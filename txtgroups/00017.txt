A NURSE is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the first British victim of the ebola outbreak.

William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London late last night after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone.

Despite the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work.

He was described as a 'remarkable young man' and a natural leader by an American scientist who worked at the same hospital in Kenema. 'He had taken on a very big role,' said Robert F Garry, a professor in microbiology at

Tulane University in New Orleans. 'We've lost several other nurses including the head nurse who lost her battle against ebola.

'He was very well liked by all the nurses and had taken on a pivotal role. Some people are just marked out as leaders and he led the nurses. He was a very hard worker and they looked up to him.'

Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Gabriel Madiye, Mr Pooley's boss at another Sierra Leone clinic, said: 'Will wanted to go to Kenema and help the patients at the hospital there. I told him not to go, but Will said he felt a very strong responsibility to the patients there as they were being abandoned by doctors and nurses who were fearful of contracting the ebola virus.

'I told him he would not be able to withstand the disease but he said he had to go.'

Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema for just five weeks.

Previously he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there since March.

But as the ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to the badly-affected region of Kenema, Mr Madiye said.

'I have been calling him for updates and he said he was fine, but for the past five days I have tried to ring him and he hasn't called back,' said Mr Madiye, who is the executive director of the Shepherd's Hospice.

'This morning, he said he was being evacuated to Britain. He sounded positive and said he would be fine in a couple of weeks and would call me then. He said the British doctors would save him.'

Mr Pooley's doctors are said to be confident that, with urgent medical attention, he has a good chance of fighting the disease.

Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus.

ZMapp, an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two US missionaries who contracted the virus. But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted.

A source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.'

Mr Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus.

Health officials last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' - a factor which will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and their major organs fail.

But fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat the virus.

The World Health Organisation has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus at 2,615 and declared the crisis to be a 'global health emergency'.

Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Last night two people were reported to have died of ebola in the Congo, in what is thought to be a new outbreak. Around 300 have become infected in Kenema, the district where Mr Pooley was working.

The World Health Organisation approved ZMapp for use two weeks ago, an extraordinary decision given that the drug had not been widely tested. It was used to treat Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly, who have since been discharged from hospital.

'EBOLA PATIENT' IN SCOTTISH HOSPITAL

A WOMAN was last night in isolation in a Scottish hospital after showing symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus.

The patient, from Sierra Leone, was having urgent medical tests, as health officials were put on high alert amid fears the disease has spread to the UK for the first time.    

The woman was a detainee at the Dungavel immigration detention centre in South Lanarkshire, a holding unit mainly for failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation. It is understood she is being treated at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire.

Limited numbers of staff will be allowed contact with the patient, who is likely to be transferred to a highly-infectious disease ward somewhere in the UK. Home Office officials have since suspended the detention or release of detainees from the centre in a bid to contain any potential outbreak.

Health officials across the UK have been alerted to the situation and a full emergency plan will be put into action if the patient tests positive, although the NHS trust treating the woman said it appeared highly unlikely that she would.

A statement from NHS Lanarkshire said: 'We are currently investigating a possible case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [Ebola].

'This is a precautionary measure and it would appear at this stage to be highly unlikely the patient will test positive for Ebola.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not comment on operational matters.' It came as doctors said the Ebola outbreak in Africa will take at least six months to bring under control. Joanne Lui, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the pace of outbreaks in Guinea had slowed but other countries, particularly Liberia, now had to be the focus of efforts to contain the disease.

She said: 'If we don't stabilise Liberia, we will never stabilise the region. In terms of timeline, we're not talking in terms of weeks, we're talking in terms of months?...?at least I would say six months, and I'm being?...?very optimistic.'

Her warning came after the World Health Organization said the toll of 1,069 deaths and a further 900 sufferers could 'vastly underestimate the magnitude' of the outbreak.

DEADLY EBOLA VIRUS COULD SPREAD TO KENYA NEXT

KENYA is at high risk of an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, the World Health Organisation has warned.

It said the East African country - popular with Britons going on safari - is vulnerable because it is a major transport hub with many flights from West Africa.

So far, the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola has been confined to four countries in the west of the continent - Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Nigeria has confirmed a third person who was in contact with an American finance consultant who flew into the country with the disease has died.

And Tom Frieden, director of the US's health protection agency, said he is 'deeply concerned' that the disease might start spreading in the country's capital Lagos.

The latest figures show that almost 2,000 people have now caught Ebola and there have been 1,069 deaths, including 56 in just two days.

Canada is donating up to 1,000 doses of an experimental vaccine to help stem the spread of the disease and Germany has ordered all its citizens, except key medics and diplomats, to leave Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The World Health Organisation has admitted the outbreak is out of control and sanctioned the use of untested drugs to combat it.

EBOLA CLAIMS ITS FIRST LIFE ON EUROPEAN SOIL

THE Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa claimed its first European life yesterday.

Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care.

With the death toll climbing above 1,000 and the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control the virus.

Mr Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary, caught Ebola - one of the deadliest diseases known to man - while treating patients in Liberia.

His condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the 'miraculous' recovery of two American aid workers.

His body will be cremated today to prevent the virus spreading.

Last night, two doses of ZMapp were on their way to Liberia to treat two doctors - the first Africans to receive the drug.

The development follows concern that the antibody medicine, which is grown in tobacco plants and has not been formally tested on humans, was being reserved for use on Westerners.

The Liberian government said it is aware that the drug's safety has not been established, but that it had no option but to try using it.

Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC: 'The alternative for not testing this is death, a certain death. This is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if they give their consent to do so.'

With no conventional treatment or vaccine available for Ebola, and this outbreak being the worst ever, interest in ZMapp is high.

But production is slow and with just 12 doses made, its US manufacturer says the supply is now exhausted.

There is anger in Guinea that neighbouring Liberia has managed to secure some of the scarce stock. Assiatou Diallo, a nurse in the Guinean capital Conakry, said: 'The Liberians can count on their government but Guineans can only count on God in the face of Ebola.'

Yesterday, an ethics panel hastily convened by the World Health Organisation said that the size of the outbreak made the use of untested, and so potentially dangerous drugs ethical, provided certain conditions are met.

The organisation previously admitted the disease, which causes internal and external bleeding, is out of control.

EBOLA? THAT DOESN'T SCARE ME, SAYS ANNE

Never one to shirk a challenge, Princess Anne will go ahead with a visit to some of Africa's poorest areas, despite the rapid spread of the Ebola virus.

The Queen's daughter is to carry out the four-day trip next month to Ethiopia and Tanzania, even though there are already two suspected cases there of the disease, which kills 90 per cent of its victims.

'There is no question of Her Royal Highness not going ahead with the visit,' a courtier tells me.

And one of the Princess Royal's friend adds: 'Anne sees her charity work as vital and will not be put off by something like this.

'She is used to running the risk of catching illnesses when visiting hospitals and sick children in Africa.'

More than 1,000 people have died in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the Ebola outbreak was first reported in February.

Yesterday, the first European, Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, 75, died after contracting the virus while working in West Africa.

Anne (right), who turns 64 on Friday, will visit Ethiopia as president of Save The Children, a role she has performed for 44 years. She will inspect projects being undertaken in the country, where there is a high risk of terrorist attacks, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

It advises against all travel to Ethiopia's Somali region, where there is a high threat of kidnapping.

The Princess will then fly to Tanzania, where she will see work by the Vine Trust, a children's charity of which she is patron.

Two suspected Ebola cases were reported in Tanzania last week, with a mother and son who had travelled from Uganda put in quarantine.

This week, a team of health workers were deployed at entry points to the city of Arusha in northern Tanzania in an effort to prevent Ebola entering the country. Neighbouring Zambia has banned all flights from countries affected by the disease.

Though this outbreak has been in West Africa, the virus has been a scourge in the east of the continent since it was first identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan in the Seventies.

AS Wills and Kate establish their new household in East Anglia, his ex-girlfriend Arabella Musgrave appears to be setting up a rival, more bohemian, court overseas.

The 31-year-old head of communications for Gucci dressed as a Tudor aristo for a medieval-themed birthday party at a 17th-century villa in Tuscany.

Arabella, who briefly courted Wills before he went to St Andrews University, is pictured (right) alongside George Galliers-Pratt, the 34-year-old member of the Cayzer banking dynasty whom she married in May.

Arabella admitted 'we look ridiculous', but a chum joked that the couple looked like 'the naughty cast of The Tudors'.

IS BARBRA Streisand reluctant to share the spotlight with her fellow divas?

When her new Partners album of duets was announced, an internet posting seemed to suggest she had been working on it with no lesser lights than Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Bette Midler.

That post, however, was deleted and when Streisand made public the track details of the album this week, there was no sign of the trio of women stars.

They have, apparently, been 'bumped' for an all-male line-up including Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Josh Groban and a beyond-the-grave Elvis. 'What an extraordinary collection of talent!' Barbra says.

Backstage dressers are, no doubt, relieved to be spared the combined demands of the divas at Barbra's forthcoming gigs.

WHEN Barclays boss Bob Diamond resigned in 2012 after the Libor rate-rigging scandal, the American's 24-year-old daughter, Nell, publicly told George Osborne and Ed Miliband to 'hold my d***'.

Happily, Diamond's successor, Antony Jenkins, has a more refined girl. Camilla Jenkins, 25, is a University of York graduate who has just become engaged to an Army captain.

She is to marry Robert Stewart (pictured with Camilla), an alumnus of the 'Scottish Eton', Fettes College, who serves with the Black Watch. His mother, Jane, says she is 'delighted'.

No doubt Camilla, who wrote for her university newspaper, took heed of her own relationship advice. In one column, she advised freshers: 'Dump your high-school boyfriend. Two years on, wisdom is infinitely better and sounder and your choice may not seem quite so rosy. Being in a relationship involves sacrifice: societies, friends and degree will suffer. Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not, but avoid regret by thinking about it now.'

National treasure June Whitfield's long career was nearly brought to a premature end while preparing to film new BBC1 sitcom Boomers.

'We did a read-through at Hat Trick Productions and June tripped over a chair,' executive producer Jimmy Mulville tells me. 'Thankfully, she got right back up and did the read-through. June does her own stunts.'

Whitfield, 88, who plays a wheelchair-bound lush in the series, has her own personal fitness trainer. She says: 'You have to respect your age, but it doesn't necessarily mean you are decrepit.'

Who knew read-throughs could be so dangerous?

NOT known for her sense of humour, fashion queen Anna 'Nuclear' Wintour will, I hope, see the funny side of a new musical about her life.

When the one-man show, performed by actor Ryan Raftery, opened in New York this week, 64-year-old Wintour (inset) was conspicuous by her absence.

The British editor-in-chief of American Vogue, who was the inspiration for The Devil Wears Prada film, did, however, send along her daughter, TV producer Bee Shaffer, to the show.

She watched politely as Raftery donned a bobbed wig and oversized sunglasses to play her mother as he recounted her (fictional) problem with chronic constipation, brought on by the stress of putting Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue.

'Wintour' then sang parodies of tunes, including the Disney hit Let It Go.

Bee, 27, can't have been too offended, as she went backstage afterwards to pose for a picture with Raftery (right), whom she jokingly referred to as her 'surrogate mother'.

West End transfer, please.

Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonne-ville, who unveiled his likeness at Madame Tussauds waxworks yesterday, was asked to name his historical hero and opted for Samuel Pepys.

So what attracts the 50-year-old actor (above), who plays the moralistic Earl of Grantham in ITV's costume drama, to the celebrated diarist?

While outwardly an upright MP and happily married naval administrator, Pepys enjoyed a double life as a philandering roisterer and was once caught in flagrante with a woman in his pay by his wife, Elisabeth.

'I'm drawn to Pepys because he was a sort of one-man webcam, living through an incredible period in history and witnessing everything from the Great Fire of London to the Plague and the Restoration,' Bonneville says in the forthcoming edition of the BBC History Magazine.

'If I could meet Pepys, I'd love to have asked him how he found the time to do so much: that is, go to work but still have a pint in Deptford, see some wench and then meet an ambassador — all in one day!'

Bonneville, of course, enjoys a much quieter life in West Sussex with Lulu, his wife of 16 years.

ECONOMIC sanctions imposed on Russia because of its support for rebels in Ukraine are clearly starting to bite. One unnamed oligarch has put his yacht up for rental with a Chelsea agent at a reputed £7 million a week.

The mega-vessel includes one room in which fake snow falls from the ceiling as the temperature is lowered. Real birch branches are laid on the floor.

'This gentleman obviously feels nostalgic for home,' says my man in the deck shoes. 'He likes to go into the snow room to be reminded of Mother Russia.'

Tom DeBuse, of Y.CO, the firm chartering the vessel, tells me: 'We are under strict intructions from the owner not to reveal his identity or the name of the yacht.'

If he can spare a few million, it would be perfect for former Labour minister Peter Mandelson, who enjoyed being thrashed with birch leaves by a 25-year-old banya keeper on his 2005 trip to Siberia with his chum Nat Rothschild.

The pair then plunged into an ice bath to improve circulation and cleanse the skin.

EBOLA NOW A THREAT TO WHOLE WORLD

THE EBOLA outbreak in West Africa has been declared an international health emergency by World Health Organisation officials.

They said a co-ordinated international response was urgently needed to stop and reverse the spread of the virus, which is the worst outbreak of Ebola the world has ever seen.

Since the outbreak began in March it has claimed over 930 lives and affected more than 1,700 people Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia.

But experts said it was unlikely to turn into a global health pandemic and the threat to the UK remains very low.

The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and causes diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, a temperature, followed by kidney failure, internal bleeding and bleeding from the nose and ears.

There are no cures or vaccines and this particular strain has a 55 per cent mortality rate.

In the past, outbreaks have been confined to rural areas, but this one is sweeping through cities in previously unaffected countries such as Nigeria.

Experts think that traditional burial methods, whereby mourners touch and kiss the bodies of the deceased, may be behind its rapid spread. Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation, an agency of the UN, said the announcement was a 'clear call for international solidarity'.

She said: 'Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own.

'I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.' No travel or trade bans have been enforced, but WHO advised anyone who has come into contact with Ebola patients not to go overseas.

They also recommended that officials at airports in affected countries take the temperatures of all passengers leaving and make them fill in questionnaires to check for potential victims.

In the past two days alone there have been 68 new cases and 29 deaths, WHO says.

It is only the third time in recent years the organisation has declared an international health emergency, after swine flu in 2009 and the polio outbreak of Asia, Africa and the Middle East in May. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity, said: 'Ebola continues to pose a very serious health threat for people in West Africa, but it remains very unlikely that the outbreak will turn into a global pandemic.

'However, even though the epidemic is currently "regional", Ebola is still of global concern and there remains a possibility that imported cases will reach countries outside of West Africa and also that the health care system, economies and stability of the countries involved will be affected.'

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said the announcement will make 'the vast resources of the UN such as funds, experts and equipment, available to help stop Ebola. This should bring the outbreak under control, although it's likely it won't be stopped completely until after Christmas.'

The announcement comes as a Spanish priest infected with the virus - the first European to be struck down by the disease - who was airlifted back to his home country was last night described as 'stable' in a Madrid hospital.

Meanwhile, British Airways announced this week it had cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone to protect staff and passengers.

GEM EXPLORER LIFTS THE GLOOM; MARKET REPORT

AS the gloom deepened around global stock markets due to worries over conflicts in Iraq, Ukraine and Gaza, there were still a few bright spots.

Botswana Diamonds shone through after the explorer confirmed it will kick off a drilling programme in the African country in the third week of September.

The company said work on the PL117 block in Orapa, Botswana will begin on targets identified through recent work by Sunland Minerals, its joint venture with Russian firm Alrosa-Nyurba - the largest diamond producer in the world.

Verification drilling depth will be 100 metres, and after the core is studied in Botswana, the specimens and samples from the site will be dispatched to St Petersburg, Russia for analysis, the firm said.

The group also said an extensive work programme is being finalised for new licences in the area, and an enlarged team from Alrosa is due to join the existing Botswana Diamonds team at the site.

Botswana, one of Africa's most stable countries, is the world's largest producer of diamonds.

The country started selling its own diamonds in December 2013 after the De Beers cartel agreed to a 10-year marketing agreement.

That deal ended a more than one hundred year tradition of sending diamonds mined in Africa to London where they were valued, sorted and sold at pre-determined prices. Around £4bn of diamond trades are estimated to take place in Botswana.

Botswana Diamonds gained nearly 16pc, or 0.38p to 2.75p, on the prospect of getting a share of those riches.

But the overall market mood was far from sparkling as US President Barack Obama's plans for air strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq notched up the geopolitical uncertainty for stocks already impacted by conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

The Footsie closed off its worst levels as a recent sell-off in US stocks steadied in early trade on Wall Street, but the FTSE 100 index still ended 30.01 points lower at 6567.36. The UK index dropped over 3pc in the past seven sessions.

Royal Mail was one of the minority of blue chip gainers after it announced plans for further efficiency savings by asking delivery staff to collect mail from up to 50,000 post boxes.

Royal Mail shares, which have fallen to their lowest levels since the firm's controversial privatisation last October, gained nearly 3pc or 12.5p to 426.5p. Bermuda-based insurer Catlin Group was the top mid cap performer, up nearly 4.5pc or 20.7p to 507p after it reported a 118pc jump in first half pre-tax profits, but the FTSE 250 index was weaker early on with the market malaise, but recovered to close up 3.28 points at 15,243.38.

Henderson Group was under pressure, shedding 5.4p to 222.6p as broker Credit Suisse downgraded its rating for the fund manager's stock to neutral from outperform following recent first half results.

Aside from the geopolitical conflicts, worry over the spread of the Ebola virus was also spooking investors as the World Health Organisation declared that the outbreak in West Africa is an international health emergency.

However, Westminster Group got a boost, adding 7.25p at 48.25p after it said it has deployed advanced fever detection screening equipment, which identifies people who may be suffering from ebola and other viruses to its airport security operations in West Africa.

Also on the upside with small caps, outdoor audio visual advertising specialist MediaZest jumped nearly 9pc, or 0.01p to 0.16p as it said it has won a batch of new contracts and said it expects to announce further new business wins before the close of the half year. The group said the new service contract revenues it has won will contribute in total more than £85,000 to the current half year, which ends on September 30.

Contract news was also a boost for SeaEnergy, shares in which jumped 7.5pc or 2.25p to 32.25p after its GOSeaEnergy Ship Management joint venture won two further ship management contracts deals.

And shares in Rose Petroleum added 0.2p to 3.35p after it promoted John Blair to be chief executive of its US oil and gas assets.

But on the downside, small cap hygiene group Puricore shares dropped 7.5pc, or 2.75p to 33.5p, as it reported an increased first half operating loss as revenues slid 31pc as the company continued to revamp its offering to supermarket retailers.

Puricore shares dropped last month after it warned that it was set to post a loss due to lower sales of its new its supermarket retail concentrate products.

THE CO-OP'S LABOURED REFORMS; COMMENT
BY ALEX BRUMMER

Daily Mail
DAIM

English
(c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved
THE sound of stable doors slamming at the Co-operative Group will be heard for years to come.

A combination of the antics of the Rev Paul Flowers, the over-ambition of former chief executive Peter Marks and the value destructive merger of the bank with the Britannia Building Society in 2009 has torn the heart out of the organisation.

It, and its offshoots, most notably the Co-operative Bank, will be the subject of regulatory scrutiny and probes for a long time.

One of the central recommendations of reform proposals just released is that future boards members be 'qualified' to lead what is still a multi-billion pound organisation.

The idea that they weren't before ought to be considered risible.

The reality, however, was of a board elected by regional Co-operative warlords more interested in preserving handsome stipends for themselves and their cohorts than the 8m loyal members who expected the highest standards of behaviour.

A consequence was that the senior executive staff were disregarded as employees and the structure festooned with unqualified 'political' choices including a plasterer and a former teacher. And there was Flowers, the Labour supporting Methodist minister with a chequered past that included sex offences and an alleged record of expenses fiddling.

The changes proposed, based largely on the ideas former City Minister Lord Myners, are sweeping in their breadth.

There is to be a new board composed of an independent chair with a majority of non-executives and including the chief executive.

Directors will be required to 'meet the high standards of competence' commensurate with such a large business.

A Council is to be elected to hold the board true to its principles but how the politics of this will work is a little bit more mystical.

What is certain is that the newly burnished Co-op will be a fraction of its old self. Businesses, including two-thirds of the 'ethical' bank have been jettisoned in panic as the Co-op has struggled to find the funds to make up its part of the £1.5bn black hole in the bank's capital and the broader £2.5bn loss across the group.

The general insurance CIS was sold to Royal London for £219m ten months ago.

Most recently the 774-chain of pharmacies were sold to Bestway Group for £620m and the farms to Wellcome Trust for £249m. The bank is now controlled by rapacious hedge funds, who will presumably dispose of their stakes when it has been sufficiently repaired.

Disaster at the Co-op took place under the noses of Labour Party politicians, including the shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who until political donations were suspended received £50,000 a year towards running his constituency office. Nice help if you can get it especially if the money comes from membership funds that could have been distributed to some of the least well off people in the country as the dividend.

Even with competent management one fears for the future of what is left. Britain's grocery sector is highly competitive with German discounters like Lidl and Aldi challenging Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's to distraction.

The Co-op is stuck with many outlets that are too large and in the wrong places as a result of the disastrous debt-fuelled Somerfield merger.

It doesn't stand much of a chance.

HAVE investors lost the appetite for giant mergers?

Admittedly this week saw Walgreens cement its relationship with Alliance Boots, but that was simply the latest stage in a long telegraphed transaction.

More fascinating are the number of giant deals that are hitting the Tarmac.

When it comes to deal making Rupert Murdoch and his media empires are never to be underestimated as the Wall Street Journal et al have discovered. But this week Murdoch retreated from a $70bn offer for Time Warner his tail between his legs.

Elsewhere Sprint (owned by Japan's Softbank) abandoned its purchase of T-Mobile America, a deal worth $30bn. Other transactions to come unstuck include Pfizer's $120bn assault on UK health sciences champion AstraZeneca. Earlier this year the proposed get together of two advertising giants Publicis and Omnicom fell apart.

Questions are currently being asked as to whether the AbbVie takeover of Irish-based Shire Pharmaceuticals will still take place.

None of this is much fun for advisers and leaves predators wiping egg off their face. But it is good to see boards and investors showing some backbone at last.

FASCINATING to note that the Ebola miracle drug ZMapp has emerged from a small 2003 San Diego-based biotech start-up Mapp, funded by government grants.

Remarkably, production is dependent on pariah cigarette firm Reynolds that cultivates the compound in the leaves of tobacco plants.

Eat your heart out, big pharma.

ENCASED IN A SEALED PLASTIC CHAMBER, THE FIRST EUROPEAN EBOLA VICTIM RETURNS HOME

THE first European victim of the Ebola outbreak has been airlifted out of West Africa, where the sick, dying and dead are being abandoned on the streets.

Miguel Pajares, 75, is a Spanish missionary who caught the disease while treating patients in Liberia. He has now been flown to Madrid in a military plane and taken to hospital in a portable isolation chamber.

The priest was described as stable but disorientated. He was given a police escort to hospital and was accompanied by his colleague Juliana Bohi - a nun who has now tested negative for the disease.

The scenes in Spain were a marked contrast to the images from Liberia and Guinea, where victims have been left to rot in the street. Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the outbreak, which has claimed 932 lives, is forcing the government to take 'extraordinary measures'.

The World Health Organisation will meet today to consider whether or not to declare the outbreak a global health emergency.

A YOUNG man lies dead in the streets of Liberia, left to rot in view of passers-by and local children.

He is just one of many Ebola victims to have been dragged out of their homes and dumped on the country's roads by terrified relatives in a desperate bid to avoid being quarantined.

The outbreak of the deadly virus began in March, and has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 people across West Africa.

Last week the Liberian government announced tough measures to contain the disease, including shutting schools, imposing quarantines on victims' homes and tracking their friends and relatives.

But yesterday information minister Lewis Brown said locals had started dragging bodies onto the streets, as many fear that being isolated in a home where an Ebola victim has died will put them at risk of catching the disease.

'They are removing the bodies from their homes and are putting them out in the street,' Mr Brown said, adding: 'We're asking people to please leave the bodies in their homes and we'll pick them up.'

Mr Brown also confirmed that on Monday night, troops were deployed in the border region of Lofa to isolate affected communities.

He added: 'We hope it will not require excessive force, but we have to do whatever we can to restrict the movement of people out of affected areas.' On Monday the Liberian government announced that corpses will now have to be cremated, as attempts to check the spread of Ebola have been hampered by the tradition of touching bodies at burials.

The African Development Bank and World Bank is to give $260million to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea amid fears that the disease will overrun healthcare systems in one of the world's poorest regions. But Samura Kamara, Sierra Leone's foreign minister, said the virus had cost the government $10million and was hampering efforts to stimulate growth. British Airways is suspending flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of the month.

Germany has also joined France and the US in advising against travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Meanwhile two infected American aid workers have seen their conditions improve thanks to an experimental drug developed by a US biotech firm.

And a man in Saudi Arabia is undergoing tests for a suspected Ebola infection after returning from a trip to Sierra Leone.

... AND BRITON IN 'QUARANTINE' AFTER TRIP TO WEST AFRICA

BRITISH Airways has cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone as the Ebola outbreak sweeps through West Africa.

It said it had been forced to protect staff and passengers amid a 'deteriorating public health situation'.

The news comes as it emerged that a Briton has quarantined themselves at home over fears they may have been exposed to the deadly virus in West Africa.

The unnamed Cardiff resident is being monitored by doctors and is voluntarily staying away from work and keeping contact with others to a minimum.

The disease has claimed almost 900 lives since February in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in the world's worst outbreak. The World Health Organisation warns it is out of control.

BA airline flies four times a week from London to Freetown in Sierra Leone and on to Monrovia in Liberia. Its decision to cancel flights came amid growing fears over whether the epidemic could spread to Britain.

The only other airline to stop any flights is Emirates, which has suspended its service to Conakry in Guinea.

Experts questioned BA's move yesterday, and said that with up to 750 BA passengers due to fly back to Heathrow on the route each week, it is feared that hundreds could be stranded.

BA said it was trying to get customers on alternative flights out of the cities.

It added: 'We have suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 due to the deteriorating public health situation. The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review.'

But microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said: 'It doesn't sound like very good planning to me if they are leaving people stranded who want to leave. They should have brought them out.'

He described the move as '75 per cent over-reaction', adding: 'I can see why they did it from a PR point of view but from a virological point of view, it is probably not necessary.

'The big fact about Ebola is that it's not that easy to catch.

'I am not surprised, but slightly disappointed they have taken that step.' However, another expert said the decision would cut the odds of the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, from being brought into Britain.

Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said sharing a plane with an Ebola sufferer was 'extremely dangerous'.

He added: 'It is more than possible that other people on the plane will become infected.' Public Health Wales, which runs health services in the region, said the suspected patient in Cardiff did not have symptoms and there were no cases in Wales, adding: 'We are alert to the possibility of cases in the UK and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have travelled from West Africa.'

A spokesman said people cannot be tested for the virus before the onset of symptoms, which take up to 21 days to appear.

He added that the individual has been under surveillance for a week and 'seems well'.

Meanwhile, infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol was flown back to Atlanta for treatment yesterday after contracting the disease in Liberia.

She follows her colleague Dr Kent Brantly, who returned for treatment on Saturday. Both are said to be making progress.

Ebola victims suffer severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no cure.

THE 'HOLIDAY BUGS' THAT COULD BE MORE SINISTER THAN YOU THINK; AS EBOLA HIGHLIGHTS THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF EXOTIC TRIPS, A VERY CAUTIONARY TALE

Waiting at Frankfurt airport, my head started to spin. Then, as I got on the plane, I collapsed. I remember begging the purser to let me fly home, but to no avail. 'You're too sick for us to look after,' he said, and called an ambulance.

I'd been in Ethiopia for a week, working as a reporter, and I'd been bitten by mosquitoes and also developed diarrhoea. I was running a temperature, had a rash, a splitting headache and ached all over.

But I'd been covering foreign stories for nearly 20 years, so exhaustion, mosquitoes and travellers' tummy were familiar territory. Yet nagging away at my brain was the idea that this time something wasn't right.

But with interviews to be done, I pushed the worry away and got on with work. It was just normal travel bugs, I told myself.

Even collapsing at the airport didn't change this view. The German doctor at the airport clinic asked some questions, including about where I'd been, and diagnosed diarrhoea and dehydration.

He put me on a drip to rehydrate me and I lay there for five hours, drifting in and out of consciousness. I was then passed as OK to travel and flew home. It was the start of nearly two months of misdiagnosis.

The experience has left me wondering how likely is it that British airport staff or medics will be able to spot or diagnose Ebola — and just what the implications are of that.

It was September 2011 when I collapsed en route from Ethiopia. Once we arrived in Britain, my colleague, photographer Clare Kendall, voiced her concerns: 'Your eyes are full of blood and your head's swollen.'

But we had a trip to Nicaragua a month later to prepare for, so after a few days' rest I was working again.

Only I couldn't work properly. After one meeting, I wrote in my diary that I was 'overtaken by bone-aching weariness and had to go to bed for two hours'. And so it went on until, just a few days before we were due to fly to Nicaragua, I collapsed in the back garden.

I rang my GP practice and was given an emergency appointment at my local hospital, where the doctor said I had a urinary tract infection. Hugely relieved, I took the tablets he prescribed and went home confident that I'd be well enough to fly.

But I wasn't. 'When I stand up or walk, I feel lightheaded and everything spins round,' I wrote in my diary. I rang NHS Direct, who said it might be vertigo. They told me to ring my GP.

My memory of that month or so is hazy, but I missed the Nicaragua trip because, essentially, I couldn't stand up. Or do anything much.

Towards the end of October 2011, I collapsed again and the GP referred me for extensive tests at the hospital. These took six hours.

On OCTOBER 29, I received a letter saying that the tests showed I had antibodies for not one but three conditions: West Nile virus (which is carried by mosquitoes), dengue fever (another mosquito-borne illness, with similar symptoms) and tick-borne encephalitis (spread by ticks, and which can spread to the brain).

No wonder I didn't feel well. All three conditions are potentially fatal, and after reading the letter, I sat in the kitchen and shook.

Then I rang a friend who had studied medicine. His view was that I currently had West Nile virus and dengue fever. (The encephalitis antibodies were the result of a trip to Jordan two years before, when flu-like symptoms had developed into meningitis.)

I had the full list of classic symptoms of both West Nile virus and dengue fever: a fever, pain behind the eyes, aching bones, muscle pain, feeling sick, a skin rash, sore throat, diarrhoea and blood in my stools.

Presumably, my condition had been hard to diagnose because cases of West Nile virus and dengue fever are fairly rare both at Frankfurt airport and in leafy Hampshire, where I live.

But the misdiagnosis had meant I didn't seek medical help more quickly. There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus and dengue, apart from rest, fluids and paracetamol, and by then I was over the worst. But early diagnosis is important to be alert for any complications. Dengue fever, for instance, can lead to a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure, or catastrophic bleeding (dengue haemorraghic shock).

It had been a salutary lesson — and one that last year I was grateful to have learned.

I'd returned from a trip to Shanghai where, again, a mosquito had bitten me. A week after my return I was still feeling rough, so this time I immediately rang my GP.

'I'm not well. I've been in Shanghai. A mosquito bit me. I've had dengue fever. What do you think?' I asked.

Malaria, she said, probably. She sent me straight to hospital where a truly wonderful consultant kept me in for 24 hours and did lots of blood tests. They were all sent to scientists at the medical labs at Porton Down, the Government's military science facility (this is where all UK tests for tropical diseases are sent). This both worried and reassured me.

The consultant was concerned that I was going to start bleeding. So was I. Having heard of people who've bled to death in a matter of days, I didn't want to be one of them.

Dengue haemorrhaghic fever is a risk if you have antibodies in your blood system from a previous infection; other risk factors are being aged under 12, female and Caucasian. I fit three out of four of those — which is why I'm now avoiding dengue regions.

I spent a night in an emergency medical ward. After 24 hours, and with the reassurance that some of the test results had already come back clear, I was discharged.

Two weeks later, confirmation came through that I hadn't got dengue fever but I did have some unknown Chinese virus. Again, there was no specific treatment, but this time I was back to full health after three weeks.

But all this leads me to conclude that it's very difficult for both patient and doctor to know what's wrong with you when you return from foreign travel with a list of symptoms — and, as a patient, it's hard to know when to seek help, and how much to push for it, when you don't know what's wrong.

David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agrees, and says this is why it's important to seek expert advice early on.

'If you are feeling sick and have come back from somewhere tropical, the first thing is to get help,' he says — and make a point of mentioning you've been on holiday, and where.

If you have a fever, ask your GP to check it's not malaria. 'There are plenty of other viral infections that are self-limiting and aren't going to kill you, but you can die of malaria very quickly,' says Professor Mabey. 'However, it's easily treatable.' International travel means more of us are returning home with tropical diseases such as dengue. Some 2,000 cases of malaria are reported in the UK every year: in 2013, seven people died.

And according to Public Health England (PHE), dengue fever is on the rise. In 2011 (the year I caught it) there were 223 cases; in 2012, there were 343, a 54 per cent rise.

'There's a lot more malaria and we still see leprosy, which is mis-diagnosed because people don't think of it,' says Professor Mabey. 'And we see the odd case of sleeping sickness [caused by a parasite]. But none of these are common.'

For GPs all of this presents an enormous challenge because they are simply not experienced in these rare, though sometimes deadly, health problems.

Even Professor Simon de Lusignan, a GP and director of the Royal College of GPs Research and Surveillance Centre, which keeps an eye on outbreaks of everything from flu to Ebola, says he's seen only three or four cases of tropical illness in his 27-year career.

'It is difficult to diagnose tropical diseases,' he says. 'Flu-like symptoms could be so many things.'

What does this mean for a virus such as Ebola, with an incubation period of up to 21 days?

The current outbreak has been centred on Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but the concern is that, with international travel, the virus could spread.

Several West African airlines have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Hong Kong, officials have confirmed they will quarantine any visitors from the affected countries who have a fever.

Last week, PHE said the Government was 'taking precautionary measures'. It told Good Health these involved 'telling agency staff and health professionals what the symptoms are'.

But airport staff — who are on the front line — have said that they are not ready to deal with an outbreak of Ebola in the UK.

Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, said last week: 'Our members are very concerned. What do they do if they are confronted with someone who doesn't appear well?' She added that she would 'absolutely not' be able to 'spot the symptoms' of Ebola.

PHE points out that most general travellers are unlikely to have come into contact with the virus. Their director for health protection, Dr Paul Cosford, told Good Health this week: 'The risk to this country is very low.

'We are concerned about the threat in West Africa, but we don't think that it will cause an outbreak in the UK.'

The Ebola virus is transmitted through eating infected bush meat (such as monkeys) and exposure to the body fluids of those who are sick — NOT from sneezing or coughing.

The advice from Public Health England is that if you've been to one of the affected countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea) and experience a fever, headache and general malaise within 21 days of your return to the UK, seek immediate medical help. Other early symptoms include sore throat, joint and muscle pain. These escalate to a rash, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and impaired kidney and liver function, which may be followed by internal and external bleeding.

NOW EBOLA HITS DOCTOR WHO TREATED VICTIM

A NIGERIAN doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola, three other people are showing symptoms and 70 are under surveillance, the country's health minister has said.

News of a second case in Lagos, Africa's biggest and most densely populated city and an international transport hub, will fan fears the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, will spread to the West.

The virus has claimed nearly 900 lives in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

The new case is a doctor who helped treat Patrick Sawyer, an American finance consultant who died in a Lagos hospital after flying into the city from his sister's funeral in Liberia. She had also died of the disease, which can be spread through sweat and saliva and has no vaccine or cure.

Nigerian health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said three other medical staff are showing symptoms. Some 70 people who came into contact with Mr Sawyer are under surveillance.

Dr Anthony Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health, has said a vaccine against Ebola could be ready by next summer.

And Professor Chris Whitty, the Department for International Development's chief scientist, has urged calm.

He said: 'What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it start to decrease.'

Meanwhile fears Ebola had reached Britain at the weekend proved groundless, after a passenger who died after flying into Gatwick from Sierra Leone tested negative.

WORLD HEALTH CHIEF: EBOLA IS NOW RUNNING OUT OF CONTROL
BY DAVID WILLIAMS

THE spread of the deadly Ebola virus is out of control and the effects could be 'catastrophic', the World Health Organisation said last night.

The outbreak of the disease, the worst since it was discovered in the mid-1970s, has so far caused 729 deaths in four different countries.

At the moment its spread is contained to West Africa, but there are growing fears that it could hit the UK.

Last night WHO director-general Margaret Chan said: 'This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.'

Speaking at a meeting in Guinea's capital Conakry, she told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast that the virus could be stopped.

But she said that cultural practices such as traditional burials were a significant cause of its spread.

British authorities are currently on high alert, and have put measures in place to ensure that all passengers displaying symptoms are prevented from boarding flights to the UK.

Anyone who appears ill on arrival into Britain will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units. However, because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.

Yesterday Mrs Chan revealed that the outbreak has now caused 1,323 recorded cases of the disease overall.

She warned that governments may need to restrict population movements and public gatherings, and use the police and civil defence forces to guarantee the security of response teams.

But the WHO chief went on to point out that more than 60 medical workers have died, a loss which has hampered efforts to tackle the disease.

Two Americans working for aid group Samaritan's Purse who contracted the disease in Liberia are in a serious condition and are being medically evacuated, the organisation said.

And the outbreak has prompted some international organisations to withdraw.

The US Peace Corps has said it was withdrawing 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Samaritan's Purse said on Friday it would complete the evacuation of its 60 international staff from Liberia over the weekend and WaterAid said on Friday it was suspending its operations there as well.

Sierra Leone yesterday declared a public health emergency with the government ordering house-to-house searches by troops to seek out infected patients.

So far Liberia has closed all schools and some government departments as well as looking at the possibility of quarantining affected communities.

But the leader of Guinea's Ebola taskforce said his country would not be following these moves. 'Some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder,' Aboubacar Sidiki Diakia said, citing in particular the closure of schools. He added: 'When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse.'

The WHO will convene an emergency committee on August 6 to decide if the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to recommend measures to tackle it.

Mrs Chan has promised to take personal responsibility for coordinating international response efforts and mobilising the support needed to fight the virus.

THE SECRET TRADE IN MONKEY MEAT THAT COULD UNLEASH EBOLA IN BRITAIN
BY ANDREW MALONE

With the sun beating down on the strange and exotic-looking meats on sale — some dripping blood, some heavily smoked and impossible to identify — the sights and sounds at this London market are straight out of Africa.

Skinned goat carcasses dangle overhead, blackened cow heads and lamb brains are lined up in trays, while baskets tucked in darker corners brim with yellowing strips of cured flesh.

Nearby, women hawk spices, cassava and yams, as men in shacks offer cheap airline tickets to Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon, as well as cash transfers back to family members still living on the continent. At Lagos restaurant, just past 'Monni Matters' foreign exchange and the 'God Is Good Hair Salon', there is nothing fancy about the cheap seats and chipped tables — but what's on the menu is a taste of home.

At £5 a plate, dishes include Nkwobi, a traditional meal of spiced cow feet and 'assorted meat and fish' with pounded yam, through to giant African snails, served as part of a 'designer stew' with, again, unnamed 'assorted meats'.

The scene — at Ridley Road in Dalston, East London, an area with a large African community — is replicated at similar markets in many British towns and cities, and is part of the daily ebb and flow of people and goods between the African continent and Europe.

Indeed, with flights from West Africa taking fewer than eight hours, traders boast that much of their produce is 'fresh' from the country of origin.

Yet for all the sunshine, bustle and sound of African voices, the butchers here were oddly tense this week, not to mention strangely reluctant to discuss certain choice cuts of meat.

The reason? Ridley Road has been identified as a hub for the secret market in 'bush meat' — the flesh of exotic animals such as chimpanzee, monkey, porcupine, fruit bats and even giraffe, slaughtered in the African bush and smuggled into Britain.

It is estimated that a staggering 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters Britain each year, the bulk of which is bush meat.

The trade has hitherto been defended on cultural grounds, as little different to Britons eating rabbit or venison. But it is now at the centre of a terrifying health crisis.

For we are in the midst of the worst outbreak in history of the deadly Ebola virus — and bush meat is one of the primary sources of the disease's transmission.

Spread through the blood and body fluids of infected people and animals, Ebola's latest outbreak began in February in Guinea and has so far claimed more than 700 lives.

With no cure, there are growing fears that the movement of people and goods between Africa and Europe will make it all too easy for Ebola to wreak death and havoc around the world.

And the underground trade in bush meat may be the channel by which the UK is most vulnerable to an Ebola outbreak.

Having lived in Africa and travelled the continent for 20 years, I have been offered everything from elephant meat to monkey and lion steaks, and the markets selling this bush meat are still flourishing.

But the appetite for such delicacies has also spread dramatically from Africa, to Europe and the U.S.

The reason this gives such cause for concern is that ever since the Ebola virus was discovered, deep in the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976, scientists have warned it can pass from animals to humans who prepare or eat infected meat.

A 1996 outbreak in Gabon was caused when local people ate the fresh body of a dead chimpanzee they found in the bush.

Disturbingly, one of the hosts of the disease in the latest outbreak is the forest fruit bat, sold as bush meat all over West Africa and made into a popular spicy stew called kedjenou.

The bats are also hunted and eaten by some large animals such as baboons, which, again, are sold as part of the vast global trade in bush meat.

Five previous outbreaks have been linked to the handling of meat from gorillas, chimps and duikers (a small antelope) for the bush meat business — and all these animals have been found for sale in the UK.

Heathrow baggage handlers frequently complain about foul-smelling packages, some seeping blood, as couriers arrive with their goods from Africa.

But their tip-offs present no significant hindrance to the trade, as the UK's over-stretched customs officers focus their resources on drugs and terrorist activities.

Meat is also brought into the country through the Channel Tunnel after being flown to Paris, a major hub for flights from Africa.

Which brings us to back to the bustle of Ridley Road. Here, the risk posed to public health from bush meat comes as no surprise to Dr Yunes Teinaz, a former environment health official for the area.

For years, he has been warning that the bush meat trade is a time-bomb owing to the sheer size of the business and the fact that the meat is sold without any of the safety tests demanded by law.

He has, as a result, been targeted for revenge attacks by the gangs controlling the trade.

'I'm horrified and disappointed by what has been allowed to go on,' he told me. 'I warned about this many years ago, but local authorities are still not taking any action.

'This meat is sold everywhere. It's smuggled in vast quantities. It's supplied all around Britain. It poses a potentially huge risk to public health, yet we are doing nothing to tackle it.'

It was two years ago that a BBC programme revealed that giant rats smuggled from Africa were among the items on sale at Ridley Road market.

A year earlier, trading standards officials testing meat samples, believed to be seized from vendors in the Midlands, realised they were handling chimpanzee flesh.

Dr Teinaz believes there should be a full government inquiry into the scale of the scandal, scoffing at claims by health inspectors that they check African markets regularly to ensure there is no bush meat being sold.

'You can't just walk up as a white person and ask to buy bush meat,' he said.

'You need to be an African and speak the language, and then it's easy. You can get monkey heads, animal blood used in rituals — all smuggled in without any health checks. You can place orders at these African markets and they will deliver to your home.

'This is very big business and people are smart — they will think you are an inspector or the police if you just start asking around.'

Perhaps this explains the reaction when, during a shopping expedition to Ridley Road this week, I asked for 'special meat' at a number of stalls. The so-called 'code' did not work: one Ghanaian shopkeeper became angry and agitated, turning his back and telling me to go away because 'we only sell cassava here', referring to the starchy vegetable that's a staple of tropical diets.

Yet, for all the reticence and secrecy, everyone knows what goes on.

A woman running a stall selling wigs, who came to London from Nigeria 20 years ago, confirmed that many of her fellow Africans buy bush meat from the market.

'I often get a craving for it,' she admitted. 'You used to get it everywhere here, but it's gone underground now.

'I don't have a problem with people eating it — you eat deer and rabbits and other creatures.' This trader told me, however, that she would no longer buy bush meat because of the Ebola terror.

'That's always been my only objection — on health grounds,' she said. 'I wouldn't risk it.'

But not all share her caution. One shopkeeper, outside a stall named two years ago as a supplier of bush meat, insisted that there was nothing wrong with it — though he swore he did not sell such products.

'Everybody knows where you can get it,' he told me. 'Bush meat is like drugs — you can get it everywhere if you know the right people, but you won't see it openly on sale. It's word of mouth and under-the-counter deals.'

Certainly, that is the modus operandi of one man involved in the trade. This Nigerian butcher agreed to meet me in a cafe away from the market, and made a spirited, if dangerously ignorant, defence of his business.

'A lot of people believe bush meat is magical,' he told me. 'But meat is meat. People in Britain are only against it because nobody pays any taxes.'

Insisting he did not eat bush meat himself, he told me that hunting and eating wild animals was part of his culture.

'We grew up doing it — it was normal,' he said. 'That's why people think it's normal here to eat their food from home, just like Brits want baked beans or ketchup when they live abroad.'

As for attempts to end the trade at its source, they seem doomed for a number of reasons, even despite the threat posed by Ebola.

With countries such as Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone trying to introduce local bans on bush meat to halt the spread of the virus, people are simply refusing to stop the practice.

Bush meat is, in fact, booming in popularity among Africans, encouraged by proclamations by some of their leaders to reject western ways. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there have even been calls from nationalists for foreign cuisine to be replaced with 'typically African' dishes such as chimpanzee, served as 'les cousins' to human diners.

With bush meat costing more than chicken or beef in some African cities, it has also become a status symbol for richer Africans, many of whom believe the attributes of the animals they eat will pass to them.

The number of animals being killed is staggering, with conservation groups warning that millions of tonnes of meat are being taken from Africa's forests.

'You will not stop it [the trade] — I just think it's futile,' said Bob Swanepoel, a virologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.

But all it needs is a small piece of infected meat, perhaps brought in the suitcase of a guest visiting from the continent, to pass Ebola into the community here — and the nightmare could start.

WALSH PICKS A FIGHT WITH BAE
BY ROB DAVIES

BRITISH Airways supremo Willie Walsh risked starting a dogfight with BAE Systems chief executive Ian King, as he criticised comments attributed to the defence boss about airline safety.

Speaking as IAG, the parent company of BA, swung back to profit, Walsh addressed the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.

He called for an international convention to examine the danger of surface-to-air missiles, as well as greater sharing of information between airlines about emerging threats to airspace.

But the famously outspoken Irishman lashed out at King over his suggestion that commercial airlines might be in need of military technology to protect themselves against the threat of missiles.

'We've thought about it and rejected it,' said Walsh, branding the notion that airliners could use countermeasures 'absolutely ridiculous'.

'If Ian King has a concern, withdraw from the arms industry and stop selling military equipment.'

'I don't think it [military technology] is the answer, I'm not in favour of it and I don't think any other airline chief executives are.'

Defence industry sources said King had never suggested the use of countermeasures and had been referring primarily to cybersecurity.

'[Firms] need to think about whether they need military-grade services,' King was reported to have said. 'Aspects of what has happened [leads airlines to consider] how do you protect aeroplanes, both to track them and protect them.'

British Airways stopped flying over eastern Ukraine in March, Walsh said, but added that the airline continues to fly over Iraq.

He refused to criticised Malaysian Airlines for its choice of route.

Walsh delivered his comments alongside half year financial results that vindicated his decision to cut costs, including massive job cuts, at BA's sister airline Iberia.

IAG (up 7.4p to 338.2p) reversed last year's half year loss of £141m to deliver pre-tax profits of £123m as passenger numbers soared 22pc to 35.4m. Operating profit, which strips out items such as the cost of debt, was £183m, compared to a loss of £26m last time. BA delivered £260m of the total, making up for a loss of £76m at Iberia, which was a vast improvement on a £439m loss at the half-year in 2013.

Walsh sparked ire from unions in Spain when he slashed some 3000 jobs in a bid to drag Iberia back to profitability. IAG said Iberia had reached a new agreement with unions that would see 1,427 further job cuts among pilots and ground staff. IAG was created via the merger of Iberia with BA, creating a group that has since swallowed up Spanish low cost airline Vueling. The company initially set a target of saving £400m a year and Walsh said he expects the synergies to hit £650m by next year.

'We're well ahead of our targets and clearly it was a good plan,' he said, adding IAG would always consider the prospect of adding new airlines to the group through acquisitions but said he was 'not pursuing anything at this stage'.

Airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM have suffered profit warnings, as the industry wrestles with fierce competition. Walsh said IAG was not interested in buying 'distressed' airlines and sprucing them up.

'You don't strengthen your group by taking on something weak and restructuring it,' he said.

IAG has not been affected by the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, Walsh added. The former pilot also warned baggage handling firm Swissport could lose its contract with IAG after chaos at Gatwick.'Swissport need to improve their performance and if they don't they're going to lose business,' he said.

SMUGGLED MEAT COULD BRING EBOLA TO BRITAIN

THE Ebola virus could spread to Britain in the meat of chimps, giant bats and other exotic species smuggled into the UK and eaten as a delicacy, it is feared.

Scientists say that African 'bush meat' hidden in suitcases and sold in London markets is a 'huge problem' and could be harbouring the deadly virus.

The warning comes as UK border staff said they are unprepared to deal with infected travellers.

Charities have warned that the disease, one of deadliest known to man, is 'absolutely out of control' in west Africa and the World Health Organisation will today launch a $100million (£60million) plan to fight the 'unprecedented' threat. Latest figures from the WHO show there have been 122 new cases - an increase of more than 10 per cent - in four days. Another 57 deaths have been recorded, taking the toll to 729.

But some experts say that difficulty in compiling the statistics means the official figures are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg.

In other developments:

? The US has warned that Ebola is 'one plane ride away' from the West and advised against non-essential travel to Ebola-hit nations;

? Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and called in troops to quarantine epicentres of Ebola;

? Nigeria and Sierra Leone have introduced screening at airports;

? The US Peace Corps placed two aid workers in isolation and began to evacuate hundreds more.

Ebola kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, is spread by body fluids including sweat and saliva and there is no cure and no vaccine.

International concern has been inflamed by the death of an US finance consultant who flew into Lagos in Nigeria, Africa's biggest city and a transport hub.

But some experts say the disease could also come to the UK in bush meat - traded in markets or simply given to relatives as a present.

Some 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters the UK every year. The strain of Ebola that is on the rampage in west Africa is thought to have come from a hunter handling an infected bat. Professor John Oxford, one of Britain's leading virologists, described the illegal import of animals from bats to chimps as 'a huge problem'.

And Professor Robert Dingwall, an infectious diseases expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'Similar meat that could have caused this outbreak may well end up in a market stall in London.'

He said that much of the meat smuggled in is dried or smoked but some of it is fresh.

He added: 'People will put a bloody carcass in a suitcase and take that on a plane. It is a remote risk but if that is how we think Ebola moves from animal to human inside west Africa, there's no reason to suppose it wouldn't happen here.'

Richard Kock, a professor of wildlife health and emerging diseases at the Royal Veterinary College, said it is 'very, very possible' that some suitcases will contain fruit bats - the creatures some blame for the current outbreak.

However, he added that the main risk remains air passengers.

Border staff said they were unprepared for the task of spotting sickly passengers at airports,.

Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Service Union, told the BBC her members were 'very concerned'.

She said: 'They are the first port of contact and the concern is what they do if they are confronted with someone that doesn't appear well.

'There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff as to what they should do.'

A Border Force spokesman said staff have been given clear guidance on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases.

Ministers and health officials have stressed that the chances of Ebola spreading in the UK are remote.

 

FROM AFRICAN BUSH TO OUR MARKET STALLS

÷Nearly 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters Britain each year - including cuts from exotic animals disguised as beef.

÷The charity Born Free Wild says animals from all over Africa, from giraffe to zebra, and even endangered species such as gorillas and elephants, are snared by poachers, butchered, and then transported to city markets and restaurants across the globe.

÷ Bush meat is also smuggled in hidden in suitcases by African travellers visiting relatives. Favoured delicacies include fruit bats the size of a small cat, antelope and cane rats.

÷ Much will be dried or smoked but some will be raw and could carry infections such as Ebola or HIV.

÷In 2012, an undercover investigation by the BBC revealed cane rats and 'smokies' - charred skin-on sheep or goat meat - on sale in a north-east London market.

÷ A year earlier, trading standards officers in the Midlands seized chimpanzee meat believed to be destined for restaurants.

PASSENGERS FROM AFRICA WHO SHOW SYMPTOMS WILL BE SENT STRAIGHT TO SECURE ISOLATION UNITS

BRITISH airports and airlines are on high alert to prevent the deadly Ebola virus from reaching this country.

Passengers thought to have the virus will be barred from boarding flights heading to the UK - and will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival.

They will then be quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. But because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.

Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms.

One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst-ever outbreak.

For the first time, the virus, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will arrive in Britain on an international flight. It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a 'very serious threat'.

But he sought to calm fears, saying it 'most unlikely' that Ebola could spread within the UK because of 'frankly different' standards of infection control here.

He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: 'We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking 'precautionary measures' but he was 'very confident' it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK. In other developments:

??The Foreign Office said it had not advised against travel to affected areas, but it was monitoring the situation closely.

??Experts said the survival of anyone who catches the disease was 'in the lap of the gods'.

??Public Health England said the outbreak was 'clearly not yet under control' and was the most 'acute health emergency' facing Britain.

??A charity warned that the outbreak was 'speeding up rather than slowing down' and the EU pledged £1.6million to stopping it spreading.

??There was speculation the RAF will be called to repatriate any infected Britons from West Africa.

The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks.

But international concern has been inflamed by the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos, Africa's biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub.

Mr Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease.

British Airways flies daily to Lagos and also has regular flights to Freetown in Sierra Leone and Monrovia in Liberia.

Staff at all airlines have the discretion to deny boarding.

A BA spokesman said: 'The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority.

'We will fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.'

Virgin Atlantic said its staff had been trained to spot symptoms, which range from flu-like fever and malaise initially, to vomiting, diarrhoea and, eventually, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Sufferers can suffer from convulsions and fall into a coma before dying from massive and irreparable damage to their internal organs.

It was unclear last night to what extent the UK would follow the practice of some countries and track down and quarantine all passengers on a plane used by a suspected sufferer.

But the tone of the latest official guidance suggested only those known to be in close physical proximity - five rows of seats surrounding the suspect - will be contacted for checks.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, insisted that airline passengers had little to fear, as direct contact with bodily fluids is needed for the disease to spread.

But he admitted that 'it is not impossible' that someone who is infected, could arrive in the UK before developing any symptoms.

Heathrow Airport said it had a medical team on constant duty with the power to detain, isolate or send to hospital people with suspicious symptoms.

Dr Derek Gatherer, a Lancaster University expert on disease spread, said: 'There is no treatment - nothing you can do yourself. It's in the lap of the gods if you're lucky to be one of the few who survive.'

Dr Ben Neuman, a Reading University virologist, said Ebola will come here eventually - but predicted it will be caught and shut down by border staff.

The Foreign Office sought to play down the likelihood of an outbreak in the UK, saying the Government 'is confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here'.

It added: 'We have experienced scientists and doctors - the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.'

Liberia has closed all its schools, quarantined a number of communities and placed all non-essential workers on compulsory leave as part of an action plan that will be enforced by security.

Officials said hospitals were overwhelmed, an isolation unit in the capital Monrovia was over-run and patients were being treated in their homes. Information minister Lewis Brown said: 'This is a major public health emergency.'

THE UK DOCTOR BATTLING A DEADLY ENEMY

BRITISH doctor Hannah Spencer yesterday told of her gruelling battle to help Ebola victims in West Africa.

The 29-year-old from Surrey volunteered to work in Guinea and Liberia - the crucible of the outbreak - for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.

Her stifling protective suit was the only barrier between her and the deadly virus as she worked with victims.

Dr Spencer, who has just returned to the UK from a three-week deployment, said: 'I wouldn't say I felt completely calm - obviously you have some anxieties before you go. But once you've done your first day in the isolation ward, when you're wearing all the protective gear, you feel safe to work with the patients.

'It's difficult working in the protective clothing - it's very hot, and you can't spend more than an hour inside it. So when you've got a large number of patients, it's hard to feel that you are spending long enough with each one.' Two American doctors - Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 60 - have contracted Ebola and are fighting for their lives. The disease kills 90 per cent of those who are infected.

To minimise the risk of infection, medical staff have to wear thick rubber boots that come up to their knees, an impermeable body suit, gloves, a face mask, a hood and goggles to ensure no air at all can touch their skin.

Dr Spencer and her colleagues lost up to five litres of sweat during a shift and had to spend two hours rehydrating afterwards.

She went first to Guinea and then to a rural clinic in Foya, Liberia, where the ten-bed isolation unit became crammed with 22 patients within days of her arrival, with many lying on mattresses on the floor.

Doctors Without Borders gives volunteers a 'buddy' to watch out for symptoms. When they return to their home countries they have to remain within a short driving distance of a hospital in case they later discover they are exposed.

Dr Spencer said she had faced little resistance from her family when she told them about her volunteering, and her mother told her: 'As if I could stop you from going!'

The doctor added: 'One 15-year-old girl was inside the isolation ward for over a week and I really thought she was going to die. But then she started to get better. That was a wonderful moment.'

HEALTH CHIEFS RACE TO FIND CONTACTS OF EBOLA VICTIM

NIGERIAN health officials have admitted they do not have a list of all the people who came into contact with an American victim of the Ebola virus, prompting fears the outbreak could spread.

Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for Liberia's Finance Ministry, had been in Liberia for the funeral of his sister, who also died from the disease, and was on his way back to his home in the US.

The 40-year-old arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, on June 20 and had suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea on two flights. He was put in isolation at the First Consultant Hospital and died on Friday.

So far 59 people who came into contact with him have been identified and are under surveillance. But the airlines have yet to release flight information naming passengers and crew members.

Dr David Heymann, head of the Centre on Global Health Security, said every person who had been on the plane to Lagos with Sawyer would need to be traced.

Sierra Leone's top doctor fighting Ebola died yesterday after he contracted the virus just days ago. Sheik Umar Khan was credited with treating more than 100 patients.

The latest outbreak, which has claimed more than 670 lives, is the worst in history. The highly-contagious disease has a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent.

Liberia closed most of its border crossings on Sunday and Nigeria's airports and borders have been on full alert since Friday.

IS THE WORLD'S DEADLIEST DISEASE ON ITS WAY TO BRITAIN?
BY TOM LEONARD

There was nothing unusual-looking about the passenger arriving at Heathrow from Lagos. He was carrying one of the most deadly diseases known to mankind, but it wasn't noticed by overstretched Nigerian airport officials before departure, nor by attendants on the flight, despite their special training to watch out for feverish passengers.

Because Ebola is a disease that has an incubation period of between two and 21 days, it's more than likely that the final line of defence — immigration staff at Heathrow — failed to notice anything untoward about him either. It wasn't as if he was so unsteady or unwell that he couldn't answer basic questions.

And so he was waved through. Little did anyone realise that his initial flu-like symptoms — fever, headache, achy limbs, sore throat — would soon become something much, much worse.

Ebola, a disease which is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and for which there is no vaccine and no known cure, was now in Britain for the first time. It would soon be spreading across the country, killing almost everyone it touched.

Fortunately this is an imaginary situation, but an Ebola epidemic is the nightmare scenario which inspires Hollywood disaster movie writers and keeps public health officials awake at night.

However, there is now widespread alarm among experts that it could actually happen, because the deadly disease has spread for the first time from remote jungle villages to claim its first victim in Lagos, one of Africa's most sophisticated cities, with air links to major cities worldwide, including London.

And woe betide anyone who comes in close contact with an Ebola victim. While the virus's one virtue is that it isn't as easily transmitted as, say, an airborne influenza, it is highly contagious if you come near enough to be infected by any sort of bodily fluid.

This means not only contamination from vomiting and diarrhoea — the next stage after the fever and headaches — but saliva from a kiss, sweat from a mopped brow, or even, it is thought, a sneeze.

If a sufferer is looked after by loved ones, only the most ruthless sanitation regime will save them. If he or she seeks medical help, risks could be even greater.

As one British expert told me yesterday, if an Ebola victim was misdiagnosed and ended up being admitted to a normal hospital ward, the 'consequences would be disastrous' as nurses and doctors unwittingly passed the virus to other patients and colleagues.

The final stages of the disease are hideously unpleasant as the virus punches holes in veins, often causing massive internal haemorrhaging and bleeding from the eyes, ears, mouth and other orifices. Death is generally caused by multiple organ failure.

Just as well, then, that no one ever gets Ebola beyond a handful of unlucky souls in the remote rural villages of equatorial West and Central Africa, where locals ignore warnings and still eat the fruit bats and monkeys that are the chief carriers of the disease.

At least, that's what public health experts have been saying for years. Suddenly, though, they are changing their tune.

The latest outbreak of the disease is not only to be the worst ever by number of deaths, it has also been the first to spread to people living in major urban centres, including national capitals. The risk of it spreading across the world is now very real, experts warn.

Since the outbreak started in Guinea in February, spreading to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the virus has infected more than 1,200 people, killing 672 of them so far.

A cruel irony of Ebola is that those caring for its victims often contract the disease themselves. Recent casualties included one of Liberia's most respected doctors and two Americans — thought to be Ebola's first Western victims.

Dr Ken Brantly was the medical director of a Christian aid charity, Samaritan's Purse, who had been working in Liberia since October. He contracted the disease despite wearing head-to-toe protective clothing while treating sufferers.

Nancy Writebol, a Christian missionary, had also been working with Ebola victims in the Liberian capital of Monrovia when she became infected.

Dr Brantly, at least, may yet defy Ebola's grim statistics. Early treatment improves a patient's chances of survival, and he recognised his own symptoms and got immediate care.

His wife and two young children were with him in Liberia until flying home to the U.S. a few weeks ago, but they have not yet shown any signs of the disease.

On Sunday, Liberia took the drastic step of closing its borders but it may be already too late. In Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, a Liberian man who tested positive for Ebola died on Friday.

Patrick Sawyer, a civil servant, collapsed at Lagos Airport as he returned from the funeral of his sister, who had also died from the disease. He changed plane in Togo and was vomiting on board, prompting fears the disease has already spread to a fifth country from just one outbreak.

Nigeria's government says all ports of entry are on high alert.

'The situation is getting more and more scary,' conceded Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant health minister.

Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriorology at Aberdeen University, warns: 'If the disease gets going in Nigeria, it would be cause for concern. Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.'

Professor Pennington, an international expert, said yesterday that he was hardly reassured by current efforts to contain Ebola's spread.

'This is a very big outbreak, and I get the feeling that whatever is being done to control it is not being done very well. Once you get a fairly large number of cases, it gets a momentum and becomes more and more difficult to control.

'This is now crossing international borders.'

Professor Pennington, who criticised the UK government over its handling of mad cow disease, warned that Britain would be ill-equipped to cope with a sudden influx of Ebola victims.

Isolating them is critical, he said, but ordinary hospitals simply don't have the facilities or the necessary highly trained staff. The specialist hospitals that dealt with such diseases have largely closed.

'If [Ebola] came into London, I honestly don't know where they'd put the patients,' he said. 'We could cope with one or two, but more than that? Let's hope we don't have to.'

The big problem with Ebola, he stressed, is diagnosing it. The disease looks much like common flu until it's too late. Even the rash that sufferers get after about five days could be confused with other less serious ailments.

'Ebola patients can often go under the radar, but if they ended up in hospital, giving blood samples and coughing over everyone, it would be potentially disastrous,' he said.

He adds that it was crucial for British GPs and hospital doctors to start watching out for Ebola.

'If someone is coming in with flu-like symptoms, it's crucial to ask them where they've been — and whether they've been to Africa.'

Surprisingly, scientists are still not clear exactly where Ebola comes from. The first known outbreak was in 1976 in a remote village near the Ebola river in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Although most of the cases are understood to have been transmitted from human to human, each Ebola outbreak is initially caused by someone coming into contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected animal, such as a fruit bat, monkey or pig. (The bats are believed to carry the disease without being infected by it.)

The chief cause is the popularity of 'bush meat' — animals trapped in the wild. Bats and monkeys are frequently dried and then eaten without being cooked. Since bush meat is now being smuggled into London and Paris, scientists warn this could be another source of infection in Europe.

According to Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at Reading University, the disease is spreading so rapidly now because people are 'rescuing' Ebola sufferers from hospitals or snatching their dead bodies so they can wash them in accordance with religious custom.

In the first case of an infection in Sierra Leone, a hairdresser in Freetown, the capital, was forcibly removed from hospital by her family, sparking a frantic search to find her before she infected others. She died on Sunday.

Dr Neuman also fears officials in the UK may be hard-pressed to keep out every Ebola sufferer if their numbers become too great.

'We have to hope they do, though, as in the late stages of infection, you have enough virus in your body to infect everyone on Earth maybe three times over.'

EBOLA 'COULD SPREAD GLOBALLY' AFTER PLANE BRINGS IT TO NIGERIA

AN OUTBREAK of Ebola could spread worldwide after an infected plane passenger introduced the deadly virus to Nigeria, health experts warned last night.

Previous outbreaks were confined to forests and rural areas, but this one has already spread across four countries in West Africa and has killed 672 - the disease's biggest death toll.

The news came as it emerged that an American doctor working for a charity in Liberia had become infected.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, from Texas, had moved to the country for the Samaritan's Purse organisation with his children and wife, Amber, to help contain the disease.

More than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus, which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks.

After an air traveller brought it to Nigeria, health experts now fear infected air passengers who do not realise they have the virus could spread it around the world.

With 170million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and airlines fly from there to Britain, other European countries and North America.

Civil servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his sister, who had also succumbed to the disease.

His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said: 'If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern.

'Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.'

Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers - but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.

Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids.

All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280.

A BRITISH mining company has evacuated non-essential staff from Sierra Leone amid growing fears an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus could spread.

Yesterday London Mining said it has imposed travel limits around its mine 75 miles east of the capital Freetown and was closely monitoring the situation.

The move comes after the families of several infected patients forcibly removed them from rural clinics to be treated by traditional healers. There is concern their actions will spread the disease further.

The incurable and highly contagious virus was reported in the west African country last week and 50 suspected cases have been identified. Five people have died and there have been more than 100 deaths in neighbouring Guinea where the outbreak began.

London Mining said its output had not been affected and no cases of Ebola had been found around its Marampa iron ore mine.

A spokesman said eight staff left at the weekend and those abroad on holiday had been advised not to return for now.

He added that the firm was screening all staff and visitors to its sites and has medication and equipment at the mine ready to deal with any suspected cases.

African Minerals, another British firm mining iron ore in Sierra Leone, said it has imposed travel restrictions on workers but operations were continuing as normal.

Theo Nicol, deputy information minister, said all suspected cases in Freetown had tested negative so far. Symptoms of Ebola include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting.

Travel information from the Foreign Office warns of the outbreak but does not advise against going to the region.
