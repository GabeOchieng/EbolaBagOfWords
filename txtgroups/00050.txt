On Aug. 19, Nancy Writebol, a 59-year-old missionary who had contracted Ebola in Liberia, was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, free of the disease after a period in isolation. Her doctors asked whether she would be willing to donate her potentially lifesaving blood plasma to other Ebola patients. Grateful to be alive and eager to help someone else, she said yes.

She got her chance two months later, when Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor in New York, was confirmed to have Ebola, contracted in Guinea where he had worked for Doctors Without Borders.

Other patients in the United States had been treated for Ebola since Mrs. Writebol’s recovery, but she was not able to donate plasma to them because they were the wrong blood type. (She declined to give her blood type, saying she had been told it could violate Dr. Spencer’s confidentiality.)

“The doctors called me and asked me if I was still willing,” she said. “I have to tell you, I’m just really happy to have been able to do that.”

Dr. Spencer is recovering and will be released from isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center when testing shows he is no longer contagious, a hospital spokeswoman said on Wednesday. She confirmed that he has been playing his banjo[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/bellevue-ebola-patient-craig-spencer-jamming-quarantine-article-1.2000196] and riding an exercise bike.

Also on Wednesday, New York City’s health department said that a friend of Dr. Spencer’s was no longer a public health threat and was being released from quarantine. The friend becomes one of 357 people — mainly travelers from West Africa, but also people taking care of Dr. Spencer — being monitored by the city for Ebola symptoms, but not under quarantine. Another friend of Dr. Spencer’s was released from quarantine over the weekend, leaving only the doctor’s fiancée still under quarantine, in the apartment they shared.

Once recovered, Dr. Spencer will join Mrs. Writebol in the exclusive club of Ebola survivors in the United States.

They know what it is like to spend days in isolation units, able to speak to loved ones only through glass or by phone, treated by health workers who are unrecognizable in their layers of protective gear. They know that they may be the antidote incarnate, holding the cure for another Ebola patient in their own immune systems.

Some researchers believe that blood products or transfusions from an Ebola survivor can provide antibodies against the virus that will help a newly infected person fight off what is very often a fatal disease.

Another Ebola survivor, Dr. Kent Brantly, released from Emory on Aug. 21, said he had donated blood products to three patients: Dr. Rick Sacra, another missionary; Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman; and Nina Pham, a nurse in Dallas who contracted the virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan. Mr. Duncan died on Oct. 8; the others have recovered.

Mrs. Writebol was a college counselor at Charlotte Christian High School in Charlotte, N.C., before she and her husband, David, a businessman, became missionaries in 1998, going first to Ecuador. Most recently, they were with SIM USA[http://www.simusa.org/] in Monrovia, Liberia.

Like Dr. Spencer, who posted a photo of himself in full protective gear on his Facebook page, Mrs. Writebol carefully followed disease protocols, and she is still not sure how she was infected.

“There’s so much going on outside of the isolation units,” she said. “You can come in contact with people that have no idea they have Ebola.”

She began a course of an experimental drug, ZMapp, while still in Liberia, and completed it at Emory. She received a blood transfusion in Liberia and platelets at Emory, but not from an Ebola survivor. “There was no match for me,” she said.

She said that when she got the call to donate plasma, she was not told who the intended recipient was, but she guessed that it was Dr. Spencer. His status as the first New Yorker to come down with Ebola — as well as his energetic travels around the city by subway and Uber cab in the previous days — had made him the focus of intense attention.

She donated at a doctor’s office in Charlotte. As she was connected to the machine that removed her plasma, she thought of her faith. “The thing it made me think about was the blood of Christ,” she said. “That there is life in blood.”

She said that Dr. Spencer’s parents had expressed their gratitude by email, but that she had not communicated directly with him.

Her strongest memory of isolation is how lonely it was. She could hear the voices of her doctors and nurses and see their eyes through their protective gear, but nothing else. She was surprised when she discovered what they looked like after her treatment.

Her advice to Dr. Spencer is to take it easy: “Give yourself time to regain your strength, and give yourself time to process all that’s happened.”

Correction: November 13, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions last Thursday about Nancy Writebol, an Ebola survivor who donated plasma to help treat Dr. Craig Spencer in New York, misstated the affiliation of Dr. Rick Sacra, another Ebola survivor. Dr. Sacra is a missionary with a group now known as SIM (formerly the Society for International Missionaries); he is not with Samaritan’s Purse.

Obama Vows to Cooperate, Within Limits

WASHINGTON — President Obama [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] shook off an electoral drubbing on Wednesday and said he was eager to find common ground with Republicans during the final two years of his presidency, but he swiftly defied their objections by vowing to bypass Congress and use his executive authority to change the nation’s immigration system.

In a sign of how he intends to govern under a new political order with ascendant Republican leaders, Mr. Obama renewed his commitment to act on his own to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country.

His remarks, at a news conference in the East Room of the White House, were meant to put the vitriol of the campaign behind him — he responded to disaffected Americans by saying, “I hear you,” and that his election mandate was to “get stuff done.” But his promised action on immigration underscored the profound partisan disagreements that persist in Washington.

Republicans quickly accused the president of reaching out to them with one hand while slapping them with the other.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a Republican who is line to be the majority leader in the new Congress, warned Mr. Obama in a news conference in Louisville not to act on immigration on his own.

“It’s like waving a red flag in front of a bull,” Mr. McConnell said.

The back-and-forth came on a grim day at the White House after an election that cost the Democrats the Senate and called into question the president’s capacity to accomplish much of substance in his remaining time in office.

For all the talk of cooperation, Mr. Obama confronted the reality that gridlock may still rule Washington, curtailing his legacy and frustrating his lofty ambitions.

Mr. Obama seemed determined not to let the setback consume what is left of his presidency. Relentlessly cheerful during his afternoon news conference, Mr. Obama congratulated Republicans on their election success and offered words of conciliation. But he volunteered little regret or a sense that he needed to change course.

“It doesn’t make me mopey. It energizes me, because it means that this democracy’s working,” Mr. Obama said of his party’s defeat. He struck a carefully upbeat tone, declining to “read the tea leaves” of the election or to be baited into giving it a name, along the lines of the “shellacking” he said his party had taken in the 2010 congressional elections.

Still, he noted that Republicans had had a “good night,” and conceded that he was responsible for allaying the concerns of Americans who have become convinced that Washington is dysfunctional and unresponsive to their needs.

“As president, they rightly hold me accountable to do more to make it work properly,” Mr. Obama said.

The ultimate lesson of the election, he said, was that both parties should do more to work together. He called on Congress to quickly pass an emergency request for funding to combat Ebola, and announced that he would seek congressional authorization for his military campaign in Iraq and Syria.

He also said he would seek compromises in the coming months on trade deals, tax changes, infrastructure spending and an immigration overhaul. He offered no details.

“But what I’m not going to do is just wait,” he said of action on immigration. “I think it’s fair to say I’ve shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I’m going to continue to do so. But in the meantime, let’s see what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the system.”

In Louisville, Mr. McConnell signaled that he wanted to find compromise on key issues and make the Senate “work again” by changing the rules in the chamber. He flatly promised that Congress would not shut down the government or default on the national debt [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_debt_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in disputes about the nation’s finances.

“When the American people choose divided government, I don’t think it means they don’t want us to do anything,” Mr. McConnell told reporters. “We ought to start with the view that maybe there are things we can agree on to make progress for the country.”

But he, too, foreshadowed disagreements ahead, saying, “We will certainly be voting on things as well that we think the administration is not fond of.”

The new political landscape continued to take shape on Wednesday as the Republican majority in the House neared modern records and Republicans closed in on another Senate seat, this one in Alaska.

By Wednesday evening, House Republicans had netted 12 more seats, pushing their majority to 246, a level not seen since the Harry S. Truman administration. Several races still to be decided are likely to push that total higher.

Alaskans were still counting thousands of ballots, and the state is not likely to certify a winner until next week at the earliest. But Dan Sullivan, a Republican, led Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, by about 8,000 votes, a small number but an edge of nearly four percentage points in a sparsely populated state.

Democrats were able to eke out wins for governor in Colorado and Connecticut, and they vowed to fight to protect the thin lead that Senator Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, held in his surprisingly tight race. But Gov. Patrick J. Quinn of Illinois conceded defeat in a re-election effort that included a visit by the state’s once-favored son, Mr. Obama.

As members of Mr. Obama’s party sifted through the wreckage, the president was determined to find something positive. He made a surprise appearance at the daily White House staff meeting, telling exhausted aides who had spent the previous night watching losses far more crushing than they had anticipated that he was eager to get to work and squeeze every last moment out of his remaining time in office.

It was a sign of a president now liberated from the political strictures that have bound him over the past year, when Republicans spent hundreds of millions of dollars attacking him and his policies and Mr. Obama felt constrained from defending himself, worried about the potential harm it could do to vulnerable Democratic candidates.

But it also reflected a president unwilling to play what he considers the Washington game of self-flagellation after a political defeat.

Unlike his predecessor, George W. Bush, who fired Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld the day after the 2006 midterm elections, Mr. Obama made no personnel changes, and aides said they did not expect any.

White House officials say that Mr. Obama values Denis R. McDonough, his White House chief of staff, who seemed unflustered by the setback and flashed a broad smile in the minutes before the news conference began.

The president, for his part, made a point of showing off his good cheer in defeat — “I’m having a great time,” he said at one point during the news conference — and even of challenging his image as an aloof executive unwilling to engage in the rituals that power compromise in the capital. He said he would like to have a glass of Kentucky bourbon with Mr. McConnell.

“If the ways that we’re approaching the Republicans in Congress isn’t working, you know, I’m going to try different things, whether it’s having a drink with Mitch McConnell or letting John Boehner beat me again at golf,” Mr. Obama said, referring to the House speaker.

African Mediators Fail to Name Civilian to Lead Burkina Faso After Unrest

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — Despite often rancorous discussion brokered by three African presidents, political and military leaders in Burkina Faso[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/burkinafaso/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] have failed to name a civilian to lead a transition to democracy after the resignation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/africa/burkina-faso-unrest-blaise-compaore.html] of President Blaise Compaoré.

According to a statement late Wednesday from the leaders of Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal, the country’s fractious contenders have agreed to the outlines of a plan — intended in part to avert African Union and American sanctions — to restore the Constitution and begin a path to elections by November next year.

The negotiations in Ouagadougou, the capital of this poor and landlocked West African nation, followed a convulsion of violent protest[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/burkina-faso-protests-blaise-compaore.html] last week that led to Mr. Compaoré's exit. Thousands of protesters surged through the city, setting fire to buildings including the Parliament and marching on the presidential palace.

Mr. Compaoré fled to neighboring Ivory Coast with the assistance of France, the former colonial power, which still exerts enormous influence in the region and maintains a special forces base in Burkina Faso as part of an international effort to combat Islamic militants.

In the chaos surrounding Mr. Compaoré's departure, the military suspended the Constitution and named a presidential guard officer, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, as the country’s interim leader.

The three African presidents — John Dramani Mahama of Ghana, Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria and Macky Sall of Senegal — consulted with a wide range of players, including traditional leaders, religious figures, opposition groups and the military, according to their statement on Wednesday.

They planned to continue the discussions at a West African summit meeting in Accra, Ghana, on Thursday and Friday. The Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] crisis in the region is a central topic of that meeting.

Their deliberations in Ouagadougou teetered on the brink of collapse after opposition politicians noisily refused to sit in the same room as Compaoré loyalists.

But finally, according to three presidents’ statement, the factions agreed to “immediately” restore the Constitution to establish an interim government, and to “urgently designate by consensus a suitably eminent civilian to lead the transition.” In theory, some opposition figures argue, the Constitution provides for the speaker of Parliament to take over.

The factions also agreed “to form a transitional government for a period of one year” and “organize presidential and legislative elections by November 2015,” the presidents’ statement said.

It was not clear when the agreement would come into force, but the quarrelsome groups are under pressure to avoid potentially ruinous penalties associated with military takeovers.

Within days of Mr. Compaoré's exit, the African Union, the continent’s main representative body, set a two-week deadline for the military to hand over power to a civilian or face economic sanctions. Burkina Faso ranks as one of the world’s poorest nations.

For its part, the United States has said it has not decided whether the military takeover constitutes a coup d'état, which would lead to a suspension of military aid to a country that has depicted itself in recent years as an important ally in the fight against Islamic extremism.

Zéphirin Diabré, the best-known opposition leader, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Compaoré was overthrown by “a popular insurrection that cannot be treated as a vulgar coup d'état,” Reuters reported[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/05/uk-burkina-politics-idUKKBN0IP1DN20141105].

Two distinct worlds of panic over the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic are becoming clearer, oceans apart. In the United States, popular and political anxiety over the threat from the deadly virus eased palpably as no new cases have been reported after the few so far. In Liberia, home to nearly half of the 13,000-plus people infected with the virus since the outbreak in March, the latest statistical indicators, admittedly unreliable, showed a drop in reports of new cases and even some empty beds at previously mobbed medical centers.

“Am I hopeful?” commented Dr. Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization. “I am terrified that the information will be misinterpreted and people will start to think, ‘Oh, great. This is under control.’ This is like saying your pet tiger is under control.”

Liberia remains a closely watched model for the devastations wrought by Ebola, which has a mortality rate of around 70 percent, according to the W.H.O. It has left the government struggling to take effective countermeasures. Errors by the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf included a blanket quarantine ordered last summer on residents in Monrovia despite warnings from international health experts that it would compound the threat. Protesting crowds caused Liberian Army troops to use gunfire that killed a teenager in what an independent inquiry concluded was a “complete disregard for human life.”

Improved medical, education and cremation measures may at last be causing some relief in Liberia. But the disease is still raging in parts of Sierra Leone, prompting Dr. Aylward to warn that Ebola has shown a pattern to resurge quickly if safeguards are relaxed. “It’s going to take a very, very aggressive program of work,” he said, cautioning that just a few mishandled burials of Ebola victims in Liberia could start a whole transmission chain all over again.

What Follows a Shellacking at the Polls?

WASHINGTON — It is not a good sign for a president when there is talk in the days before an election of a “shellacking” — the term President Obama used in 2010 to acknowledge crushing Democratic midterm losses.

But a shellacking it was on Tuesday: Democrats lost control of the Senate, suffered further losses in the House of Representatives, and lost governorships even in liberal-leaning states like Maryland.

Now the post-mortems and predictions begin: How did Democrats fall so low? And what does it mean for the president, the parties, Oval Office aspirants and the country?

For Democrats, the public’s sour mood is perplexing: The economy is growing (especially compared with Europe’s), unemployment is falling, and the federal deficit is shrinking. Yet, a series of problems — from the shaky rollout of Mr. Obama’s health care overhaul[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to troubles across the Middle East and the flawed initial response to Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — have shaken Americans’ confidence.

Still, as Mr. Obama confirmed with his decisive re-election victory in 2012 (and as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had done before), there can be life after a shellacking.

Mr. Obama, like any president, retains significant power over foreign policy; already he has broad Republican backing for airstrikes on the Islamic State militant group.

He can also use executive action to advance Democratic priorities on energy, gay rights and climate change.

But any progress he makes on those issues might well be overshadowed if, as expected, he announces new rules to help millions of undocumented immigrants remain legally in the country.

At that point, things could quickly turn tense.

Mr. Obama is in a tight corner. He had promised action on immigration before September, but postponed it to appease vulnerable Democratic candidates, leaving normally friendly Latino voters furious over the delay; one Democratic congressman, Luis Gutiérrez of Illinois, warned of a “civil war” in the party.

But if the president does act, the real fury will come from the right. The standard post-election professions of good will could evaporate and prospects for compromise vanish even before Republicans take control of the Senate in January.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the presumed next majority leader, said Wednesday that unilateral action by Mr. Obama on immigration would be “a big mistake” that “poisons the well” for future cooperation.

Mr. Obama acknowledged the concerns. But he told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he had waited years for Congress to act, and “what we can’t do is just keep on waiting.” Congress, he added, could still pass an immigration overhaul, superseding his own actions.

How all this plays out in the eyes of millions of Latino voters could be critical to the hopes of both parties in 2016.

Mr. McConnell had tentatively offered an olive branch as the Republican gains became clear on Tuesday. He expected no sudden embrace from Mr. Obama, he said — their relationship has been chilly. But, he said, “perpetual conflict” was not inevitable, either.

He and Mr. Obama said they had spoken and sketched out the possibility of cooperation on trade (a big deal, with talks continuing on European and Pacific trade pacts), corporate taxation and improvements to outdated roads and bridges.

Still, if Mr. McConnell, a canny deal maker who rode into Congress on Ronald Reagan’s coattails in 1984, is to pass any significant legislation, he will need a modicum of party unity, support from a few Democrats — and the absence of a presidential veto.

But in the traditionally genteel Senate, Mr. McConnell will face a particularly unruly herd of Republicans. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose interest in a presidential run is no secret, said Wednesday that he might not endorse Mr. McConnell as leader; he favors a more confrontational Senate.

And as other potential Republican presidential aspirants in the Senate — Marco Rubio of Florida or Rand Paul of Kentucky — seek to distinguish themselves, cross-aisle cooperation will hardly be a top priority.

So, gridlock or compromise? Will the president find ways to deal with an often implacable Congress, or are his frustrations just beginning? Will Republicans seek to craft a record of accomplishments, or will a divided party overplay its winning hand?

Stay tuned.

Treating those who treat Ebola in Liberia

As the number of people sickened with Ebola soared this summer, American and Liberian officials faced a new challenge: How could they encourage international medical workers, understandably frightened about the risks, to come help fight the disease? The officials knew they would have to provide some assurances to the workers that they would be cared for if they fell ill.

Their answer, a dedicated Ebola field hospital for health workers, is scheduled to open soon outside Monrovia, the Liberian capital.

The facility was originally a modular trauma hospital installed by the United States military over more than a month at a cost of $10.4 million. It has been modified to house up to 25 infectious patients near the international airport in Harbel, about 35 miles east of Monrovia. It will be staffed by 69 members of the United States Public Health Service, who will treat health care workers from abroad as well as from Liberia. More than 150 Liberian medical workers have died from Ebola.

‘‘All of us here are trying to convey to the world that you can come here as a health care worker and provide care that’s greatly needed, and if something were to happen to you, we’ll give you the best care,’’ said Cmdr. Jamal K. Gwathney, a family-medicine doctor and the team’s chief of operations.

Patients will have to be vetted by the State Department and Liberian health officials before they are admitted to the hospital. It has air-conditioned wards and promises aggressive monitoring and management of electrolytes and blood pressure, though none of its physicians are critical-care specialists. For now, the unit will not use experimental drugs, although discussions are underway about using the site for research.

Throughout West Africa, Ebola patients typically endure sweltering heat and receive only food, drinks and some medications for comfort. Even health care centers that provide intravenous fluids to replace those lost through vomiting, diarrhea and sweating typically administer them without the benefit of diagnostics, aside from an initial Ebola test. Well over half of the patients die. Only foreigners are sometimes whisked away for sophisticated care.

Capt. Paul Reed, the new center’s chief medical officer, acknowledged that Liberians who were not health care providers might want to be admitted. ‘‘I know it’s been discussed,’’ he said, but added that he was comfortable with the plan to treat only health workers rather than trying to provide ‘‘such a high level of care for the masses.’’ He compared the approach to the triage doctors routinely perform during mass-casualty events.

The higher level of risk undertaken by health workers to serve others, their main role during outbreaks, and the chance that incentives will encourage more of them to work are strong arguments for prioritizing their care over that of members of the general population, said Ruth Faden, director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.

However, that calculus is complicated, because others — burial and outreach team members; caretakers for children; political leaders — could be considered equally important. Capt. Calvin Edwards, the officer in charge of the unit, said that if capacity allowed, treatment might be expanded to others ‘‘supporting the Ebola operation.’’

The Public Health Service team arrived in Harbel early last week dressed in long-sleeved blue uniforms. A corporal read them the rules of their deployment, including bans on alcohol consumption, water sports and pet adoptions. ‘‘Don’t let the local nationals touch your bags,’’ she warned.

Because none of the staff members had ever treated Ebola before, some spent their first few days in the country training with the people their unit is designed to serve, at Ebola units run by the aid groups Doctors Without Borders and International Medical Corps.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a health official who leads Liberia’s incident management system for the Ebola response, said the new unit should ‘‘give hope to those who are coming across the world.’’

While the center had been scheduled to begin accepting patients on Friday, its leaders said, some critical supplies, including personal protective equipment and hand-washing stations, had not arrived by Tuesday afternoon.

Obama’s offer to Republicans

President Obama refused on Wednesday to submit to the Republican narrative that his presidency effectively ended with the midterm elections.

He said he will not agree to the repeal of health care reform, as many Republicans demand. He will not sit around doing nothing while they look for the courage to enact immigration reform. He will continue to demand a higher minimum wage and new spending on public works, and expansion of early education programs.

‘‘Obviously, Republicans had a good night,’’ he said, a quiet admission that his party got drubbed, losing control of the Senate, as well as at least 14 House seats. But he said he hoped to meet regularly with Republican leaders and work on areas where there is mutual agreement.

‘‘What’s most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically the last several is: Get stuff done,’’ he said. ‘‘Don’t worry about the next election. Don’t worry about party affiliation. Do worry about our concerns.’’

Republicans ran on no message except that Mr. Obama was always wrong, and voters on Tuesday said they were angry with the country’s direction and political gridlock, taking their fury out on the president’s party because he is in charge. Under those circumstances, Mr. Obama was justified in sticking with what he called ‘‘the principles that we’re fighting for,’’ which got him elected twice: creating job opportunity by expanding the economy, the top issue on the minds of most voters. There is no need to backtrack on goals like a higher minimum wage or expanded health insurance when most voters say they want those things.

But Mr. Obama said there were several areas where he thinks agreement could be reached with Republicans, and several of them were the same ones outlined by Senator Mitch McConnell, who will be the new majority leader, in his post-election news conference. One is a trade agreement with Pacific nations, which he said would help open those markets to American goods. (Though it needs to include strong labor and environmental regulations.) Another is corporate tax reform that would eliminate many deductions and breaks, though unfortunately Republicans continue to insist on applying any revenues generated toward reducing corporate tax rates rather than using that revenue on federal projects that would create new jobs.

Mr. Obama also said he would request $6.2 billion to fight the spread of Ebola and would ask Congress to formally authorize the military action against the Islamic State. Mr. McConnell seems open to cooperation on these issues, saying he would work with the White House on trade and corporate taxes and wants to hear its requests on Ebola and the Islamic State.

In what reporters in Sierra Leone denounced as an abuse of the government’s emergency powers to deal with the spread of Ebola, one of the country’s most prominent broadcast journalists was detained this week after he devoted a segment of his popular radio program to a critical discussion of President Ernest Bai Koroma’s handling of the outbreak.

The radio host, David Tam-Baryoh, was arrested on Monday following a broadcast of his weekly program “Monologue” on the independent station Citizen FM. Listeners in Freetown told the Committee to Protect Journalists[https://cpj.org/2014/11/in-sierra-leone-journalist-imprisoned-after-critic.php] that Saturday’s episode was interrupted after Mr. Tam-Baryoh interviewed an opposition spokesman who criticized the president’s response to the Ebola crisis and his supposed interest in seeking a third term in office.

According to Umaru Fofana, who reports for the BBC and the Freetown news site Politico, a senior police official said[http://politicosl.com/2014/11/sierra-leone-president-orders-journalists-arrest/] that Mr. Tam-Baryoh was arrested as a result of “an executive order signed by his excellency the president.” The same officer said that the detention would last “until it pleases his excellency” to release the reporter.

On Thursday, Mr. Fofana reported that Mr. Tam-Baryoh’s wife had been denied access to him, and that the police raided his office and confiscated equipment.

Wife of detained #SierraLeone[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SierraLeone?src=hash] journalist, David Tam-Baryoh has expressed concern over his health, safety & denial of access to him. — Umaru Fofana (@UmaruFofana) November 6, 2014[https://twitter.com/UmaruFofana/status/530274783641223169]

Mohamed Massaquoi, a local newspaper editor who is the president of the Sierra Leone Reporters Union, denounced the arrest as an abuse of the president’s powers. In an interview with Daniel Finnan of Radio France International, he said, “We are under health emergency, we are not under public emergency.”

Arrest of journalist David Tam Baryoh for #Ebola[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash] criticism is a shame to #SierraLeone[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SierraLeone?src=hash], says journalist union https://t.co/9A1QVsSEXQ[https://t.co/9A1QVsSEXQ] — Daniel Finnan (@Daniel_Finnan) November 5, 2014[https://twitter.com/Daniel_Finnan/status/530054533435891712]

“If you are going to arrest journalists simply because of saying the facts,” he added, “then it’s a shame to the government, it’s a shame to the people of Sierra Leone.”

Freetown’s Global Times reported[http://www.globaltimes-sl.com/tam-baryoh-sent-to-pademba-road/] that there were concerns over the detained reporter’s health after he “complained of chest pain” in custody at a maximum-security prison.

The arrest was front-page news[https://www.facebook.com/SierraNetworkSalone/photos/pb.347165958693646.-2207520000.1415306523./742297559180482/?type=3&theater] in Sierra Leone, although one newspaper, The Awareness Times, featured an editorial[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526587.shtml] by its publisher, Sylvia Olayinka Blyden, who asserted that Mr. Tam-Baryoh had been arrested not for criticism of the Ebola response, but for sectarian “incitement.” Ms. Blyden, a former close adviser to the president who resigned last month[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/ebola-sierra-leone-west-africa.html], has also criticized the health ministry, saying it[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/printer_200526321.shtml] underreported cases of Ebola.

Before she left the government, she was involved in a bitter dispute with Mr. Tam-Baryoh[http://www.globaltimes-sl.com/tam-bayoh-slams-awareness-times/]. Previously, however, she had been full of praise for his work. In 2012, she wrote:[http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=8&num=20049] “Sierra Leone’s leading good governance and social activism radio program is the weekly ‘Monologue’ program hosted by seasoned journalist David Tam-Baryoh. The program is famous for spurring various governments and officials into doing the right thing for citizens, as it is known to have a huge listenership.”

In response to criticism of her editorial, Ms. Blyden wrote Thursday on Facebook[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=806118719451560&set=a.132650853465020.25192.100001603180299&type=1&comment_id=806457626084336&offset=0&total_comments=51] that emergency measures were justified, since “we are AT WAR with a virus that has KILLED thousands of our compatriots so far.”

Peter Nkanga of the Committee to Protect Journalists said: “Sierra Leone’s genuine state of emergency means that critical thinking and public debate are more important than ever. Locking away journalists without charge helps nobody. We call on President Ernest Bai Koroma to ensure that David Tam-Baryoh is released immediately and that journalists are allowed to do their jobs freely.”

Ice Bucket Challenge: Can Lightning Strike Again?

Ice in a bucket became lightning in a bottle this summer, raising awareness and a record $115 million to combat the rare disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Former President George W. Bush, Taylor Swift, LeBron James, Bill Gates and millions more social media users participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, dumping buckets of ice over their heads to support attempts to find a cure for A.L.S., known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. About 30,000 Americans have A.L.S., which attacks nerve cells and ultimately leads to total paralysis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/muscle-function-loss/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], although the mind remains sharp. Life expectancy is usually about two to five years from diagnosis.

The concept was simple: People made videos of themselves dumping a bucket of ice water on their heads, posted it to Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites, and then challenged friends to do the same within 24 hours or donate money to A.L.S. research and care. (Many people both made a video and donated the money.)

On Facebook alone, more than 17 million Ice Bucket Challenge videos were shared from June 1 to September. More than 440 million people viewed the videos more than 10 billion times, Facebook said.

Since the end of July, donations to the ALS Association, a Washington-based nonprofit, amount to nearly six times the $19.4 million the group raised in all of the year ended Jan. 31, 2013.

“This is an encouraging sign that people have truly embraced the fight against A.L.S. as a cause they want to support,” Barbara Newhouse, chief executive of the ALS Association, said in a statement.

But can charities replicate that success? Social media marketing experts said that would be close to impossible because serendipity played such a large role. Still, that has not stopped experts from studying the phenomenon.

“More than anything else, the reason why this all worked in the end is because people felt like they were doing good, that they were contributing to something,” said Charlene Li, a social media expert and a founder of the Altimeter Group consultancy. “It really was about you, but it had the veneer of being a good citizen.”

Such experts point to a couple of key factors: The stunt was easy and entertaining, especially during the dog days of summer. Peer pressure spurred people to join in.

Star power also propelled the challenge into a global sensation. “It’s not just that celebrities got involved, but they really made it their own,” said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the digital marketing company 360i. “There was creativity here, whether it’s Kermit the Frog, Bill Gates or Sarah Palin — they all were both relatable and akin to their personality.”

The ALS Association didn’t even start the campaign. A spokeswoman said that if the group had tried to create it itself, it probably would not have been nearly as successful. The charity stumbled onto success by jumping on a small campaign that already had taken root.

The Ice Bucket Challenge had been percolating on the Internet for several weeks before it was linked to A.L.S., with participants challenged to donate to a charity of their choosing. In mid-July, for example, the golfer Greg Norman challenged Matt Lauer, host of “Today” on NBC. Mr. Lauer performed the stunt on the show, promised to donate money to the Hospice of Palm Beach County and challenged Brian Williams, Martha Stewart and Howard Stern.

A couple of weeks later, Pete Frates, a former college baseball player at Boston College, learned about the challenge from his friend Pat Quinn. Mr. Frates and Mr. Quinn have A.L.S. and wanted to turn the stunt into a fund-raiser for the disease.

Mr. Frates posted a video of himself bouncing his head to “Ice Ice Baby,” the 1989 rap song by Vanilla Ice, and challenged some friends. Soon, the Ice Bucket Challenge spread through Boston circles.

By August, a cascade of politicians, pop stars, actors, athletes, chief executives and other celebrities were taking part. “Did we ever imagine the level of awareness or the money that is coming in? In our dreams we did,” Nancy Frates, Mr. Frates’s mother, said in an interview this summer.

The challenge soon became a lightning rod for criticism. Some called it “slacktivism,” where people click and post items online in the name of a charity or a social cause without taking action. Others said it did little to raise awareness about the disease or took issue with the premise that participants need not donate money if they dumped a bucket of ice on their heads. They said it should be the reverse: People who donate should dump buckets on the heads of those who do not.

Other critics said that among celebrities it turned into a popularity contest that had little to do with the charity or the disease. In response to the criticism, the ALS Association highlighted its record level of donations, saying the challenge brought in 2.5 million new donors. Some social media experts pointed out that the group could have raised even more money by adding a button at the end of the videos that would allow people to donate with a click.

Some A.L.S. groups have discussed making the Ice Bucket Challenge an annual event. And it didn’t take long for some causes to try to piggyback on the trend, adding their own twists but also flirting with trend fatigue. None of the imitators have met with such success.

There was the “Lather Against Ebola Challenge,” which encouraged people in Ivory Coast to wash their hands with videos showing people dumping soapy water over their heads. The “Rice Bucket Challenge” in India skipped dumping rice while instead urging people to give a bucket of rice or donate to meals for children.

College students started a “Pay My Tuition” challenge on Twitter, asking celebrities to help pay their tuition. In response, Blackboard, the education technology company, started an essay contest. The winners[http://blog.blackboard.com/drum-roll-the-winners-of-our-paymytuitionchallenge/] won scholarships from Blackboard. But the Ice Bucket Challenge will be hard to beat, said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Once an idea infects us, we build up antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to resist similar ideas again,” he said.

One question remaining is whether such viral donations represent a net increase in contributions to charities or a shift in dollars from other causes. But while the challenge has faded from the spotlight, some groups are trying to keep the light shining.

Before Game 2 of the World Series last month, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, presented a trophy to the Frates family and dedicated the game to Mr. Frates and others fighting the disease.

The silver bucket read: “Not since the legendary Lou Gehrig has anyone inspired a nation to take up the fight against A.L.S. as you have. Major League Baseball extends its deepest gratitude for all you have done to bring awareness to this important cause.”

Mr. Obama’s Moment on Immigration

President Obama said on Wednesday that he would act on his own by the end of the year to “improve” the immigration system, presumably by giving many — perhaps millions — of the country’s unauthorized immigrants temporary protection from deportation and permission to work. He has said this before, only to back off in deference to election-year politics.

Now the election is over, and the only thing to say to the president is: Do it. Take executive action. Make it big.

He must not give in to calls to wait. Six fruitless years is time enough for anyone to realize that waiting for Congress to help fix immigration is delusional. Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative John Boehner have warned Mr. Obama that executive action would destroy any chance of future legislation.

But Republicans have had many, many opportunities to move on immigration, and never have. They killed bipartisan reform in 2006 and 2007, and again this year. The party, whose hard-core members tried to stoke national panic at the border this summer, shrieking about migrant children, Ebola and the Islamic State, is not ready to be reasoned with.

The arguments for protecting a broad swath of immigrants through executive action, meanwhile, are firmly on Mr. Obama’s side.

IT HONORS THE LAW Mr. Obama should direct the Department of Homeland Security to focus its limited enforcement resources on removing violent criminals, terrorists and other public-safety threats — and not people who have deep roots in this country and pose no threat. This use of discretion is customary and entirely legal.

IT HELPS THE COUNTRY Having such a large immigrant population living here outside the law also undermines the law. Ever more stringent crackdowns waste resources by chasing down people who pose no threat. Allowing unauthorized immigrants to live and work without fear, and keeping families together, will boost the economy, undercut labor exploitation and ease the strain on law enforcement. This has been the goal of a comprehensive immigration overhaul. A deportation reprieve would not be permanent, but it would have many of the same benefits as legislative reform.

IT CUTS TO THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For years the immigration discussion focused obsessively on border security and avoided the question of what do with 11 million immigrants already living here. If Mr. Obama acts, he will be declaring that this population has a stake in our country’s future. That is starkly opposed to the view espoused by Republican hard-liners like Senators Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions, Representatives Lamar Smith and Steve King, who take their cues from anti-immigration pressure groups that embody the country’s old strains of nativism. Millions of Americans-in-waiting need an answer. It should be a welcoming one.

There is reason to worry that Mr. Obama’s as-yet-unannounced plan for executive action will be too cautious, small and narrow. He has not said how big a group might qualify for protection. He should start with those who would have qualified for legalization under the bill that was passed in the Senate in 2013 but died in the House.

That bill, a serious attempt at a once-in-a-generation overhaul, would have given millions with clean records a shot at legalization if they paid fines and back taxes and got to the back of the citizenship line, among other things. Mr. Obama strongly endorsed the bill. His executive action should be just as broad.

There will surely be intense debate when Mr. Obama draws the lines that decide who might qualify for protection. Some simple questions should be his guide: Do the people he could help have strong bonds to the United States? Does deporting them serve the national interest? If it doesn’t, they should have a chance to stay.

Doing Good in Harm’s Way

As Dr. Rick Sacra prepared to fly to Liberia to treat patients in the Ebola zone, he prepared for the worst.

He sat down with his wife, Debbie, at their home in Worcester, Mass., for a conversation both somber and direct, showing her a spreadsheet of insurance and family assets. “We talked about the risk that I could get Ebola, and I could die.” Colleagues from SIM, the group that he works with, had suggested he would most likely be safe. One told him, “If you follow the protocols, you won’t get it.”

But Ebola got Dr. Sacra. Airlifted back to the United States, he recovered[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/us/aid-worker-recovering-from-ebola.html], but “I am still regaining my strength,” he said. “Still regaining the stamina that I had before the illness.”

In the anxiety and anger swirling around the questions of quarantine for health care workers returning from West Africa, the quiet heroism and determination of people like Dr. Sacra and the organizations they work for can be forgotten. Dr. Sacra, who went to Liberia after two colleagues there, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, contracted Ebola, chose to go to one of the world’s toughest places to help some of the world’s most desperate people, serving an organization that has done such work for decades.

Other kinds of risk seem to be rising in hot spots like Syria, where aid workers and journalists have been beheaded by Islamic State militants. Doing good no longer provides a protective shield, said Jim Lanning, director of applications and logistics for International Relief and Development, a group in Arlington, Va. While relief or missionary work has never been risk-free, he said, being part of an organization dedicated to helping people usually “was a free pass,” he said.

“Now it’s a target,” Mr. Lanning said.

And still, they go. There are some 60 organizations working in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the countries most affected by the Ebola virus, that are recognized as trusted and reputable, according to the United States Agency for International Development’s Center for International Disaster Information[http://www.cidi.org/], which cites evaluation efforts by such groups as InterAction and the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster network.

Juanita Rilling, the director of the disaster information center, said that a crisis like the Ebola outbreak, which builds slowly, did not get the surging response that natural disasters often did. The recent $100 million donation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/business/paul-allen-to-give-100-million-to-tackle-ebola-crisis.html] by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, is a good sign of growing donor interest — but, she added, “You don’t have to be Paul Allen to make a difference.” Nongovernment organizations, she said, “put even tiny cash donations toward a world of good.”

Ms. Rilling said that although many potential donors were motivated by hands-on activities like drives for clothing or canned goods, “cash is the best donation” because it provides groups the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and to buy goods locally, which can save money and help local economies.

Charities have advantages over government in getting aid to where it’s needed, said George Salloum, vice president for finance and operations at SIM[http://www.sim.org/], also known as Serving in Mission. “Because we’re smaller, we’re able to be more nimble, quicker, but we don’t have the resources they have,” he said. The groups work together, sharing responsibility and on-the-ground experience.

Samaritan’s Purse[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/], founded by the evangelist Franklin Graham, airlifted 100 tons of relief supplies to Liberia on Oct. 1; the organization manages some 20,000 volunteers in as many as 70 countries each year.

“We go to areas where people, a lot of people, are in the ditches of life,” said Ken Isaacs, vice president for programs and government relations at Samaritan’s Purse.

“There’s risk involved; there’s a lot of human suffering involved,” he said. “That’s part of our ministry. That’s who we are.” Cushy places, Mr. Isaacs said, don’t need the organization’s help — though, he added jokingly, “Sydney would be nice.”

As the disease worsened in Monrovia, Liberia, where Samaritan’s Purse worked with SIM, crowd unrest grew into riots, with people “threatening to burn the hospital down and threatening to hurt us,” Mr. Isaacs said. And unlike a war, where the areas of greatest risk can be mapped out — a sniper’s alley here; a border clash there, with artillery in heavy use — a disease like Ebola is “insidious,” he said. “It’s stealthy, like a torpedo. You don’t know when it’s going to happen — and you’re waiting. You’re waiting.”

Still, SIM is well accustomed to dealing with illness and chaos, said Bruce Johnson, the president of SIM USA. “This is, unfortunately, not new to us in Liberia,” a country that has been torn by civil war and a breakdown in basic services, he said. “We’ve been there since the 1950s.”

The group tries to build institutions that can be run locally, he said. “Our philosophy is work with those people in that country — train and equip them, and as quickly as possible turn that over to them and work alongside them in a collaborative way.”

SIM has a 136-acre campus in Monrovia with a hospital and other services. Its initial Ebola care center had 75 beds, “and that was overrun,” Mr. Johnson said. As Ebola continued to spread, the group opened part of the campus to Doctors Without Borders, which built and ran an Ebola center with 200 beds.

It was on that campus that Dr. Sacra and Ms. Writebol, a hospital worker with SIM, became infected, along with Dr. Brantly, a doctor with Samaritan’s Purse who was working at the SIM hospital.

Ms. Writebol said she had been in Africa for a year when Ebola appeared to be making its way to Monrovia, where she was working on the SIM campus. The group started evacuating expatriate staff members from facilities when she and Dr. Brantly fell ill. Ms. Writebol’s husband, who directs electrical and water services for the campus, could only stand by as her treatment began. The torments of the disease continued after she was taken to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment.

“There were nights when I would lay my head on my pillow,” she recalled, “and you would think, ‘I don’t know if I’ll wake up in the morning.' ”

She experienced peripheral neuropathy[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/peripheral-neuropathy/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — numbness, tingling and pain in the extremities. “It was very painful — so painful that at night while I was at Emory, they would have to pull the sheet off the tops of my toes. Even the weight of the sheet was just excruciating,” she said. She had burning sensations in her feet that health care workers treated with ice packs.

Now, she says: “I’m thankful I can walk. I’m just thankful for my life.”

Dr. Sacra went through torments as well. “It was really pretty awful,” he said. But comparing himself to Ms. Writebol, he said, “I think she was quite a bit more sick than I was.”

He and Ms. Writebol, he joked, are part of a “small, exclusive club.”

But, he said, he felt that he had to go to Liberia — he could not just let a nation where he had worked for much of the last 15 years languish. “It would be like watching something bad happen to your hometown.” He added, “I feel like, hey, if I can do something about that, I feel that’s my God-given responsibility to take care of my neighbor.”

Each group finds its niche in a crisis. At the Healey International Relief Foundation in Lumberton, N.J., Robert T. Healey Sr., the founder, said his group expected to spend more than a million dollars on efforts to help people in Sierra Leone. The group is sending personal protection equipment and gloves while sticking with long-term projects like running a hospital it built with partners and developing a plant to produce bagged intravenous fluids. The Healey foundation has been working with Christian churches and building on longstanding relationships in Sierra Leone since first becoming involved at the turn of the century.

The Healey family fortune, derived from a yacht-building business founded by Mr. Healey and his brother, as well as real estate and oil and gas interests, helps finance projects in some of the world’s poorest locales. “We take so much for granted here,” Mr. Healey said.

An infected cut can be fatal “out in the bush country,” he said. In the developed world, “you go down to the drugstore, you buy some Neosporin, you put it on your arm and it solves the problem,” he said. “Over there, they have nothing. I mean nothing.”

He is 85 years old, he says, and has provided for his wife, seven children and 11 grandchildren. But, he said, “How do you go to sleep at night when there are children in Sierra Leone who are dying?”

Another relief organization, International Medical Equipment Collaborative or IMEC, of North Andover, Mass., gathers surplus medical equipment and supplies for relief organizations working around the world. “I’m fairly confident this is what I was put on this earth to do,” said the group’s founder, Tom Keefe.

The group organizes “protective equipment suites” — surgical gowns, gloves, masks and more in the proper proportions — that can be loaded onto pallets and shipped out by truck, sized so that 20 can fit in a shipping container. These can then be delivered directly to hot spots, ready to use. Mr. Keefe has teamed with Mr. Lanning of International Relief and Development, an organization that handles shipping for groups like his.

Not every charitable organization working on the ground is fighting disease. Playing to Live is running a pilot program in Liberia for children orphaned by the disease, hoping to aid their recovery with art therapy and play. The project is headed by Alexis Decosimo, a doctoral student in East Tennessee State University’s College of Public Health, who says the therapy can “build resiliency and hope, and create a safe place to process trauma.”

But risk is ever-present. According to the latest report from Humanitarian Outcomes, an organization funded by U.S.A.I.D., 2013 set a record for violence against civilian aid workers, with 251 attacks that killed 155 people and wounded 171; 134 were kidnapped. According to the group, those figures for aid worker victims represent a 66 percent increase over 2012.

Groups try to stay as long as they can in difficult situations, Mr. Salloum of SIM said, but there is a point when it is time to go. “I was leading our team in South Sudan for the last year,” he said. “We were forced out of the country twice in the last year.” With battles that led to pro- and anti-government forces shelling and destroying towns, “we had to evacuate people who were in harm’s way.” Working with Samaritan’s Purse, they pulled out for a time, Mr. Salloum said.

Trevor Hughes, the director of risk management and global security for International Relief and Development, said a job like his was “more common than it used to be.” Not all groups or individuals in a conflict zone understand that a particular logo on a truck “means you’re not a part of the conflict, or whatever the situation is, and everybody loves you because you’re there to improve the situation.”

“Bad things happen and good people are targeted — directly targeted,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what color your skin is or what passport you hold.”

Groups like his constantly evaluate the level of risk. “There are some very clear principles” set by each group, he said, based on common ideas of how to evaluate risk that govern the time to pull up stakes. Ultimately, he said, the question comes down to, “What are we achieving here?”

Different missions will evaluate risk differently, he said. If something like a civil war breaks out, a group might suspend its childhood vaccine campaign. But if the group is running a war hospital, it is “literally saving dozens of lives, every hour of the day and night,” Mr. Hughes said. “That goes to the core of what they do.”

Many of those who work with Ebola patients and come back to the United States find themselves facing a different set of problems: the spreading hysteria over the disease and efforts to impose mandatory quarantines. Underlying these issues is fear of a disease that is still poorly understood, even by many professionals, Dr. Sacra said.

After surviving Ebola and being released from the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, he came down with a cough, a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and conjunctivitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/conjunctivitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] back home in Massachusetts. As he described it, “My immune system was tired and distracted from the recent hike up Mount Everest, and now the molehill is giving it a hard time.” He went to a hospital, expecting to be given antibiotics[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and sent on his way. Instead, “I got greeted with the moon suits and the whole deal,” even though the symptoms he described were not those of Ebola. Eventually, he got his antibiotics.

Dr. Sacra said that organizations like his were willing to comply with requests for a measure of quarantine after trips, but sought balance. Those in SIM generally follow guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by local health departments, but “we recognize that sometimes you have to make adjustments above and beyond what’s necessary legally, according to the rules, to relieve anxiety” in the community.

“We may go beyond to be a helpful part of the community,” he said.

Still, a measure of good sense and proportion is needed, he said: There are gradations of caution that do not go as far as forced isolation. “There’s all kinds of levels to this, and all sorts of nuance — and we’ve lost this,” he said.

“We’re willing to go above the minimum restrictions if we need to be good neighbors,” he said. “But if it starts making an impact on the actual purpose of the ministry — the program we’re trying to run — you have to balance.” Neighbors in American communities are important, he acknowledged, but “what about our neighbors in West Africa? They are equally important to us.”

What do these volunteers get out of their often-grueling experience? Kim Federici, a retired oncology-hematology nurse from a town outside San Antonio, said a big part of it was inspiration. She recently returned from working in Liberia with Doctors Without Borders.

She has made several trips for the group, to Armenia, Cambodia and other countries. She was asked to do “health promotion” in Liberia and worked to her limits, talking with people about how to avoid infection and working with a team of 20 local people. They went from town to town, teaching, going out with ambulances to pick up the sick and accompanying burial teams, trying to reduce panic with calm words and repeated explanations.

Even when things were at their worst, and families lost beloved relatives, “the ones who had the tears and the grief still celebrated the survival of the others,” she said. She recalled a painful conversation with a man in one town who lost seven members of his family. When she called him to tell him that his wife had died, he said, “I cannot bear this any longer,” and hung up the phone.

When she came back through the town on another day for the burial of one of his neighbors, “he came running out and he put his hands on the car,” she said. “He said, ‘How do I thank you?' ” She was stunned, but he explained: “Look. I have my daughter and my granddaughter.”

She said, “It really humbles you to be in that kind of a situation.”

Ms. Federici, now home again, said, “I was never clearer about how humanity looks to the light — when it is pressed to the ground, it looks to the light.”

Correction: November 10, 2014, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about volunteers who risk their health or lives to help people misidentified a country in which Kim Federici, a retired nurse from Texas, recently worked with Doctors Without Borders. It is Liberia, not Sierra Leone. The article also erroneously included one country among those in which Ms. Federici has worked with the aid group. She has not worked in Mexico.

Missionary work, while never risk-free, once provided something of a protective shield, but now such relief workers can be targets; those who go to disaster or conflict zones can endanger their lives, and those who go where Ebola is raging come home to face hysteria over a disease that is still poorly understood, even by many professionals.

New Donor Generation Stimulates U.S. Giving

CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave the federal Centers for Disease Control foundation $25 million to help combat the Ebola crisis last month, it served as a public service announcement of sorts.

Five years after the recession reshaped the global economy, charitable giving is back in a big way in the United States. What is more, a new generation of donors is meeting significant challenges with transformative gifts.

Mr. Zuckerberg has emerged as one of the most generous entrepreneurs of his generation, doling out eight- and nine-figure gifts to education, health and community development causes. And to a surprising degree, much of the country has followed in Mr. Zuckerberg's footsteps, even after the financial crisis.

Overall charitable giving in 2013 was up 3 percent from the previous year, the largest year-over-year increase since the recession, according to Giving USA and the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, which track contributions. Donations from individuals, companies, foundations and bequests topped $335 billion in 2013, approaching the peak from before the financial crisis. It was the fourth consecutive year of gains.

And while few are as wealthy as Facebook or its founder, the American people and the business community have largely shrugged off the financial crisis and resumed their charitable ways.

''It's really recovered,'' said Melissa Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. ''America has a long, long tradition of generosity.''

It wasn't always clear this would be the case. In the throes of the recession, giving plunged 15 percent, to $298 billion in 2009 from $350 billion in 2007, according to the Giving USA data, which is figured in constant, inflation-adjusted dollars.

Even then there was a silver lining. The country was poorer, meaning there was less to give, yet as a proportion of wealth generated, Americans appeared to maintain their generosity.

''Although total giving has predictably declined, we are still giving at high levels and at nearly the same proportion of total dollars as before,'' wrote Rob Reich and Christopher Wimer of Stanford University, in a 2012 paper examining the recession's impact on philanthropy.

But where those dollars were going ''changed pretty significantly,'' said Eileen R. Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust. Donations to organizations that fight homelessness and food banks spiked in 2008 and 2009, while giving to arts and education causes slumped.

''When there's a recession and high unemployment, people respond to those immediate needs,'' said Ms. Berman.

But as the direst days of the recession have passed, giving to different causes has returned to precrisis levels. ''As the recovery has persisted, people are moving back to the areas where they have traditionally given,'' said Dr. Patrick M. Rooney, associate dean of Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.

Giving to the arts and education has outpaced charity to hunger and homelessness causes in recent years. And when disasters strike, be it an earthquake in Haiti or a tsunami in Japan, Americans can generally be relied on to open their wallets.

Perhaps most surprising about giving since the recession is who has proved most generous. It turns out that poorer individuals give a greater percentage of their income, even during tough times. Though low-income Americans cut back on charitable giving the most during the recession, they tend to give a higher proportion of their wealth away than those in the middle and upper classes.

''It's remarkable how generous low-income Americans are,'' said Ms. Berman. ''Their giving dropped the most in the recession because they don't have as much expendable income, but they tend to give a higher proportion of their money away to charity.

''Folks that see so clearly how their lives can be upended by one thing -- a child that gets sick or a family member having a hard time -- have a sense of, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' ''

The richest individuals have also resumed their charitable ways. ''More high-net-worth households are giving, and they're giving more,'' said Mr. Rooney.

In recent months, a number of large gifts from billionaires have made headlines. In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's donation to fight Ebola, last month Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, gave $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. And last year, the billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross gave $200 million to the University of Michigan.

Today's youth, enabled by online giving and best exemplified by Mr. Zuckerberg, are also participating. ''The millennials are really committed to giving,'' said Ms. Heisman. ''This isn't just a baby boomer phenomenon.''

And companies, too, are gradually resuming their philanthropic initiatives, though progress is slow. Just 64 percent of companies increased total contributions from 2010 to 2013, according to a report by the CECP, in association with the Conference Board. And corporate giving, while up 10.8 percent since 2011, dropped 3.2 percent from 2012 to 2013, Giving USA says.

Yet despite this broad-based recovery in giving, the recession did set back philanthropy in America. The $335 billion in gifts last year remains below the precrisis high of $350 billion. ''It's been a pretty slow build-back,'' said Ms. Heisman.

The biggest drag is individual giving, which is down $21 billion from before the recession began, according to Mr. Rooney. Efforts like Giving Tuesday, a charitable take on the likes of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and new online sites like Donors Choose and Kickstarter, have failed to meaningfully bolster giving levels.

As a result, Americans still give away roughly 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product per year. That is higher than other countries and has largely recovered since the recession. But the proportion is not growing substantially.

''The 'glass half empty' view is that we're back to where we were about a decade ago,'' said Mr. Rooney. ''The 'glass half full' is that giving dropped during the Great Recession, but it didn't fall off the charts. There's a reason they call it the Great Recession.''

Correction: November 12, 2014, Wednesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about an increase in charitable giving omitted a source for a report that found that just 64 percent of companies had increased their total philanthropic contributions from 2010 to 2013. The report was done by CECP, in association with the Conference Board -- not by the Conference Board alone.

Australia’s Little Guantánamos

“Australia has temporarily closed its border to people from Ebola-affected West African nations,” reports [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australia-shuts-borders-to-ebolaaffected-countries-20141027-11ciut.html] Dan Harrison for The Sydney Morning Herald — an effort he says is meant to bolster the nation’s “defenses against the virus.”

The minister for immigration, Scott Morrison, reportedly told the Australian Parliament on Monday that the country had wholly suspended immigration from affected regions, “including its humanitarian intake,” Mr. Harrison writes. “Mr. Morrison added Australia was canceling or refusing non-permanent or temporary visas for people from Ebola-affected nations who had not departed for Australia. He said the government was ensuring that all people from Ebola-affected nations who had entered Australia through the humanitarian program before the suspension had undergone three separate health checks before their departure, and were being subject to on-arrival screening and post-arrival monitoring.”

This caps a string of criticisms levied against the conservative government of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, which is perceived by some as a largely anti-immigrant administration despite Australia’s global reputation as a pluralist society.

In another piece for The Sydney Morning Herald, the paper’s immigration correspondent, Sarah Whyte, highlights [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australia-needs-long-term-policy-to-handle-immigration-says-major-new-report-20141104-11gt9h.html] a new report which calls for a “long term policy to handle immigration.”

The report, “Beyond the Boats: Building an Asylum and Refugee Policy for the Long Term,” is “one of the most significant bipartisan documents about the government’s asylum seeker policy,” Ms. Whyte explains, citing growing numbers of displaced people coming to Australia in numbers “not seen since World War II.”

“Making nine recommendations, the report calls for the end of mandatory detention of asylum seekers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea,” Ms. Whyte writes, “for Australia to resettle at least 15 percent more refugees than is currently allocated; and for the militarization of Operation Sovereign Borders and the demonizing of people seeking protection to end.” (Operation Sovereign Borders, or O.S.B., is a contingency of the Australian Defense Force that aims to stanch the flow of refugees arriving on Australian shores by boat.)

Amanda Taub touches on [http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7138391/australia-racism-immigration-asylum] many of the same problems in an article for Vox. She digs into Australia’s fraught racial history, unearthing “what happens when you take a nation with a history of white supremacy and racial insecurity, paint on a superficial glaze of political correctness, and add politicians willing to exploit xenophobia for electoral gain.”

“Australia’s ‘boat people,’ immigrants who arrive in fishing vessels and makeshift boats, have been made scapegoats for the country’s racial and cultural anxieties,” she writes. “By demonizing asylum seekers as lawbreakers and terrorists, Australia’s politicians are able to use xenophobia as an effective wedge issue, while maintaining a politically correct veneer of support for multiculturalism on other issues.”

The most egregious manifestation of these anxieties is the aforementioned detention camps. As Ian Lloyd Neubauer explains [http://time.com/13682/australia-asylum-seeker-policy-compared-to-guantanamo/] in a March essay for Time: “In 1992, Australia introduced a mandatory detention policy for non-citizens entering the country without a valid visa. It was intended to be a risk-management tool, enabling the health and security status of refugees and illegal immigrants to be checked while preventing such arrivals from simply vanishing into the general population. While that sounds reasonable on paper, the reality is that there are today around 10,000 men, women and children detained indefinitely, without hope of release unless they agree to return to the countries they risked their lives to flee in the first place.”

They’ve been labeled Australia’s answer to Guantánamo Bay in Cuba [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/opinion/australias-guantanamo-problem.html]. But the crimes allegedly committed aren’t plots against national security — merely desperate attempts at a better life.

About half of new undocumented entrants to Australia are stowed away in detention centers that aren’t even within Australian borders. Two of the most infamous are in neighboring Papua New Guinea and on Nauru, an island nation in the South Pacific. These centers are “squalid,” Mr. Neubauer says, “breeding grounds for rape, rioting, malaria and mental illness, and that bear the look and feel of concentration camps.”

These centers are a dirty secret Canberra doesn’t want the world to know about. “Australian doctors are increasingly troubled by the treatment of children in offshore processing centers and the gag clauses that prevent them from talking about it, Australia’s human rights commissioner says,” according to a report for The Guardian [http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/06/mandatory-detention-children-abusive-australian-paediatricians] by Melissa Davey. “More than 80 percent of almost 150 pediatricians surveyed thought the mandatory detention of children was abusive,” she reports. And only after national and international outcry, the Australian federal government has announced it will launch an investigation of reports [http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/03/nauru-child-sex-abuse-allegations-new-inquiry] of “abuse and sexual misconduct of staff against children on Nauru.”

When Chris Iacono, a former Salvation Army volunteer, visited Manus Island, another detention center administered by the Australian government, he said “the men were held in small, gated compounds with padlocks and chains. It just felt like we were walking through a human zoo.” In an interview [http://www.vice.com/read/sent-to-nauru-with-no-training-and-no-answers---part-2] with Vice, Mr. Iacono recalled numerous detainees expressing suicidal thoughts and desires to self-harm. Vice reports some detained women are requesting abortions — an option they prefer to raising children within the confines of detention camps.

“Founding a nation out of British colonies in the South Pacific was never going to be racially uncomplicated,” Amanda Taub writes. “But Australia’s failure to reconcile its politics and its policy with its geography has left large numbers of people in perilous camps and legal limbo.” And while another former British colony across the Pacific has had to deal with similar postcolonial tensions, perhaps there are lessons there for Australia to embrace.

In March, “the American military announced the repatriation of an Algerian who had been held at Guantánamo without trial for 12 years,” writes [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/opinion/australias-guantanamo-problem.html] Ben Saul, a professor of international law at the University of Sydney, in an Op-Ed for The New York Times. “Last month, a United States federal appeals court ruled that the judiciary could hear complaints regarding conditions at the prison. If America is finally moving toward the more humane treatment of detainees, Australia should take note.”

W.H.O. Issues New Guidelines for Burying Ebola Victims

GENEVA — The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] released a new protocol[http://who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2014/ebola-burial-protocol/en/] Friday for the burial of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] victims in an effort to slow transmission of the disease and reinforce signs of progress in curbing the spread of the epidemic in West Africa.

Ebola victims are at their most infectious when they die, and traditional burial rites that bring family members into contact with the body of the deceased have caused 20 percent or more of new infections in the most affected countries, Pierre Formenty, one of the organization’s Ebola experts, told reporters in Geneva.

The protocol, set out in a 17-page guide[http://who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/safe-burial-protocol/en/], was prepared by the W.H.O. in consultation with medical agencies and faith-based organizations. It lays out ways of conducting burials that seek to satisfy the imperatives for safety and the cultural sensitivities of Muslims and Christians.

Health authorities have mobilized about 140 teams in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries most affected, that can conduct safe burials, the W.H.O. reported this week, around one-third of the number of teams it said is needed.

Health experts are trying to establish whether the international response to Ebola is finally starting to drive down the rates of transmission, at least in some areas.

In western Sierra Leone, about half of the Ebola victims who die are buried safely, and in the east of the country it was 80 percent, Mr. Formenty said.

More than 4,900 people have died of Ebola since December, all but a handful in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to figures released on Friday by the W.H.O. But in the past week, it reports, the number of new infections in Liberia has declined.

The increase in the number of teams conducting safe burials in Liberian is among the factors that the W.H.O. credits for the downturn in cases, along with more treatment centers and medical teams. In the Liberian capital, Monrovia, the time between death and burial of victims decreased from three days in August to less than 24 hours now, Dr. Formenty said.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which has taken the lead in managing safe burials, reported that it has conducted nearly 2,300 cremations and burials in Liberia, but only 909 in Sierra Leone, where the W.H.O. said this week the rate of transmission was still “very concerning.”

In Guinea, where Red Cross teams now handle the burials of all Ebola victims, the number of new infections appears to have slowed, but they have not yet started to decline, Dr. Formenty said. The data showed that safe burials alone would not bring down infection rates, underscoring the need for more treatment centers, more medical teams and more dialogue between the health authorities and communities.

The new protocol emphasized that burials needed to be safe, but also dignified, taking account of religious and cultural sensitivities to build trust in communities where some people have accused burial teams of spreading the disease.

Inviting the bereaved to be involved in digging the graves of deceased family members and offering Muslim families an alternative to ritual washing of the dead, a practice that could involve lethal exposure to the virus, “will make a significant difference in curbing Ebola transmission,” the W.H.O said.

A City Closes the Door on Its Ebola Scare

DALLAS — If there was a physical landmark of this city’s five-week Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] scare it was Apartment 614.

In this second-story unit in the Ivy Apartments, behind a dull-gray door, the man whom city officials had taken to calling Patient Zero — Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, the first person to die of Ebola in the United States — briefly stayed. The apartment was gutted and decontaminated, at a cost to Dallas County of about a quarter of a million dollars.

On Friday, a bare room was visible behind the balcony’s smudged sliding glass doors. Even the carpet was ripped out, leaving a concrete floor with a plastic fork, a $13.99 price tag for lingerie and little else. A woman from Malaysia who lives next door said in broken English that she felt safe. Another neighbor, Biak Bualhring, 24, from Burma, walked below the empty apartment and hardly glanced up.

“My pastor told me don’t worry too much,” she said. “Our family feels O.K.”

Dallas, like Ms. Bualhring, has moved on. The city, the first to grapple with the virus in the United States and the near panic and quarantines that it set off, reached the end of its Ebola ordeal Friday, as the last person being monitored for symptoms of the disease was cleared by officials.

That person — a hospital worker who handled medical waste on Oct. 17 — was part of the final group of people undergoing twice-daily checks in the Dallas region for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the disease.

The 16 people were all health care workers who had possible contact either with two nurses infected with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, with their bodily fluids or with potentially contaminated surfaces or medical waste. Fifteen in that group were cleared Thursday, and the last person was scheduled to be cleared Friday evening. The last person was not identified by officials, but was considered to be at low risk. More than 40 others who had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan were taken off the monitoring list in late October.

A total of 177 people were monitored in the Dallas region, with only three cases of Ebola confirmed, in Mr. Duncan and in two nurses who treated him, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson. “Thanksgiving came early for Dallas, because we have a lot to be thankful for,” said Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive. “It’s a joyous day. This outbreak that began with Eric Duncan is over for Dallas.”

County officials estimated the Ebola-related price tag here at nearly $1 million, not including money spent by the city, state and federal government.  

To mark the end of the monitoring period here, on Friday, former President George W. Bush, who lives in Dallas, visited Presbyterian hospital and greeted nurses and doctors, including Ms. Vinson. And President Obama spoke via a conference call on Friday afternoon with Judge Jenkins, Gov. Rick Perry, Mayor Mike Rawlings and the state health commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, praising their leadership.

Thomas W. Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the end of monitoring in the Dallas area “shows that the fast isolation of people sick with Ebola and good contact tracing can prevent the spread of this disease.”

“But we need to be careful of declaring anything over, because the epidemic continues in West Africa,” Mr. Skinner said. “We want health care workers and hospitals around the country to keep thinking Ebola and to prepare for the possibility of more cases arriving in the United States.”

Obama and Congressional Leaders Discuss How to Move on Immigration

WASHINGTON — Speaker John A. Boehner[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_a_boehner/index.html?inline=nyt-per] warned President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] in person Friday that taking unilateral action to ease deportation of undocumented immigrants would rupture relations with the new Republican majority and would kill efforts to overhaul immigration policy as congressional leaders gathered at the White House for the first time since Tuesday’s elections.

At a session that also touched on efforts to fight Islamic terrorists and halt the spread of Ebola, Mr. Boehner tried to assure Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders that Republicans intended to pursue immigration law changes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/politics/immigration-bill-hinges-on-new-obama-attitude-boehner-says.html] next year. But, despite prompting by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Boehner would say only that it would take months to make progress, according to accounts of the meeting provided by multiple people familiar with what took place.

The mostly cordial session over a lunch of herb-crusted sea bass and pumpkin tarts was held in advance of a lame-duck session of Congress scheduled to begin next Wednesday, and the lawmakers each left with a six-pack of White House beer[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/dining/reviews/a-white-house-beer-we-can-believe-in.html]. But, Mr. Obama’s vow to take action on immigration is certain to hang over the return of lawmakers after an election that saw Republicans grab control of the Senate and increase their House majority as of January.

While it was not discussed at the White House session, Senate Democrats have begun weighing whether to allow Republicans a vote on their proposal to block any executive action by the president — a plan that Democrats believe they can defeat on the floor.

During the meeting with 13 House and Senate leaders, officials said, the president pushed back against Mr. Boehner, saying Mr. Obama had legitimate authority to act on his own as other presidents have. He was backed in that argument by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.

“The president has the authority to act by executive order on immigration,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters after the session. “It’s in the law, but it’s also in the precedent of other presidents, whether it’s President Eisenhower, Kennedy, both Bushes, President Reagan — it just goes on and on.”

The meeting also included a briefing by Pentagon officials on efforts to combat the Islamic State militant group. Mr. Obama told congressional leaders that he intended to work with them on a new authorization to use force against the group, most likely in the new Congress. Aides to Mr. Boehner said the speaker welcomed that decision and reminded the president that, historically, the White House has drafted the resolution, sent it to Capitol Hill and help push its passage. Mr. Boehner said Republicans would help with its approval.

The White House, on a day when administration officials were trumpeting the ninth straight month of more than 200,000 additional jobs, said the president urged congressional leaders “to pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year in the same bipartisan, drama-free way they did earlier this year because there is no reason to create uncertainty for businesses that are putting Americans back to work.”

The offices of Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and current majority leader, and Mr. Boehner have been conferring over a lame-duck agenda, with both parties trying to game out what would be to their advantage to dispose of before Republicans take over the Senate and what they can afford to push into 2015.

Leaders of both parties would like to fund the government through Sept. 30 and eliminate any talk of a shutdown for now. Members of the Appropriations Committees favor doing it through a package of new spending bills rather than just funding agencies at current levels. Passing the new bills in a so-called omnibus allows lawmakers to reset agency priorities, but House Republicans have balked in the past at passing such big packages and the leadership may have to settle for a simple extension.

They also have expressed growing interest in trying to pass legislation overhauling the National Security Agency’s once-secret program that is systematically collecting records about Americans’ phone calls. The legal basis for the current call records program, Section 215 of the Patriot Act[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/usa_patriot_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], will expire in June 2015 without new action.

But because surveillance issues can scramble the usual partisan lines — splitting libertarian conservatives from national security hawks, for instance — it may be in the Republicans’ interest to get the bill out of the way before they assume control of the Senate, avoiding internal discord.

The House of Representatives in May passed a version of the bill, called the U.S.A. Freedom Act[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/us/politics/house-votes-to-limit-nsas-collection-of-phone-data.html], but the Senate has not yet taken up its version, sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee. In September, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, endorsed Mr. Leahy’s bill. It also has support from Silicon Valley as well as from the conservative Republican Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas.

The central element of Mr. Leahy’s bill[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/us/politics/senators-bill-is-stricter-on-nsa-than-houses.html] would get the N.S.A. out of the business of collecting bulk domestic phone records, which it uses to analyze links between people in hope of identifying previously unknown associates of terrorism suspects. Instead, the records would stay in the hands of phone companies, and a new kind of judicial order would permit the government to swiftly obtain calling records of a suspect, along with those of callers up to two links away, even if different companies hold them.

Senate officials are also in negotiations over possible approval of select judicial, executive branch and ambassadorial nominations.

Congressional leaders also want to approve a renewal of the terrorism-risk insurance program and extend a series of business and energy tax breaks, making some of them permanent.

To China, Shift in Obama’s Political Fortunes Outweighs the Economic One
By MARK LANDLER

WASHINGTON — The last time President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] went to China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], five years ago, he was a political supernova from a nation with a depleted, debt-ridden economy. When he returns to Beijing on Monday, he will be a political casualty from a country with a resurgent economy.

White House officials hope the later distinction will outweigh the earlier one when Mr. Obama meets with President Xi Jinping[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html?inline=nyt-per] before traveling on to Myanmar and Australia. But they are likely to be disappointed: China, analysts say, is likely to dwell more on Mr. Obama’s electoral reversals than on the comparatively robust American recovery.

“Politics trumps economics, at the end of the day,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

That is not to understate the shift in economic fortunes between China and the United States since 2009. At that time, in the depths of the financial crisis, visiting Americans were lectured by Chinese officials about the need for the United States to put its fiscal house in order. Now, Mr. Obama has cut the deficit in half while the Chinese economy is the one slowing sharply, weighed down by a sea of bad loans.

But Mr. Lardy said the Chinese economy was not as troubled as some in Washington believe. The government, he said, was orchestrating a slowdown in growth to squeeze out excesses in housing and other markets — a difficult process that he said Beijing was managing fairly well.

Mr. Obama, meanwhile, has been preoccupied by other crises, from the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak to the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Republican takeover of the Senate has added to doubts that the president will have either the time or the political influence to push forward his much-promoted strategic pivot to Asia.

China’s state media has been unforgiving about Mr. Obama’s political travails. “Obama always utters ‘Yes, we can,’ which led to the high expectations people had for him,” said The Global Times, an English-language website affiliated with the People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, in a postelection editorial. “But he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters. U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.”

The timing of the editorial, just a few days before Mr. Obama’s arrival in Beijing, was unusual. But it reflects a broader nationalist strain in China, embodied by Mr. Xi, who has consolidated his power and displayed few signs of conciliation toward Mr. Obama on thorny issues like Chinese cyberattacks on American companies.

Mr. Obama’s best bet to counter doubts about his standing, analysts said, will be to move quickly on projects that reinforce America’s presence in the region, like a proposed trade deal, and in areas where China and the United States can work together, like climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

“It’s a matter of, in part, communicating through your body language, through your ambitions, and through what you commit to,“ said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution. “That’s an important part of what he’ll do, but I certainly think that the election does not help him in that.”

One of the areas where a Republican-controlled Congress might actually help rather than hinder Mr. Obama is in passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious trade pact involving 12 countries that is a centerpiece of the president’s pivot to Asia.

Negotiations for a deal have bogged down in the last year, in part because Japan and other Asian countries are reluctant to make big concessions without knowing whether Mr. Obama will have “fast-track” authority to pass a treaty in Congress. The White House held off asking for such authority before the midterm elections, at the request of Democrats.

Now, though, a free-trade-friendly Congress is more likely to grant Mr. Obama fast-track authority. That could give the administration a genuine window to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2015 before the next presidential election . While in Beijing, Mr. Obama is expected to meet with leaders of the countries involved in the negotiation. They will be there for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, an annual meeting of Pacific Rim countries being held in China.

The United States trade representative, Michael B. Froman, has played down expectations for any breakthrough in Beijing. And China, which has not been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, will be watching the American efforts with some skepticism.

Still, Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama could find common ground on climate change. As the world’s two largest carbon emitters, China and the United States are trying to develop a common position on new targets for emissions reductions in advance of climate talks in Paris next year. The thinking is that they could then pull the rest of the world into a treaty.

While the Chinese may view Mr. Obama as a diminished figure, analysts say they are well aware that his successor — whether Hillary Rodham Clinton or a Republican — could end up taking a tougher line toward China. That means they will keep looking for ways to work with him.

Administration officials reject the contention that Mr. Obama’s focus on Asia has been impeded by events elsewhere in the world. Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, noted that it was his second visit to the region this year — a “substantial investment of time and attention,” she said, given “all the issues that we are all facing.”

On the eve of the trip, the White House got good news from unlikely sources: Japan and China, which agreed to set aside a longstanding dispute over islands in the East China Sea. The United States has fretted about being drawn into an increasingly dangerous confrontation.

“The tensions between Japan and China have been overshadowing the whole region, and the relationship between the United States and China,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama. “When relations between China and its neighbors are stable, that helps us.”

Treating Ebola Without Fear

Observing my patient through the chicken wire, I saw that the front half of his scalp was shaved — and the long gray hairs behind that equator were gathered in a kudumi, or knot. He was a temple priest. All these years later I can still see that tuft and the three broad white stripes of vibhuti, or holy ash, smeared across his forehead, proclaiming his Shaivite faith, a reminder that the world was all maya — illusion. But his discomfort was real. In my recollection, he sits cross-legged on his mat in that locked room, groaning, restless, his trunk swaying, his features anxious, grimacing as if he’d tasted something bitter.

Anywhere else in the hospital, you would stumble over relatives congregated around a tiffin carrier of food or patients catching the breeze on a veranda. But here it was just me and the seasoned orderly who ran the ward. All that chaos and cacophony of Government General Hospital in Madras, India, was mysteriously kept at bay; even the crows didn’t venture close. The orderly assured me that this was classic rabies: The patient had asked for his cup and plate to be removed from his room. He had symptoms of hydrophobia — the sight of water, the thought of swallowing, caused excruciating throat spasms.

The rabies ward was just two rooms in a small building set apart from the massive hospital complex. It looked like a larder, with its padlocked door and its windows screened with chicken wire, but effectively it was a jail. I had seen it often from afar but never had a patient there until I was summoned that night. As I walked through the maze of corridors, I was frightened. What, I wondered, if my patient was foaming at the mouth? What if he attacked or bit me in the “furious” stage? This was 1980, before the era of Hazmat suits and the like. At best, had I been thinking ahead, I might have brought gloves.

But then, strangely, in the presence of a human being in distress, all those fears vanished. Inside the room I found a patient as upset by his confinement as by his symptoms. “I just came for some help. Why did they bring me here?” Did he want something to drink, I asked. He waved away that idea quickly. He was spitting, drooling, too scared to try swallowing his own saliva.

I can’t recall what it was I injected. Thorazine, I am guessing. Or was it Valium? Those were the two palliatives we cycled between most frequently. (Rabies is typically fatal once the virus takes hold.) I felt terribly sorry for this man who was old enough to be my father. Squatting by his mat, I was ashamed of my earlier fear and hesitation. I was glad to spend some time with him. By the next morning he was comatose and convulsing. By nightfall, he’d transcended the mortal world.

In hindsight, I realize that contagion was all around me that year. Just living in the third-floor house-officers’ quarters above the hospital presented risks; that part of town was endemic for filariasis and malaria, and I’d contracted both. Tuberculosis was a possible diagnosis in every patient with a cough. A fellow medical student and I scoured the respiratory wards after hours, applying our stethoscope to so many wicker-basket chests, trying to sharpen our skills, seeking out “cavernous” or “amphoric” breathing. (Imagine someone blowing over the mouth of a large flask.) To hear that was to strike diagnostic gold: It spoke of a cavity in the lung caused by tuberculosis. We must have theoretically understood that such cavities were highly infectious, teeming with millions of tuberculosis bacteria so that every cough was laden with them, but I don’t recall worrying about it. I knew of several doctors who contracted hepatitis B through a needle stick. A rash you touched might be highly infectious — secondary syphilis or a case of scabies. Why had I been so fearful of rabies, given all the other diseases that lurked close at hand?

A couple of years later, in July 1983, I was pursuing specialty training in infectious diseases at Boston City Hospital, and I saw a patient with a new syndrome called AIDS. The cause was unknown. I was scared and, yes, excited that I was at the front line. My fear was superseded by an impulse to take on a disease that others were happy to sidestep. The fact that AIDS first manifested in intravenous-drug users, gay men and blood-transfusion recipients suggested it spread very much like hepatitis B: through blood and body fluids, not casual contact. Nevertheless, many medical professionals in those early years, even the occasional senior physician, covered up with masks, gowns and gloves. I tried to set an example, feeling for lymph nodes in sweaty armpits with my bare fingers, just as I might with any other patient. Still, I wondered if my newfound zeal in caring for patients who were ostracized might be foolhardy, putting me at risk. I would come to know two physicians and a nurse who contracted H.I.V. after exposure to infected blood.

Now we are faced with Ebola, and once again the impulse to shun the disease and the impulse to help its victims arise together. I have the urge to sign up, to head to Liberia or Sierra Leone; the call for doctors seems personally addressed to me. When I tell my mother, who is in her 90s, that I am thinking of volunteering in West Africa, she clutches my hand and says: “Oh, no, no, no. Don’t go!” I’m secretly pleased. Perhaps I want her to forbid me to go. In the evenings when I visit my parents, we watch the news as the Ebola story sputters, catches fire, sputters . . . and then it lands on our shores, in Dallas! And a doctor who served, stirred by the same impulse brewing in me, returns to New York infected with the virus. “See?” the devil on my left shoulder says. “You don’t have to go anywhere. It’ll come to you.” I am disturbed. Sleepless. Bothered. Have I lost my altruistic impulses, or is it that naïve innocence has been supplanted by wise caution?

We doctors feel the pull. But each of us has reasons to stay back, reasons that get bigger as we age: children, partners, parents, grants. The yellow medical armor may not suffice, even when donned on our shores in the best facilities. And the possibility now exists of quarantine when we return — no “Welcome back, our hero” signs at the airport, but straight to house arrest. Employers are gently pointing out that if we choose to volunteer, that is admirable, but we’re effectively on our own, not covered by our health insurance. If we fall sick in Africa, there is no guarantee of being evacuated, no promise that even our bodies would be flown back. I fear that volunteers who get any fever out there will be quarantined with others who might be infected, waiting on the test. And if it is Ebola, they will be moved to the infected tent — no I.C.U., just confinement. From there, who knows.

The impulse to serve must now compete with the public perception of recklessness and irresponsibility. But dozens of doctors have come back safely, and if the outbreak is indeed being contained, it is their service, along with that of so many others, that has made the difference. Still, a strategy that punishes those putting themselves at risk, rather than rewarding them, is flawed. It’s hard to imagine Americans regarding our other defenders, the military, in this way.

Diseases are now global almost as soon as they are local, and efforts to control the disease must be global, too. That effort puts medical personnel at risk for dying and, yes, possibly even spreading the thing they set out to conquer. But Ebola would have come to our shores anyway. The world is listing, gently, toward where you sit — privileged, at least for now, to read these words in peace with your morning coffee and bagel.

Abraham Verghese is the Linda R. Meier and Joan F. Lane Provostial Professor at Stanford University. He is the author of “Cutting for Stone.”

THE LAUGHING MONSTERS

By Denis Johnson

228 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.

On the plane I was reading this book.

“Do you like Denis Johnson?” the woman beside me asked.

“Yes,” I said.

“I’ve always felt he doesn’t like his characters very much,” she said.

“O.K.,” I said.

She had gone to a writing program, had graduated from a writing program but no longer wrote, possibly because her characters’ demand for respect and compassion became too onerous. She had become an acupuncturist and had a child. Now she and the child were coming back from Cabo San Lucas, where she had attended some sort of acupuncture conference, I think. That part was a little vague, but we didn’t talk much after the child spilled juice all over us. The book, “The Laughing Monsters,” was untouched however, immune to our discomfort — as were its characters, who were experiencing far more severe discomfort in an unpleasant and unenchanting Africa. The Laughing Monsters are some hills in the Democratic Republic of Congo, so named by a missionary before he was murdered, but they might just as well refer to the characters, the scammers and rogue spies Nair and Adriko.

Nair (an inspired name, close as it is to “nadir,” which as we know is the lowest point of, well, anything) is a black-haired Danish-American working for NATO Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, or N.I.I.A., and why not. Michael Adriko is a large, merry, lethal-looking African who is on his fifth fiancée, the beautiful if clueless Davidia, a Colorado girl who happens to be the daughter of the camp commander for the United States 10th Special Forces Group from which Michael is currently AWOL — or, as he prefers to say, “detached.”

Nair and Adriko have played here many years before, during the civil war, making some money, having some fun. Nair particularly relishes the mess that is Africa. The anarchy and madness. The things falling apart. He even likes the lobbies and rooms of the hotels with their distinctive chemical odor that says: “All that you fear, we have killed.”

Ostensibly, Nair has come in an N.I.I.A. capacity to check up on Adriko, who has been indiscreetly suggesting access to a crashed planeload of enriched uranium, but he’s also here because his friend has summoned him — to attend the wedding to Davidia in his childhood village of New Water Mountain with the blessing of his people. The real plan, however, is for both men to become rich in the world that 9/11 has brought to full term. Excitement and opportunity now reside only in the arenas of information, be it false or true, regarding security and defense.

“The world powers are dumping their coffers into an expanded version of the old Great Game,” Nair informs Davidia. “The money’s simply without limit, and plenty of it goes for snitching and spying. In that field, there’s no recession.” While Adriko crows: “Oh my goodness, Nair, you just tickle them in their terrorism bone, and they ejaculate all kinds of money.” (The hundred grand that Nair picks up selling the location of the United States military’s fiber optic cables is chump change.)

Poor Davidia. She thinks she’s going to have a lovely, unique wedding in the jungle to her man. But where, she wonders, is the jungle exactly?

“The people cut it all down,” Nair says. “They burned it to cook breakfast, mostly.”

En route to the fantasized nuptials in a stolen Land Cruiser, Adriko plows over a woman bringing a basin of harvested termites to market. His unconcern disillusions Davidia somewhat, and it soon becomes obvious she’s not cut out for further adventures after circumstances in the bloody board game that is Africa devolve into shooting, pillaging, imprisonment and interrogation. She’s taken out of the picture by Daddy in a helicopter while the men find their way to New Water Mountain separately and quite the worse for wear.

The village is not a happy one. The animals and most of the children are dead, the land and water toxic because of the extraction of gold and hydrocarbons. A grotesque “queen,” La Dolce, rules and harangues the demented residents (who have “the puffy look of corpses floating in formalin”) from a giant leafless tree. She’s fat and laughing with “a buzz-cut Afro on her hippopotamus head, eyes leaping from the sockets and eyelids like birds’ beaks closing over them — her mouth is tiny and round, but it opens to shocking hugeness, displaying many square white teeth.” A couple of Seventh Day Adventists are present in this pit of gruesome, but even they’ve become fed up. One describes the scene as “the outworking of a spiritual travesty,” but adds: “After a while, everything’s funny.”

Not much more comes of this. The village is left to its doom, Adriko and Nair hitch a ride out with the Adventurists (“We’ve crawled from the wreck, we’ve walked away,” Nair muses), and, after freshening up, begin to consider where to try next. Abidjan? Maybe Liberia. (“Much is possible there.”) Uganda, Ghana, Senegal. . . . “There’s always Cameroon.”

One doesn’t feel warmly toward these buccaneers. They’re comedians, irredeemable. This is the world after 9/11 (many lifetimes past, now) with its new equations, fluid alliances and casuistries. To the question here, “Are you any kind of believer?,” the only answer can be no.

Denis Johnson is closest in sensibility to the great Robert Stone, though he lacks that writer’s command of plot and structure. Yet we don’t read Johnson for methodology but for troubled effect and bright astonishments. A writer should write in such a way that nobody can be ignorant of the world and that nobody may say that he is innocent of what it is all about. Sartre says this, more or less, in “What Is Literature?” Johnson writes in just such a way. Life is ludicrous and full of cruel and selfish distractions. Honor is elusive and many find the copious ingestion of drugs necessary. Our ignorance is infinite and our sorrows fearful. We have made an unutterable waste of this world, and our passage through it is bitter and unheroic. Still, the horror can at times be illuminating, and it is necessary that the impossible be addressed. Here is the hapless murderer Bill Houston at the end of Johnson’s first novel, “Angels,” strapped down in the gas chamber, listening to the sound of his heart:

“Boom. . . . Boom! Was there ever anything as pretty as that one? Another coming . . . boom! Beautiful! They just don’t come any better than that. He was in the middle of taking the last breath of his life before he realized he was taking it. But it was all right. Boom! Unbelievable! And another coming? How many of these things do you mean to give away? He got right in the dark between heartbeats, and rested there. And then he saw that another one wasn’t going to come.”

Writing, like old age and Wyoming, is not for sissies.

Johnson was born in Munich, and his childhood was peripatetic. “Every move meant a chance to reinvent myself,” he’s said. His books take that same opportunity. This is his ninth novel. Others include the best-rendered post-nuke Florida Keys dystopia ever (“Fiskadoro”), the big and boldly retro Vietnam novel “Tree of Smoke” and the curiously hypnotic academic novel “The Name of the World.” There’s also the elegant and gloomy Americana novella “Train Dreams,” and lesser merely impressive and enjoyable entertainments, sly riffs on our orphanhood, our muddled dreams, our historical tininess, our moral wobbliness. He’s also written poetry, some plays, a single collection of short stories — the perversely divine “Jesus’ Son” — and a solid collection of political and travel essays, “Seek.” He probably plays the cello too.

“The Laughing Monsters” is a minor work — there’s no rocketing prose or conceptual jumping of lanes. Cheerfully nihilistic, it’s a buddy book dependent for much of its situation on several of Johnson’s early journalistic pieces about Liberia and Charles Taylor and the “atmosphere of happy horror” pervasive at the time. The whores and martinis and low-rent espionage seem no more than familiarly nostalgic, as does a time pre-Ebola. Africa is a hard land and it’s getting even harder.

In Johnson’s earlier novel “The Stars at Noon,” set in Nicaragua, a druggie prostitute is known as Mona Lisa because of her secretive beautiful smile that says: “It’s over — why are we still here?”

What a question! Prescient as ever, even as it all is over faster and faster and we still appear to be here. The critic Walter Benjamin speaks of the Klee painting “Angelus Novus,” from which he derives the concept of “the angel of history.” A stupendous storm propels the angel into the future to which his back is turned, the wreckage of the past growing and growing before him. Whereas we perceive merely a chain of events, the angel sees “one single catastrophe.”

The single catastrophe is what fuels the demands and mysteries of literature. The wreckage is what essential writers particularize, and Denis Johnson’s interests have always been in wreckage, both individual and universal. If “Train Dreams” (a Pulitzer finalist) dealt with the dignified tragedy of a past American anonym, “The Laughing Monsters” addresses the vanishing present, a giddy trickle-down of global exploitation and hubris — the farcical exploits of cold dudes in a hard land.

DAVID Gonzalez approached the South Bronx street-corner preacher and said he was from The New York Times.

“He had just been shouting fire, brimstone and eternal damnation,” recalled Mr. Gonzalez, at that time, in 1991, the Bronx bureau chief. But when the preacher heard the Times affiliation, his face brightened. “He told me that he really liked our opera coverage.”

It was a lesson in not making assumptions about just who reads The Times — a topic that I often hear about from readers who are frustrated by what they describe as elitism in the paper’s worldview, and who would like The Times and its staff to remember that the median household income[http://www.census.gov.proxy.bc.edu/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf] in the United States is close to $52,000 a year, and that about 15 percent of Americans live in poverty.

It’s not hard to see why they feel that way. The featured apartments with their $10 million price tags[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/realestate/new-yorks-multimillion-dollar-condo-market-booms.html] and white-glove amenities seem aimed at hedge fund managers, if not Russian oligarchs. The stories on doughnuts at $20 a half dozen[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/dining/doughnuts-in-new-york-city-from-carpe-donut-nyc-to-pies-n-thighs.html] are for those who are flush with disposable income, not struggling to pay the rent. Many of the parties, the fashions, even the gadgets are well beyond the reach of the middle class.

It’s no secret that The Times often is intended to appeal to its many affluent readers and, at least sometimes, the advertisers who want to reach them. (Consider the ad-heavy special section produced twice a year and called, simply, “Wealth.”[http://www.nytimes.com/business/businessspecial3/])

Claudia Griffiths, a reader in Maine, put it this way: “$160 flashlight and $219 level[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/garden/home-repair-tools-for-basic-tasks.html]? Do the one percent of the one percent need your home-tool shopping help? Hello. Could the Times editors consider for WHOM they are actually writing? Here, not most Americans.”

Irene Lin of Washington, D.C., wrote that The Times “caters to upper-middle-class white cosmopolitan elites while being profoundly out of touch culturally and politically with most of America.”

So who is The Times written for — the superwealthy, or for citizens of all income levels? Is the paper trying, in the axiom about journalism’s mission, to “afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted”? Or is it plumping the Hungarian goose-down pillows of the already quite cozy?

I asked the executive editor, Dean Baquet, whom he has in mind when he directs coverage and priorities.

“I think of The Times reader as very well-educated, worldly and likely affluent,” he said. “But I think we have as many college professors as Wall Street bankers.”

On the question of all that high-end[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/fashion/for-luxury-watch-buyers-one-just-isnt-enough.html] content, he called it “one of the bigger tensions” in The Times’s big picture. The paper has become expensive to subscribe to, and it is supported financially by advertisers who want to reach a high-earning readership, but “you don’t want to become an elitist news operation.” And it’s not just The Times that pitches to the rich, he said, noting that The Wall Street Journal’s real estate section is called “Mansion[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/public/page/real-estate-luxury.html].”

Mr. Baquet said that stories about $56 million apartments[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/realestate/56-million-for-prime-new-york-city-views.html] and parents who buy houses[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/garden/leaving-home-but-not-the-folks.html] near their children’s boarding schools are a legitimate part of the mix. But there are also stories about people struggling to get by, he noted. “You have to look at the whole of the report — and that is not elitist,” he said. “Are there parts of the paper aimed at an affluent audience? Yes, and that’s O.K., because it’s balanced out.”

Last year, I wrote a column[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/public-editor/those-in-poverty-go-wanting-even-in-the-times.html] about The Times’s coverage of poverty, observing that the quality of that coverage was often excellent but pushing for it to be more consistent and more plentiful. (Pew researchers have found[http://niemanreports.org/articles/it-cant-happen-here-2/] that fewer than 1 percent of front-page newspaper stories, including those in The Times, dealt with poverty.)

Greg Kaufmann, the editor of TalkPoverty.org[http://talkpoverty.org/] at the Center for American Progress, wrote to me recently to praise what he sees as The Times’s improved “commitment to covering poverty, inequality, and particularly the struggles of low-wage workers.” He praised stories on the proposed dismantling[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/nyregion/de-blasios-plan-to-eliminate-workfare-lifts-hopes-for-job-seekers.html] of the city’s workfare program and the comparatively high pay[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/business/international/living-wages-served-in-denmark-fast-food-restaurants.html] of fast-food workers in Denmark.

But he remains troubled by “articles tailored to the interests of the economic elite that really don’t do much for the rest of us.”

Here’s how I see it: There’s nothing inherently wrong with covering these subjects. And certainly The Times should cover haute cuisine, haute couture and all the other hautes. Not only do they often have news value but it also can’t be denied that the advertising revenue these articles help generate allows The Times to do the hard-hitting, expensive-to-produce journalism that is at the core of its mission. Many other news organizations can’t do these stories, in some cases because they can’t afford it.

But sometimes the tone and the emphasis and the mix are off, failing to acknowledge that this audience is a tiny slice of the American (not to mention global) economic pie. Self-awareness on the part of The Times — the mocking Twitterreaction[https://twitter.com/susanorlean/status/527889282564759552] to a headline about “artisanal parenting[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/garden/the-wire-actress-long-retired-is-back-in-a-film-about-herself.html]“ comes to mind — and, yes, empathy, are sometimes missing in action. I was struck by a phrase of Mr. Gonzalez (whose background is, he said, “blue-collar, Puerto Rican, Catholic and South Bronx”): He tries to write about those who have less while keeping their “dignity intact.”

As Ginia Bellafante, who writes a column[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/newyorkandregion/columns/big_city/index.html] about life and policy in New York City — often about the poor and middle class — told me, “We can’t assume that every reference to a shoe, a store, a restaurant” is globally appreciated. At the same time, she said, The Times can’t ignore an important part of its audience: “Every affluent person in New York and every big city and its fancy suburbs reads The Times and they always have.”

What she tries to do in her column is broaden the perspective of those who “can be closed off to the experience of New York City beyond their immediate experience.”

In the end, the upscale doughnut and the penthouse apartment — lofty as they may be — have nothing to do with The Times’s highest purpose.

A Changed China Awaits Mr. Obama
By NICHOLAS KRISTOF

Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
PRESIDENT OBAMA hasn’t even begun his state visit to China and he has already been mocked.

“U.S. public opinion has downgraded Obama,” a state-run Chinese newspaper, Global Times, editorialized about Tuesday’s election[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/890056.shtml]. “He has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters. U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.”

What a welcome! Global Times is often shrill, but that tone reflects the way President Xi Jinping is tugging his regime in a more nationalistic, assertive and hard-line direction.

The regime also gave a cold shoulder in September to former President Jimmy Carter, initially trying to block Chinese universities from hosting him. Xi and his No. 2 both declined to meet Carter — even though Carter is the one who established U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations[http://www.nybooks.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/archives/2014/oct/23/china-strikes-back/] in 1979.

Then there’s something a bit more personal: China doesn’t seem to want to give me a visa.

I’ve been visiting China for more than 30 years and lived in Beijing for five. I speak Mandarin and have been alternately hailed by Chinese authorities and detained by them. But I’ve had cordial relations with the last few foreign ministers, and, until now, I’ve always received visas.

The Chinese leadership is blocking some visas for New York Times employees because it is upset by Times coverage of profiteering by families of senior officials. It was particularly irritated by Times articles[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html] showing that relatives of the former prime minister had amassed $2.7 billion.

Xi has been ruling China for two years now, and he has shown some inclination toward economic and legal reforms. Two years ago, I thought Xi might open things up a bit. Boy, was I wrong! Instead, it increasingly seems that Xi may deepen reforms in some areas but, over all, is a tough-minded nationalist who takes a hard line on multiple fronts so as to challenge nearly everything that Obama stands for:

•• In the East China and South China Seas, Xi has taken an aggressive approach to maritime disputes. There may be a thaw[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/world/asia/china-japan-reach-accord-on-disputed-islands-senkaku-diaoyu.html], but risk remains of military accidents, escalation and even war.

•• At home, he has overseen harsh repression of dissidents; activists who once were tolerated are now imprisoned. The brave lawyer Xu Zhiyong was this year sentenced to four years in prison[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/world/asia/china-sentences-xu-zhiyong-to-4-years-for-role-in-protests.html], and China not only imprisons the Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo but also torments his wife, Liu Xia[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/15/liu-xiaobo-china-nobel-prize-prison-wife-liu-xia-mistreat], with extrajudicial house arrest.

•• The government has tightened controls on the Internet, blocking not only nytimes.com[http://nytimes.com] but also Facebook and YouTube — and making it hard to use[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/business/international/china-clamps-down-on-web-pinching-companies-like-google.html] Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar.

Deng Xiaoping accepted technologies that brought political risks because they would help the economy, but Xi seems willing to sacrifice business convenience for more rigid political control.

Xi comes across as cocky and proud that China is now booming and strong, and he has been willing to poke his finger in the American eye. In 2009, he derided “well-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than lecture us about our own affairs.”

All this creates a challenge for Obama. The United States doesn’t have many China experts in senior roles, and neither in Beijing nor Washington are many officials fighting for an improved relationship. Meanwhile, the two sides are battling behind the scenes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/world/us-tries-candor-to-assure-china-on-cyberattacks.html] over Chinese cyberwarfare against American targets.

When Obama first traveled to Beijing in 2009, his efforts at conciliation were perceived as signs of weakness, and China then overplayed its hand, Washington responded and relations suffered.

The world needs China to step up and play a constructive role (an excellent example is China’s plan to build an Ebola hospital in Liberia[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/11/06/china_ebola_hospital_liberia_100_bed_center_announced.html]), especially on climate change. But Xi’s vision of the China-U.S. relationship is that America keeps mum about Chinese abuses and irresponsible behavior.

When Xi traveled to Tanzania last year, members of his delegation bought thousands of pounds of illegal, poached ivory from slaughtered elephants, according to a report this month by the Environmental Investigation Agency[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/chinese-presidents-delegation-tied-to-illegal-ivory-purchases-during-africa-visit/]. These purchases were so huge that the price of ivory doubled on the black market, the group said. This stockpile of illegal ivory was then smuggled to Beijing by diplomatic pouch on the president’s official plane, the agency said.

Chinese officials vociferously denied the report, but the episode is a reminder how much China increasingly matters worldwide, for good or for ill. From the global economy to the survival of elephants to carbon emissions, China today affects almost everything everywhere.

So for those of us who love the Middle Kingdom, it’s sad to see it veer toward a nationalistic and repressive line under Xi. Obama won’t be able to change China, but he has too often signaled weakness in the Middle East and Ukraine. In China, he should stand firm.

THE LAUGHING MONSTERS

By Denis Johnson

228 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.

On the plane I was reading this book.

''Do you like Denis Johnson?'' the woman beside me asked.

''Yes,'' I said.

''I've always felt he doesn't like his characters very much,'' she said.

''O.K.,'' I said.

She had gone to a writing program, had graduated from a writing program but no longer wrote, possibly because her characters' demand for respect and compassion became too onerous. She had become an acupuncturist and had a child. Now she and the child were coming back from Cabo San Lucas, where she had attended some sort of acupuncture conference, I think. That part was a little vague, but we didn't talk much after the child spilled juice all over us. The book, ''The Laughing Monsters,'' was untouched however, immune to our discomfort -- as were its characters, who were experiencing far more severe discomfort in an unpleasant and unenchanting Africa. The Laughing Monsters are some hills in the Democratic Republic of Congo, so named by a missionary before he was murdered, but they might just as well refer to the characters, the scammers and rogue spies Nair and Adriko.

Nair (an inspired name, close as it is to ''nadir,'' which as we know is the lowest point of, well, anything) is a black-haired Danish-American working for NATO Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, or N.I.I.A., and why not. Michael Adriko is a large, merry, lethal-looking African who is on his fifth fiancée, the beautiful if clueless Davidia, a Colorado girl who happens to be the daughter of the camp commander for the United States 10th Special Forces Group from which Michael is currently AWOL -- or, as he prefers to say, ''detached.''

Nair and Adriko have played here many years before, during the civil war, making some money, having some fun. Nair particularly relishes the mess that is Africa. The anarchy and madness. The things falling apart. He even likes the lobbies and rooms of the hotels with their distinctive chemical odor that says: ''All that you fear, we have killed.''

Ostensibly, Nair has come in an N.I.I.A. capacity to check up on Adriko, who has been indiscreetly suggesting access to a crashed planeload of enriched uranium, but he's also here because his friend has summoned him -- to attend the wedding to Davidia in his childhood village of New Water Mountain with the blessing of his people. The real plan, however, is for both men to become rich in the world that 9/11 has brought to full term. Excitement and opportunity now reside only in the arenas of information, be it false or true, regarding security and defense.

''The world powers are dumping their coffers into an expanded version of the old Great Game,'' Nair informs Davidia. ''The money's simply without limit, and plenty of it goes for snitching and spying. In that field, there's no recession.'' While Adriko crows: ''Oh my goodness, Nair, you just tickle them in their terrorism bone, and they ejaculate all kinds of money.'' (The hundred grand that Nair picks up selling the location of the United States military's fiber optic cables is chump change.)

Poor Davidia. She thinks she's going to have a lovely, unique wedding in the jungle to her man. But where, she wonders, is the jungle exactly?

''The people cut it all down,'' Nair says. ''They burned it to cook breakfast, mostly.''

En route to the fantasized nuptials in a stolen Land Cruiser, Adriko plows over a woman bringing a basin of harvested termites to market. His unconcern disillusions Davidia somewhat, and it soon becomes obvious she's not cut out for further adventures after circumstances in the bloody board game that is Africa devolve into shooting, pillaging, imprisonment and interrogation. She's taken out of the picture by Daddy in a helicopter while the men find their way to New Water Mountain separately and quite the worse for wear.

The village is not a happy one. The animals and most of the children are dead, the land and water toxic because of the extraction of gold and hydrocarbons. A grotesque ''queen,'' La Dolce, rules and harangues the demented residents (who have ''the puffy look of corpses floating in formalin'') from a giant leafless tree. She's fat and laughing with ''a buzz-cut Afro on her hippopotamus head, eyes leaping from the sockets and eyelids like birds' beaks closing over them -- her mouth is tiny and round, but it opens to shocking hugeness, displaying many square white teeth.'' A couple of Seventh Day Adventists are present in this pit of gruesome, but even they've become fed up. One describes the scene as ''the outworking of a spiritual travesty,'' but adds: ''After a while, everything's funny.''

Not much more comes of this. The village is left to its doom, Adriko and Nair hitch a ride out with the Adventurists (''We've crawled from the wreck, we've walked away,'' Nair muses), and, after freshening up, begin to consider where to try next. Abidjan? Maybe Liberia. (''Much is possible there.'') Uganda, Ghana, Senegal. . . . ''There's always Cameroon.''

One doesn't feel warmly toward these buccaneers. They're comedians, irredeemable. This is the world after 9/11 (many lifetimes past, now) with its new equations, fluid alliances and casuistries. To the question here, ''Are you any kind of believer?,'' the only answer can be no.

Denis Johnson is closest in sensibility to the great Robert Stone, though he lacks that writer's command of plot and structure. Yet we don't read Johnson for methodology but for troubled effect and bright astonishments. A writer should write in such a way that nobody can be ignorant of the world and that nobody may say that he is innocent of what it is all about. Sartre says this, more or less, in ''What Is Literature?'' Johnson writes in just such a way. Life is ludicrous and full of cruel and selfish distractions. Honor is elusive and many find the copious ingestion of drugs necessary. Our ignorance is infinite and our sorrows fearful. We have made an unutterable waste of this world, and our passage through it is bitter and unheroic. Still, the horror can at times be illuminating, and it is necessary that the impossible be addressed. Here is the hapless murderer Bill Houston at the end of Johnson's first novel, ''Angels,'' strapped down in the gas chamber, listening to the sound of his heart:

''Boom. . . . Boom! Was there ever anything as pretty as that one? Another coming . . . boom! Beautiful! They just don't come any better than that. He was in the middle of taking the last breath of his life before he realized he was taking it. But it was all right. Boom! Unbelievable! And another coming? How many of these things do you mean to give away? He got right in the dark between heartbeats, and rested there. And then he saw that another one wasn't going to come.''

Writing, like old age and Wyoming, is not for sissies.

Johnson was born in Munich, and his childhood was peripatetic. ''Every move meant a chance to reinvent myself,'' he's said. His books take that same opportunity. This is his ninth novel. Others include the best-rendered post-nuke Florida Keys dystopia ever (''Fiskadoro''), the big and boldly retro Vietnam novel ''Tree of Smoke'' and the curiously hypnotic academic novel ''The Name of the World.'' There's also the elegant and gloomy Americana novella ''Train Dreams,'' and lesser merely impressive and enjoyable entertainments, sly riffs on our orphanhood, our muddled dreams, our historical tininess, our moral wobbliness. He's also written poetry, some plays, a single collection of short stories -- the perversely divine ''Jesus' Son'' -- and a solid collection of political and travel essays, ''Seek.'' He probably plays the cello too.

''The Laughing Monsters'' is a minor work -- there's no rocketing prose or conceptual jumping of lanes. Cheerfully nihilistic, it's a buddy book dependent for much of its situation on several of Johnson's early journalistic pieces about Liberia and Charles Taylor and the ''atmosphere of happy horror'' pervasive at the time. The whores and martinis and low-rent espionage seem no more than familiarly nostalgic, as does a time pre-Ebola. Africa is a hard land and it's getting even harder.

In Johnson's earlier novel ''The Stars at Noon,'' set in Nicaragua, a druggie prostitute is known as Mona Lisa because of her secretive beautiful smile that says: ''It's over -- why are we still here?''

What a question! Prescient as ever, even as it all is over faster and faster and we still appear to be here. The critic Walter Benjamin speaks of the Klee painting ''Angelus Novus,'' from which he derives the concept of ''the angel of history.'' A stupendous storm propels the angel into the future to which his back is turned, the wreckage of the past growing and growing before him. Whereas we perceive merely a chain of events, the angel sees ''one single catastrophe.''

The single catastrophe is what fuels the demands and mysteries of literature. The wreckage is what essential writers particularize, and Denis Johnson's interests have always been in wreckage, both individual and universal. If ''Train Dreams'' (a Pulitzer finalist) dealt with the dignified tragedy of a past American anonym, ''The Laughing Monsters'' addresses the vanishing present, a giddy trickle-down of global exploitation and hubris -- the farcical exploits of cold dudes in a hard land.

JOY WILLIAMS is the author of four novels, three collections of stories and a book of essays.

''PRIMUM NON NOCERE'' or ''First, do no harm'' is supposed to be the guiding principle of health care workers. And within civil societies, at least, not harming others is considered every person's moral, ethical and even legal responsibility.

The heated debate over whether it's responsible for health care workers who treated Ebola patients to go grocery shopping or bowling or get on a cruise ship before the end of the disease's 21-day incubation period raises a larger question: What is everyone's duty to prevent transmission of infectious diseases?

Is it ethical to go to the gym when you have a cold, visit a nail salon when you have a foot fungus or board an airplane with a stomach bug? What about the morality of sending your kids to school when they have, say, a green runny nose or were not vaccinated? Are you a bad person if you don't get a flu shot?

When it comes to ''do no harm,'' the problem is defining harm and the risk of inflicting it, as well as what constitutes reasonable measures to impose on someone to minimize that risk.

''Risk is a function of two things -- probability that harm will occur and severity of that harm, should it transpire,'' said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of law at Georgetown University who specializes in public health law and human rights.

And those two factors, he said, have a rough inverse relationship. That is, the more severe the potential harm, the less probability, or risk, we are willing to assume -- much less allow someone else to assume on our behalf.

It's why we have case law going back almost a century imposing criminal or civil penalties on individuals who transmitted serious diseases (typhoid, whooping cough, syphilis, tuberculosis, H.I.V., etc.) that they knew, or should have known, they had, given their symptoms or exposure. But we don't call the police or sue if someone shows up at a cocktail party or sits next to us at the movies with a phlegm-rattling common cold (though we might want to).

In the case of Ebola, even though the risk of transmission may be low, health law experts and bioethicists tend to agree that it's incumbent on exposed individuals to do what they reasonably can to minimize that risk during the disease's incubation period because the stakes (a horrific death) are so high.

''So go for a walk, ride your bike, but don't shake anyone's hand or touch them -- and I would advise not going into congregant settings,'' Professor Gostin said. ''I think it's unethical and wrong to hop on a cruise ship or get on an airplane or go to crowded movie theater or kiss your fiancée or go to a bowling alley.''

But indeed, he continued, this is your ethical obligation whenever you have a fever and are vomiting or sneezing due to infectious illness. Judging from the large number of flights grounded or delayed during the past few weeks when noticeably sick passengers triggered false Ebola alarms, ''do no harm'' is not an ethical imperative for many air travelers.

''I just flew from Washington, D.C., to Tel Aviv and had to take care of six sick passengers -- three vomiting with fever,'' said Dr. Gil Siegal, a surgeon and professor of law at the University of Virginia who has written extensively about the legal responsibility to avoid causing harm. ''Public health policy makers need to adopt the assumptions of behavioral economists,'' he said. ''People are not always rational actors,'' whether assessing their own risk of getting sick or the risk of making someone else sick.

Opposing irrationalities perhaps explain the outrage on social media over the nurse Kaci Hickox, who resisted secluding herself after she returned from West Africa, not to mention Dr. Craig Spencer and Dr. Nancy Snyderman, who went to crowded public places while still at risk of transmitting Ebola. Some critics may have had an exaggerated sense of their risk of falling ill, and these particular health care workers may have had an insufficient sense of their responsibility to manage the risk they posed and the anxiety they might create.

''It's hard to have measured responses when having this conversation because I do find some of the behavior of folks returning from Ebola zones really exasperating,'' said Noel T. Brewer, an associate professor who studies the psychology of risky health decisions at the University of North Carolina's Gillings School of Global Public Health. ''As a lay person and as a person who studies health risk, sheltering in place or keeping your distance for 21 days does seem like a small cost to accept in comparison to the alarm they caused.''

The situation recalls the strident opposition to laws recently passed in Rhode Island and New York requiring health care workers to get flu shots or wear masks when treating patients during flu season. Vaccination rates among American health care workers average just 45 percent, and the flu kills 36,000 people a year.

Similarly, there are parents who defy state mandates to vaccinate their children before sending them to school.

This has contributed to a resurgence of childhood diseases that had been virtually wiped out in the United States, including measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough).

Part of the problem is cultural, said Dr. Brewer, echoing many of his public health colleagues. Americans tend to think more about individual than communal rights and are understandably dubious of medical mandates that seem to be always changing. Americans also value toughness and the ability to work through physical adversity without thinking how they might end up weakening other members of the team.

Contrast this with many Asian countries where it's common to see people wearing surgical masks in public. Tellingly, Americans tend to assume this is to prevent the mask wearer from getting sick. But it's actually more often the reverse: The wearer is sick and the mask serves not only to prevent passing germs to others but also to alert people that the wearer is unwell and they should keep their distance.

''America has gotten so focused on rugged individualism and the autonomy of the person that we forget we have wider ethical responsibilities to our families and communities and our country,'' said Professor Gostin, who bows rather than shaking hands when he is sick and sends home ill students attending his classes. ''This me-first mentality is what I think promotes irresponsibility when it comes to public health.''

The Capricious Hand of Ebola: One Boy Survives as Others Die

SUAKOKO, Liberia — Soon after he lost his parents to Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], Junior Samuel, 8, slumped in a plastic chair inside a treatment center here, listless, feverish and racked with aches. Within a day, he began bleeding from his gums, a particularly ominous sign.

“The kid’s very sick,” Elvis Ogweno, the ambulance supervisor, told a triage nurse when he brought the child in. “There’s no one to take care of him.”

Ten days later, 9-year-old Rancy Willie, who had also just lost his mother, inched out of a pickup truck in the driveway. Weak, hot with fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and barely able to swallow after lying outdoors for more than a day while awaiting help, he, too, would soon begin bleeding.

The boys became roommates at the treatment center, run by the American charity International Medical Corps[https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/]. They received essentially the same care. But one boy died hours before the other one went home, having recovered. And the fate of a third boy, 5-year-old Williams Beyan, remained unclear.

Over and over, doctors here have been confounded by the divergent paths of patients whose cases appeared similar at first. “No matter how long we were there, we didn’t know how to predict it,” said Dr. Steve Whiteley, a California emergency physician who volunteered.

They say they have been especially baffled by what Dr. Whiteley called the “light bulb” phenomenon — a patient who appeared to get better, then suddenly died. Wondering why the boys had different outcomes, the physicians asked: Were the children battling different levels of the virus early on? Did one start out healthier than the other two? Could their genes or immune systems have helped determine their fate? And what could health workers do to improve children’s chances?

The answers are hard to come by. In the absence of much lab testing and research, the disease seems heartbreakingly random.

A study published last month[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/10/14-0430_article] in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases showed that children who survived a previous outbreak tended to have higher blood levels of an immune system activator, and those who died tended to have higher levels of substances that indicated dysfunction of the cells lining blood vessels, which can lead to organ failure. Among adults, the amounts of those proteins were not associated with either survival or death.

“Kids are not adults,” said Dr. Anita McElroy, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the study. “They really are different in how they respond to this virus.”

The researchers speculated that children might benefit from certain treatments — perhaps including statin drugs, which act on those cells lining blood vessels — but those possible remedies had not been studied in humans with Ebola and there was a chance that they could worsen outcomes.

As in previous, smaller outbreaks, children are underrepresented[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100] among Ebola patients in the current epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, those under 15 made up 13 percent of cases in the epidemic’s first nine months, though they accounted for about 43 percent of the population. They tend to be less exposed to major risk factors, such as caring for sick relatives or preparing bodies for burial.

Young people tend[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411680#t=article] to fare better[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411249#t=article] than adults in their 40s or older when they do contract the disease, although some studies have shown that very young children, those under 5, are more vulnerable than older children and young adults. Researchers speculate that the reason may be their immature immune systems, or the possibility that they are exposed to a larger initial dose of virus through close contact with their mothers. Children under 15 as a whole in the current outbreak do not have an overall survival advantage, according to W.H.O. statistics.

At the center here, just under half of the children under 15 have survived, a rate similar to that of patients over all. Fifteen children in that age group have been discharged or have died since the center opened in mid-September, after being built by the charity Save the Children. Eight are now being treated, as a recent surge in patients has filled the 26-bed confirmed ward to capacity.

Junior, who was small and weighed 44 pounds, seemed very ill at admission. He had no family members to take care of him, and staff members, wearing hot protective suits, could not always stay long enough to provide comfort. Like the other two boys with whom he would share the ward, his viral load was fairly high, a bad sign. He was given an intravenous line and oral liquids with electrolytes to combat dehydration[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/dehydration/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Over days, his trajectory was noted. Oct. 3: admitted with fever, vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], loss of appetite[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/appetite-decreased/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], difficulty swallowing, and pain in his abdomen, chest and head. Oct. 4: bleeding from gums. The only other child in the ward was “scared to death to be in the room with him,” Audrey Rangel, an American nurse, said during rounds.

Oct. 5: diarrhea and vomiting. Oct. 7: stable and “jumping around like crazy pants.” Oct. 10: fever of 102.

Rancy Willie arrived three days later. That evening, Ms. Rangel helped lift Rancy off the bed to weigh him. With her goggles fogged, she had a hard time reading the number on the scale — only 37 pounds, it appeared — which was needed to calculate the right doses of medications.

Ms. Rangel tied a glove around one limp arm, then the other, apologizing as she searched for a vein to start an IV. Other workers looked, too, and Rancy whimpered as they did, but it was difficult to see well at night in the unit, and the small boy was severely dehydrated. As the nurses held each forearm aloft, Rancy’s hand drooped like a flag.

“You’re so brave,” Ms. Rangel said. A colleague inserted the needle but missed his vein. Quickly, the team decided to wait for morning, when a nurse experienced in pediatrics would be on duty.

After wrapping the boy in a fuzzy orange and yellow blanket for the night, Ms. Rangel helped him sit up to drink a rehydration solution. His sips were so small, though, that he barely swallowed anything. Moments later, the nurse heard him moaning. He vomited on the bed and over the rail.

“O.K., better?” Ms. Rangel asked. Then another wave overtook him.

Everyone called Rancy by his last name, “Willie,” because there was no relative to correct them. The little boy’s voice was weak and hard to hear, muffled by the medical workers’ headgear.

Rancy was moved into Junior’s room on the ward for confirmed cases. Two nights later, Rancy fell, hit his head and began bleeding profusely. It took an hour and a half for a nurse to come because staff members were busy admitting very sick patients on the ward for suspected cases.

“I had to make a choice,” Bridget Ann Mulrooney, an American nurse, explained to her colleagues that night. There was limited time she could spend in her protective suit, and so many competing needs.

She had bandaged Rancy and put him to bed, but in the middle of the night he got up, confused, and began wandering around naked. Junior, spooked by what he thought was Rancy’s ghost, fled and found a bed in another part of the ward.

Junior no longer had a fever and had begun sitting outside during the day and eating again, his face brightening into a smile whenever he was greeted. Each day, he looked better. A doctor stopped during rounds one morning to pick him up and twirl him around.

On the night of Oct. 17, his fifth at the center, Rancy moaned and moaned. “Willie, what do you want?” a nurse asked. She and a doctor cleaned his bloody diarrhea and gave him a Tylenol-like painkiller and a sedative[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/sedatives/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to help him sleep. He was bleeding from his eyes, nose and mouth. His sister and a cousin had been admitted and had taken Junior’s place in the room, but they were too sick to offer comfort.

Rancy, whose stepfather said he loved dancing and soccer and wanted to be a civil engineer, died before sunrise.

That morning, after more than two weeks at the center, Junior was discharged to live with his aunt and uncle, Ebola no longer detectable in his blood. He smiled broadly and said he had not been afraid until people around him began to die. On Friday, he said by phone that he hoped to go to school one day; he had never attended.

Williams was still a patient when Junior left. His father, George Beyan, had been discharged the same day Williams tested positive for Ebola, and aid workers at the center encouraged him to come back to the ward to help care for his son. During triage, a nurse checked off just about every symptom on the case investigation form for Williams: fever; vomiting; pain in his stomach, chest, muscles and joints; difficulty swallowing and breathing; a rash; and red eyes[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/eye-redness/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Mr. Beyan sat Williams up, encouraged him to eat and drink, asked staff members for extra juice, and even walked him outside to get some fresh air and sunlight. The father sat vigil as Williams napped, and he held him close overnight, wrapped in the same blanket. Mr. Beyan would tell anyone who asked that his son was doing better, little by little. “Small, small,” he would say in Liberian English. The doctors wanted to believe it, too, even as Williams ran high fevers and had continuing diarrhea.

After all, Junior’s survival had surprised them, and so had Mr. Beyan’s. He had been staggering when he was admitted in early October, and he had hiccupped for days, a sign strongly associated with death from Ebola at the center. The disease was capricious, the doctors were learning. Williams began crying one evening, after having had a 104-degree fever that day. He had just been outside watching a movie. Then he was gone.

Mr. Beyan sobbed, inconsolable. “My little boy.”

The Irish rocker Bob Geldof[http://www.bobgeldof.com/] has become better known for assembling starry charity projects – the Live Aid and Live 8 concerts, the Band Aid singles – than for the music he recorded with his own band, the Boomtown Rats. He has another charity disc in the works: on Monday, Mr. Geldof announced that he is commemorating the 30th anniversary of the first Band Aid single, “Do They Know It’s Christmas,”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE] with a remake that will raise money to help combat Ebola in West Africa. It is scheduled to be released Nov. 17.

The song, which was written by Mr. Geldof and the Scottish singer Midge Ure, of Ultravox, as a response to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984, will be retooled to deal with Ebola, and recorded this month by Band Aid 30, an ensemble that draws heavily on current stars. Ed Sheeran, Emeli Sandé, One Direction, Adele, Ellie Goulding, Sam Smith and Bastille are among the younger singers who have agreed to perform on the new version. The roster also includes Bono, who sang on the original 1984 recording, and Chris Martin of Coldplay, who performed on the Band Aid 20 version[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5vMdmajxFY] in 2004. (There was a remake, by Band Aid II,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Y1cn2dAcE] in 1989 as well.)

At a news conference in London on Monday, Mr. Geldof said that he planned to record versions of the song that would include different artists for the French, German and American markets, with artists popular in those countries, the BBC reported[http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29986704], but the only musicians he mentioned were the French electronic music group Daft Punk and the French singer Johnny Hallyday.

Given the prevalence of Internet downloading, Mr. Geldof made a plea on his website for people to buy the physical disc to contribute to the charity.

“It doesn’t really matter if you hate this song or you don’t like this song, you have to buy this thing,” he said. “I really urge everyone. Don’t download it, don’t look at it on YouTube.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Breakthrough.

The leaders of China and Japan met for the first time[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/world/asia/leaders-of-china-and-japan-hold-long-awaited-meeting.html] in Beijing today, a step toward improving the standoff between the world’s second- and third-largest economies.

They are both attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, a 21-nation group representing half of the world’s economic output. President Obama is there, too, with a hectic schedule[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/world/asia/obama-arrives-in-china-on-trip-with-complex-agenda.html].

• Pessimism on Iran talks.

President Obama says there is still “a big gap” between the sides negotiating a comprehensive deal on Iran’s nuclear program[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/nuclear_program/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. The deadline is in two weeks.

Secretary of State John Kerry, Iran’s foreign minister and a senior adviser to the European Unionare meeting[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/10/world/middleeast/ap-ml-iran-nuclear.html] in Oman today.

• White House backs “net neutrality[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/net_neutrality/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].”

President Obama today formally opposed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/technology/obama-net-neutrality-fcc.html] deals in which content providers like Netflix would pay extra to broadband companies for faster access for their customers.

• Grand reopening.

The new HealthCare.gov website is live today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/white-house-says-consumers-can-browse-early-on-retooled-health-care-site.html], and officials say it is easier to use than the one that frustrated millions last fall.

The open enrollment period formally starts Saturday. In most cases, insured consumers who do nothing will get re-enrolled in the same, or similar, health plans.

• School in Nigeria is attacked.

A suicide bomber disguised in a school uniform today killed[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/10/world/africa/ap-af-nigeria-violence.html] at least 48 students at a boys’ high school. It occurred in the northeast, where Boko Haram militants are most active.

• Ebola quarantines end.

Mali is preparing to release 108 people from a quarantine today.

It’s also the last day[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/10/us/ap-us-ebola-nurse-quarantined.html] that Kaci Hickox, the nurse who successfully fought a quarantine order, is required to be monitored for symptoms.

• Data breach at Postal Service.

The personal information of 800,000 employees[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/us/postal-service-discloses-major-data-theft.html] was hacked, the U.S. Postal Service said today, a computer breach that seemed to have the signature of Chinese perpetrators.

• Backing independence from Spain.

The results of Sunday’s nonbinding vote, announced today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/world/europe/catalans-vote-in-straw-poll-on-independence-from-spain.html], give an overwhelming victory to secessionists in Catalonia, a region of 7.4 million people in Spain’s northeast.

The poll is not recognized by the government, but the Catalan leader says it should pave the way for a formal referendum, like the one held in Scotland in September.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are slightly ahead. European shares closed higher, and Asian indexes ended mixed.

• Year-end bonuses on Wall Street, typically a large percentage of pay, will likely disappoint[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/wall-streets-bonus-season-not-likely-to-be-filled-with-joy-survey-finds/] on average in 2014, a survey showed today.

But some specialties — investment bankers, private-equity traders and asset managers — should still see bonuses rise 10 percent to 15 percent.

• Banks deemed “too big to fail,” like JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, will have to keep a lot more capital on hand[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/financial-stability-board-to-propose-stricter-capital-rules-for-global-banks/] under rules proposed today by the Financial Stability Board.

The rules are intended to prevent any financial trouble at 30 global banks[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-10/banks-face-25-loss-buffer-as-fsb-fights-too-big-to-fail.html] from rippling through the economy.

• Investors will have direct access to Shanghai stocks[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/business/china-moves-to-open-economic-links.html] for the first time next week after approval today by Chinese and Hong Kong regulators.

OVER THE WEEKEND

• North Korea released[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/world/kenneth-bae-matthew-todd-miller-released-by-north-korea.html] two Americans who had been accused of trying to subvert the secretive state.

• President Obama announced[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/us/politics/in-line-to-be-attorney-general-loretta-lynch-at-home-in-glare.html] he would nominate Loretta E. Lynch, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, to be the next U.S. attorney general, paving the way for the first African-American woman to hold the job.

• Israel’s Arab minority observed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/world/middleeast/israeli-arabs-protest-fatal-police-shooting.html] a one-day strike to protest the fatal police shooting of a young Arab man.

• Pope Francis demoted[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/world/europe/pope-demotes-us-cardinal-critical-of-his-reform-agenda.html] a U.S. cardinal who is critical of his reform agenda.

• In boxing, Sergey Kovalev, 31, remained undefeated[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/sports/challenger-sergey-kovalev-wins-two-titles-from-bernard-hopkins.html] by beating Bernard Hopkins, 49.

• Disney’s “Big Hero 6[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/movies/big-hero-6-an-animated-film-based-on-a-marvel-comic-book.html],” based on an obscure Marvel comic series, led the North American movie box office. “Interstellar[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/movies/interstellar-christopher-nolans-search-for-a-new-planet.html]” was second.

• Catching up on TV: We have your episode recaps for “Homeland[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/homeland-recap-yes-that-was-only-a-drug-fueled-hallucination/],” “The Newsroom[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/the-newsroom-recap-a-bit-of-self-control-for-will-and-aaron-sorkin/],” “The Affair[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/the-affair-recap-do-noah-and-alison-have-chemistry/]” and “The Good Wife[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/the-good-wife-recap-is-alicia-too-entitled/].”

The awards were created by Internet billionaires at Google, Facebook and Alibaba to give science some glitz.

BACK STORY

Whatever happened to the Berlin Wall[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] after it fell 25 years ago Sunday?

It took about a year to dismantle the wall’s concrete slabs, which stood 15 feet tall and stretched for 96 miles, and much of it was recycled and used for a highway in Germany.

But sections of it ended up on display in more than 40 countries[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/berlin-wall-anniversary/berlin-wall-now-pieces-scattered-around-globe-n239946], including Israel, Russia and the United States.

In a men’s bathroom at a Las Vegas casino, three urinals are mounted[http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/08/travel/berlin-wall-locations/] onto a slab of the wall. (Women can ask a guard to show them when the bathroom is empty.)

In Seoul, South Korea, three sections of the wall stand in Berlin Square, where citizens can pray for the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.

And at the Vatican, a Ferrari executive donated a piece of the wall that stands in a garden[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2009/11/09/RTV2142409/] where popes have been meditating since the 13th century.

The actor David Hasselhoff collected[http://www.npr.org/2014/11/09/362595983/how-mr-hasselhoff-tore-down-this-wall] 350 pieces of the wall, some of which he gave to the cast and crew of “Baywatch.”

Many other pieces that were chipped off the wall ended up on eBay, where they are still on sale[http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.X%22berlin+Wall%22&_nkw=%22berlin+Wall%22&_sacat=0] today.

Doctors in Liberia are perturbed by divergent paths of Ebola patients whose cases appear similar at first but can have opposite outcomes; study published in journal Emerging Infectious Diseases shows that children who survived previous outbreak tended to have higher blood levels of immune system activators, while those who died had higher levels of substances that indicated dysfunction of cells lining blood vessels (Series: The Ebola Ward).

Ask Well: Immune to Ebola?

Question:

If a person is infected with Ebola and recovers, are they then immune to the disease or can they still contract it again?

Answer:

Yes, surviving Ebola appears to make you unable to catch it again, though this has never been formally tested, because it is unethical to deliberately try to reinfect someone with a fatal disease. But no one has been known to get Ebola twice, and survivors have high levels of protective antibodies in their blood.

The immunity appears to be only against the same Ebola strain — in the case of the current outbreak in West Africa, the one called Ebola Zaire — although there may be some cross-protection against the four others[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/]. How long the immunity lasts is unknown.

People who have developed immunity can be of great help in the outbreak. Their blood plasma is full of protective antibodies that can be injected into other victims — as long as they are a good donor match — and may save them by neutralizing what virus they have before it can enter more cells. (There is some risk of passing on other diseases like hepatitis or H.I.V., but those are treatable; Ebola is not.)

Survivors can also bury bodies and provide care for the ill relatively safely. This could be valuable when personal protective gear hampers doing delicate tasks. For example, putting IV lines in children’s small veins is hard with three sets of gloves on.

Care by survivors is part of a long medical tradition. In decades past, in smallpox epidemics in poor countries before vaccination was widespread, adults who had survived earlier epidemics isolated victims and cared for them.

Scientists have long assumed that some people are naturally resistant to Ebola, because some have tended to and even buried relatives without falling ill. After a traditional healer [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/health/ebola-outbreak-in-sierra-leone-is-tied-to-one-funeral.html]in Sierra Leone died from Ebola, her body was so teeming with virus that it infected 14 mourners at her funeral. But another 26 did not get sick. Some might simply have been lucky, some may have had some sort of genetic protection.

More important, there is evidence[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/health/ebola-immunity.html] that some Africans do have genetic protection because they get infected but never develop symptoms.

In 2000, a team of French scientists studied[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2800%2902405-3/abstract] 24 people in Gabon who had tended to Ebola victims — mostly close relatives — without falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies in their blood but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation, a clear indication that they had had the virus but had defeated it without ever falling ill.

A similar 1999 study[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/179/Supplement_1/S28.short] by American scientists in the Democratic Republic of Congo found similar results in five of 152 household contacts.

If scientists knew which genes provided immunity, they could test for them. But they do not.

They also have no idea how widespread that natural immunity is. The one large study[http://www.plosone.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009126] that tried to establish that, published in 2010, was done by French scientists at the International Center for Medical Research in Franceville, Gabon. (From 1994 to 2002, Gabon had four relatively small, isolated Ebola outbreaks.)

A team led by Dr. Eric M. Leroy, a virologist, took 4,349 blood samples in 220 villages selected at random — most of which had never had a case of Ebola. They found that 15 percent of Gabon’s population had at least some antibodies to Ebola. But it varied widely: Near the coast, only 3 percent did; in jungle villages near the Congo border, up to 34 percent did.

Also, some of those people had low antibody levels. Exactly what level is protective is unknown.

But if they had never met an Ebola victim, how did they develop antibodies?

That also is unknown. One possibility is that they ate bushmeat — chimpanzee, monkey, or most probably, large fruit bats, which are a natural reservoir for the virus. They may have each gotten only a tiny dose of virus, small enough for their immune systems to fight off by developing antibodies. In effect, they were “vaccinated” by the meal.

But Dr. Leroy’s leading theory was that they ate fruit that fruit bats had gnawed on and contaminated with their saliva.

“We imagine that this is the main route,” he said. “But it is a hypothesis. We do not have the evidence.”

Resetting U.S.-China Relations

President Obama arrived in Beijing on Monday for a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He will meet with China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s president, Xi Jinping, at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday. The occasion is a vital opportunity for the two presidents to reset the relationship between the nations.

Since Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi last met, at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., in June 2013, many analysts have been pessimistic about that relationship. China’s announcement of an “air defense identification zone” in the East China Sea last November, and ongoing disagreements in areas like computer crime, climate change and trade, have contributed to a climate of mistrust.

The two presidents should use their meeting on Wednesday to reassure each other about their nations’ strategic intentions and to ease suspicions that each government harbors toward the other. This will require candor on the part of both leaders.

Mr. Obama should reiterate that America welcomes the continuing, peaceful emergence of China as a world power and that its strategy is not — as many Chinese analysts claim — to “contain” it. Mr. Xi should reassure Mr. Obama that China is not interested in (much less capable of) pursuing, in Asia, a Chinese version of the Monroe Doctrine, and that it recognizes the constructive role that the American presence can continue to play in East Asia. Above all, they should articulate a vision of global affairs in which cooperation between the United States and China is indispensable to the pursuit of peace and stability.

The two presidents will have the opportunity to cover many areas in the United States-China relationship. They should renew their commitments to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and cooperating on energy-efficiency technologies. They should discuss ways to align their responses to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] crisis in West Africa.

Both countries have an interest in promoting reconciliation and reconstruction in Afghanistan, and in collaborating on a vision for peace, stability and prosperity there.

The rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State poses serious threats to the stability of the Middle East and, potentially, the global community. China and the United States, which are both victims of terrorist threats and declared enemies of the Islamic State, should spare no effort in bolstering their cooperation in combating this, including possible cooperation on intelligence sharing, through the United Nations and other multilateral forums.

On North Korea, the two presidents should reaffirm their commitment to denuclearization. They should leave no doubts in the minds of North Korean leaders that a nuclear North Korea will never be accepted by the international community. The only way for North Korea to achieve the goals it holds dear, including security, economic development and normalization of relations with the United States, is for Pyongyang to return to the denuclearization process. The two presidents should work together to revive the stalled six-party talks.

Economic ties — long considered the ballast of the United States-China relations — have become less cordial in recent years, in spite of the massive expansion of bilateral trade and investment since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. Last month, 51 top American business leaders, led by the U.S.-China Business Council, urged Mr. Obama to make the conclusion of a bilateral investment treaty by 2016 a priority in his meetings with Mr. Xi. Such a treaty would have tremendous benefits for both countries.

Military-to-military relations, long regarded as the weakest spot in United States-China relations, have in fact grown considerably in recent years. There are now regular visits and exchanges involving military officers of both nations, from all levels. The two militaries have cooperated in counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and in joint exercises of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Recently, the Chinese Navy participated for the first time in the biennial international maritime exercise led by the United States Pacific Fleet.

Broadly put, the two presidents must act to arrest and reverse the emergence and deepening of a dynamic in which efforts by either nation to bolster its own security causes the other to feel less secure. The relationship between the United States and China must not become a strategic rivalry, spiraling downward. The two militaries should continue to build mutual understanding and trust, and promote pragmatic cooperation in areas such as United Nations peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism.

As China’s economic and military strength continues to grow, and its weight in the Asia-Pacific region increases, Beijing and Washington will have to not only negotiate and renegotiate the boundaries of their power and influence, but also develop a shared understanding of their global roles and responsibilities.

Chinese leaders have put forward a new model of “major-country relationship” between China and the United States, an intellectual framework for resolving one of the greatest puzzles in international history — how to avoid falling into the so-called Thucydides trap, the often-cited cycle of struggle between rising and established powers.

To build such a new model, the two presidents will need to not only demonstrate to the public in both countries their ability to rise above pessimism and cynicism and to deliver tangible benefits, but also to chart a trajectory for a relationship that benefits both nations and that is positive-sum, not zero-sum. This week, they should renew and sustain the momentum from their meeting last year, and lay the foundation for a mature, cooperative and robust United States-China relationship in the years and decades to come.

Kapp, a former president of the U.S.-China Business Council, is a senior adviser to the China program at the Carter Center. Bernard Loeffke is a retired major general of the United States Army.

BEIJING — The meeting between President Xi Jinping[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/shinzo_abe/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Japan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/japan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] lasted only 25 minutes, less than half the time usually given to formal encounters between the leaders of two nations. The names of the tiny islands in the East China Sea that are at the core of their frosty relationship did not pass their lips.

The two leaders tried a new beginning Monday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, but the atmosphere could hardly have been cooler. Their countries’ flags, often the backdrop for such diplomatic meetings, were conspicuously absent, lest they convey an impression of amity.

And the body language? At the outset of the meeting, before they were seated, Mr. Abe spoke to Mr. Xi. The cameras caught the Chinese leader listening but not answering, turning instead for the photographers to snap an awkward, less than enthusiastic handshake.

“Obviously Mr. Xi did not want to create a warm or courteous atmosphere,” said Kazuhiko Togo, director of the Institute for World Affairs at Kyoto Sangyo University. “It was a very delicate balancing act for Xi.”

If the Chinese leader smiled too much, he would antagonize the nationalistic audience at home, which has been led for more than two years to believe that Mr. Abe is not worth meeting, Mr. Togo said. If he glared, he would sour world opinion.

The long-awaited encounter came three days after the two countries agreed to a formal document in which they recognized their differing positions on the East China Sea, including on the waters around the islands known as the Diaoyu in China and the Senkaku in Japan.

The two sides said that “following the spirit of squaring history” — an oblique reference to Japan’s brutal occupation of parts of China during World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — they would seek to overcome the problems in the relationship.

The meeting Monday was not intended to deliver any substantive progress on territorial and historical issues that have brought the two richest countries in Asia close to conflict and inflamed nationalist sentiments, officials from both sides said.

But Mr. Abe, who appears to have done most of the talking during the limited time given, asked for the early implementation of a hotline that could help defuse possible clashes between Chinese and Japanese vessels in waters around the islands, said Kuni Sato, the press secretary for the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

In general, Ms. Sato said, Mr. Abe told Mr. Xi that China and Japan should explore a relationship that was based on strong economic cooperation, better relations in the East China Sea and stability in East Asia.

Mr. Abe talked about the need to curb Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and about cooperation on dealing with North Korea. He also squeezed in, as an example of cultural exchange, a mention of his attendance last month at a Chinese ballet company’s performance in Tokyo, according to Ms. Sato.

Mr. Xi had refused to consider a face-to-face meeting since becoming president in March 2013, but Mr. Abe, who was elected at the end of 2012, publicly requested the encounter in the past few months. Japanese diplomats were dispatched to Beijing to arrange the meeting and to complete the accord released Friday, which was intended as a basis for better relations.

The Chinese, as hosts of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that opened Monday, realized they could not snub Mr. Abe during the summit meeting, and agreed to the encounter, Chinese officials said. President Obama arrived in Beijing for the forum Monday morning.

That Mr. Xi and Mr. Abe met gives a “kickoff” to what could be an exceedingly long process of discussions over the future of the uninhabited islands, and the disagreements over Japanese repentance for atrocities in China during the war, said Yang Xiyu, a senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies and a former Chinese diplomat.

“The gaps between the two sides are too big to handle, let alone narrow,” in such a meeting between the two leaders, Mr. Yang said.

Since taking control of the islands from the United States in 1972, Japan has consistently refused to concede that there is any dispute over sovereignty. China says the islands were taken from it by Japan at the end of the 19th century.

On the question of what China sees as Japan’s lack of repentance for its occupation of China, Mr. Togo of Kyoto Sangyo University said it would be impossible for Mr. Abe to announce publicly that he would not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, a site in central Tokyo that honors the nation’s war dead, including convicted war criminals. Such a pledge would antagonize his conservative political base.

“Abe cannot say he will not go, but it doesn’t mean he will go,” Mr. Togo said.

Some Japanese analysts said they believed Mr. Abe’s visit to the shrine in December of last year was sufficient to satisfy his domestic constituency, allowing the prime minister to focus on developing a modicum of a working relationship with China.

Even though the four-point document agreed to by both countries appeared to be evenly balanced to give each side “face,” the Chinese government got the upper hand, said Ren Xiao of Fudan University in Shanghai.

Japan contends that there is no dispute over the islands, and that it maintains total control of them. But the four-point accord’s declaration that there were different positions over the islands “fulfilled China’s requirement,” he said. That was a sufficient concession that there was a conflict over the islands, he said.

Epidemics of Confusion

WASHINGTON — A mysterious virus emerges in Africa and makes its way to our shores. An anxious and skeptical public rejects scientific evidence that the lethal virus is transmitted only through body fluids. There are no drugs to effectively treat infected patients, nor a vaccine to prevent new cases.

People shun the infected and their contacts; some demand quarantines. Conspiracy theorists contend the virus escaped from government laboratories.

No, the virus is not Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. It is the outbreak in the early 1980s of the virus that causes AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

The epidemics have prompted eerily similar reactions from health officials and the public, raising crucial questions about why the world remains persistently unprepared to react to the sudden emergence of viral threats.

For decades, scientists have warned that diseases obey no national boundaries. New and old contagions can pop up in hours anywhere in the age of jet travel. And as a rapidly growing population invades previously wild habitats, more dangerous microbes are bound to be discovered.

While the world has learned many lessons about containing them, it has forgotten a few — and probably will need to learn others.

Experts underestimated the extent of the spread of both viruses. After development of an H.I.V. test, doctors discovered that millions of people were infected in one of the worst pandemics in history. The Ebola epidemic, which involves thousands, is smaller and confined to West Africa for now.

But as long as the infection spreads in West Africa, it poses a major threat to the rest of the world; many countries will have a very difficult time controlling its spread if it reaches them.

In circumstances like these, epidemiology’s immense power deserves respect. Scientists quickly and clearly delineated how Ebola and H.I.V. are transmitted. For H.I.V., the routes include sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, contaminated needles and childbirth.

Ebola requires direct contact, which means that the fluids splash or spray into someone else’s mouth, eyes or nose, or enter through the bloodstream through cuts or breaks in the skin.

But public officials, then and now, failed to communicate this information in ways most people understand.

At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, officials and journalists spoke of “bodily fluids” to avoid using words like penis, vagina and sperm. Only later did officials became explicit about the risks of rectal intercourse.

Ambiguity was costly. People avoided restaurants where waiters were perceived to be gay out of fear of getting the disease from “contaminated” food and dishes. Parents refused to send their children to schools where a student was known to be infected. Some people called for quarantines, which made no scientific sense.

Conspiracy theorists were not far behind, embracing the fiction, disseminated by Soviet Union officials, that scientists created H.I.V. at Fort Detrick, an Army base in Maryland, from which it escaped to infect the world.

Health officials have had ample time — years — to polish their language skills. Yet the phrase “bodily fluids” is again with us, and confusion has arisen over whether the virus can be “airborne” as officials try to explain that Ebola virus is not dispersed like the influenza[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and measles[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] viruses.

The New York Times’s Well blog has been inundated with questions[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/category/ask-well/] about whether Ebola can be caught from subway poles, bowling balls, toilet seats, mosquitoes, sweat, coughs, sneezes and even pets.

And so history repeats. An uncertain public, fearful of the unknown, has stigmatized many Ebola survivors and workers who cared for Ebola patients[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/bellevue-workers-worn-out-from-treating-ebola-patient-face-stigma-outside-hospital.html?_r=0], as AIDS patients once were, even though they are not infectious to others. Governors and health officials have clashed over the need to quarantine people returning from West Africa, though — as a court has stated — such policy is not based on scientific evidence.

As for the inevitable conspiracy theory: Dr. Peter Piot, a co-discoverer of the Ebola virus and now dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, recalls that an attendee at a recent meeting about Ebola asserted that the virus escaped from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Sierra Leone. Others have claimed that the epidemic is a ruse intended to squeeze foreign aid money from donors.

By its very nature, public health involves politics. As politicians, health officials have traditionally tended to play down, or even ignore, risks to calm anxiety and panic.

But the official foot-dragging that first greeted the AIDS epidemic wound up pitting activists against government agencies and officials. Trust was lost, and “silence equals death” became a rallying cry.

Federal officials have not been silent about Ebola, but sometimes, they have been too emphatic and absolute in their choice of words. Despite lack of prior experience, the experts predicted that any American hospital could safely handle Ebola patients with little risk to noninfected individuals. That assurance came back to haunt them in Texas.

To their credit, the officials quickly corrected themselves. But by then, the damage was done.

Fear of the unknown plays a great role in fanning anxiety during outbreaks of deadly diseases. H.I.V. was truly a mystery at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. At first, scientists debated whether the cause was an infectious agent (even an old one in disguise) or a drug, or combinations of them.

Ebola was identified in Central Africa in 1976 but was unknown in West Africa when cases began to occur in Guinea earlier this year. It is the largest epidemic of the disease. As of Friday, Ebola has infected 13,268 people, of whom 4,960 have died, the World Health Organization says.

As in the early years of AIDS, standard support therapy is the only proven therapy. If drugs are found to treat Ebola, health workers will need ways to get them to Africa’s poor. If nothing else, the AIDS epidemic may have prepared us for that.

Both viruses continue to raise major challenges. A decrepit infrastructure for delivery of health care and other services is the result of years of political unrest in West Africa. Hundreds more doctors and nurses are needed from elsewhere to care for the ailing.

The fact is that Ebola, like AIDS, will leave behind a tragic legacy: hundreds of thousands of orphans.

Craig Spencer, New York Doctor With Ebola, Will Leave Bellevue Hospital

Craig Spencer, the New York City doctor who became the first person in the city to test positive for Ebola, is free of the virus and is set to be released from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday, hospital officials said on Monday.

Dr. Spencer, 33, who had been in Guinea treating Ebola patients with Doctors Without Borders, was rushed to Bellevue by ambulance on Oct. 23 after reporting a fever of 100.3 to the authorities that morning. He was placed in isolation in a secure ward, and within hours a blood test confirmed he had the virus.

His infection set the city on edge and set off a race to find his contacts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/tracing-patients-possible-contacts-creates-host-of-challenges-for-the-city.html] over the previous few days, when he went bowling[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/can-you-get-ebola-from-a-bowling-ball/], dined out and rode on the subway and in an Uber taxi. But to date, no one else in the city has tested positive for the virus.

Dr. Spencer is scheduled to appear at a news conference on Tuesday at the hospital.

“After a rigorous course of treatment and testing,” Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, said in a statement, “Dr. Spencer poses no public health risk and will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow.”

It was unclear on Monday whether Dr. Spencer would return to his Hamilton Heights apartment, where his fiancée, Morgan Dixon[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patients-fiance-shares-his-altruism-.html], is under quarantine. Two friends who had contact with him in the days before his diagnosis were initially held in quarantine, but were recently released.

Dr. Spencer was given a range of treatments, including an experimental drug and blood plasma donated by a recovered Ebola patient, Nancy Writebol[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/nyregion/in-exclusive-club-of-us-ebola-survivors-kinship-is-sealed-in-blood.html], a 59-year-old missionary who contracted the virus in Liberia.

His condition was serious at first, but by last week, he had recovered enough that he asked for, and was given, his banjo and an exercise bicycle to pass the time while he was in isolation.

Dr. Spencer’s recovery adds to the evidence that when treated in advanced American hospitals, Ebola has a far lower fatality rate than in West African field hospitals starved of doctors, nurses and equipment. While 70 percent of Ebola patients in Africa are dying, eight of the nine patients treated in the United States have survived. The only one who died was Thomas Eric Duncan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html], a Liberian, whose treatment was delayed when a Dallas hospital initially misdiagnosed his illness.

The experience of the Dallas hospital — two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan there contracted Ebola, but survived — caused American hospitals and public health officials to re-examine how they responded to possible cases. Requirements for protective gear were revamped, and when Dr. Spencer was taken to Bellevue, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dispatched a team to New York even before tests confirmed he had the virus. In Dallas, the C.D.C. did not arrive until two days after it was called.

A day after Dr. Spencer went to Bellevue, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that all travelers arriving in New York who had had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined for 21 days, even if they had no symptoms and thus were not likely to be contagious. That policy, which New Jersey and several other states also enacted, was criticized by some public health experts as an overreaction that would discourage doctors and nurses from traveling to Africa to help contain the virus. But Mr. Cuomo defended it, saying he preferred to err on the side of caution.

Sierra Leone Defends Jailing Critic of Ebola Response

Sierra Leone’s attorney general defended the arrest last week of a prominent radio journalist[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/world/africa/sierra-leone-reportedly-detains-journalist-for-criticism-of-ebola-response.html] who criticized the government’s handling of the Ebola crisis as lawful and justified, in a news release[https://www.facebook.com/johnbenjaminjr/posts/10152527997312875] distributed over the weekend.

Franklyn B. Kargbo, Sierra Leone’s senior law enforcement official, accused the radio host David Tam-Baryoh of undermining the effort to stop the disease’s spread by making “disparaging and inflammatory statements” about the government’s work “that in no way would aid the collective efforts we are making as a nation in the fight against the Ebola virus.”

According to Mr. Kargbo, Mr. Tam-Baryoh’s statements were likely “to incite public hatred, disaffection and instability by inferring and making innuendos of the government using the ongoing constitutional review process to perpetuate itself in governance rather than fighting the Ebola virus disease.”

Jarrah Kawusu-Konte, a spokesman for the president, shared the attorney general’s statement[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203652883254877&set=a.1193636713323.2030736.1000587276&type=1] on Facebook and Twitter, and confirmed that it was official in an email.

PRESS RELEASE ON THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF DR. DAVID TAM BARYOH ON JULY 31ST THIS YEAR, HIS EXCELLENCY THE... http://t.co/s0vM8Dv606[http://t.co/s0vM8Dv606] — Jarrah Kawusu-Konte (@jaraski) November 8, 2014[https://twitter.com/jaraski/status/531094041937858560]

Mr. Tam-Baryoh was detained last week after the broadcast of his weekly program, “Monologue,” was halted. It had contained a discussion in which questions were asked about the possible abuse of quarantine powers in one area of the country and whether President Ernest Bai Koroma would seek to extend his term in office.

The journalist apparently referred as well to the possibility of an uprising against Mr. Koroma like the recent one in nearby Burkina Faso if the president tried to stay on.

“His insinuation of recent events in Burkina Faso to be replicated in Sierra Leone, a country still reeling from a very devastating conflict and presently dealing with an Ebola epidemic of unparalleled magnitude,” Mr. Kargbo argued, was “not only distasteful, but an attempt to provoke unrest.”

The president used his emergency powers,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html] granted to fight the Ebola outbreak, to arrest Mr. Tam-Baryoh and have him sent to the Pademba Road prison in Freetown, the capital, the attorney general said, because such criticism could lead to “a breakdown of public order and good governance of the nation.”

One of Mr. Tam-Baryoh’s friends told The Guardian[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/ebola-journalist-arrested-over-criticism-sierra-leone-government-response] that Mr. Tam-Baryoh had been beaten and denied access to medication for high blood pressure.

The presidential spokesman, Mr. Kawusu-Konte, noted[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203647173672141] that on Friday President Koroma had warned journalists to keep in mind in their work that national security was paramount.

Mr. Koroma, during a visit to a northern district, said Friday, “We do not want people to preach tribalism, hatred and division in the country, pretending to be criticizing government on the handling of Ebola.”

The crackdown on dissent comes amid concern that the nation’s health ministry has been underreporting the number infected with Ebola.

More than 200 new cases were registered by officials in the past two days, according to Umaru Fofana[https://twitter.com/UmaruFofana], a Sierra Leonean correspondent for the BBC.

In Quick Response, Mali Thwarts an Ebola Outbreak

Using old-fashioned detective work, public health workers in Mali, one of the world's poorest nations, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, tracked and quarantined 108 people in two cities and a few roadside towns who may have had contact with a 2-year-old girl from Guinea who died of Ebola on Oct. 24.

There was even a car chase: The last bus the family traveled on during a 700-mile journey from Guinea was stopped on a rural highway, emptied out and disinfected.

A 21-day quarantine since the little girl's death on Oct. 24 is almost over, and 41 of the 108 Malians in quarantine are due to be released Tuesday, and the remainder by Friday. Since none are showing symptoms, health officials are allowing themselves to hope that their quick response has kept Mali's first outbreak to a single case.

If so, Mali will join Senegal and Nigeria in having proved yet again that rapid reactions can stop Ebola. In contrast, the initial outbreak in Guinea festered unaddressed for months before it exploded.

''I'm actually feeling very good right now,'' Dr. Rana Hajjeh, who led the C.D.C. advisory team, said Friday. ''We feel reassured that most of the danger is over.''

The case also illustrates how even people in close contact with victims do not necessarily get the disease, which spreads when infectious fluids get into an open cut, or a nose, eye or mouth.

Remarkably, no one in Mali who touched the girl, Fanta Condé, is yet sick. Not the woman she called her grandmother, her 5-year-old sister or her uncle, who all spent three days traveling with her from Beyla, Guinea. Not Dr. Abdouramane Koungoulba, the pediatrician who first examined her on Oct. 21, nor two traditional healers who saw her earlier, nor any of a dozen other doctors or nurses who gave her a transfusion and intravenous hydration and cleaned up her vomit and diarrhea in the 48 hours before she died.

Nor, apparently, are any of the dozens of bus passengers, taxi drivers, family friends or other contacts she had while traveling.

The episode also drew attention to an unusual decision by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta: Unlike most West African countries, Mali has not closed its border with an Ebola-affected neighbor -- in this case, Guinea.

That is partly for practical reasons. There are so many gravel roads crossing the long border that closing it is probably impossible.

Dr. Abdou Salam Gueye, a C.D.C. investigator, explained that closing the border would violate an honored Malian principle of diatiguiya (pronounced JAH-tih-GEE), the belief that hospitality to friends and even strangers is obligatory. It extends back centuries, to the days when Mali was the core of a great West African empire, and travelers with introductions were welcomed like family.

Michel Sidibé, the Malian executive director of U.N.AIDS, the United Nations' H.I.V.-fighting agency, said diatiguiya is a Mandingo tradition.

''If I come to my diatiguiya's house, he cannot close the door,'' Mr. Sidibé explained. ''His home is my home. Even if I am sick, he must bring me in. And this has extrapolated into 'I cannot close the border.' ''

Mali's harrowing brush with Ebola began last month with a woman's selfless act: trying to rescue two young girls in her family from the disease. Aminata Gueye Tamboura, 45, fetched them from their ailing family in Guinea, the cradle of the epidemic, then took them aboard buses and taxis, back to her home in Kayes, in northwest Mali. (Mrs. Tamboura, although called Fanta's grandmother, is actually the second wife of Fanta's grandfather in polygamous marriage.)

Fanta had a 104-degree fever and an unstoppable nosebleed by the time she was hospitalized. Health officials feared she had seeded the virus all along the route, potentially turning Mali into the fourth nation engulfed by the disease.

The child's family in Guinea did not believe the virus existed and rejected medical help, even as relatives began to die there, including Fanta's father, said Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, leader of the W.H.O. team in Mali. Fanta's mother remained in Guinea with a 3-month-old baby because she had to observe 40 days of mourning for her husband, Dr. Koungoulba said.

Ms. Tamboura, the girls and an uncle left Beyla, a small city, on Oct. 18 in a 10-passenger ''bush taxi,'' and crossed the border the next day. Some passengers said Fanta was given acetaminophen to lower her fever and avoid detection. Ms. Tamboura denied it.

During a three-hour layover in Bamako, Mali's capital, the family took taxis to and from the compound of family friends, and rested there. That compound is now also quarantined with 25 people inside; the government delivers food and has posted guards to make sure no one leaves.

In Kayes, Ms. Tamboura took Fanta to two different traditional healers, known as marabouts, and then to a neighbor, a former doctor, who urged her to go to Fousseyni Daou Hospital, which she did on Oct. 21.

Initially, Dr. Koungoulba said, she told him Fanta was a local child, so he did not suspect Ebola. He did wear gloves, but no other protection. That evening, Ms. Tamboura's sister admitted that Fanta was Guinean, so he ordered an Ebola test. But it took 24 hours for a car to arrive from Bamako and fetch the sample.

When it turned up positive on Oct. 23, Dr. Koungoulba kept asking himself: ''Did I do everything I should? Did I touch her dirty diaper or the blood running from her nose?''

Dr. Hajjeh, who had just finished helping Mali devise a response plan in case the disease ever arrived, said she was at the airport when she heard the test results were positive.

''I canceled my flight and stayed,'' she said.

At the hospital, about a dozen staff members were quarantined, as were Fanta's family and all 40 patients and their families, who sleep under trees on the dusty grounds to help care for the sick.

The quarantine was partly for their own protection, doctors said, since there had been angry reactions elsewhere in Mali to earlier suspected cases, which turned out to be false alarms.

Tensions rose when Fanta died the next day. By then, the government was making national broadcasts, looking for everyone who had ridden the buses. They found many of them through old-fashioned sandal leather: Some passenger lists had cellphone numbers, but in Mali, a village might share one phone. The authorities estimate that they failed to find 39 passengers, but none who sat near the family.

Then Fanta's 5-year-old sister developed a fever, but it turned out to be malaria, and curable.

Luckily, rumors that the disease did not exist, or that Westerners started it to sell drugs, got little traction in Mali. But in Guinea, such beliefs crippled the response to the epidemic for weeks.

Many Malians stopped shaking hands, opting to touch their hearts in the Muslim ''salaam'' or do the ''W.H.O. elbow bump.''

''Some even do like the Dalai Lama,'' said Dr. Fall of the W.H.O., meaning they bowed with their hands in a praying position. ''They laugh when they do it, but at least they do it.''

Hand-washing stations -- often just a plastic teakettle of water with soap -- are now required in buses. (While hand sanitizers are easier, some Muslims shun them because they contain alcohol, Dr. Hajjeh said.)

Some customs did not change: Friends continued sharing tea glasses and eating from common plates, even inside the hospital.

Senegal's outbreak was one case with few suspected contacts. Nigeria's was large -- 21 cases in two major cities. But its response was powerful and efficient, said Samantha Bolton, a W.H.O. spokeswoman. Nigeria turned the emergency operations center it created for polio over to its Ebola team, and health workers made 18,500 home visits to more than 900 contacts.

''In Nigeria, the government was very, very much in control,'' Ms. Bolton said. ''That needs to happen in Mali. Here, the government could probably do with a few more people on each team.''

The country recently appointed an Ebola coordinator, so it will be better prepared next time, if there is one.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Leaders one on one.

President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China plan to go for a quiet, private walk and have dinner, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Today’s itinerary[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/world/asia/obama-apec-china-hong-kong.html] reflects the White House’s decision to emphasize the relationship between the two, rather than have Mr. Obama reach out to the Chinese public.

• Heightened alert in the Mideast.

Israel is tightening security[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/11/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html] in major cities and in the West Bank today.

On Monday, two Israelis were killed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/world/middleeast/palestinian-stabs-israeli-soldier-at-tel-aviv-train-station.html] and two others injured in separate stabbings that Israel attributed to Palestinian men.

• Some success against Ebola.

It appears[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/health/quick-response-and-old-fashioned-detective-work-thwart-ebola-in-mali.html] that a quick response from the authorities in Mali has kept that West African country’s outbreak to a single case.

In New York, Craig Spencer, the doctor who became the first person in the city to test positive for the virus, will be released[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-doctor-with-ebola-will-leave-bellevue-hospital.html] from the hospital today.

A new music album[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/geldofs-new-charity-disc-aimed-at-ebola/] will raise money to help combat Ebola in West Africa.

• Punished for abandoning ship.

The captain of the South Korean ferry that sank in April was sentenced[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/world/asia/south-korea-ferry-captain.html] today to 36 years in prison for deserting his ship and its passengers in a fatal crisis.

He was acquitted on the most serious charge against him, angering family members of the 304 victims. Most of the fatalities were high school students on a field trip.

• Veterans Day.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaks at Arlington National Cemetery today and lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.

The holiday also brings free entry[http://www.nps.gov/findapark/feefreeparks.htm] to all national parks, many of which are holding special events[http://www.nps.gov/findapark/event-search.htm?start_date=11/08/2014&end_date=11/12/2014].

HBO will broadcast a tribute concert[http://www.hbo.com/#/the-concert-for-valor] from the National Mall in Washington at 7 p.m. Eastern.

• The billion-dollar divorce.

A judge in Oklahoma City has ruled[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/business/harold-hamm-oklahoma-oilman-billion-dollar-divorce.html] that an oil executive must pay nearly $1 billion to his ex-wife. That’s not a typo.

• Road accident kills dozens.

A head-on collision[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/11/world/asia/ap-as-pakistan-road-accident-.html] today between a bus and a truck on a highway in Pakistan left 58 people dead, mostly women and children.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stock futures are trending higher after a slight gain on Monday.

European shares are rising; Asian indexes were mixed, with Japan up 2.1 percent.

• Obama administration officials said today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/business/international/us-and-china-overcome-hurdles-on-technology-pact.html] that a breakthrough had been achieved in negotiations with China to eliminate tariffs on information technology products.

• It’s Singles’ Day[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/made-up-holiday-in-china-but-real-revenues-for-online-retailers/] — because of all the 1’s in the date — in China. Those not in relationships are encouraged[http://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2014/11/10/gearing-up-for-chinas-24-hour-sale-that-beat-cyber-monday-and-black-friday/] to go on online shopping sprees for heavily discounted products.

• The maker of Hellman’s mayonnaise is suing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/business/unilever-sues-a-start-up-over-mayonnaise-like-product.html] the maker of an eggless spread, accusing it of false advertising and fraud.

NOTEWORTHY

• New reads.

Senator John McCain’s “13 Soldiers[http://books.simonandschuster.com/Thirteen-Soldiers/John-McCain/9781476759654],” a history of Americans at war told through personal accounts, hits bookstores for Veterans Day.

Mr. McCain’s onetime Republican rival, former President George W. Bush, is releasing “41: A Portrait of My Father[http://www.randomhouse.com/book/248609/41-by-george-w-bush],” a biography of former President George H.W. Bush.

Also out today is Stephen King’s “Revival[http://stephenking.com/library/novel/revival.html],” about addiction, music, religion and life after death.

• Returning to the spotlight.

Garth Brooks, one of the biggest country music stars of the 1990s, today releases his first original album since 2001, “Man Against Machine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/arts/garth-brooks-is-back-with-a-new-album-man-against-machine.html].”

But don’t bother looking for it on iTunes. He has started a competing service, GhostTunes[https://www.ghosttunes.com/].

• But is it waterproof?

A Patek Philippe watch[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2014/important-watches-ge1404.html], described as the most complicated in the world, is expected to be sold for over $17 million today at Sotheby’s.

• A different stage.

The actress Emma Stone makes her Broadway debut[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/theater/emma-stone-joins-cabaret-on-broadway.html] today as the club singer Sally Bowles in “Cabaret.”

Ms. Stone was first chosen last year for the part, only to drop out suddenly and be replaced by Michelle Williams.

BACK STORY

What about North Korea?

As world powers talk today[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/10/world/middleeast/ap-ml-iran-nuclear.html] about Iran’s nuclear program, negotiations with North Korea, which already has nuclear weapons, have been frozen since 2009.

North and South Korea were born at the end of World War II, when the U.S. divided the peninsula with the Soviets, a split that solidified with the Korean War.

The North began nuclear research after the Soviet retreat in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Its leaders apparently felt as if they could not depend on Moscow for nuclear cover.

The North first tested[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/world/asia/09korea.html] a device in 2006, and another in 2009.

It agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and tests of long-range missiles in exchange for food aid in 2012, only to break the deal by testing a missile that same year and conducting a third nuclear test in 2013.

Washington has indicated no interest in resuming talks until the North begins to dismantle nuclear plants.

Here’s another small sampling of sparkling prose in recent editions, from serious to silly to Kenny G.

•••

National, 10/30:

Colorful Rogues Make Way for National Issues [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/politics/national-concerns-drain-color-from-politics-in-louisiana.html]

NEW ROADS, La. — A politician at a street fair is usually an inconvenience, an ordeal to be endured as he thrusts a flier at your chest and a smile at your face. But the silver-haired candidate pushing his 1-year-old in a stroller through the funnel-cake stands and craft booths at the harvest festival here did not have to try so hard. The glad-handers rushed up to him.

“I’d vote for you! I voted for you plenty of times!” shouted Mark Wells, 58, a retired state employee.

Edwin W. Edwards, 87, a four-term former governor and eight-year former federal inmate, is back on the trail, this time as a long-shot Democratic contender for a House seat and salvation for magazine feature writers in a dreary election year.

For all his color, though, Mr. Edwards, the populist rogue who embodied Louisiana politics from the 1960s to the 1990s, charming one half of the state and mortifying the other, might as well be a ghost.

A wonderful description, by Campbell Robertson and Jonathan Martin, of a unique and anachronistic character.

•••

National, 10/30:

Capital Mourns Bradlee, and the Passing of an Era [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/ben-bradlee-funeral.html]

WASHINGTON — They came to bid farewell to Benjamin C. Bradlee, a “journalistic warrior.” They paid tribute to his fearless fervor for a good story, his old-school patriotism, his impatient energy, his irreducible magnetism and his sailor’s vocabulary. They mourned the passing not just of a larger-than-life figure, but of the bygone era he represented.

The legendary editor who helped force out a president and transform American journalism, Mr. Bradlee had passed into icon status long before he died last week at 93, as much an idea as a person. But at a power-packed funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday, his family, friends and admirers celebrated the man as well as the myth, offering a collective eulogy for a Washington that is no more.

Deft and vivid phrases by Peter Baker in sketching another outsize figure.

•••

International, 10/25:

Ottawa Gunman’s Radicalism Deepened as Life Crumbled [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/americas/ottawa-canada-gunmans-radicalism-deepened-as-life-crumbled.html]

OTTAWA — A loner. A drug addict. A criminal. A drifter. And lately, an Islamic radical.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the bearded, 32-year-old gunman who was shot dead Wednesday after killing a soldier and storming Canada’s Parliament, aptly fit each of those descriptions. In the tumultuous wake of what Canada’s prime minister has called a terrorist act, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau’s radicalism has become the defining one.

But a closer examination of his past draws a somewhat different portrait: one of an increasingly troubled, mentally unstable man who initially may have embraced religion not as a political cause, but as an attempt to scaffold a disintegrating life.

A powerful lead, by Michael Wines and William Yardley, capped by an effective image with the unusual use of “scaffold” as a verb.

•••

Science, 10/25:

Pragmatism on Climate Change Trumps Politics at Local Level Across U.S. [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/science/pragmatism-on-climate-change-trumps-politics-at-local-level-across-us.html]

While politicians are increasingly willing to include environmental messages in their campaigns, many at the national level still steer clear of the politically charged topic of climate change. But in communities across the country where the effects are lapping at the doorsteps of residents, pragmatism often trumps politics, and candidates as well as elected officials across the political spectrum are embracing the issue.

Metaphor and reality meld in this strong image by John Schwartz.

•••

International, 10/23:

Beijing Unsoothed by a Kenny G Visit [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/world/asia/kenny-g-stirs-controversy-with-visit-to-hong-kong-protest.html]

Kenny G is an icon in China, and his visit stirred up controversy and conspiracy theories on both sides of the political divide.

In one of the more inexplicable mysteries of Chinese culture, his 1989 saxophone ballad “Going Home” has for decades oozed from speakers across Chinese public spaces at closing time, setting off rapid exits by the masses. The song has no lyrics, yet somehow, when it is played in a mall, Chinese shoppers know what to do. They go home.

If you missed Dan Levin’s longer exploration[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/world/asia/china-says-goodbye-in-the-key-of-g-kenny-g.html] of this Kenny G phenomenon, this was a small and delightful reminder.

•••

National, 10/28:

Justices Drawing Dotted Lines With Terse Orders in Big Cases [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/supreme-court-with-terse-orders-has-judges-and-lawyers-reading-tea-leaves.html]

WASHINGTON — People used to complain that Supreme Court decisions were too long and tangled. Those were the days.

In recent weeks, the court has addressed cases on the great issues of the day without favoring the nation with even a whisper of explanation. In terse orders, the court expanded the availability of same-sex marriage, let a dozen abortion clinics in Texas reopen, and made it harder to vote in three states and easier in one.

Judges and lawyers who used to have to try to make sense of endless, opaque opinions now have to divine what the Supreme Court’s silence means.

Sharp, penetrating language by Adam Liptak enlivens this potentially abstruse legal issue.

•••

Metro, 10/14:

New Park Ave. Tower Is Now the Tallest, if Not the Fairest, of Them All [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/nyregion/432-park-avenue-tower-the-tallest-if-not-the-fairest-of-them-all.html]

But even more than the views from the apartments, it may be the views of them that give 432 Park its allure. From Central Park, Park Avenue or Park Slope, there it is. On the George Washington Bridge or Long Island Expressway, there it is. In the bleachers at MetLife Stadium or Citi Field, there it is. Everyone from cinematographers and muralists to tourists and snow globe makers must now contend with the tower. …

There can be no doubt the skyline has changed, yet New Yorkers are less sure whether it has changed for better or worse. Some are awed by the slender, omnipresent obelisk, its perfect symmetries, an undeniable feat of engineering; others are repulsed by its dimensions, both physical and financial, where units cost as much as $95 million, an undeniable feat of excess.

A number of nice touches by Matt A.V. Chaban in his description of a new skyline addition.

•••

International, 10/17:

Nairobi’s Latest Novelty: High-End Mac and Cheese, Served by Whites [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/nairobis-latest-novelty-high-end-mac-and-cheese-served-by-whites.html]

Fast food in Nairobi used to be chicken and chips from a local spot like McFrys or barbecue at a roadside thatched-roofed shack. To outsiders, it might seem a shame to have a part of the world so full of its own charm get sucked into the homogeneity of everywhere.

But few Kenyans seemed upset about that.

This feature by Jeffrey Gettleman on Nairobi’s dining scene was full of memorable touches.

 In a Word

This week’s grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.

•••

Like others have done before her, Ms. Burre, who had a new baby, intended to exchange her chosen field for full-time motherhood.

Make it “As others have done.”

•••

What someone wears, along with other visual clues given off in photographs, can tell a thousand different things about them. …

The team poured through more than 80 years of scientific research about dating and attraction, and was unable to prove that computers can indeed match people together.

“Someone” is singular, but “them” is plural. Make it “What people wear …” And in the second sentence, we meant “pored” (this was fixed later).

•••

James returned to Cleveland, a destination that absolved him of not only gutlessness but also of disloyalty.

To make the elements parallel, make it “not only of gutlessness but also of disloyalty.”

•••

As far as nourishment, it lies somewhere between the palate cleanser that is “Clapping Music” and the feast of “Drumming.”

This “as far as” idiom requires a verb — “as far as nourishment goes” or “is concerned” or some such. In this case, though, better to simplify: “As nourishment, it lies somewhere …”

•••

He mentions dabs, an exponentially powerful form of marijuana.

This loose use of “exponentially” seems vague and hyperbolic.

•••

But a series of unforced errors — Mr. Braley’s dis of Mr. Grassley, vague threats of legal action against his neighbor’s errant chickens and the unfortunate placement of an English fruit farm, rather than Iowa agriculture, on his Facebook page — have piled up.

No need for the slang.

•••

The American government, sensibly, is averse to negotiating with terrorists or governments that hold United States citizens for ransom or political leverage. But in exceptional circumstances, it makes sense to do so. The Alan Gross case meets that criteria.

“Criteria” is plural; make it “that criterion” (or “that standard”).

•••

One reason many detainees abandoned their hunger strikes is because, twice a day, the government used what is called “enteral feeding” to ensure that they were getting nutrients.

Redundant. Make it “One reason … is that …”

•••

If the G.O.P. is faring better in the early vote by attracting voters who would have turned out anyway, then they diminish their ability to fare as well on Election Day as they have in the past.

“G.O.P.” is singular, so it doesn’t work with “they.” Rephrase, perhaps by using “Republicans are” in the first clause.

•••

Karin Landgren, the United Nations secretary general’s special representative here, echoed a similar theme.

“Similar” is redundant after “echoed.” Make it “sounded a similar theme” (or “echoed the theme”).

•••

Colleagues say that before working 14-hour days as a minister, Ms. Pellerin was a prolific reader of fiction and nonfiction, and that she is equally at ease admiring a Picasso painting as she is listening to a hip-hop track.

This phrasing doesn’t work. We could say “she is equally at ease admiring … or listening.” Or perhaps “she is just as comfortable admiring … as she is listening.”

•••

They described how agencies had urgently investigated a man who wrote a bizarre post on social media that he was going to try and contract Ebola in Africa and then return to the United States.

Make it “try to contract Ebola.”

•••

How big of a win will this be for Republicans?

No “of” in this expression. Make it “how big a win.”

•••

[Capsule summary] At 4,200 pages, “The Norton Anthology of World Religions” is well-positioned to strain backs and ruffle feathers in its wide choice of original texts.

No hyphen is needed here. The Times’s stylebook says this:

well(-). Nearly all modifiers formed with well are hyphenated when they occur before nouns: well-advised, well-behaved, well-bred, well-done, well-founded, well-groomed, well-intentioned, well-known, well-mannered, well-nigh, well-read, well-rounded, well-spoken, well-thought-of, well-timed, well-to-do, well-worn.

Thus: He is a well-read man. But omit the hyphen when the words follow the noun they modify: He is well read.

•••

To eliminate trips that could lead to falls, management at The Sequoias required residents to have walkers valet parked once they reached their table, then remain seated while staff served the meal.

Make it “the staff” or “staff members.” The stylebook says this:

staff, staffer. Like army, the noun staff is collective, referring not to individuals but to the group. For individuals, use staff members. References to three staff or many staff, or to training staff, are jargon. Confine staffer(s) to informal contexts.

•••

Less than a quarter of Europeans can connect to high-speed cellphone networks, compared with about 90 percent of Americans.

The reference is to a number of people, so use “fewer.”

•••

Then there was Bill Clinton, whose cheeseburger eruptions were dissected nearly as much as his bimbo eruptions during his 1992 presidential run, proudly displayed a jogger-friendly plastic Timex Ironman.

Block that metaphor. He had an affection for cheeseburgers, but they did not erupt, nor can one really dissect an eruption. And it’s probably not wise to use the derogatory “bimbo eruptions” except in a quotation. Lastly, the sentence goes off the track, either because of a missing word (“who”?) or the wrong verb form (“displaying”?).

•••

A product of a prominent Boston Brahmin family, a graduate of Harvard and a Navy veteran of World War II, Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee overcame polio, rose from Newsweek reporter to friend of President John F. Kennedy and eventually to the pinnacle of his business.

This is not a series of three; there are only two verbs (“overcame” and “rose”). We needed “and” before “rose,” or a separate verb with the “eventually” part.

•••

Last fall, I had got a curious call from the company: A Google public relations employee called to ask if I was interested in reporting on the personal project of one of their top executives.

Google isn’t “their.” Make it “the company’s.”

•••

But most male students expressed some nervousness about accidentally running afoul of consent rules, especially because drinking usually proceeds a casual hookup.

Should be “precedes.”

•••

Place your order downstairs (the menu also lists smoothies, shakes, sundaes and beer) before climbing three flights to a terrace with a sweeping view over thousands of motorbikes on their circumambulation around Hoan Kiem Lake.

Circumambulation refers specifically to walking, so it seems like an odd choice here.

•••

Mr. Cooper, his muscular form covered in baggy gray pants and a T-shirt, his mouth screwed into an O that rendered his famous face utterly unrecognizable, was reciting a line from “The Elephant Man” — the 1977 Bernard Pomerance play inspired by the trying adulthood of Joseph Carey Merrick — that has been a guiding light for him since adolescence.

There should not be a second dash here.

•••

​​[Web headline] ​​F.C.C. Proposal Would Allow ​​á​​ la Carte Internet Video Services

Undone again by French. As the stylebook points out, it’s “​à la carte,” with a grave accent.

•••

Professor Gutiérrez said research by she and other investigators had also raised questions about Eiffel’s supposed connection to a number of other structures in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela and other countries, including the Iron House in Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, which she said bore little or no resemblance to other Eiffel creations.

Ouch. “By her,” of course, not “by she.”

New York Today: Veterans March

Good morning on this fine Tuesday.

When Raymond Kelly was police commissioner, parades got shorter[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/police-announce-parade-crackdown/] in New York City.

In 2010, the Police Department told organizers that parades had to cover 25 percent less distance and could not go on for more than five hours.

Still, Mr. Kelly says he is a great fan of parades.

“I love them,” he told us.

That’s fortunate, because today Mr. Kelly will lead the Veterans Day parade[http://americasparade.org/] as its grand marshal.

“I’m a veteran at being grand marshal,” he said, referring to the St. Patrick’s Day parade of 2010.

Mr. Kelly is a Vietnam veteran and a former Marine lieutenant.

He described his military service as “an experience that stays with you your whole life.”

Mr. Kelly will march with his wife, Veronica, who served in the Coast Guard reserves.

(He would not comment on whether he would also march with his sizable security detail, which he may lose[http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20141110/civic-center/ray-kelly-lose-his-12-detective-security-detail-sources-say] at the end of the year.)

Asked what he would wear, he said, “Dress blues, tennis shoes and a light coat of oil.”[http://4mermarine.com/USMC/dictionary/d.html]

“I wanted to see if you were listening,” he said. “I will wear a two-button suit.”

The opening ceremony takes place at 10 a.m. at Madison Square Park.

The parade begins at 11:11 a.m. and proceeds up Fifth Avenue to 52nd Street.

Here’s what else you need to know.

OPEN OR CLOSED

• Schools: closed.

• Stock markets: open.

• Banks: mostly closed.

• Post Offices: closed except for the main post office on Eighth Avenue.

• Government offices: mostly closed.

• Transportation: mostly on normal weekday schedule.

WEATHER

Parading weather. Sunny and still with a high of 64[http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&lon=-73.96940231323242#.VGHfjYfyBI6].

COMING UP TODAY

“We decided to blow it out more fully,” the producer, Anne Hamburger, told us.

The piece shows how much has changed since military wives eagerly awaited letters scratched out in the trenches.

And how little:

“One woman told me every time she walked by her computer, she hit ‘refresh,’” Ms. Hamburger said.

Dear Diary:

Ebola came to the apartment building across 147th Street on Oct. 24. As Dr. Craig Spencer [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/ebola-patient-in-new-york-is-called-a-doctor-at-ease-in-danger.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A11%22%7D] took his temperature across the way, I was battling cockroaches and on the phone with my super, begging him to turn off the heat. I walked by his apartment on my way to a lecture at school. I asked a guy with a notebook what was going on.

The roaches that had made themselves apparent that day were so gross with their mysterious skittering, and now seemed all the more contagious with the news. All those recent stories about New York rats and bacteria. Now this. Good grief. The heat – the pipes clanking, the windows fogging – now carried notes of a faraway virus. No chance of catching it, but still. Welcome to New York.

West 147th Street was unusually quiet for the homecoming of a global health crisis. It was reporters mostly. The usual after-school block riot was mute. As the news got out, a few neighbors [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/from-bellevue-hospital-center-to-brooklyn-feeling-ebola-anxiety.html] stood on stoops and on the edge of curbs. One man, on a bike, who called himself El Dragone, shouted to a cameraman from Mashable and two reporters from city dailies, and me: “It’s not a virus, it’s a plague.”

A virus of the body and what? A plague of the Western imagination? He wheeled off. [Dr. Spencer was declared free of the virus and set to be discharged [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-doctor-with-ebola-will-leave-bellevue-hospital.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday.]

One neighbor, a friendly cable guy, said, “It hits home.”

Is this my home? I wonder.

I went back to my apartment and opened a window. My cat sat on the sill. We were in an atmosphere of proximate, impossible danger and fleeting community. A big big island and all was quiet on 147th. Good luck, Dr. Spencer.

New York
With Phone Calls and Persistence, Tracking Travelers at Risk for Ebola
By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

On the 12th floor of a glass tower at the city health department’s headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, workers huddle like telemarketers at banks of 30 computers, doggedly calling one telephone number after another.

Darryl Wong, a French-speaking operator, was trying to reach a West African man who had left New York several days before and had not returned when he said he would.

“Ah, bon,” Mr. Wong said patiently to the man’s wife, who answered their phone in the Bronx. “Il est toujours à Maryland.” He wheedled a Maryland number out of the woman, and began calling it.

New York City’s defense against the Ebola epidemic — and at least the hypothetical threat that it will percolate through the city’s mass transit system, schools and dense neighborhoods — is this 24-hour-a-day operation now keeping track of almost 300 people, believed to be the largest monitoring effort in the country.

Run from a health department building set amid industrial wasteland and miles of railroad tracks, it involves hundreds of workers drawn from all corners of the department. Operators speak French and at least five dialects of West African languages like Mandingo and Pulaar. For tough cases, they can call the Police Department’s missing persons unit, and have done so.

Two-thirds of the 289 people being tracked recently came to New York City from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three hardest-hit countries; the rest are workers who have been involved in the care of Dr. Craig Spencer, the city’s first Ebola patient, who was released [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-ebola-patient-bellevue.html?ref=nyregion] from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday. The travelers are not under quarantine because they said they did not have contact with Ebola patients; in fact, almost no one in the United States is now under quarantine.

Those being monitored must take their temperatures twice daily and check in with the health department for 21 days, the maximum known time it can take for symptoms of Ebola to emerge.

They are not always easy to reach. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] gives the city a daily list of travelers from those countries who are destined for New York City. Most come through Kennedy International Airport, but sometimes the information the passengers provide at the airport, such as phone numbers, addresses and name spellings, turns out to be incorrect.

With the help of the health department’s researchers, colorfully known as “disease detectives,” and sometimes aided by the police, almost all are eventually located, health officials said. Since the monitoring began Oct. 24, they said, only four people have not been found.

But because people fall in and out of contact, and new people arrive, the percentage reached on any given day fluctuates. At one point it was 80 percent; one day last week the monitors reached 90 percent, prompting a round of applause at a health department meeting.

After some anxiety, Mr. Wong, who normally deals with H.I.V.[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] matters, found his West African traveler in Maryland, and confirmed that he was still fine. Another person Mr. Wong was tracking had an elevated temperature[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] one morning, but by the afternoon, it had gone down. Up to now, no one being monitored has registered any symptoms worrisome enough to prompt testing for Ebola.

The operators become almost extended family to some of the people they are monitoring. Last week Sonia Freeland, another operator, was holding an animated conversation with a man she had already spoken to several times. “It’s Sonia,” she says, coaxing him to go upstairs in his house, where he has left his fever log.

“So everything has been O.K.?” she asks.

His only problem, the man says, is money.

“Only money?” Ms. Freeland says. “That’s the biggest complaint on everybody’s list.”

The operators ask personal questions, like whether people are eating well, and many people seem to find the conversations therapeutic. “They open up, especially if they know your voice,” Ms. Freeland said.

Nearby, Cynthia Charway, who normally works in tuberculosis control, jotted down a traveler’s temperature readings.

“O.K. Beautiful!” she says encouragingly, as he reported a temperature of 97.3 at 10:05 p.m. and 97.9 at 8:51 a.m. The precision leads her to believe that he is not making it up, she said.

The next person she called told her he was going to Las Vegas and would return in three days, posing a potential challenge while he is on the road.

In front of them is a series of conversion charts. One shows two columns of dates labeled “Arrival date” and “21 days later,” so they will know when someone’s maximum risk period is due to expire. Another is a conversion table from Celsius to Fahrenheit, for those more conversant with Celsius, with the danger threshold, 37.8 degrees Celsius equals 100.04 degrees Fahrenheit, marked in red. (To be conservative, the city set its cutoff slightly below the C.D.C.'s 100.4 degrees.)

The monitoring operation is part of a much bigger Ebola “activation,” as health officials call it, of 470 city health department employees, from data analysts who compile the day’s results and send them to the first deputy mayor to on-call doctors. The city anticipates that the cost of preparing for and treating Ebola will be in the millions of dollars, and has begun negotiating with federal officials for support.

Patterned after the response to other modern health crises, like swine flu[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/influenza/swine_influenza/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], the activation is reviewed internally during twice-daily strategy meetings, seven days a week. The meetings are led by Dr. Jay Varma, deputy commissioner for disease control and the “incident commander” for Ebola in New York.

Sitting in a conference room arrayed with laptops and nine video screens are chiefs for areas such as legal, rapid response, safety, clinical operations, surveillance and epidemiology.

It is a portentous lineup for a department better known for handing out condoms[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/condoms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and for public service ads chastising subway riders for liking soft drinks.

Normally, this team has a unit in charge of “countermeasures.”

“Because there is no what we call ‘countermeasure’ for this — there is no vaccine or antibiotic[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — we repurposed them to be quarantine and monitoring,” Dr. Varma said.

Virtually all travelers from the three West African countries arrive through five major airports, including Kennedy, and each of the five states where those airports are has its own policies on high-risk arrivals. At least 650 people in the five states were being monitored last week, but the only person under quarantine was Morgan Dixon[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patients-fiance-shares-his-altruism-.html], the fiancée of Dr. Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html], better known to city health officials as “the index case,” who contracted Ebola while working in Guinea.

About one-third of the 289 people under active monitoring in New York City have had contact with Dr. Spencer, including doctors, nurses and others taking care of him at Bellevue and the Fire Department employees who took him there. The Bellevue workers have sometimes been tricky to reach, health officials conceded. They tend to resent being checked on, often work late shifts, and are not always in the mood to report their temperatures at 5 a.m.

The logistical challenges of monitoring were part of the justification when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced that travelers who had contact with Ebola patients would be quarantined, even if they were healthy and thus had little risk of transmitting the virus. The policy was criticized as an overreaction that would discourage doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to fight Ebola at its source.

Defending the low-key approach, city health officials note that thousands of people have traveled to the United States from West Africa during the current outbreak, yet only two of them have turned out to have Ebola and neither of them transmitted the disease to anyone outside the hospital where they were being treated.

Now that more than two weeks have gone by without a second Ebola case in New York, the crisis has cooled a bit. Dr. Varma has stopped sleeping at the office on an air mattress, which is left tossed in one corner, in case it is needed again. If no other Ebola diagnoses are made, the command system will begin to wind down over the next few weeks. But a skeletal system will remain in place indefinitely, Dr. Varma said.

“A lot of this operation simply has to keep standing until the crisis in Africa is fully addressed,” he said.

Craig Spencer, Recovered New York Ebola Patient, Goes Home

For recovered Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] patients, the new rules of etiquette demand hugs.

As Dr. Craig Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/ebola-patient-in-new-york-is-called-a-doctor-at-ease-in-danger.html], New York City’s first Ebola patient, demonstrated over and over and over again on Tuesday, hugging is the new doctor’s note, the proof that the patient is well, that the public should not be afraid and that in the United States, the disease is not the terror-inducing epidemic it is in West Africa.

As Dr. Spencer was released from Bellevue Hospital Center on Tuesday, Ebola-free after 19 days of treatment, Mayor Bill de Blasio welcomed him “back to his normal life” on behalf of all New Yorkers. Taking a page from President Obama’s playbook when he hugged Nina Pham, a nurse who recovered from Ebola, the mayor turned to his wife, Chirlane McCray, at the Bellevue news conference and asked, “Would you like to administer the first hug, First Lady?”

Ms. McCray and Dr. Spencer duly embraced, followed by the mayor and Dr. Spencer, followed, over the next hour or so, by serial hugs from the doctor who was in charge of his treatment, Laura Evans; the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary Travis Bassett[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/in-new-york-bringing-a-comforting-message-during-a-chaotic-time.html]; the head of Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola], Sophie Delaunay; and a gantlet of hospital workers.

Dr. Spencer’s parents sat in the front row of the audience, listening silently and without expression as he made brief but emotional remarks[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/statement-dr-craig-spencer].

“Hello, my name is Craig Spencer,” he began, looking pale but fit as he made his public debut. “Today I am healthy and no longer infectious.”

He recalled that in his five weeks in West Africa, “I cried as I held children who were not strong enough to survive,” but that he also had celebrated with those who were cured and “invited me into their family as a brother.”

In turn, after he became sick, he said, some of his recovered Ebola patients in Guinea called his personal cellphone to ask whether there was anything they could do.

Dr. Spencer, 33, was treated at the city’s premier public hospital, which is supported by taxpayer funds. Dr. Ram Raju, the president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs Bellevue, said that the hospital was still tallying the price for his care, but that the cost was expected to be so high that it was seeking federal help to pay the bill.

Dr. Bassett said about 100 workers had been involved in Dr. Spencer’s care, and 25 nurses in blue and white uniforms who had cared for him formed a silent backdrop to the news conference.

Officials declined to describe the course of Dr. Spencer’s illness — Ebola leads to profuse vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and bleeding — and Dr. Raju said it was not known whether experimental treatments he was given, like blood plasma from a recovered Ebola patient, had made a difference.

Seventy percent of Ebola cases in West Africa are fatal, but eight of the nine people treated in the United States have recovered. Dr. Bassett said a key reason was the labor-intensive job of managing body fluids and replenishing lost blood, allowing the body’s own defenses to kill the virus.

Dr. Evans recalled that on the day Dr. Spencer arrived at the hospital, she had at first thought he was part of one of the many drills the hospital had conducted in preparation for the virus.

She said that his sense of humor had “helped enormously” in keeping up the spirits of the hospital staff who cared for him, and that as a doctor, he had consulted on his treatment. She declined later to provide examples of how he had consulted, saying only that he was more sophisticated than most patients about his treatment and had also offered “life lessons.”

Dr. Spencer was taken to Bellevue on Oct. 23 after reporting a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of 100.3. He had felt fatigue on Oct. 21, but over the next two days he went to a bowling alley, on the subway and other public places, prompting some, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York at one point, to suggest he had been careless.

No one Dr. Spencer came in contact with has fallen ill, however, and on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio pre-empted any questions about Dr. Spencer’s choices by saying that he “did everything right” and had “followed the protocol to the letter” by reporting his fever immediately.

Indirectly, Dr. Spencer was the impetus for the decision by Mr. Cuomo and several other governors to order quarantines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html] of travelers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, even if they were healthy and thus posed no risk of transmitting the virus. Public health experts criticized those polices as an overreaction that would discourage health care workers from fighting Ebola at its source. While no one explicitly mentioned the governor or quarantines on Tuesday, speaker after speaker made a point of saying that medical workers fighting Ebola, like Dr. Spencer, needed praise and support.

Mr. de Blasio urged the public to donate to the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City, led by Ms. McCray, which he said would channel contributions to international aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders and Unicef.

Soon after the news conference, three city sedans and two S.U.V.s with tinted windows pulled up in front of Dr. Spencer’s building in Upper Manhattan. The police had cleared the road in front of the building by towing a few cars to nearby streets.

Dr. Spencer, dressed in a light blue shirt and gray trousers, climbed out of one of the sedans and walked directly into his building without looking back. From the car behind him came his mother and father, and then an official carrying a clear plastic packet with what appeared to be clothes, as well as bags of groceries.

Nearby residents were given letters signed by Dr. Bassett, assuring them that “all building residents are safe.” Dr. Spencer is free to go wherever he likes. And his fiancée, Morgan Dixon, who lives with him, was released from home quarantine on Tuesday, though the health department is still monitoring her for any symptoms.

Moments after Dr. Spencer returned, a neighbor, Stan Malone, tied eight Mylar balloons to an iron fence next to the building’s door. The balloons read, “Welcome!” and “Welcome Home.”

“I feel completely safe,” said Mr. Malone, 45, who identified himself as the mayor of the block. “He did a very good thing by going over there.”

said Mr. Malone, 45, who identified himself as the mayor of the block.Nate Schweber contributed.

U.N. Seeks a More Nimble Response to Ebola in Africa

UNITED NATIONS — A shortage of international health workers and delays in building Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] treatment clinics in West Africa are forcing the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] to change course in fighting the virus, and to call for smaller and more mobile treatment units that make greater use of local staff — and in turn require more money.

The shift comes eight months after the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa was first identified. The virus is waning in some places and growing stronger elsewhere, and the international response so far has been unable to get the outbreak under control.

The most prominent international efforts have so far been focused on building large treatment centers. But by the time they are completed, they may not be where they are most needed.

For example, four 100-bed centers are to open soon in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, where reports of new cases have slowed significantly, while Sierra Leone, where new cases are escalating, is seriously short of treatment centers.

“We need to be more nimble and flexible,” Anthony Banbury, the head of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, said in an interview.

“Instead of trying to build 100-bed facilities, I believe we need smaller facilities, more geographically dispersed, and to rely more on trained national medical professionals to provide the clinical care,” he said.

The United Nations health system, however, has not been known for being nimble.

Many health advocates say the United Nations’ call for help in mid-September was very late, and the trust fund that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established — he asked for $1 billion in contributions — is still not fully funded. His special envoy, Dr. David Nabarro, said recently that an additional $500 million would be needed to pay for Ebola operations through next March. Both Dr. Nabarro and Mr. Banbury are to brief the General Assembly on Thursday. Their ability to curb the virus in West Africa is widely seen as a critical test for the organization.

The World Health Organization says that even as 4,700 treatment beds are needed, fewer than one-quarter of that number are in place, chiefly because there are not enough trained doctors and nurses to run Ebola treatment units, known as E.T.U.s.

Strife and poverty had crippled health systems in much of West Africa long before the Ebola outbreak. The United Nations says at least 5,000 more health care workers will be needed to control Ebola over the next year if the virus continues to spread in the three worst-affected countries.

“Had the international community decided they wanted to send what had been asked for early on — a lot of treatment facilities, with teams to manage them, the E.T.U.s-in-a-box kind of thing — that would have been great,” Mr. Banbury said. “That would have given us better capability on the ground now, and that would have led to a stronger response. But they didn’t.”

Mr. Banbury noted that in places where concentrated efforts had been made and more precautions were being taken, matters had improved and the spread of the virus had slowed.

Yet the positive effects of practices like safer burials of victims have been hard to measure. A majority of those who are known to have succumbed to Ebola are being buried safely, Mr. Banbury said, but it is not known how many victims die without ever coming to the attention of the authorities. Data is sparse.

According to the latest W.H.O. figures, 13,268 cases of Ebola have been reported, the overwhelming majority in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, and at least 4,960 people have died. Doctors Without Bordersissued a call this week[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/ebola-hard-won-gains-liberia-must-not-be-undermined?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=social] for the training of rapid response teams that could investigate new hot spots and coordinate contact tracing and treatment.

The Farewell Parties Are Just Beginning

Good Wednesday morning from Washington. Former President George W. Bush made a rare detour into public policy to criticize President Obama’s plans in Afghanistan, and Senator Mark Begich appears to have been defeated by the Republican Dan Sullivan in Alaska. But first up, members of Congress return for a session that, for many of them, will be a long goodbye.

The lame-duck session that opens on Wednesday on Capitol Hill will bring dozens of congressional careers — the sensational as well as the short-lived — to a close.

With more than 50 House members and nearly a dozen senators leaving either by their choice or by the voters’, colleagues will spend considerable floor time paying tribute to the dearly departing who left their imprint one way or another.

There’s Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who served a record 29 full terms and wrote reams of legislation. And there is Representative Vance McAllister, the Louisiana Republican who served 12 months and was done in by a videotaped extramarital kiss.

On the Democratic side, veteran heavyweights like Representatives George Miller and Henry A. Waxman, both of California, will be casting their final votes along with Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. Lame-duck Republicans include Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the bane of federal spending, and Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

Several conservatives at the forefront of the House Tea Party movement are also exiting stage right, notably Representative Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota congresswoman who founded the House Tea Party caucus.

Senate results are still outstanding in Louisiana, and vote-counting dragged on for a week in Alaska. Hopeful for more lame ducks, Republicans planned ahead and had already invited Alaska’s Mr. Sullivan to attend party organizational meetings this week.

Bush Tiptoes Into Public Arena to Question Obama on Afghanistan

Former President George W. Bush has largely stayed out of current policy debates, but as he kicked off a book tour on Tuesday, he expressed concern that withdrawing all American troops from Afghanistan would create an island of instability.

In an interview in College Station, Tex., on Tuesday after he presented “41: A Portrait of My Father,”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/us/politics/bush-43-shares-spotlight-with-bush-41-as-tribute-book-is-published.html?ref=politics] his new biography of the elder President Bush, the younger Mr. Bush offered support for President Obama’s decision to wage war on the Islamic State, but took issue with his successor’s plan to pull out of Afghanistan.

“I do worry that a lack of U.S. presence in Afghanistan will create a vacuum,” he said.

“I understand people’s fatigue and stuff,” he added, but the question should be, “Is it in the interest of the United States that young girls and women don’t suffer? Most audiences agree it’s in our interest.

“My worry, as is Laura’s by the way, is if we leave too soon that women and children, young girls, are going to suffer.”

In his book, Mr. Bush seemed to implicitly criticize Mr. Obama’s decision to pull all troops out of Iraq in 2011, attributing the rise of the Islamic State to “subsequent developments and decisions.” That withdrawal was actually included in an agreement that Mr. Bush struck with Iraq before leaving office, but some of his former aides have said that Mr. Obama should have tried harder to negotiate a new agreement.

“I’m not going to criticize our president,” Mr. Bush said, when asked about that passage. “But what I will say is I think he set” a necessary goal of defeating the Islamic State. “Whether or not the current strategy works, we’ve got to hope it does work.”

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama is leaving China and heading to Myanmar, where he will land in Naypyidaw, the capital, and attend an East Asia Summit gala dinner.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is traveling to Houston to speak at the annual convention of the American Association of Port Authorities.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the prospective majority leader, is hosting a morning coffee for Republican senators-elect before the Senate and House reconvene at 2 p.m.

Funny, Furious and Foul-Mouthed at the ‘Concert for Valor’

The Crowd Goes Wild: What could get bigger applause at a Veterans Day concert than a national anthem sung by Jennifer Hudson? On Tuesday night, it was Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.”

All Together Now: From John Oliver: “It’s lovely to hear people cursing in unison on the National Mall.” (Yes, yes, Mr. Oliver is a British comic, but his wife, Kate Norley, is a former Army medic and Iraq veteran.)

Come Back Anytime: The comedian George Lopez said he would visit Washington more often after last week’s vote to legalize marijuana. “There’s a lot of different things it can be used for,” he said, “medical purposes or video games.”

Bleep: It was advertised as a family friendly show. But that is not what Eminem is known for, and he didn’t disappoint. (He was the evening’s last performer. Maybe the kids were asleep?)

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Climate deal clinched.

Today’s landmark agreement[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/world/asia/china-us-xi-obama-apec.html] between the U.S. and China, the world’s biggest carbon polluters, would create targets to curb emissions and spur other countries to make cuts.

It could also recharge efforts to negotiate a new global climate agreement. But Republicans criticized the deal, saying it doesn’t require the Chinese to restrict carbon emissions for 16 years.

• Congress returns.

A seven-week break ends today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/us/politics/lame-duck-session-is-first-crucial-test-of-breaking-gridlock.html]. House and Senate lawmakers face a Dec. 11 deadline to renew spending authority for federal programs, including the arming and training of Syrian rebels.

Also this week, Republicans will choose their leaders for the session that begins in January. They added another member late Tuesday when the Republican candidate in Alaska defeated[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/11/us/ap-us-senate-alaska.html] the Democratic incumbent for a Senate seat.

• Riding the streaking comet.

The European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft successfully [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/science/space/european-space-agencys-spacecraft-lands-on-comets-surface.html]landed a probe[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/science/space/european-space-agencys-spacecraft-lands-on-comets-surface.html] for the first time ever on a comet, known as 67P.

The probe’s solar panels are to provide an hour’s worth of observation every couple of days until next March, when the surface of the comet becomes too hot.

• At the Supreme Court.

The justices are considering whether to allow same-sex couples in Kansas to wed after a federal judge ordered the state to stop enforcing its ban.

The court also hears arguments[http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/argument-preview-racial-gerrymandering-partisan-politics-and-the-future-of-the-voting-rights-act/] today on whether redistricting in Alabama overcrowded some areas with black Democrats on the basis of race or party.

• The Ebola response.

The Homeland Security secretary and top health officials are among those testifying today[http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/chairwoman-mikulski-announces-full-committee-hearing-us-government-response-ebola-outbreak] at a Senate hearing on the administration’s $6 billion funding request[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/us/politics/obama-to-ask-congress-for-6-billion-to-fight-ebola.html] to combat the virus.

And a nurses’ strikes that began Tuesday picks up steam today[http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0IW04K20141112?irpc=932] in more states. About 100,000 of them will demonstrate for tougher Ebola safety precautions at hospitals.

• Kerry to the Mideast.

Secretary of State John Kerry is heading[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/11/12/world/middleeast/12reuters-mideast-palestinians-kerry.html] to Jordan today for talks with King Abdullah about tensions in Jerusalem and the fight against the Islamic State.

Separate arson attacks[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/11/12/world/middleeast/12reuters-mideast-palestinians-israel-mosque.html] today on a mosque and synagogue in the West Bank and Israel are the latest in a wave of violence[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/11/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians-timeline.html].

• A 21-year education fight.

The South Carolina Supreme Court today ruled for rural school districts[http://www.thestate.com/2014/11/12/3807370/breaking-sc-supreme-court-finds.html?sp=/99/132/] in a 21-year-old education funding lawsuit, saying legislators had failed students.

• Following the pope’s lead?

American bishops will elect four among them to attend the synod at the Vatican next year in a vote today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/us/change-urged-by-pope-francis-is-rattling-hierarchy-of-roman-catholic-church.html] at their annual fall meeting in Baltimore.

The choices will be an indication of whether the group supports significant change or the status quo.

• Total ban on tobacco proposed.

Officials in Westminster, Mass., hold[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/12/us/ap-us-town-vs-tobacco.html] a public hearing today on banning sales of all tobacco and nicotine products. It would be the first such prohibition in the nation.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are adrift after indexes hit another record high. European stocks ended down sharply, and Asia closed mostly higher.

• Five big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, must pay a collective $3.16 billion in fines[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/british-and-u-s-regulators-fine-big-banks-3-16-billion-in-foreign-exchange-scandal/] for conspiring to manipulate the foreign currency market, U.S. and British regulators said today.

• Black Friday jockeying has begun.

JCPenney, Staples, Macy’s, Best Buy and Target plan to open earlier than ever[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-12/wal-mart-stretches-black-friday-deals-to-reach-shoppers.html] on Thanksgiving, while Walmart says it will spread its Black Friday sales over five days starting on the holiday.

• YouTube announced a subscription music service[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/business/media/youtube-introduces-a-paid-service-called-music-key.html] today after signing a licensing deal with independent record companies.

NOTEWORTHY

• Exercise and weight loss.

A study shows that a substantial number of people who take up an exercise regimen wind up heavier than when they started[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/exercising-but-gaining-weight/] — and not because of muscle weight.

• Extended stays.

Starting today, short-term tourist and business visas issued to citizens of China and the U.S. will increase[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/u-s-and-china-bid-for-tourism-with-expanded-visa-deal/] from one to 10 years; student and exchange visas grow from one to five years.

The arrangement comes out of this week’s Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Beijing.

• Baseball is back, already.

Stars of Major League Baseball play Japan’s national team in Game 1 of the Japan Series[http://m.mlb.com/japan-series/] in Osaka (live on MLB Network and MLB.TV at 4 a.m. Eastern, and re-aired at 9 p.m. on MLB Network).

• America’s welcome center.

Sixty years ago today, Ellis Island, New York’s main immigration point, closed. It’s now a museum, where an art exhibition[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/arts/design/jr-brings-ellis-islands-abandoned-hospital-to-life.html] is bringing the arrivals back to life.

BACK STORY

Ahead of today’s U.S.-China climate agreement[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/world/asia/china-us-xi-obama-apec.html], Beijing closed thousands of factories and barred millions of cars around the capital.

The goal was to try to control the pollution[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/air-quality-app-stops-providing-data-from-u-s-embassy/] there for the meeting of world leaders.

Both the restrictions and the pact to limit carbon emissions should be popular among the Chinese: The country has one of the world’s biggest — and least known — environmental movements.

The Chinese people mount an estimated 180,000 protests a year, with environmental degradation a significant rallying cry.

Crowds of thousands have closed chemical plants and prevented new ones from being built, blocked coal-fired power plants, and forced the cancellation of a major copper smelter.

In response, the Chinese government has tightened some environmental laws and promised a war on pollution[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/china-declares-war-against-pollution/].

But protests and pacts can accomplish only so much in an authoritarian country that puts political stability and economic growth first and often jails dissidents, including environmentalists[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/world/asia/14china.html].

No Video. No Photos. No Names. Inside New York’s Ebola Monitoring Operation.

New York City’s health department runs a 24-hour-a-day operation that defends against Ebola; its efforts include tracking more than 300 people for symptoms of the disease.

Anemona Hartocollis, a Metro health reporter, wrote [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/with-phone-calls-and-persistence-tracking-travelers-at-risk-for-ebola.html]about this effort, the largest in the country, in an article in The Times on Wednesday.

Here she chronicles her visit inside the nerve center of the city’s monitoring operation.

We’ve all heard the political debate over quarantine for Ebola patients.

Meanwhile, New York City has been monitoring as many as 357 people, mostly travelers returning from West Africa, for symptoms of the disease.

The number alone made it a massive operation, and my editor asked for an inside look.

So began several days of negotiations for access with the New York City health department. Dr. Craig Spencer, the first and only Ebola patient in New York, was still in the hospital (he got out Tuesday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-ebola-patient-bellevue.html]), and the health department was understandably worried that something could go wrong, and I would be “inside” in a position to pick up on it.

A sympathetic health department press officer, Megan Montalvo, explained that the department’s lawyers were sweating out the details of how much access I could have, because of concerns about, among other things, privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa.

Eventually, I received a somewhat lawyerly written document approving my visit to the inner sanctum of the monitoring operation, but only under certain conditions: no video; no photography in the room where the monitors worked; no publishing the names of those being monitored.

The big fear was that a videographer or photographer would capture the names of or other identifying information about the people being monitored for Ebola. I pushed back a little, arguing that the story would not make sense if a photographer was not allowed into the monitoring call center, and the lawyers eventually capitulated on that point.

The ensuing inside look turned out to be fascinating, with much material that fell, regrettably, to the cutting room floor, as I focused on the monitoring effort alone.

The photographer, Joshua Bright, and I attended one of the health department’s twice-daily, seven-days-a-week Ebola command meetings. Just walking into the room made me feel like I was in a movie about NASA.

Nine video screens lined the walls, and for some reason, many of them were tuned to images of blue sky and clouds. Health department chiefs sat around tables arranged in a long rectangle, their rather clunky-looking ThinkPads in front of them. A piece of plain white paper with the title of the department – Surveillance, Quarantine and Monitoring, for instance – was taped to the back of each laptop to identify the person sitting in front of it.

I have to admit that, as a taxpayer, I was secretly pleased the laptops were not more glamorous. (My Times-issued laptop is a battered ThinkPad, and it is not easy to carry around.)

Dr. Jay Varma, deputy commissioner for disease control and the “incident commander” for Ebola in New York, ran the meeting at warp speed, and much of it was in health department code, so I was glad the lawyers had permitted audio taping.

My favorite exchange never made it into the article.

Dr. Varma announced that his 10th-grade daughter had come home talking about an Ebola lesson she received in school. Sounding like the sleep-deprived, clueless parent of a teenager who does not share any more than necessary, he asked his colleagues: Were the schools giving mandatory Ebola training?

“Jay, did she come home wearing P.P.E.?” Dr. Don Weiss, the head of surveillance, piped up, using the now-ubiquitous initials for personal protective equipment.

“No, that’s standard in my house,” Dr. Varma shot back.

As it happens, and as I learned at that moment, there is no mandatory Ebola training in the schools – yet.

United Nations, struggling to keep up with the spread of the Ebola virus in specific localities and its decline in others, is changing battle tactics; UN's Mission for Ebola Emergency Response is moving away from building large treatment centers and is instead calling for smaller and more mobile units that can make greater use of local trained healthworkers.

As many as 18,000 nurses went on strike Tuesday and picketed in front of Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California over concerns about patient-care standards and Ebola. The two-day strike by the nurses, who have been in contract talks since July, was expected to affect at least 21 Kaiser hospitals and 35 clinics and last until 7 a.m. Thursday. Union officials said that nurses were striking over claims that there had been an erosion of patient-care standards for months and that the company had failed to adopt optimal safeguards for Ebola. The health care provider said that it was well equipped to handle any potential Ebola cases and that the reasons union leaders gave for walking out were not supported by facts. Facilities will remain open, though some elective procedures and routine appointments may be rescheduled, company officials said. Replacement nurses are in place, union officials said.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, which treated the only Ebola patient to die in the United States, will pay his relatives an undisclosed sum and create a charitable foundation in his name, the family’s lawyer said Wednesday. The agreement heads off a lawsuit from relatives of the man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died Oct. 8. Mr. Duncan, who arrived in Texas from Liberia on Sept. 20, was initially sent away from the hospital’s emergency room with antibiotics[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], something Presbyterian administrators have acknowledged was a mistake. Les Weisbrod, the lawyer, declined to say how much money the family would receive but said the settlement was a “very good deal” that would provide for Mr. Duncan’s parents and his four children. The foundation will assist efforts to fight Ebola in Liberia, he said. Mr.

Duncan’s nephew, Josephus Weeks, had been critical of the care Mr. Duncan received, saying his death was partly due to his race, nationality and lack of insurance. But on Wednesday, he credited hospital officials for moving quickly to settle the case and acknowledge mistakes.

First Outbreak Quashed, Ebola Reappears in Mali

The West African nation of Mali[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/mali/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], which just beat its first outbreak of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], has confirmed a second one that is larger and more threatening, global health authorities said on Wednesday.

The victim who apparently began the new outbreak was an imam who fell ill in Guinea and traveled to Mali for better treatment at a major private clinic in Bamako, the capital.

The new cases will add to the mounting total of Ebola victims. In its last update on Nov. 5, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said there had been more than 13,000 confirmed or suspected cases in West Africa since the epidemic began. Some 5,000 people have died.

The imam died at the Pasteur Clinic in Bamako on Oct. 27. Because of his status, his body was washed at a large mosque and then returned to Guinea for burial after a funeral at another mosque.

The Pasteur Clinic failed to diagnose Ebola as the underlying cause of the kidney failure[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/acute-kidney-failure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] for which it was treating the imam. Kidney failure is a possible complication of late-stage Ebola.

The outbreak was only detected after a nurse at the clinic fell ill and died, and the chief W.H.O. representative in Mali heard from his counterparts in Guinea that members of the imam’s family were dying.

“It was a real failure by the clinic,” the W.H.O. representative, Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, said in a telephone interview.

Now, the clinic is closed and under quarantine — as are the mosque in Bamako, one or two other Malian clinics where the imam was treated, and the large family compound where the nurse lived.

Among the patients quarantined at the clinic are 10 United Nations peacekeepers stationed in Mali who were wounded in fighting in the north.

On Wednesday evening, the Malian health authorities confirmed that one of the clinic’s doctors also had Ebola.

The clinic is now surrounded by police officers. Armored vehicles from the United Nations peacekeeping mission are parked nearby.

“Most nurses and doctors had gone home when the clinic was quarantined, and I fear the patients will be left without proper care,” said Dramane Maiga, the clinic’s director.

Health experts are trying to trace everyone with whom the imam, the nurse and others with suspected cases of Ebola came into contact.

The task will be complex, because the imam fell ill nearly a month ago, on Oct. 17, in Kourémalé, a town that straddles the Guinea-Mali border. The consequences for Mali were not recognized until Nov. 10, when doctors ordered an Ebola test on the dying Bamako nurse.

So far, 28 staff members at the Pasteur Clinic, which is not related to the Pasteur Institute in France or any of its African offshoots, have been quarantined, as have 50 people who had contact with the nurse.

A friend who visited the imam at the clinic has died of unknown causes and is considered a suspected case, although no blood samples are available to test, the W.H.O. said.

“We’re still working on the contact tracing,” Dr. Fall said. It is not yet clear how many people may have been exposed to the virus.

The mosque connection is worrisome, Dr. Fall added, because it is unclear how many people touched the imam’s body. No one has fallen ill there so far.

The imam traveled in a private car, not on public transportation, and at least four members of his family who were in the car are now ill or dead in Guinea.

His first wife has died, as has his daughter. The daughter died on Monday, and Ebola was suspected, but the family declined offers of a safe burial. The imam’s brother, second wife and son are ill and in Ebola treatment centers.

Teams including advisers from the W.H.O. and other health agencies are working at the clinic, the mosque and the border.

The Malian authorities have not closed the border, which is considered impractical. It is 500 miles long and crossed by many gravel roads. Also, in a holdover from the divisions of French colonialism, it separates many extended families who are used to traveling back and forth.

In addition, Mali has a longstanding tradition of welcoming both strangers and those with clan connections — a principle known as diatiguiya (pronounced JAH-tih-GEE).

The new outbreak is frustrating for the health authorities because they were feeling triumphant about their containment of the country’s first case[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/health/quick-response-and-old-fashioned-detective-work-thwart-ebola-in-mali.html]: a 2-year-old Guinean girl, Fanta Condé, who died in the town of Kayes in northwestern Mali on Oct. 24.

The authorities had quarantined 108 people who were briefly in contact with Fanta on buses from Guinea, at a family compound in Bamako and at the hospital in Kayes where she died. None had fallen ill, not even the three relatives who took her to Mali from Guinea on Oct. 19, and all 108 were to be released from quarantine by Friday.

When the new, unrelated cluster was first suspected on Monday, Dr. Rana Hajjeh, who directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in Mali that worked on the Fanta Condé case, mentioned it in an email and described it as “Murphy’s Law” — the tongue-in-cheek principle that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time.

Katarina Höije and Cheick Diouara contributed reporting from Bamako, Mali.

Officials Consider Scaling Back of Ebola Centers in Liberia

WASHINGTON — As the rate of new Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] infections in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] has slowed, American and Liberian officials are debating whether to build all 17 planned Ebola treatment centers in the country or to shift money from the Obama administration that was planned for the centers into other programs to combat future outbreaks.

The United States announced Monday that it had completed the first of the 100-bed centers, some 40 miles outside Monrovia, in Tubmanburg, and turned over its operation to the International Organization for Migration, the group that will staff and run the center.

Two other treatment units, in Sinje, to the north of Monrovia, and Buchanan, to the south, will be completed by the end of November, American military officials said. Seven additional treatment units across the country are in various stages of construction.

A 25-bed hospital recently opened outside Monrovia, and American and Liberian military officials are clearing the land for two more units. If all of them go ahead as planned, that would bring the total of units built by the American and Liberian militaries working together on the project to 13, or four short of the units promised by President Obama on Sept. 16.

But Mr. Obama’s promise came at the height of the epidemic when new cases were increasing at a brisk rate. Since then, the rate of new infections in Liberia has come down and several treatment units around the country have for more than a month reported empty beds. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that there had been a stabilization in the decline of new infections in Liberia, which reported 97 new cases last week.

Everyone involved, from the W.H.O. to the Liberian government to the Obama administration, has warned against complacency in international efforts to fight the disease. But both American and Liberian officials say that if the numbers continue to decline, it may be wiser to shift the funds toward other needs in the country.

“They would be fools to spend all that money on E.T.U.’s,” said Stephen D. Cashin, chief executive of the Pan African Capital Group and an adviser to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, speaking of the Ebola treatment units. “They’re better to spend the money on putting in place the expertise and skill sets and county medical clinics and health care to provide care to the masses of people of Liberia, and to create a system of movable clinics and testing centers and hot spots.”

Capt. Robert C. Langston, a public affairs officer with the United States Army in Monrovia, said that the Liberian government was taking the lead on deciding where and when the units would be built. But he said that the American military, which has 2,100 troops in Liberia, “will remain agile and flexible to respond quickly to needs on the ground as they change.”

American military officials say they now think that fewer American troops will deploy to West Africa to build units and train health workers than originally planned — perhaps 3,000 instead of 4,000.

Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Ziankahn, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, said in a telephone interview that a decision would be made soon on whether to go ahead with all of the planned treatment units. “There’s going to be some decision point as to whether we have to shift our efforts to something else,” he said.

Mr. Obama has asked Congress for $6 billion to fight Ebola in the United States and West Africa, a request that administration officials defended before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday.

“We believe we have the right strategy in place both at home and abroad,” Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said at the hearing. “Additional funding is needed, and that’s what we’re here to talk about today.”

If the full Congress approves the funding, it would be the single largest sum to combat Ebola from any country or international organization.

The request seemed to gain bipartisan support. The hearing had none of the contentiousness of one in the House last month when officials were grilled for hours about the initial flawed federal response to Ebola cases in the United States. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the committee, said she hoped the request would be granted, adding that it was similar to when President George W. Bush asked for emergency funding to fight bird flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in 2009.

“We’ve done this before,” she said.

Under the request, the Department of Health and Human Services would receive about $3 billion, a third of which would be spent in the United States on items such as personal protective equipment and monitoring travelers at American airports.

In the hardest hit countries in Africa, the money would go to bolstering infection control, including support for laboratories and to help develop a local health care work force trained in identifying outbreaks.

The State Department and the United States Agency for International Development would together receive nearly $3 billion to go toward supplies, logistics networks, burial teams and education to prevent the spread of the disease.

About $1.5 billion of the total $6 billion the federal agencies are asking for would go to a so-called contingency fund to be spread among federal agencies to meet unexpected and sudden needs, such as a vaccination campaign for health workers, should a vaccine become available.

About $250 million would go to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration to speed the development of vaccines and other therapies.

Researchers to Test New Treatments in Countries Hit Hardest by Ebola

Researchers on Wednesday announced that they would soon begin the first clinical trials to test experimental treatments for Ebola in the West African countries most affected by the outbreak.

Until now, such treatments have mainly been available to the small number of patients treated in the United States and Europe, not those in the epidemic’s epicenter.

“This is an unprecedented international partnership which represents hope for patients to finally get a real treatment against a disease that today kills between 50 and 80 percent of those infected,” Dr. Annick Antierens of the aid group Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.

The group said its treatment centers would be the sites of three clinical trials, to be run by European researchers. One study will test the drug Avigan, another the drug brincidofovir and the third will test blood or plasma transfusions from Ebola survivors.

The trials could begin in December, with results on whether the treatments work as early as February. Only a few hundred patients will participate in the trials, still a small portion of those infected in an outbreak that has already killed more than 5,000 people.

Officials in the United States are also planning at least one clinical trial in Africa that will probably involve more than one drug.

An ethical debate has erupted over whether some patients in the studies should be given a placebo to sharpen the comparison with those who get experimental therapies.

The three European-run trials will not include control groups that get placebos, with researchers there arguing that it would be unethical to deny people a treatment that could plausibly save their lives. A control group is not needed to tell if a drug is working, they say.

“None of us would consent to be randomized in such circumstances,” researchers wrote last month in the Lancet, a medical journal. Included among those who wrote the article was Peter Horby of Oxford University, who will run the brincidofovir trial.

They also argue that African patients will be less likely to participate in the trials if there were a chance they could receive a dummy pill.

“It is an option that will not be accepted by the local community,” said Dr. Johan van Griensven of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who will be in charge of the study testing blood and plasma transfusions, which will take place in Conakry, Guinea. The blood or plasma of those who recover from an infection is expected to contain antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that can neutralize the virus.

American officials say that since it is not known if drugs work, patients are not necessarily being deprived if they get a placebo. They say trials with control groups provide clearer answers.

Still, federal officials are trying to minimize the number of patients who would get a placebo.

There are likely to be practical problems running clinical studies in the midst of an epidemic, with health care systems already breaking down. The public health authorities had previously announced that trials of two experimental Ebola vaccines were expected to begin soon in West Africa.

The relationship between the United States and China has been in the spotlight this week as President Obama and President Xi Jinpingdined with each other[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/putin-drapes-chinas-first-lady-in-a-jacket-and-invites-speculation/] in Beijing, took short walks in the wintry night air and announced agreements[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2014/11/12/president-obama-joins-president-xi-china-joint-press-conference] on climate change[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/world/asia/climate-change-china-xi-jinping-obama-apec.html], trade and military cooperation. On Wednesday, after eating his fill of Peking duck during the visit, his second to China since taking office, Mr. Obama flew to Myanmar, while Mr. Xi returned to the business of governing the world’s most populous nation.

Observers have offered their insights throughout the week to The Times. Among them is Ely Ratner[http://www.cnas.org/RatnerEly], senior fellow and deputy director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Before that, Dr. Ratner served with the United States State Department as the lead political officer covering China’s external relations in Asia. He has also worked at the RAND Corporation and as a staff member on the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His recent writings have focused on competition over resources and territory[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/world/asia/spratly-archipelago-china-trying-to-bolster-its-claims-plants-islands-in-disputed-waters.html] in the South China Sea.

Following are Dr. Ratner’s thoughts on the state of United States-China ties:

There is growing alarm in Washington about the direction Xi Jinping is taking China with rising nationalism, xenophobia and assertiveness toward its neighbors. At the same time, it appears Xi is more serious than his predecessors about economic reform and more prepared to make significant contributions on global issues of importance to the United States like Ebola, Afghanistan and climate change. So despite having serious concerns, U.S. policy makers also see considerable opportunity.

What this means from a policy-making perspective is that the administration wants to remain focused on concrete initiatives with China to better manage areas of competition and to cooperate on issues of common interest. This means forgoing big sweeping pronouncements and breakthroughs and instead aiming for practical, high-impact outcomes. You’ll hear this loud and clear from the administration next week.

Personally I don’t think it’s right to say there’s been a downturn in relations or that we’re at a low point in a cycle. It would be a mistake to view increased frictions as the result of inattention or clumsy policy. Instead, the rise of China is at once intensifying areas of competition and opening new opportunities for cooperation. This puts a priority on sustained high-level diplomacy to manage the former and pursue the latter. It’s no accident that Obama has met with his Chinese counterpart more than any American president in history.

If you want to gauge the health of the U.S.-China ties, the key question is whether both sides remain invested in the relationship, and despite increased tensions over the likes of cyber and maritime issues, the answer remains a resounding yes.

Special Edition: An Old Congress Returns, and It Means Business

Good Thursday morning from Washington, where the last session of the 113th Congress is underway, Democrats are looking to expand their leadership ranks, and members of both parties are preparing to pass some legislation — at last. Plus, we investigate the origins of the “lame duck.”

There’s an old saying in Washington that elections have consequences, and that’s already playing out after last week’s vote.

The lame-duck Senate hadn’t been in session for 30 minutes on Wednesday when Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat trying to save her seat in a runoff, took the floor clamoring yet again for a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.

The stunning result was that after months of impasse, Ms. Landrieu is finally going to get a vote as early as Tuesday. Not to be outdone, the House raced to approve its own Keystone bill, which is sponsored by Ms. Landrieu’s Republican opponent, Representative Bill Cassidy.

The out-of-nowhere Keystone votes have obvious political overtones[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/11/12/mcconnell-offers-louisiana-republican-a-seat-if-he-wins/], but both parties also showed a sudden willingness to fight other issues on the floor rather than skirting showdowns. Democrats, for example, moved on a bill to place new rules on the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance program[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/223938-reid-sets-up-nsa-reform-vote].

“The American people are wondering whether Congress can get anything done,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and author of the surveillance legislation. “The answer is yes.”

The outbreak of lawmaking raises the question of what might have happened if the Senate had tried this before the election.

— Carl Hulse

Is There Room at the Democrats’ Leadership Table for Warren and Klobuchar?

Despite losing at least eight seats in the Senate and a dozen in the House[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/midterm-elections.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar], congressional Democrats appear ready to stand pat in their leadership elections set for this morning.

Republicans, giddy with their gains on both sides of the Rotunda, aren’t about to mess with their leaders.

There are reasons for the Democrats to stick with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Reid is known for catering to the needs of the party’s senators and has built up plenty of goodwill; Ms. Pelosi is a fund-raising titan whom Democrats can’t afford to lose. That doesn’t mean there is not unrest in the ranks[http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/nancy-pelosi-frustration-democrats-112644.html], but there’s not enough to topple anyone.

The most interesting wrinkle for Senate Democrats is that there appears to be some sentiment to bring Senator Elizabeth Warren [http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/11/12/democrats-look-to-raise-senator-warrens-profile/] of Massachusetts to the leadership table.

She proved to be a big draw on the campaign trail and is a strong fund-raiser with a significant progressive following[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/politics/warren-is-now-the-hot-ticket-on-the-far-left.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar]. The current leadership team would like to tap into her skills.

Democrats also want to find a high-profile spot for another smart, hardworking senator: Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/2014/10/25/democrat-amy-klobuchar-feels-at-home-in-iowa/17941649/]

— Carl Hulse

Now There Are Six: A Record Number of G.O.P. Women in the Senate

Last week’s election will increase the number of those lawmakers who have traditionally been as numerous as Washington daffodils in February: Republican women in the Senate. The 114th Congress will have six of them, up from four in the current Congress and topping the record of five Republican women who served simultaneously in the middle of the past decade.

Twenty women from both parties serve in the departing Senate, but next year’s total will depend on the fate of Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, which will be decided in a runoff next month[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/in-louisiana-challenger-pushes-landrieu-to-runoff.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar].

The senior Republicans are Senator Susan Collins of Maine, first elected in 1997, who just cruised to re-election, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was sworn-in in 2002. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Deb Fischer of Nebraska are in their first terms, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Joni Ernst of Iowa will join their ranks in January. They are the first women elected to the Senate from their states.

There will be at least 103 women in[http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/11/12/elections-house-undecided-slaughter-brownley/] Congress come January, but only 21 or 22 of those in the House will be Republicans (an Arizona House race has not been called[http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/11/12/barber-mcsally-race-200-ballots-found/18927081/]). The Republican total is up from the 19 in the 113th Congress but down from the 24 in the 112th Congress.

Women — especially Republicans — have struggled to increase their ranks in Congress, doubling their number in some years only to take a step back in the next. The road has been especially hard in the Senate, where 29 Democratic women have served compared with 15 Republicans in congressional history.

“While it is a milestone,” Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said of the new tally, “men will still make up about 90 percent of the Republican members in the Senate.”

— Jennifer Steinhauer

Correction: An earlier version of this post reported that there will be at least 103 women in the House come January. There will be at least 103 women in Congress.

Food Service Strike Threatens to Create a Lunch-Hour Crunch

Members of Congress, government workers and even tourists may have to brown-bag it today.

Hundreds of food service workers and janitors at the Capitol Visitors Center, the Pentagon, the National Zoo, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, and the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center are planning to strike, demanding better wages and benefits from the contractors that employ them.

They’re hoping to press President Obama for executive orders that would give priority in federal contracts to companies that pay workers $15 an hour and provide benefits — including health insurance and paid leave — or offer employees their own contracts.

Mr. Obama has already issued orders requiring contractors to pay a higher minimum wage[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/us/politics/obama-raises-minimum-wage-for-contract-workers.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar] and disclose workplace safety violations[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/business/us-contractors-to-face-new-rule-on-labor-practices.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar]. That was “the minimum” he could do, said Paco Fabian, communications director at Change to Win Federation, a union-backed consumer advocacy group that helped organize the strike.

With Mr. Obama in Asia for a meeting of world leaders, the workers are taking their case to Congress and will picket the Capitol Visitors Center.

— Julie Hirschfeld Davis

Committee Leaders’ Priorities Are Clear, Even Before Taking Up Their Gavels

He faces a climate-change denier leading the Senate Environment Committee, one of the loudest immigration opponents with the gavel of the Senate Budget Committee, a dogged opponent of his Wall Street regulations heading the Banking Committee, and a mercurial antagonist at the helm of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

President Obama must really be looking forward to the new Republican Senate.

Senator John McCain of Arizona has been sniping at Mr. Obama’s foreign policy ideas since the 2008 election[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03mccain.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar]. From Mr. McCain’s post at the Armed Services panel, his criticisms will have far more bite. The president has been making progress on climate change. Now, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma will get to weigh in from the Environment Committee, and he calls the whole notion a hoax[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/on-climate-change-a-gloat-and-a-warning/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar].

Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the new chairman of the Banking Committee, is no fan of the Dodd-Frank regulations[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43425.html] passed after the 2008 financial crisis. Look for him to try to chip away at them.

And then there’s Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama at the Budget Committee. He’s already threatening to shut down the government[http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/jeff-sessions-government-funding-immigration] if Mr. Obama loosens immigration law enforcement through executive action.

“Congress should not fund any activity that it thinks is not worthy of funding,” Mr. Sessions fumed on Wednesday.

— Jonathan Weisman

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama is in Myanmar, where he will meet with members of its parliament and President Thein Sein.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is speaking at the AFL-CIO and American Federation of Teachers summit meeting, then meeting with humanitarian and faith groups to discuss the Ebola response.

The House is expected to vote on authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline project.

If It Walks Like a Lame Duck and Swims Like One, It’s Probably Congress

The lame-duck Congress is waddling its way to the end of the year, but where, exactly, did the term come from?

Like many catchphrases, the term is not American at all. According to the Congressional Research Service’s history of such sessions[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL33677.pdf], the expression originated in 18th-century Britain as a reference to businessmen who had gone broke. Colleagues likened them to game birds that had been shot. In the 1830s, the name had been redefined to mean defeated lawmakers whose days were numbered.

The name has unflattering connotations, but the sessions can often be productive[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/we-are-not-doomed-to-endless-gridlock/]. The 2010 session even inspired President Obama to declare that “we are not doomed to endless gridlock.”

— Alan Rappeport

What We’re Reading Elsewhere

In The New Yorker, Jeffrey Franks provides a history of “midterm mood swings.”[http://www.newyorker.com.proxy.bc.edu/news/daily-comment/midterm-mood-swings]

Politico interviewed Nancy Pelosi [http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/nancy-pelosi-112799.html], who said last week’s elections did not represent a “wave of approval for the Republicans.”

Last week’s elections did not help the National Rifle Association[http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120236/2014-midterms-boosted-gun-control-and-hurt-nra], The New Republic says.

Videos of Jonathan Gruber, an administration adviser on the Affordable Care Act, continue to surface in which he criticizes American voters, going so far as to call them stupid. The details and videos are at The Daily Caller[http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/12/in-third-video-obamacare-architect-talks-about-basic-exploitation-of-american-voters-video/], The Hill[http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/223911-third-video-surfaces-of-obamacare-consultant-slamming-us-voters] and the Fox News website[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/12/another-tape-surfaces-obamacare-architect-calling-american-people-stupid/].

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Back to business.

Freshmen victorious in last week’s elections descended on Washington[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/us/politics/rookies-prepare-for-life-at-bottom-of-congresss-food-chain.html] for bipartisan sessions that will help them get ready for their new lives.

Senate Republicans unanimously chose Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as their majority leader for the next congressional session.

• Publishing feud is settled.

Amazon and Hachette said today that they have resolved their bitter fight over e-books and signed a new contract.

Neither side gave details, but Hachette has the ability to set the prices on its e-books[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html], which was a major battleground in the dispute.

• Comet-probe problem.

The landing of a European Space Agency probe[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/science/space/philae-rosetta-spacecraft-bounced-at-landing.html] on a comet Wednesday turned out to be three separate landings because a thruster failed to anchor the probe to the surface, engineers said today.

In its final position, the probe’s solar panels may not be able to recharge when its batteries drain in a couple of days.

• Shifting course on Ebola.

Clinical trials may begin as soon as next month in West Africa for experimental treatments for Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/health/researchers-to-test-new-treatments-in-countries-hit-hardest-by-ebola.html]. Until now, such treatments have been available mainly to patients in the U.S. and Europe.

The rate of new infections in Liberia has slowed; but Mali, which just beat its first outbreak, confirmed a second one[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/health/mali-reports-a-second-larger-ebola-outbreak.html] that is larger.

• World Cup inquiry is questioned.

Soccer’s governing body, FIFA, cleared Russia and Qatar[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/sports/fifa-inquiry-clears-qatar-and-russia-in-world-cup-bids.html] today of wrongdoing in their successful bids to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.

Its report was immediately contested by the lawyer who conducted the two-year corruption investigation.

• Frankenweapons.

Representatives from many nations meet today in Geneva to consider restrictions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/science/weapons-directed-by-robots-not-humans-raise-ethical-questions.html] on weapons relying on artificial intelligence. Critics warn they could become difficult for humans to control.

• Cold from coast to coast.

Frigid temperatures — in some cases 25 to 40 degrees below normal — are in store today for much of the U.S., the National Weather Service[http://www.weather.gov/] says.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are choppy today after an uneven Wednesday.

European stocks ended ahead. In Asia, the Nikkei reached another seven-year high.

• Hasbro, which already has its own TV and movie studio, is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/hasbro-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-dreamworks-animation/], producer of the Shrek films, media reports say.

• A fifth death, this one in Malaysia, was linked to airbags made by the Japanese supplier Takata, leading to a new recall by Honda[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/business/international/honda-issues-fresh-recall-after-death-in-malaysia-is-linked-to-airbag.html] today.

Takata also rebutted claims by former employees that it concealed signs of defects in airbag tests[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/business/takata-offers-its-rebuttal-to-report-of-secret-airbag-tests.html] in 2004.

• Sony is announcing today a web-based subscription service called PlayStation Vue[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/business/media/sony-to-introduce-web-based-tv-service.html] with a personalized, searchable approach to live and on-demand television.

NOTEWORTHY

• An amount that computes.

Steven A. Ballmer of Microsoft fame is donating an unspecified amount to Harvard University[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/gift-from-ballmer-will-expand-computer-science-faculty-at-harvard/] that will expand its computer science faculty members by 50 percent.

Mr. Ballmer, now owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, graduated from Harvard in 1977. The university’s computer science graduate program is ranked 18th by U.S. News & World Report.

• A Cy Young odd couple.

A repeat winner and a virtual unknown take pitching’s highest honors[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/sports/baseball/cy-young-winners-clayton-kershaw-is-unanimous-corey-kluber-is-unexpected.html] this year.

Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers won for the third time and shares the award with Corey Kluber, a former fourth-round draft pick with the Cleveland Indians.

• Soaring art prices.

A 1963 Andy Warhol painting[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/arts/design/a-warhol-leads-a-night-of-big-bids-at-christies-.html] of Elvis Presley pointing a gun sold for nearly $82 million on Wednesday night, part of an $852.9 million auction haul for Christie’s and its highest one-night take.

• “Duck Dynasty” on stage.

Members of the Robertson family[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/theater/duck-dynasty-musical-las-vegas.html], from the A&E reality series, have persuaded a team from Broadway to bring their story to Las Vegas.

• Tech tips.

We tell you how to create a sharper listening experience on your smartphone[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/technology/personaltech/audio-equalizer-and-enhancement-apps-beyond-the-smartphone-sound.html], how to find the best map apps[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/technology/personaltech/the-map-apps-that-move-you-in-the-right-direction.html] and how to erase personal information from your iPad[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/technology/personaltech/how-to-erase-personal-information-from-an-ipad.html].

• For the record book, literally.

A Harlem Globetrotters star will try to make the farthest basketball shot backward in Phoenix, and the Shangri-La Hotel in China is trying to have the most people eating breakfast in bed.

They’re two of many efforts being undertaken today for Guinness World Records Day[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/11/gwr-day-2014-worlds-tallest-and-shortest-men-set-to-meet-for-the-first-time-61584/].

BACK STORY

President Obama is meeting his counterpart today in Myanmar[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/world/asia/obama-will-try-to-push-myanmar-back-on-the-path-toward-democracy.html]. On his itinerary, though, his destination is listed as Burma.

The U.S. and other nations, including Britain, continue to use this name because the military rulers that changed the name[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/20/world/burma-takes-another-name-now-the-union-of-myanmar.html] to Myanmar 25 years ago were not democratically elected.

The country has been under authoritarian rule since 1962, but it is scheduled to hold a general election next fall.

That doesn’t mean all is rosy. A parliamentary committee voted against an amendment that would have allowed the leading opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/world/asia/for-some-daw-aung-san-suu-kyi-falls-short-of-expectations-in-myanmar.html], a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, to run for president.

And last week, a report said that the military had committed atrocities against an ethnic minority. It is also increasing the persecution[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-rakhine-state-thailand-malaysia.html] of a separate minority, 100,000 of whom are confined to miserable camps.

That news may mean a politically fraught exercise for Mr. Obama as he pushes for more reforms[http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/exclusive-irrawaddy-interviews-us-president-barack-obama.html] while praising the country’s progress.

AUSTIN, Tex. — Texas recently closed the book on its first cases of Ebola. The remaining people still being monitored after having come into contact with the man who died of the disease in Dallas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22}] last month, or with two nurses who contracted it[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/ebola-outbreak-texas.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22}], were cleared a week ago. But the virus, or something like it, can be expected to return, said the new head of a state task force on infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Brett Giroir, the chief executive of Texas A&M Health Science Center[http://www.tamhsc.edu/], described the first case as a shot across the bow. (Texas A&M is a corporate sponsor of the Texas Tribune.)

“We live in a global world,” he said. “We’re an airline away from anywhere. It’s going to be Ebola, or it’s going to be other diseases.”

Whatever it proves to be, Dr. Giroir will play a significant role in shaping the state’s response. Gov. Rick Perry tapped[http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/20194/] the 54-year-old biomedical researcher last month to lead the Texas Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response.

It is the latest in a career full of prestigious posts for a man from humble beginnings. The first member of his family to go to college, Dr. Giroir earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University and his medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He later became an office director at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency[http://www.darpa.mil/default.aspx], which invests in technology research for the Defense Department.

There, he caught the eye of Guy Diedrich, then a Texas A&M University System vice chancellor, who was looking for someone to oversee efforts to create a biotechnology corridor in the Brazos Valley. (The university system is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)

Dr. Giroir joined the system in 2008 and, as the vice chancellor for strategic initiatives, led a successful effort to win a $285.6 million federal contract[https://www.texastribune.org/2012/06/18/m-system-lands-major-federal-biosecurity-contract/] to establish a center for developing medical responses to pandemic diseases and bioterror threats. That center is now part of the health science center, which he has run since last year[https://www.texastribune.org/2013/09/09/biosecurity-leader-head-m-health-science-center/].

“Brett has been working, and excelling, his entire career for this sort of moment,” Mr. Diedrich, who now works for Cisco Systems, said of the recent crisis.

Over all, Dr. Giroir said, the state’s brush with the virus “went pretty well” — “but only because a lot of people made incredible efforts to make it go well despite systems that were not prepared for it,” he said.

Among the biggest missteps, he said, were public assurances that the virus would not spread beyond Thomas Eric Duncan, the person with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States. That led to distrust when it did spread, Dr. Giroir said.

While doctors initially missed the meaning of Mr. Duncan’s symptoms, Dr. Giroir added, “that will never happen again in the U.S. The first patient is always the hardest to diagnose.”

Dr. Giroir also said: “It’s tragic that Mr. Duncan died. People die with Ebola. There are things we wish would have happened. I’m not sure he would have survived under any circumstances.”

Though the first report from the task force is not due until Dec. 1, it has already issued some recommendations. The task force called for the establishment of two specialized Ebola treatment facilities and new protocols for determining if and when people need to be quarantined. “You do what you need to do,” Dr. Giroir said, “but it should be as least intrusive on people’s lives and liberty as possible given what you know about the science.”

Dr. Giroir said that some coming task force proposals “relating to how we layer local, state and federal control” could prove controversial. Some would require legislative action to implement.

He also argued for a national equivalent of his position, focusing on all biological threats, not just Ebola. The two previous White House administrations had a special assistant for biodefense.

“For the task force, I’m in charge,” Dr. Giroir said. “There’s not that analogy at the federal level.”

How Did Obama Lose American Voters?

In December 2012, 56 percent of Americans approved of President Obama’s leadership. About 40 percent disapproved.

Today, those numbers are almost precisely reversed[http://www.gallup.com/poll/113980/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Job-Approval.aspx], a fact that Democrats were made keenly aware of in the fall campaign and in the midterm elections.

“The public’s confidence is gone, and it doesn’t seem to be coming back,” says Ross Douthat at The New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-how-obama-lost-america.html?_r=0].

So what happened?

Mr. Douthat offers not a unified theory but four “partial” ones: Republican intransigence, an incomplete economic recovery from the Great Recession, Obamacare and foreign policy crises.

Indeed, partial theories are popular among observers, and many land on similar issues. In an account of Obama’s second term, Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura, writing at The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/where-did-obama-go-wrong/2014/11/03/f0196c0a-61e2-11e4-8b9e-2ccdac31a031_story.html], detail what amounts to a war of attrition between the White House and Congress, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress on legislation of any kind.

What all the parties had to show for it, after multiple failures on policy and a government shutdown, was nothing but disapproval, The Post reporters write: “The president’s approval ratings took a nose dive, and Congress’s were even worse.”

For Andrew Sullivan at The Dish[http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/11/04/where-did-obama-go-wrong/], “a fanatically obstructionist and increasingly extreme GOP” wanted to undermine the president with a strategy “hatched privately before Obama even took office.”

“They judged early on that the real promise of Obama — his ambition to transcend the old politics in favor of pragmatic reform — could be killed if they simply refused to play along,” Mr. Sullivan writes.

On the economy, Peter Foster at The Telegraph[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/11150023/Barack-Obama-the-end-of-a-love-affair.html] says: “Since Mr. Obama took office facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 6 percent and American businesses have created 10 million new jobs — that’s more than Japan, Europe and every other advanced economy combined.”

Problem is, he adds, many of those “jobs are ‘McJobs’ — that is, low-paid and part-time work that don’t leave people feeling better off.” On top of that, “in numerical terms, G.D.P. has risen by 8 percent since Mr. Obama took office, but median household incomes are down.”

Mr. Douthat agrees: “Even with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment, especially for the middle class,” and adds that it “isn’t necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering. It’s an example of voter patience persisting for a while, and finally running out.”

“The most persuasive answer to the question” — where did Obama go wrong? — “was the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov,” Mr. Sullivan says. “No one else can be blamed for this, and it hit the president’s ratings like a ten-ton truck.”

Mr. Douthat points to competence as a general concern for the public with this administration and identifies the roll-out as a key moment: “The health care law is Obama’s signature issue, it remains largely unpopular (even if support for full repeal is weak), and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the president’s approval.”

Yet for Mr. Sullivan, this is only the start of the narrative: “What this superficial version of events misses is what happened next. The truth is: the Obama team subsequently achieved a near-miraculous rescue of Obamacare, achieved real success in enrollment, and have seen core healthcare costs slow down in such a way that could yet shift our long-term fiscal liabilities for the better.”

Still, as Mr. Foster points out, “Like George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama’s approval numbers never recovered from the sight of his flagship piece of legislation capsizing so ignominiously before it had even left the harbour.”

Mr. Douthat suggests that the president “had an edge that Democratic politicians often lack: The public trusted him on foreign policy.”

But, he writes, one crisis after another — Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Ebola — eroded that trust and “made Obama’s position irrecoverable.”

While acknowledging that Mr. Obama’s refusal “to engage in the theatrical parts of the presidency looks terrible during crises,” Danny Vinik at The New Republic[http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120022/obama-better-crisis-manager-media-gives-him-credit], like Mr. Sullivan, defends the president on issues like ISIS, at least on substantive grounds: “It’s more important that the president craft effective policy responses to crises. Obama has done that — and the media coverage has missed it completely, focusing instead on Obama’s rhetorical shortcomings and downplaying his policy successes.”

Conor Friedersdorf at The Atlantic[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/politics/archive/2014/11/why-president-obama-hasnt-earned-our-approval/382265/] has an entirely different log of reasons to disapprove of Mr. Obama’s performance. His list includes warrantless wiretapping, a failure to punish illegal torture, a costly and ruinous war on drugs, the unacknowledged moral costs of drone strikes, the president’s “secret kill list,” an out-of-control national-security state and the president’s persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists who’ve worked with them.

“Confronted with all of those transgressions, more than four in 10 Americans still approve of the job Obama is doing,” Mr. Friedersdorf writes. “And most of them are loyal Democrats. Partisanship and tribalism are overriding the moral compass of too many liberals.”

For Elias Isquith at Salon[http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/where_obama_went_wrong_how_failing_to_seize_the_radical_moment_explains_his_terrible_week/], the root of the president’s problems is not to be found in specific events or issues but in his temperament. Many moderates see “Obama’s penchant for working from within the system rather than trying to disrupt it” as a real plus.

But, he asks, was this temperamental conservatism “the wrong fit for the current era, when major reforms are so desperately needed”?

Mr. Isquith turns back to a 2009 Harper’s article by Kevin Baker[http://harpers.org.proxy.bc.edu/archive/2009/07/barack-hoover-obama/], predicting that Mr. Obama would fail, because he would be unable “to seize the radical moment at hand.”

For Mr. Isquith, “Rather than recognize how ideological and partisan realignment and polarization had effectively changed the rules of the Senate,” the president went looking for consensus where none existed.

“At this point, there is no question that President Obama will fall short of initial expectations,” Mr. Isquith says. “But more than the failure to pass any one particular bill, the disappointment stems from the president’s dogged insistence on being a reformer during a radical era.”

But perhaps our focus on the presidency is itself skewed. The presidency is the central element in our political system, but as Aaron David Miller writes[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/14/peak_president_american_leadership], maybe the problem is our expectation of the presidency itself.

He argues at Foreign Policy (and in his book “The End of Greatness: Why America Can’t Have (and Doesn’t Want) Another Great President”): “The centrality of the presidency must be reconciled with the limitations of the office and the constraints that bind it. The presidency has always been an implausible, some might even say an impossible, job. But the following mix of challenges and constraints — some old, some new — has made the post-World War II presidency harder still: constitutional and practical constraints on the office itself; the president’s expanding reach and responsibilities; the expanding role of a government we trust less, even when we demand more from it; America’s global role; and an intrusive, omnipresent, and nonstop media.”

“Greatness in the presidency is too rare to be relevant in our modern times and — driven as it is in our political system by big crisis — too risky and dangerous to be desirable. Our continued search for idealized presidents raises our expectations and theirs, skews presidential performance, and leads to an impossible standard that can only frustrate and disappoint. To sum up: We can no longer have a truly great president, we seldom need one, and, as irrational as it sounds, we may not want one, either.”

He concludes: “Historic greatness in the presidency has gone the way of the dodo. And it is unlikely to return any time soon.”

Knowing how, when and where to book that first safari can be complicated, said Jennifer Goetz, a founder of Your African Safari,[http://www.yourafricansafari.com/] a new website dedicated to helping travelers research and locate a reliable safari company that’s right for them.

Ms. Goetz, an avid safari traveler, and her partner, Javier Luque, began testing the site last year with information and itineraries from operators they knew personally.

“We started by focusing on the main countries and parks,” she said. “Then we added some of the big tour operators as fodder, and before long, the site mushroomed.”

The website includes thousands of photos, reviews and articles by tour operators and journalists and offers users the chance to perform searches and compare itineraries from more than a thousand tour companies in 76 parks across 14 countries.

Users can ask for quotes from multiple companies at once and request more information through the site.

It’s also an outlet for sharing experiences, good or bad, with others. “I’ve been on many safaris, and there are a lot of rogue operators,” Ms. Goetz said. “There’s not a lot of policing of that being done.”

She and Mr. Luque hope to incorporate lodges into the site soon, something every traveler on safari wants these days, she said.

Regarding Ebola, Ms. Goetz said she was happy to see an increase in articles dispelling its myths, including an article on her website[http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/ebola-virus-and-african-safaris] reminding travelers of how difficult it is to contract the virus in an airplane.

It also notes that most countries in the south and east are conducting thorough screenings of travelers entering those countries, including temperature screenings, and that Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, which receive the bulk of Africa’s tourists, have not been affected by the virus and are not under any type of travel restriction or medical alert.

Keeping Children Alive in Sierra Leone

Arriving at Port Loko, one of the largest towns in the north of Sierra Leone, is like reaching a country under siege. In the face of Ebola, the 500,000 inhabitants of this district have been sealed off from the world, stigmatized like a cellblock of criminals, and left largely to fend for themselves. Even to bring them food and schoolbooks, you need a government pass. And they are not alone. Counting other districts under quarantine, more than a third of the nation cannot move freely.

There is something chillingly familiar about the fear, suspicion and desperation I saw. The military checkpoints, the closing of schools and entire towns, people begging and queuing for scarce relief food all reminded me of a childhood in the 1990s I would rather forget -- one of civil war, displacement and peril. Many people told me they thought today's Ebola crisis was worse than the war, because at least we could see or hear the enemy then.

During two weeks in late October I was on a mission to bring food and supplies to a Port Loko orphanage where 39 children and one teacher had just completed a 21-day quarantine. In those three weeks, the children received no outside help. No food. No visitors. No games. No real schooling, despite the teacher's presence; her task was simply keeping them alive.

''I've got nothing for these kids,'' she told me. ''They have nowhere to go. There's no food, nothing.''

It made me realize that what may be in the shortest supply in Sierra Leone is hope for the future. Each day further into the epidemic, it becomes harder to imagine how to recapture time lost -- not just in the caring of parents who have died, but in education when schools are closed, in income when people can't work, in food cultivation and road-building when cash itself has run dry.

Ebola is not just a health emergency. It is a tragedy that has swept away fragile new roots for a new society, put down after the decade of civil war. While a vast majority of Sierra Leone's 6.1 million people have not been infected, Ebola has loosed many other threats that will linger long after the virus is quelled.

The orphanage and Port Loko are emblematic. Every place I visited felt locked down, even in the ways people showed emotion. When I reached my mother's home, she kept her distance -- no hug or touch. ''For your protection,'' she said.

Perhaps the most tragic challenge is what is happening to Sierra Leone's children while schools across the country are closed -- at least until March, the government says, but that seems optimistic. I can understand the logic of closing schools during an Ebola outbreak to lessen the chances of contact with others. Still, I can't help but wonder whether, in the short run, Sierra Leone's children would be safer in schools than languishing at home, with very little food and almost no mental stimulation.

It is not as if they are safely alone. In fact, there can be as many as two dozen people -- relatives, neighbors -- sheltering together in a small house. And contagion from them is not the only danger. There are also widespread and sickening reports that girls, cooped up for weeks at a time, are being raped. This points toward a surge of pregnant teenagers, whose hope of reaching their intellectual potential by staying in school will be dashed. My mother, an elementary school teacher in Freetown, knows of at least four of her sixth graders who are pregnant. When she is outside and recognizes any of the girls she teaches, she worries they will be attacked sexually or exposed to the virus: girls especially, because their families are likely to press them into taking care of someone sick with Ebola.

The streets are not the place for girls, she says. They should be in school. But Ebola has killed many qualified teachers, who were in desperately short supply even before the epidemic. And the teachers who remain are forbidden to hold informal learning sessions because the government has prohibited gatherings of more than five people. (Curiously, though, authorities have allowed large groups of worshipers to go to churches and mosques.)

This presents a grave contrast to almost any other type of humanitarian crisis -- even most wars. In those, one strategy is to keep children in school when possible; there, children have some protection from the turmoil outside, are cared for by responsible adults, and can be helped to build resilience against hardship.

Closed schools also mean more children will fall into illiteracy, which is already too high, and leave the society more vulnerable to future health crises. Sierra Leone's Ebola victims include a disproportionate share who could not read the billboards and other public messages advising them how to stay safe.

The government is making some effort to broadcast lesson plans over the radio, but those boring programs don't distinguish among grade levels or ignite a child's spirit of inquiry. And, of course, the poorest families don't own a radio.

Still, children instinctively crave learning, and I met many even under these awful circumstances. One group of girls, on their own initiative, had arranged a study club that met in order, as one girl said, to keep their minds alive.

At an official discharge ceremony of 41 patients who had been treated for Ebola, I asked two children what they most wanted now. First, they said, food. Then school.

I handed them a couple of bags, holding pencils, pens, paper, crayons and books. They were grateful. In those simple items, they saw hope.

Liberia President, Citing Ebola Gains, Ends State of Emergency

MONROVIA, Liberia -- President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia announced an end to a national state of emergency in an address broadcast across the nation on Thursday, citing progress in the fight against Ebola.

In August, Liberia and its capital, Monrovia, became the epicenter of the regional outbreak, the first time the virus had threatened an urban center since it was discovered in Zaire in 1976.

In her address, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said she was ending the state of emergency ''not because the fight against Ebola is over,'' but because the government and its consultants had concluded that sufficient progess had been made to ''sustain the fight against the virus until it is finally eradicated from our country.''

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf had been criticized domestically for the lack of a decisive response to the outbreak, which crossed the border from Guinea into northern Liberia in March. A three-month state of emergency was declared in early August, with a 9 p.m. curfew and soldiers and police officers patrolling the streets. Communities were quarantined, including the seaside slum of West Point, home to about 75,000 people.

The community resisted the quarantine and security forces fired on residents, killing a 15-year-old boy and severely wounding a 22-year-old man, according to a report released last week by the Liberian Independent National Commission on Human Rights.

Those who fired the shots have not yet been identified, although the government announced on Sunday that five men, including a platoon commander, had been found guilty of ''indiscretion'' and ''indiscipline'' by a military inquiry and would be punished. The commission has called on the government to offer protection to witnesses who claim to have seen the gunmen.

In announcing an end of the state of emergency, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf also ordered the opening of food and merchandise markets, including those along the border, and directed school authorities to organize youths to renovate and clean up school facilities. A decision to reopen schools will depend on the progress in fighting Ebola, she said.

A midnight curfew remains in place, and public health law still allows for restriction of movement.

While official figures indicate that the number of Ebola cases has dropped in Monrovia, and many Ebola treatment units in the capital are caring for only a handful of patients, new outbreaks have emerged in rural areas, including the town of Jenewonde, located near the border with Sierra Leone.

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said the fight would not be over until neighboring countries like Sierra Leone and Guinea were free of Ebola and ''until the national goal of zero new cases by Christmas is achieved all across the country.''

Referring to international aid efforts, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said: ''I believe that our partners will continue to be with us as we move to rebuild our health care delivery system. I believe that the world has shown that they do care.''

Critics of the state of emergency likened it to Liberia's days of military rule and argued that it could be used to manipulate scheduled senatorial elections and inhibit press freedom and criticism of the government. In recent weeks, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf asked for extended powers under the state of emergency, a move that was rejected by the national legislature.

Representative Acarous Moses Gray of an opposition party, Congress for Democratic Change, opposed the requests.

''The essence of the state of emergency was to curtail rights of her opponents,'' said Mr. Gray. ''Initially I did not support the state of emergency because it was not clearly defined. The significance of the state of emergency has not been seen.''

An Ebola patient in Sierra Leone will be transported to a hospital in Nebraska on Saturday if he is healthy enough to make the trip, hospital officials said on Thursday night. The patient, who recently tested positive for Ebola, would be the third person treated for the virus at Nebraska Medical Center's special biocontainment unit in Omaha. The hospital said in a statement that that the man would be evaluated for possible treatment by a medical crew flying to Sierra Leone. ''The members of the crew will determine whether the patient is stable enough for transport -- if he is, he would arrive in Omaha sometime Saturday afternoon,'' the statement said. The hospital previously treated two Americans: Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman released last month, and Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary released in September. Eight of the nine people treated for the virus in the United States have recovered from it.

While the world’s attention has been focused on Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], dengue hemorrhagic fever, an incurable viral disease, has become a pandemic, sickening up to 100 million people a year and killing more than 22,000. It is a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries. Transmitted by mosquitoes whose range is increasing in part because of global warming, the disease is present in more than 100 countries, including in southern Europe and in the United States.

A vaccine to protect against dengue is set to become available next year, with more in the pipeline. The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur announced on Nov. 3 that a vaccine it has developed performed effectively during the last phase of clinical trials and now awaits regulatory approval. The Japanese drug company Takeda also has a dengue vaccine in the final stages of development. Clinical trials are underway as well for a vaccine being developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, and Singapore University hopes to begin clinical trials for a dengue vaccine in 2016.

There are potentially big profits to be made from a dengue vaccine in the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America. Sanofi Pasteur, which spent more than 1.3 billion euros, or $1.7 billion, developing its vaccine, could reap €1 billion a year in profits from sales that are expected to take off briskly as soon as the vaccine hits the market. To Sanofi’s and Takeda’s credit, both say they plan a tiered pricing approach to keep the vaccine within the reach of the many poor people who need it.

Brazil has begun a pilot program releasing genetically modified male mosquitoes with a gene that kills their offspring. It is also releasing mosquitoes inoculated with bacteria that block the virus’s development. It is too early to tell whether these new techniques will help.

Meanwhile, governments and community health workers must continue efforts to educate people about precautions to take against dengue-infected mosquitoes, like eliminating standing water and improving sanitation in crowded urban centers. In our interconnected and warming world, the pharmaceutical industry will have to focus more effort on diseases that initially affect the poor but then threaten the entire population.

Obama Offers Assurances of U.S. Shift Toward Asia

BRISBANE, Australia — President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] sought to give new momentum to his strategic shift to Asia on Saturday, telling an audience of students here that the United States could be a force for order in a fast-growing region shadowed by threats like a nuclear-armed North Korea and maritime disputes between China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and its neighbors.

“I’m here today to say that American leadership in the Asia Pacific will always be a fundamental focus of my foreign policy,” Mr. Obama said at the University of Queensland.

In his address, the president acknowledged skepticism in some quarters about how real the shift to Asia was, given distractions like the Islamic State, the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak, and the Ukraine crisis. “They wonder whether America has the staying power to sustain it,” he said.

But he insisted that the United States was enriching its military ties and trade relations with Asian countries, detailing a series of military operations in the region. “Day in and day out, steadily and deliberately, we will continue to deepen our engagement,” he said.

Mr. Obama said the United States would rotate additional Marines through Darwin, in northern Australia, where it has established an outpost to project American military might in the Pacific. He described missile defense cooperation with South Korea, counterterrorism training with the Philippines, and defense alliances with Japan.

The president, who was ending a three-nation Asian tour by attending a meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized powers in Brisbane, was bolstered by a landmark climate agreement with China[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/world/asia/china-us-xi-obama-apec.html] this week. He announced a $3 billion American pledge[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/us/politics/obama-climate-change-fund-3-billion-announcement.html] to a fund that will help developing countries confront the dangers of climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Mr. Obama’s heavy emphasis on climate change could stir tensions with his Australian host, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a longtime skeptic of climate science who has resisted putting it on the agenda of the Group of 20 meeting. In a shot at Mr. Abbott, Mr. Obama joked that he knew climate change was the subject of “healthy debate” in Australia.

The president also visited Myanmar, where the reform process has bogged down amid widespread violence against the country’s Muslim minority and signs that the military-dominated government will not allow the pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to run for president.

“The question we face is which of these futures will define the Asia Pacific in the century to come,” the president said. “Conflict or cooperation? Oppression or liberty?”
