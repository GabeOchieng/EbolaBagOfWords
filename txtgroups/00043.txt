ATLANTA —  Federal health officials will require temperature checks for the first time at five major American airports for people arriving from the three West African countries hardest hit by the deadly Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus, but health experts said the measures were more likely to calm a worried public than to prevent many people with Ebola from entering the country.

Still, they constitute the first large-scale attempt to improve security at American ports of entry since the virus arrived on American soil last month.

And they also mark a notable policy shift at a time of rising concern about the disease. Public health officials had initially resisted the move, saying such checks would be an unnecessary use of thinly stretched resources. But pressure for tougher action mounted. Republicans sharply criticized President Obama for what they called a lax response. Many, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have pushed to restrict air travel from West Africa, something the administration has rejected. 

The temperature check requirements were announced hours after the first Ebola patient to have the illness diagnosed in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian, died in a Dallas hospital, intensifying questions about whether he might have survived had he been admitted to a hospital when he first sought care there in late September. 

The president’s Republican critics were largely silent  Wednesday after Mr. Duncan died and the administration announced the airport screenings. It was unclear if the Republicans saw the temperature checks as a sufficient response to the epidemic or if they did not want to be perceived as seeking political gain from Mr. Duncan’s death.

That Mr. Duncan was able to get from Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] to Dallas as the disease surged out of control in West Africa underscored the risk of spreading disease in a globalized world. An infected Liberian-American, Patrick Sawyer, carried the disease to Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, on a flight for business. Mr. Duncan had come to the United States to reunite with family. 

“We are a global village,” said Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan. “Germs have always traveled. The problem now is they can travel with the speed of a jet plane.”

The new requirement of temperature checks has broad implications for health departments across the country.

In a conference call with state and local officials Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Obama expressed confidence in the procedures already in place to prevent the spread of Ebola, but urged them to be vigilant in the days and weeks ahead.

"As we saw in Dallas, we don’t have a lot of margin for error," Mr. Obama told the group, according to a transcript released by the White House. "If we don’t follow protocols and procedures that are put in place, then we’re putting folks in our communities at risk."

Experts cautioned that a temperature check on arrival would almost certainly not have detected that Mr. Duncan had Ebola before he entered the country. The disease typically incubates for eight to 10 days before symptoms including fever develop.

American health officials believe Mr. Duncan did not have a fever when he arrived in the United States, a view seconded by his family. “There’s a sense that this is a be-all-and-end-all and that this will put up an iron curtain, but it won’t,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “At the very most, all we are buying here is some reduction of anxiety.” He added: “That’s worth something because, at the moment, we have a much larger outbreak of anxiety than we have of Ebola.”

The measures will go into effect on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport in New York. JFK receives about 43 percent of the people who fly to the United States from Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia and Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. Next week, screenings will begin at Washington Dulles, which gets 22 percent of such travelers, and at Newark Liberty International, O’Hare International in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta.

After a passport check, airport workers will lead travelers to a special area and point a thermometer at their foreheads. The workers will also ask travelers questions. A fever can be a symptom of Ebola. Those who have a temperature will be taken to a quarantine area in the airports and evaluated by an official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. It will be up to local health departments whether to place them in quarantine. 

In Texas, for example, health authorities required some people who had contact with Mr. Duncan to be monitored by health professionals to be sure their temperatures were properly monitored, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director. 

“Ebola is scary, it’s a deadly disease,” he said. “But we know how to stop it.”

He added, “Health workers throughout the U.S. need to think Ebola.”

The number of travelers from the affected West African countries is relatively small, and Dr. Frieden said the measures were unlikely to be disruptive. Only about 150 people a day come to the United States from the three countries, and the five airports receive about 94 percent of them.

In Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, C.D.C.-trained local workers have been screening people as they depart from Africa. Of the roughly 36,000 travelers who left the three countries over the past two months, about a quarter came to the United States, officials said. Of those, just 77 had symptoms, such as a fever. Most were related to malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes. None were Ebola, Dr. Frieden said.

The last large-scale effort to stop a disease at American airports came during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a viral infection that may spread through the air. Travelers were given yellow cards that explained its signs and symptoms and were told they should seek medical care if they developed symptoms. But there was no American requirement that people flying in from countries with SARS cases have their temperatures taken.

There have been calls to ban travel from the affected countries altogether, but Dr. Frieden said that would be counterproductive, as it would harm the surging international effort underway to quell the disease in West Africa, as health and aid workers traveling to the region would not be able to return.

Dr. Frieden said the response to SARS was a cautionary tale: The outbreak cost the world more than $40 billion in what he said were “unnecessary and ineffective travel and trade changes.”

“Banning travel would do more harm than good and paradoxically, it would increase the risk to Americans,” Dr. Frieden said. “People going in have to come out, too. The ability to respond to the outbreak would be undermined.”

The federal government has had substantial legal authority to take broad actions to stop people from coming into the country with infectious diseases since the passage of the National Quarantine Act of 1893, Professor Markel said. The law has been changed in the century since, but it still gives the federal government substantial power in the face of a deadly outbreak.

Historically, American health authorities have had elaborate systems to check immigrants’ health. On Ellis Island, for example, medical workers gave immigrants full medical examinations and even took cultures of bodily fluids, Professor Markel said. There were facilities nearby where the immigrants could be held while waiting for results. But those days were different: Many traveled for days or weeks to reach the United States, giving diseases ample time to surface.

Amid Concern About Virus in U.S., New York Hospital Says It's Ready for the Worst

A nurse came out in gloves, a surgical mask, goggles and an impenetrable gown made of the medically ubiquitous periwinkle blue mesh. It was the standard outfit for treating infectious patients at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan.

But it looked almost casual compared with the gear worn by another staff member: a full Tyvek body suit, a surgical gown over the body suit, boots, surgical mesh over the boots, gloves and a hood with a plastic guard over the face and covering the top of the head with built-in ventilation (known as a P.A.P.R., a powered air-purifying respirator). No skin was exposed, and everything was covered in impervious material.

That was the uniform for anyone coming in contact with an Ebola patient's bodily fluids.

On Wednesday, amid concern about the possibility of Ebola's spread in the United States and particularly within hospitals, Bellevue officials showed off their isolation rooms and their leave-no-skin-cell-uncovered precautions in an attempt to reassure New Yorkers that should the virus arrive here, the city's premier public hospital could handle it.

Dr. Ross Wilson, the chief medical officer for the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the city's public health facilities, said Bellevue could treat up to four patients with confirmed cases of Ebola in isolation units. They have sliding glass doors that let nurses monitor the patient without entering the room, and private bathrooms and the necessary medical equipment so that a patient who needs intensive care can be treated in the room rather than having to be moved to the intensive care unit. The hospital has nine other isolation rooms that could have the equipment installed if the need arose.

Though other public and private hospitals have isolation rooms, patients suspected of having Ebola who arrive at Kennedy Airport will be sent to Bellevue, Dr. Wilson said. On Wednesday, the day of the first Ebola death in the United States, the federal government announced it would begin screening passengers arriving from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone at five airports, including Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airport, indicating that though the disease has not become widespread in this country, the emergency response to the epidemic has.

Dr. Wilson said it was highly unlikely that New York would see a confirmed case of Ebola but that the hospital was preparing its staff and its facilities in the event that it does.

Any gear that comes into contact with an Ebola patient will be placed in a machine that heats items to a very high temperature, sterilizing them. Once they have been sterilized, they can be disposed of like normal medical waste, hospital officials said.

Dr. Wilson said Bellevue would be employing independent observers to make sure that hospital workers were taking off contaminated protective clothing properly, to reduce the risk of infection. He said a nurse in Spain who contracted Ebola after caring for a patient who died from it may have gotten the virus while changing out of her suit.

A spokeswoman for the Health and Hospitals Corporation said Bellevue would be cleaning the isolation rooms according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Those guidelines say ''a broad range of hospital disinfectants'' could be used but they also recommend ''selection of a disinfectant product with a higher potency than what is normally required.''

Dr. Wilson said the hospital had also set up a lab near the isolation rooms for testing the blood of suspected Ebola patients so that it does not contaminate other lab supplies or have to travel in the hospital.

Nurses at the hospital said they had been taught what symptoms to watch for and what precautions to take.

''My mom is calling me all the time saying, 'Be careful!,' '' said a nurse who declined to be identified because she was not authorized to speak publicly. ''But I tell her, in our walk of life, you deal with this every day. I'm used to it.''

European Leaders Scramble to Upgrade Response to Ebola Crisis

BRUSSELS -- When the Ebola virus was first identified in March as the cause of a series of mysterious deaths in the remote forests of Guinea, Europe moved quickly to battle a disease that has now infected more than 7,000 Africans and already killed around half of those. It mobilized more money and health workers than the United States, China or anyone else for West Africa.

But, proud of its long record as the world's biggest donor of humanitarian aid, Europe has since suffered a blow to its self-image of can-do generosity. Its own efforts to contain the lethal virus have been overshadowed by President Obama's announcement last month that he was sending 3,000 troops to West Africa to build hospitals and otherwise help in the fight against Ebola.

While a few left-wingers sneered at the American deployment as yet another example of Washington's taste for military intervention -- and praised Cuba for sending more than 100 doctors to West Africa -- many European officials and politicians welcomed the move and wondered why what had been a European-led international effort to contain the virus had clearly not worked.

Now, with Europe grappling with the first case of Ebola transmitted on its soil after news on Monday that a nurse in Madrid had been infected, European leaders are scrambling to coordinate and ramp up their response to the lethal disease. As public anxieties grow, politicians on the far right are seizing on the Ebola crisis to demand sharp curbs in immigration, while those on the left rail against Europe's colonial past and its failure to do more to help Africa contain the virus.

Pressure to contain the epidemic has prompted European Union officials in Brussels to start meeting daily with aid groups and representatives from member states to discuss how to best respond to the crisis. Europe's emergency response unit, housed in a drab Brussels office block, used to focus on monitoring natural disasters and wars, but now tracks Ebola around the clock.

''Speed is of the essence, and there is a feeling that all of us have been behind the curve,'' Claus Sorensen, director general of Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, a department of the European Union's Brussels administration, said in an interview.

For many months, the struggle against Ebola was a largely African and European effort. Doctors Without Borders, which was founded in France, set up a series of treatment centers. Its doctors and nurses stayed put while those of some other groups, like Samaritan's Purse of the United States, pulled out after staff members became infected.

Doctors Without Borders, financed by the European Union and donors, now has nearly 300 international workers and 2,900 local employees in West Africa, according to Christof Godderis, a spokesman for the group's Belgian branch, which has been at the forefront of the anti-Ebola campaign.

Yet the sight of American troops building clinics and unloading supplies has been a jolt to Europe's longstanding belief that humanitarian assistance is a more effective tool for dealing with the problems of the world than military might. Together with its 28 member states, the European Union boasts of providing more than half of the global total of humanitarian assistance.

Linda McAvan, head of the European Parliament's development committee, said Europe's self-criticism is off-base. ''The U.S. is one country,'' she said. ''If it wants to send its military, it can do that straight away. But the European Union does not have a military,'' she said in an interview.

Instead, the bloc has 28 separate militaries, each one controlled by its national government.

Prodded by Mr. Obama's Sept. 16 announcement, President François Hollande of France announced two days later that he, too, was sending troops to West Africa. The French soldiers will set up a hospital in the forest region of southern Guinea where the current Ebola outbreak began last December. Britain has ordered its military to do the same in Sierra Leone. European officials note that, unlike the American military, Britain and France will provide medical personnel to staff what they build.

Europe does not have a direct equivalent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the organization that has dispatched scores of disease-control experts to West Africa. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, headquartered in Sweden, coordinates the work of health experts in different countries but does not have its own emergency-response teams.

In a debate in the European Parliament a day after Mr. Obama's announcement, politicians from across the political spectrum took the floor to complain that Europe needed to get more directly involved in battling Ebola in West Africa.

''Look at the way we have managed, or rather mismanaged, this epidemic,'' Michèle Rivasi, a center-left French legislator, told the European Assembly. Abandoning customary French suspicion of the American military, she said that Washington was ''not sending soldiers but people who can build hospitals, and that is a good thing.'' Europe, she added, needed to step up its response.

The Parliament passed a resolution calling for a more robust European response to the outbreak and bemoaning ''the underestimation of the crisis by the international community.''

In announcing the United States' deployment, Mr. Obama was pointed in his message that America was ''prepared to take the leadership on this'' but could not fight the epidemic on its own. The White House in effect challenged other nations to roll out a similar level of response in Guinea and Sierra Leone, the two other nations hard hit by the disease, which were colonies of France and Britain, respectively.

The pressure to stem the spread of Ebola at its roots has grown as both Europe and the United States have encountered their own cases. A Liberian man died on Wednesday at a Dallas hospital. A Spanish nurse who treated a priest who had been airlifted from Sierra Leone for treatment at a Madrid hospital is the first known case of Ebola being contracted through exposure outside Africa.

After months of reassuring Europeans that there was little danger of Ebola spreading in Europe, the European Union responded with dismay and sent a letter to the Spanish authorities asking for an explanation.

Despite sometimes incendiary remarks by extremists like Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder and honorary president of France's National Front party, mainstream politicians have united behind support for West Africa.

''The values we stand for as Europeans in the world, of solidarity, of dignity and of respect for human rights, are such that our support to the countries concerned is a moral duty,'' said Françoise Grossête, a Christian Democrat, during the European Parliament debate.

Mr. Sorensen, the director general for humanitarian aid in Brussels, scoffed at demands from some populist politicians that Europe should seal itself off from infected countries. Noting that tight border controls had never stopped flu from spreading, he said: ''It is better to deal with this disease at its root and not wait until it comes here like the plague in the Middle Ages.''

Despite its cumbersome decision-making apparatus, Mr. Sorensen said, the European Union moved swiftly back in March, allocating extra financing to Doctors Without Borders, within days of the virus being identified. The private aid organization has been a leader in providing an extensive front-line response.

At first it looked as if the response was adequate, with reported cases leveling off and even dropping, raising hopes that, as in 23 previous Ebola outbreaks recorded in Africa since 1976, the virus had been contained.

Instead it spread, in part because some people feared that aid workers might actually be spreading the disease and stopped seeking treatment. Doctors Without Borders closed a facility in southern Guinea after an attack in April by a stone-throwing crowd. Villagers later killed eight African members of a team trying to raise awareness of Ebola in that region.

The European Union has since sharply stepped up its financing to Ebola-hit countries, with a total of $230 million now committed to the region. Of that, about $127 million will go toward trying to prop up rudimentary health and other government services in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with an additional $51 million targeted directly at Ebola efforts. Individual European countries have pledged upward of $255 million.

Philippe Maughan, a European Union aid official who was recently in West Africa, said support to governments was vital because Ebola also kills indirectly by paralyzing hospitals and making it impossible for Africans with unrelated ailments to get treatment. ''If you drop on the street from a heart attack, nobody will touch you because they think you have Ebola,'' he said.

U.S. to Begin Ebola Screenings at 5 Airports

ATLANTA -- Federal officials said Wednesday that they would begin temperature screenings of passengers arriving from West Africa at five American airports, beginning with Kennedy International in New York as early as this weekend, as the United States races to respond to a deadly Ebola outbreak.

Travelers at the four other airports -- Washington Dulles International, O'Hare International, Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International -- will be screened starting next week, according to federal officials.

The screenings, which will include taking the passengers' temperatures with a gun-like, noncontact thermometer and requiring them to fill out a questionnaire after deplaning, will be for people arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries hardest hit by the epidemic.

About 90 percent of the people arriving from the three countries come through the five airports, officials said. Kennedy Airport alone has about 43 percent of the travelers. The second-highest share of visitors -- 22 percent -- come through Washington Dulles.

Over all, their numbers are relatively small. Of the roughly 36,000 travelers who left the three countries over the past two months, officials said, about a quarter came to the United States. Of those, 77 had symptoms, such as a fever, consistent with early-stage Ebola, but none turned out to have Ebola. Most of the fevers were related to malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes.

The airport screenings are the federal government's first large-scale attempt at improving the safety at American ports of entry, a measure many had called for after a Liberian man was treated for Ebola in Dallas, the first case of the disease in the United States. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday.

''We work to continuously increase the safety of Americans,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ''We believe these new measures will further protect the health of Americans, understanding that nothing we can do will get us to absolute zero risk until we end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.''

The C.D.C. will send personnel to airports to perform the screenings, and Coast Guard members will be deployed to help in the coming weeks.

The instrument that will be used to take people's temperature uses an infrared beam to take the temperature. If someone has a temperature, that person will be further evaluated by a C.D.C. expert in the airports.

It is the first time that health authorities in the United States have taken the step of monitoring the temperature of people arriving at American airports, and the policy carried broad implications for health departments across the country.

How to respond to someone with a temperature will be up to local health departments, officials said. Local health officials may decide to quarantine a traveler, something that is legal under American law, or to transport a traveler to the hospital. In Texas, health authorities decided to require some of the people who had contact with Mr. Duncan to be monitored by health professionals, because the professionals did not think the people were capable of taking their temperatures themselves.

Health checks in airports have been applied to travelers entering the United States in the past -- during the SARS epidemic, for example -- but no temperature checks were required. Travelers were given yellow cards that explained the signs and symptoms of SARS and warned them that if the symptoms developed, they should bring the cards to physicians.

Officials are also working to coordinate efforts with countries that receive connecting flights from West Africa with United States-bound passengers so that the C.D.C. questionnaire can be distributed internationally, officials said.

White House officials declined to comment on the new screenings, although in the past several days, administration officials have signaled that they were considering new measures in the United States that would add to the procedures already in place in African countries where the disease is rampant.

President Obama indicated on Monday his desire to increase screenings, saying after a briefing with top health officials that the government was already planning a new approach.

''We're also going to be working on protocols to do additional passenger screening, both at the source and here in the United States,'' Mr. Obama said.

There have been calls to ban travel from the affected countries altogether, but senior administration officials said that would be counterproductive, because it would harm the international effort to quell the disease in West Africa, where it is raging out of control. Further spreading of the disease in Africa would serve only to increase the risks to Americans.

''Banning travel would do more harm than good, and paradoxically it would increase the risk to Americans,'' an official said. ''People going in have to come out too. The ability to respond to the outbreak would be undermined.''

Republican lawmakers have been highly critical of what they say has been a lax and inadequate response by the Obama administration, and many have pushed to restrict air travel from West Africa.

The criticism has been most pronounced from conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz, who represents Texas and has written to the Federal Aviation Administration asking officials to outline what steps are being taken to keep travelers sick with Ebola from boarding flights bound for the United States. ''I remain concerned that we don't see sufficient seriousness on the part of the federal government about protecting the American public,'' Mr. Cruz told a Texas radio station this week.

The screenings are a shift in administration policy from last week, when senior White House officials and doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resisted calls for trying to take passengers' temperature as they entered the United States.

In an interview last week, Dr. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., questioned the wisdom of such an approach, saying that the result would be a great number of ''false positives'' from people who had fevers because of illnesses other than Ebola.

He questioned who would be trained to take the temperatures, and he said he worried about where people with temperatures would be held temporarily in the airport.

''Like any intervention, there are upsides and downsides,'' Dr. Frieden said at the time. ''There are a lot of downsides. You slow travel, you end up costing people money. Who's going to get screened? Who's going to train them? If you have a positive, where are you going to bring them to?''

He added: ''The plain truth is we can't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa. What we can do is minimize that risk, as is being done now in Dallas.''

Spanish Case May Be Tied to Mistake With Gloves

MADRID -- Spanish health officials began to explain Wednesday how an auxiliary nurse became the first Ebola case in Western Europe, saying that it was likely she became infected when she touched her face with the gloves she had worn while tending to a Spanish missionary with Ebola at a Madrid hospital.

The explanation came after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain defended his government's handling of the case, telling Parliament on Wednesday that he was confident the country could contain the virus and pledging ''total transparency'' about how the authorities handled the case, which has alarmed Spaniards who are concerned that the disease had been allowed to reach their shores.

A Spanish health official said the auxiliary nurse, identified as María Teresa Romero Ramos, who was found to have Ebola on Monday, had told him that she might have touched her face while still wearing her gloves after she removed her protective suit during her first visit to the room of the missionary, Manuel García Vieo, who died on Sept. 25.

Germán Ramírez, an official from the tropical disease unit at La Paz, a Madrid hospital linked to the Carlos III Hospital where the nurse is being treated, told reporters that he spoke to the nurse on three occasions. If her account is correct, the contagion, ''may not have been an error, but rather an accident,'' Mr. Ramirez said. The hospital's deputy director, Yolanda Fuentes, said that it was not uncommon for accidental contact like that to go unnoticed and that Ms. Romero had not mentioned it until she was interviewed again by medical experts on Wednesday.

''I think the error was the removal of the suit,'' Ms. Romero told El País, a Spanish newspaper, by telephone from her isolation unit of Carlos III Hospital, where the missionary was treated. ''I can see the moment it may have happened, but I'm not sure about it.''

The government is facing criticism not only over the events that led to the auxiliary nurse's infection but also over why, after she informed a medical center on Sept. 30 that she felt feverish, it then took nearly a week for her to be tested for Ebola. ''What I am asking is that we let the professionals work,'' Mr. Rajoy said. ''What we have to do is be vigilant but stay calm.''

Ms. Romero said she felt ''a little better'' since being hospitalized on Monday. She has been a health care worker for 15 years, according to Spanish news reports, which variously gave her age as 40 or 44.

Her husband separately told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that his wife had mostly stayed at home after going on vacation the day after Mr. Viejo, the missionary, died. During that vacation period, however, the nurse also sat for a public exam to improve her qualifications, alongside many other candidates. Her husband has shown no signs of having the disease but has also been kept in quarantine.

The couple's dog, Excalibur, was euthanized on Wednesday as a precautionary measure even as animal rights activists against the move surrounded the couple's home. Mr. Rajoy said that Spain had ''one of the best'' health care systems in the world and that any criticism of the handling of the case should not spiral into a broader political crisis. Some opposition lawmakers have been calling since Monday for Health Minister Ana Mato to resign.

Pedro Sánchez, leader of the Socialists, the main opposition party, told Mr. Rajoy that his government ''should not cover up information.'' Concerning Ms. Mato's response, Mr. Sánchez said that ''it's more than clear that your health minister, when she has spoken, has triggered more uncertainty and more anguish among public opinion.''

On Wednesday, the Spanish authorities continued their efforts to draw up a full list of people who might have had contact with the nurse. So far, about 50 people are being monitored for possible symptoms of Ebola. They include several staff members at a hospital in Alcorcón, on the outskirts of Madrid, where the nurse lives and where she was initially treated on Monday before she tested positive for Ebola and was transferred to Carlos III Hospital. Spain's government has chosen Carlos III Hospital to handle Ebola patients.

The case is worrisome because Spain is expected to have the rigorous infection controls needed to fight the spread of Ebola.

Travelers entering the United States who have been in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, the center of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, will be subjected to temperature checks and questioning when they reach five American airports under new procedures announced on Wednesday by top government officials. The screening will add another layer of security to backstop the screenings already being conducted before passengers are allowed to board planes leaving their home countries.

Although some experts doubt the new screenings will be worth the effort, they might ease public anxieties about keeping the virus out of this country. Thus far, only one traveler with an Ebola infection has entered the United States. He apparently had no symptoms on arrival and traveled to Dallas, where he became ill and died in a hospital on Wednesday. It is unclear whether the new screening measures would have identified him as an Ebola carrier.

The new entry screening will apply at five airports that receive more than 94 percent of travelers from the three Ebola-stricken nations. The airports include Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, Washington Dulles International, O'Hare International in Chicago, and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta.

Travelers whose passports show they have been in the Ebola-stricken countries will be escorted by Customs and Border Protection personnel to an area set aside for screening. They will have their temperatures taken with a noncontact thermometer, be observed for symptoms of illness, fill out a questionnaire and be asked about their possible exposures to Ebola.

Suspected cases will be evaluated by experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stationed at the airports and possibly taken to hospitals for evaluation and treatment or referred to local health agencies for further monitoring. Those who have no symptoms or history of exposure will be asked to leave phone numbers where they can be reached and will get information about what to do if any symptoms develop.

The temperature screenings can detect who has a fever, a symptom of Ebola, but fevers can also be caused by malaria, a very common affliction in the three countries, so there could be a large number of ''false positives.'' Since travelers are supposed to have their temperatures checked before boarding the planes, the screenings at the American airports would, in theory, detect the rare Ebola victim who developed a fever while en route.

A vast majority of Ebola victims in West Africa are too poor or too sick to undertake air travel. Only about 150 travelers who have been in the three countries enter the United States on an average day. They will put additional burdens on the Customs and Border Protection personnel and public health officers on duty at the airports. The C.D.C. will have to add additional staff to those already at airports to evaluate suspect cases.

The burden on the health care system will depend on how many patients suffering from fever-inducing ailments like the flu will end up in emergency rooms seeking Ebola evaluations. That effect will have to be measured as this screening moves forward.

Last week, before the administration's announcement, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., raised sound questions about the effectiveness and costs of fever checks at airports. The new approach might make the public feel safer. But, as he wisely noted last week: ''The plain truth is we can't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa. What we can do is minimize that risk, as is being done now in Dallas.''

New York Today: Preparing for Ebola

Good morning to you on this clear, cool Thursday.

New York City is gearing up to deal with Ebola.

Starting Saturday, screeners at Kennedy and La Guardia airports will take the temperature[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/newly-vigilant-us-is-to-screen-fliers-for-ebola.html] of every traveler arriving from any of the three West African countries hit hardest by the virus.

City agencies will brief the mayor and City Council on their Ebola plans at the council chambers today at 12:20 p.m.

And yesterday, as news arrived that a man had died from the disease in Dallas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html], officials at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan offered a look at the unit where an arriving Ebola patient would be sent.

Tatiana Schlossberg of The Times was among the reporters who took the tour.

Bellevue is equipped[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/nyregion/amid-concern-about-virus-in-us-new-york-hospital-says-its-ready-for-the-worst.html] with several isolation rooms, a lab, and undercover staff members tasked with testing emergency room workers’ responses.

The hospital seemed less prepared, Ms. Schlossberg said, for “how to handle the media if there was someone with Ebola.”

More than 50 reporters, photographers, and cameramen jostled for access to an isolation room.

“It was chaos,” she said. “Everyone was crowding against these poor communication assistants, trying to be the first to get in,” she said.

The scene inside the room: one bed, and two nurses in protective gear.

One wore a more familiar outfit, with a surgical gown and mask; the other had a full-body suit and a hood with a plastic face-guard.

They weren’t allowed to speak to reporters, but Ms. Schlossberg talked to other nurses outside.

“They said, ‘We’re totally prepared for this,’ ” Ms. Schlossberg said.

“ ‘We know how to handle it.’ ”

Separately, airliner cabin cleaners at La Guardia Airport went on strike[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lga-cabin-cleanders-walk-job-claiming-unsafe-conditions-article-1.1968344] against what they call unsafe working conditions.

G.O.P. Finds a Campaign Theme: ‘Be Very Afraid’

Good Thursday morning from Washington, where the Islamic State has invaded the election cycle, the Secret Service is beefing up and two presidential prospects are visiting Pennsylvania.

With four weeks to go, the election has taken a dark turn as conservatives use warnings about Islamic State militants, the Ebola virus and terrorist acts to send a message: The world is a scary place, and the Democrats can’t protect you.

Take a new Republican ad[http://youtu.be/T8MY7KPVtnY] aimed at Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona that warns of terrorists streaming across the Mexican border. “Evil forces around the world want to harm Americans every day,” it says. “Their entry into our country? Through Arizona’s backyard.”

Another one, against Senator Mark Udall in Colorado, plays a clip[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCL-p3Iual8] in which he says the Islamic State does not pose an imminent threat. “Really?” the announcer asks. “Can we take that chance?” An ad in another Arizona House race features the footage [http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/219908-gop-house-candidate-ad-uses-isis-beheading-footage]of the journalist James Foley right before his beheading.

The commercials play on Americans’ well-documented fears in a world grown more chaotic. A recent Associated Press survey found[http://hosted.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/dynamic/stories/U/US_AP_POLL_TERRORISM?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT] that 53 percent of Americans believed the risk of another terrorist attack inside the country was extremely or very high. In a new Pew poll[http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/06/most-are-confident-in-governments-ability-to-prevent-major-ebola-outbreak-in-u-s/], 41 percent said they did not have “too much confidence” or “no confidence at all” that the federal government could prevent a major Ebola outbreak in the United States.

National Republican leaders have heard those worries, too. Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have criticized President Obama for leaving Americans vulnerable to an Ebola epidemic. The Daily Caller has christened him “President Ebola[http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/03/president-ebola-in-2010-obama-administration-scrapped-cdc-quarantine-regulations-aimed-at-ebola/?advD=1248,658171].”

In an interview with First Draft, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the constant stream of bad news at home and abroad allowed Republicans to raise questions about Democratic leadership.

“It’s the accumulation of ineptitude that’s hovering over Obama and, in turn, his lieutenants that are running for U.S. Senate,” Mr. Priebus said. “I think it’s a powerful message because No. 1, it’s true. And No. 2, it’s simple.”

– Jeremy W. Peters

Secret Service Puts On a Show of Strength

If there’s one thing that Joseph Clancy, the new acting director of the Secret Service, doesn’t want, it’s another mistake.

Fresh off several weeks of scandalous headlines, the Secret Service under Mr. Clancy appears to be taking no chances. On Wednesday evening, there were 15 uniformed Secret Service officers patrolling Pennsylvania Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets. That seems to be a beefed-up presence, at least compared with the typical fall evening.

Journalists who travel with President Obama have also noticed that the number of guards around him seems to have increased. Where there used to be a single agent on either side during presidential speeches, there are now two. And they appear to be bigger, physically, than ever.

Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, confirmed that there have been “personnel enhancements and surveillance capability enhancements” in the wake of a fence-jumper’s dash from the North Lawn to the East Room last month.

“It stands to reason,” he said. “Every decision we make is a critical decision.”

– Michael D. Shear

Capitol Hill Confessions: Who’s Sharp Tongued, and Who’s a Sharp Dresser

The Washingtonian magazine’s confidential survey of Capitol Hill staff members [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/the-best-worst-of-congress-2014/]has yielded a list of the best and worst among their bosses, and some of the results are dead-on: Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader and Armani aficianado, landed on the best-dressed list. The tart-tongued Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who once called President George W. Bush a “loser and a liar,” was named one of the meanest. Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, who fought off the famously ferocious Cheney family with his aw-shucks manner, was named the nicest.

Then there were the Senate surprises: Pat Roberts of Kansas, who has had an extremely unfunny fall fighting off allegations that he no longer lives in his home state, was named one of the funniest, along with Al Franken of Minnesota (and “Saturday Night Live” fame). Orrin G. Hatch of Utah shared best-dressed honors with Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York. The inscrutable minority leader, Mitch McConnell, was voted wisest, along with Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.

And Ted Cruz of Texas seemed widely disliked, earning multiple superlatives: most partisan, biggest disappointment, most likely to vote for a government shutdown and worst at the “ask.”

– Carolyn Ryan

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama heads to Los Angeles to tour a school, talk about the economy and attend a private Democratic National Committee event.

Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, will be giving an update on security at the southwest border and immigration challenges at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at 3 p.m.[http://csis.org/event/statesmens-forum-border-security-21st-century]

Gov. Chris Christie and Hillary Rodham Clinton will both be in Pennsylvania today to offer support for the state’s candidates for governor.

A Music Video Star Is Born in South Dakota

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_m_FGfAmaU]]

Not long ago, music videos started careers, moved albums and killed radio stars.

Rick Weiland, a South Dakota Democrat, hopes they will help him become a United States senator.

His campaign is airing three video parodies set to country tunes and featuring Mr. Weiland’s campaign messages. It’s one way to stand out in a three-man race against the Republican nominee, former Gov. Mike Rounds, and Larry Pressler, a former Republican senator who is looking to win back his old seat as an independent.

At a recent campaign event in Yankton, S.D., one supporter brought along his own guitar and shouted out a request for “Big Wheel,” the Weiland campaign parody[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_m_FGfAmaU] of “Wagon Wheel” by Old Crow Medicine Show.

“I had my guitar in the car,” Mr. Weiland said, “so we just got together and performed.”

Each video has been edited to run for two minutes and 30 seconds, which allows them to air as ads during the 6 p.m. news broadcast on KELO-TV in Sioux Falls.

The other two videos parody Johnny Cash’s “I’ve Been Everywhere”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3seyRhJ7h4] and Roger Miller’s “King of the Road,”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPLn_jT1JMI] which Mr. Weiland said “wasn’t in my range as much as the others.” He plans one more, this one playing off of Mr. Cash’s “I Walk the Line” and called “I Draw the Line.”

“I’ve enjoyed doing them,” Mr. Weiland said. “I know I’ve been ridiculed a bit,” adding, “I am who I am. Let the chips fall where they may.”

– Nick Corasaniti

What We’re Reading Elsewhere

Ryan Lizza, in The New Yorker, says Senator Rand Paulhas a “personhood problem”[http://www.newyorker.com.proxy.bc.edu/news/daily-comment/rand-paul-personhood-problem] in the debate over abortion.

The Advocate magazine looks at which states are most likely to be the next to approve same-sex marriage[http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2014/10/08/whos-next-predicting-more-marriage-wins], and which will be the final holdouts.

MediaPost lists the top 10 worst places to live if you don’t like political advertising[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/235532/the-top-ten-worst-places-to-live.html].

The News and Observer in Raleigh, N.C., looks at the ways that the Republican Thom Tillis is working to reduce the gender gap[http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/10/08/4218226/kay-hagan-thom-tillis-set-their.html?sp=/99/102/105/] in his race against Senator Kay Hagan.

At National Review Online, Matt Purple labels Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut as America’s worst governor.[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/389857/americas-worst-governor-matt-purple]

Correction: An earlier version of this article, using information from a law enforcement official, stated incorrectly whom Joseph Clancy, the new acting director of the Secret Service, will be meeting with on the Hill on Friday. It is the House Judiciary and Homeland Security committee staff members, not Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committee staff members.

The name came from a river. Ebola was christened in 1976, after a deadly mutation of the virus helped it kill hundreds of people in what was then northern Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

On Jan. 25, 1977, The Times offered the world a closer look at the international effort to fight the deadly epidemic:

By 1980, amid rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union, the Pentagon was sufficiently worried about Ebola’s potential as a weapon that it was considering the development of a system for the early detection of the virus.

That was 34 year ago. On Wednesday, the federal government announced that it would begin screening travelers from Ebola-stricken West Africa.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Ebola’s reach.

The leaders of three West African nations are in Washington today, meeting[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/09/us/politics/ap-us-ebola-imf-world-bank.html] with international officials to discuss the virus outbreak and what they need to fight it.

Temperature checks of travelers from West Africa[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/newly-vigilant-us-is-to-screen-fliers-for-ebola.html] go into effect on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport, which receives about 43 percent of the people who fly to the U.S. from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

• Battle for the border.

Fighters with the Islamic State group are continuing their push today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/09/world/middleeast/09reuters-mideast-crisis.html] for Kobani, a strategic Syrian town. Capturing the town would give the militants full control of a long stretch of the border with Turkey.

U.S. and NATO officials are in Turkey today for talks on that nation’s role in fighting the extremists. There are frustrations[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/middleeast/isis-syria-turkey-border-us.html] that it has not done enough.

• Palestinians[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] look ahead.

The unity government holds its first cabinet meeting in Gaza[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/09/world/middleeast/09reuters-palestinians-gaza-government.html] today, ahead of a donors conference in Egypt this weekend.

Officials are seeking $4 billion to rebuild the territory, which was battered by the war with Israel this summer.

• Nobel Prize[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Literature.

Patrick Modiano of France, who writes on topics like memory, identity and guilt[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/books/patrick-modiano-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature.html], was today awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, which comes with $1.1 million.

The literature prize is given out for a lifetime of writing rather for than a single work.

• Split in Hong Kong.

The government canceled talks with students, which had been set for Friday, after a pro-democracy coalition of lawmakers, students and civic groups vowed today to continue sit-in protests.

• “It’s like Michael Brown all over again.”

That’s the cousin of a man who was fatally shot[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/09/us/09reuters-usa-missouri-shooting.html] by an off-duty St. Louis city police officer on Wednesday. She says he was carrying a sandwich, while officials say he was armed.

The officer is white, and the man was black. A crowd of protesters gathered at the scene, just miles away from Ferguson, Mo.

• Campaign mode.

President Obama leaves the White House today for a two-day West Coast fund-raising trip. The actress Gwyneth Paltrow is hosting the dinner and reception for the Democratic National Committee at her home.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are down almost 2 percent after Wednesday’s nearly 2 percent rise. European shares closed mostly lower, and Asian indexes ended widely mixed.

• Time Warner Cable shareholders today approved the plan to merge[http://www.marketwatch.com.proxy.bc.edu/story/time-warner-cable-stockholders-approve-merger-with-comcast-corporation-2014-10-09] with Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, a day after Comcast investors [http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20141009_Comcast_shareholders_approve_all-stock_acquisition_of_Time_Warner_Cable.html]signed off[http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20141009_Comcast_shareholders_approve_all-stock_acquisition_of_Time_Warner_Cable.html] on the $45 billion deal.

The merger still faces federal antitrust scrutiny and public hostility.

• Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, meets with the prime minister of India[http://www.ibtimes.co.in/mark-zuckerberg-meet-modi-during-india-visit-attend-first-internet-org-summit-610425], the company’s second-biggest market.

Mr. Zuckerberg is there for the first conference of Internet.org, which was set up to encourage online access by smartphone in developing countries.

• Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, updates Americans[http://www.brookings.edu/events/2014/10/09-ecb-eurozone-mario-draghi] on Europe’s economic woes in an address in Washington today.

NOTEWORTHY

• Country is king.

Blake Shelton’s latest album, “Bringing Back the Sunshine[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bringing-back-the-sunshine/id909561610],” arrives at No. 1 this week on Billboard’s latest album chart[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/blake-shelton-is-no-1-streisand-sales-steady/].

And the country-pop group Lady Antebellum is No. 2 with “747[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/747/id911464545].” It’s the first time that country albums have held the top two spots on the chart in almost four years[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6274279/blake-shelton-scores-second-no-1-album-billboard-200].

• Taking over Gotham City.

More than 130,000 people — many in costume — are expected for New York Comic Con, starting today[http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/], to soak up everything from “Game of Thrones” to Minecraft to “The Karate Kid.”

The U.S. Postal Service celebrates Batman’s 75th anniversary with limited-edition stamps[https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=S_588404&categoryId=forever-stamps] on the convention’s opening day.

• Honoring John Lennon.

Yoko Ono lights the Imagine Peace Tower[http://imaginepeacetower.com/] in Reykjavik, Iceland. It’s a monument to her husband, John Lennon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/john_lennon/index.html], who would have been 74 today. The tower will stay lit until Dec. 8, the day he died in 1980.

• Now comes smartjewelry.

Fashion designers join hardware companies to one-up the smartwatch with chip-encrusted rings, cuff links and pendants[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/technology/personaltech/fashion-and-functionality-meet-in-smart-jewelry.html].

BACK STORY

A few hours before he was assassinated in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the legislation that created the Secret Service. It was established to track counterfeiters for the Treasury Department.

The agency moved into presidential protection only after another assassination: William McKinley in 1901.

While the Secret Service is in hot water today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/09/us/politics/ap-us-secret-service-congress.html] over a breach of White House security, its harshest criticism came 50 years ago.

That’s when its director, James J. Rowley, testified before the Warren Commission investigating President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. He is the only Secret Service chief to have a president killed on his watch.

Several agents in the presidential motorcade in Dallas had broken agency rules by drinking into the early hours of Nov. 22, 1963. The Secret Service had tried to cover it up.

Mr. Rowley withstood withering questioning, including about whether the agents could have prevented the shooting.

In the end, the commission concluded: “It is conceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed alcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities, might have been more alert.”

In Transit
Travel
Cruise Lines to Avoid West African Coast

Because of Ebola concerns, several cruise lines with voyages that stop along the West African coast have chosen to steer clear of the region, even, in some cases, avoiding bordering countries where no outbreak has been reported.

Holland America canceled stops at ports in Ghana, Gambia and Senegal (so far, there has been just one case reported in Senegal and none in Ghana and Gambia) during a 35-day “African Explorer” voyage on the Rotterdam planned for November and December.

Those ports have been replaced with overnight calls in Cape Town, South Africa and Mindelo in the Cape Verde Islands and a stop in Tangier, Morocco. Seabourn Cruise Lines, Fred. Olsen and Regent Seven Seas have made similar changes to itineraries.

The Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Senegal have imposed a ban on tourists traveling there within 30 days of visiting a West African country. As the islands are an integral part of Fred. Olsen’s voyages, the company thought it prudent to omit the West African mainland from its itineraries for the time being, Wendy Jeffreys, a spokeswoman for the cruise line, said.

Very few cruise lines actually visit the region where Ebola cases are originating, Cruise Lines International Association, of which Regent is a member, said in a statement. Nevertheless, all CLIA members have been made aware of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s travel heath notices involving West African countries, the company said.

“For many years, cruise lines have observed and questioned embarking passengers about their health before boarding a ship, including recent or current illnesses and symptoms,” the statement continued. “A passenger exhibiting signs of any illness prior to boarding a ship is checked by health and medical staff who determine if the passenger will be allowed to board or declined and referred to landside medical care.”

With regard to cargo ships entering United States. ports, the Coast Guard’s Advance Notice of Vessel Arrival procedures require all inbound vessels to report any sick passengers aboard, as well as the last five port calls made by the ship, among other protocols, Chief Warrant Officer Chad Saylor, a Coast Guard spokesman, said.

The agency is working closely with the C.D.C., Customs and Border Protection and partners in each port, and there is certainly a “heightened awareness” throughout the organization, he said, with regard to the issues involved and making sure everyone is speaking up and reporting incidences.

In August, the Coast Guard issued a nationwide bulletin on behalf of the C.D.C., reminding all vessels of their requirement to report any passengers who had become sick or died aboard the vessel in the 15 days prior to entering a U.S. port.

Earlier this week, the Long Island Sound Coast Guard sector, which includes parts of New York State and Connecticut, issued its own statement saying that it would proactively contact ships that listed a country affected by Ebola among its last five port calls in order to determine if anyone aboard was exhibiting symptoms of the virus.

As usual, these quotations should speak for themselves.

Rush Limbaugh[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/10/03/this_sound_bite_is_all_the_proof_you_need_that_political_correctness_is_destroying_this_country] :

Okay, we had slavery, which is our original sin — and everything that makes America rotten and worthless and mean and immoral descends from that.  Anything that happens because of our past experiment with slavery or past period of slavery, we own. Therefore Liberia exists because of us. The people in Liberia only went there because they had to get out of here ’cause they were slaves.

So anything that happens to them while is ultimately our fault.  And how do we pay the price?  By getting Ebola ourselves.  That makes it fair. That makes it equal.…So the reason why a bunch of people don’t think we should be banning flights is because we kind of are responsible for this.  Therefore if Ebola ends up here, it’s only payback, folks. Slavery! It’s only payback.  Unfortunately we have elected people in positions of leadership who think this way.  The president is one of them.

Mike Huckabee[http://foxnewsinsider.com/2014/10/05/mike-huckabee-ebola-scare-reveals-publics-lack-faith-govt]:

We’re told that the government has to go overboard with TSA, the IRS and the NSA for our own protection.  And then, tell the CDC to go easy on folks fleeing Liberia and lying about whether they’ve been exposed to Ebola?  You know what, I’m feeling a little sick myself but it’s not Ebola; I’m just sick of a government I’m paying for telling me not to worry and just trust them.  I wish I could, but if they repeatedly lie to me, I just don’t believe them anymore.

Let’s hope there’s nothing to be worried about and that Ebola doesn’t really threaten most of us.  But hearing that from the federal government right now is like hearing that I can keep my doctor and my health insurance.

Phyllis Schlafly in an interview with WorldNetDaily[http://www.wnd.com/2014/10/mystery-virus-found-where-illegal-alien-kids-sent/#Tpi5JI1JSAdGFyFz.99]:

“There are all kinds of diseases in the rest of the world, and we don’t want them in this country,” Schlafly said. “And it’s Obama’s job to keep them out.

“Out of all the things he’s done, I think this thing of letting these diseased people into this country to infect our own people is just the most outrageous of all.”

Laura Ingraham[http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/09/26/ingraham-suggests-obama-is-willing-to-expose-am/200913]:

The military is just another tool in his arsenal to level the playing field, right? I mean, in other words, Africa really deserves more of America’s money because we’re people of privilege. We’re people of great privilege, so we should do what we can, we the American taxpayers, to transfer wealth over to Africa. It’s his father’s rage against colonialism, as Dinesh D’Souza wrote about, and maybe this is a way to continue to atone for that.

…

If a few American military personnel have to be exposed to the Ebola virus to carry out this redistribution of the privileged’s wealth, then so be it.

Spain, Amid Protests, Destroys Dog of Ebola-Infected Nurse

MADRID — A dog named Excalibur who belonged to an Ebola-infected nurse was destroyed on Wednesday, even as protesters and animal rights activists surrounded the Madrid home of the nurse and her husband. An online petition calling for the dog’s life to be spared had drawn hundreds of thousands of signatures.

The furor came amid questions about whether dogs can get and transmit the disease.

In the United States, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Skinner, said Wednesday that studies had shown that dogs can have an immune response to Ebola, meaning that they can become infected. But he said there had been no reports of dogs or cats developing Ebola symptoms or passing the disease to other animals or to people.

The death of Excalibur, a 12-year-old rescue dog, was confirmed to reporters by Javier Rodríguez, an official from Madrid’s regional government. The body is expected to be cremated.

The nurse’s husband had pleaded publicly with officials in Madrid to change their minds about destroying the dog. He told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that there was no indication that Excalibur had been infected with Ebola. The nurse has been identified as María Teresa Romero Ramos.

The fate of the dog ignited a frenzy online. More than 390,000 people signed the petition[https://www.change.org/p/a-los-que-sea-m%C3%ADnimamente-sensibles-poner-en-cuarentena-o-aislamiento-al-perro-de-la-auxiliar-infectada-por-%C3%A9bola-en-lugar-de-sacrificarlo] to save his life. By comparison, about 150,000 people have signed a petition[http://www.change.org/p/food-and-drug-adminstration-fast-track-drug-and-vaccine-research-for-ebola-hemorrhagic-fever] urging the Food and Drug Administration to fast-track research on a potential vaccine and treatment for Ebola.

Twitter erupted with pleas[https://twitter.com/carolmachelle/status/519868819784105984] in both English and Spanish to save Excalibur’s life. Then, after Excalibur was killed, came posts[https://twitter.com/ItsAlxndrvsquz/status/519888958596341760] using the hashtag #RIPExcalibur. Some also suggested[https://twitter.com/santosbs6/status/519770440734998529] that more attention was being focused on the dog than on Ebola’s human victims.

Nearly 4,000 people in West Africa have died during the current Ebola epidemic, and global health authorities expect to see thousands more infections there. The Spanish nurse was the first person to become infected outside West Africa.

The only case diagnosed in the United States has been that of a Liberian man who had traveled from Liberia to Dallas and died in a hospital there Wednesday. Three infected American aid workers were transferred from West Africa to American hospitals and treated successfully, and a freelance cameraman for NBC [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/ashoka-mukpo-nbc-cameraman-with-ebola-to-return-to-us.html]who became infected in Liberia[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/ashoka-mukpo-nbc-cameraman-with-ebola-to-return-to-us.html] has been transferred to a hospital in Nebraska, where he is undergoing treatment.

Mr. Skinner said the disease centers were recommending that Ebola patients with dogs or cats at home “evaluate the animal’s risk of exposure,” meaning they should assess how likely it is that the animal has ingested bodily fluids like blood, vomit and feces from the patient. If the animal has been exposed, it should be monitored for 21 days, the incubation period for the disease.

Mr. Skinner said the C.D.C. was working with the American Veterinary Medical Association to study the issue and develop guidance for pets in the United States.

In a 2005 study[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/3/pdfs/04-0981.pdf] of dogs in Gabon done after an Ebola outbreak in 2001-02, researchers found that dogs can be infected with the virus, but that they show no symptoms.

The study, published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a C.D.C. journal, tested dogs in two villages in the heart of the Ebola outbreak, as well as dogs in a city with some human Ebola cases, dogs in distant villages and a control group of dogs in France. Of 159 dogs tested from the two villages, 40 had Ebola antibodies in their blood. This rate was significantly higher than the prevalence of antibodies found in dogs in the city with some human cases, three times higher than the dogs several hundred miles from the outbreak, and much higher than the dogs in France. Two out of 102 dogs tested in France had antibodies for Ebola.

The researchers said the possibility that pet dogs could become infected and transmit the virus to humans could not be ruled out. They noted that pet dogs in Gabon, as in many parts of Africa, probably have greater access to the wild animals that are the source of Ebola infections because African dogs often scavenge for food, eating small animals and organs from carcasses of wild animals killed by hunters, some of which were sources of human Ebola cases in Gabon.

“We observed that some dogs ate fresh remains of Ebola virus-infected dead animals brought back to the villages, and that others licked vomit from Ebola virus-infected patients,” the researchers reported.

None of the dogs in the study showed symptoms, unlike wild animals. In gorillas and chimpanzees, Ebola infection is often lethal, the study said. Still, it is possible that dogs exposed to Ebola could be a potential source of human infection if people come in contact with viral particles in dog urine, feces or saliva through “licking, biting or grooming,” the study said.

“Given the frequency of contact between humans and domestic dogs,” it said, “canine Ebola infection must be considered as a potential risk factor for human infection and virus spread.”

Still, Dr. Thomas Ksiazek, a longtime Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, said he was dubious that the dog in Spain needed to be destroyed. Even if Excalibur was infected, it is not known if dogs can transmit the virus to humans or other animals.

Raphael Minder reported from Madrid, and Pam Belluck from New York. Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting from Washington, and Denise Grady from Galveston, Tex.

Correction: October 11, 2014, Saturday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a decision to destroy the pet dog of an Ebola patient in Spain referred incorrectly to the results of a study that tested whether dogs can be infected with the virus. The researchers found Ebola antibodies, not antigens, in the animals’ blood. (An antigen is a substance to which the body reacts by producing antibodies.)

Death of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas Fuels Alarm Over Ebola

DALLAS — For Louise Troh, word of the death of her fiancé, Thomas Eric Duncan, unfolded Wednesday as everything else has since he was found to have Ebola — at a distance.

Dallas County’s chief executive, Clay Jenkins, and the Rev. George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church drove to the home where Ms. Troh, 54, has been under quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two other young men, all of whom had been living with Mr. Duncan during the time he began to show symptoms of the Ebola virus. They have been under orders from state health officials not to leave the premises for 21 days, the maximum incubation period of the virus.

“We never sat down,” said Mr. Mason, who is the pastor of the church Ms. Troh attends. “We did not touch them. We kept about a three-foot distance from them at all times. This is simply a matter of extreme caution.”

The death Wednesday morning of Mr. Duncan, 42, the Liberian man at the center of a widening public health scare and the first person with a case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States, heightened anxiety and fear here. It also renewed questions about whether a delay in receiving treatment could have played a role in his death and what role it played in the possibility of his spreading the disease to others.

His death came on a day when a sergeant with the Dallas County sheriff’s office who had been in the apartment where Mr. Duncan had been staying was rushed to the hospital and monitored for possible exposure to Ebola.

Federal health officials said that they had not confirmed whether the sergeant, identified as Michael Monnig, had definite contact with Ebola or definite symptoms of the virus, but that he was being assessed. Officials said it could take about 48 hours before they were certain of his condition. He was not one of the 48 people being monitored for the disease.

While there were condolences expressed throughout this city over Mr. Duncan’s death, there were also renewed questions about the handling of Mr. Duncan’s case by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and about whether Mr. Duncan would still be alive had he been admitted to the hospital when he first went to its emergency room on Sept. 25.

He was instead released, and returned three days later on Sept. 28 after his condition worsened.

“I trust a thorough examination will take place regarding all aspects of his care,” Ms. Troh said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said officials there were considering investigating the delay in treating Mr. Duncan for Ebola, including the hospital’s compliance with state health and safety laws and regulations. But she added that the agency’s “top focus right now is the contact investigation and monitoring.”

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Wednesday that although Ebola is fatal in a high proportion of patients, it is important for the disease to be diagnosed early.

“The earlier someone is diagnosed, the more likely they will be to survive,” Dr. Frieden said.

He declined to speculate on whether the delay had contributed to Mr. Duncan’s death. But agency officials have said generally that basic interventions — including intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and maintaining blood pressure — can significantly improve Ebola patients’ chances of survival.

Referring to the sheriff’s deputy being treated and monitored at Texas Health Presbyterian, Dr. Frieden said communities should be vigilant but prepared for false reports of the virus as fear of it spreads.

“There will be rumors and concerns and potential cases, and that is how it should be,” he said.

Mr. Duncan died at 7:51 a.m. Wednesday at Texas Health Presbyterian, eight days after the virus was detected in him on Sept. 30. State officials, following guidelines issued by the C.D.C. on the safe handling of the remains of Ebola patients, recommended to Mr. Duncan’s relatives that he be cremated, and the family agreed.

Texas Health Presbyterian at first blamed a problem with its electronic records system for Mr. Duncan’s release after his first visit, but it later reversed itself and said the system had operated correctly. It remains unclear why, and how, the hospital did not view Mr. Duncan as a potential Ebola case during his first visit to its emergency room, since both the nurses and the doctor had access to the critical information that although his symptoms were not severe, he had recently traveled from West Africa.

After the release of the statement by Ms. Troh, Mr. Mason, the pastor, said that when he and Mr. Jenkins broke the news to her, she had expressed frustration with the hospital’s handling of Mr. Duncan’s case.

“She expressed all the what ifs,” Mr. Mason said. “ ‘What if they had taken him right away? And what if they had been able to get the treatment to him earlier?’ ”

Mr. Duncan spent nearly two decades separated from Ms. Troh, with whom he had a son, Karsiah, a student at Angelo State University, west of Dallas. Mr. Duncan had missed Karsiah’s entire childhood while the couple was estranged, but he had been rebuilding his relationship with both Ms. Troh and Karsiah. In her statement, Ms. Troh said she was dealing with “sorrow and anger” that Karsiah had not been able to see his father before he died.

In the evening, hours after Mr. Duncan died, Mr. Mason spoke at a vigil at Wilshire Baptist and recounted some of the last moments of Mr. Duncan’s life. “The last words that Eric Duncan said were said to a nurse,” he told those gathered. “She asked him what he wanted. She said he wanted to see his son. He was proud of his son. She asked him then where his son was. He said he was in college, where he should be.”

DALLAS -- For Louise Troh, word of the death of her fiancé, Thomas Eric Duncan, unfolded Wednesday as everything else has since he was found to have Ebola -- at a distance.

Dallas County's chief executive, Clay Jenkins, and the Rev. George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church drove to the home where Ms. Troh, 54, has been under quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two other young men, all of whom had been living with Mr. Duncan during the time he began to show symptoms of the Ebola virus. They have been under orders from state health officials not to leave the premises for 21 days, the maximum incubation period of the virus.

''We never sat down,'' said Mr. Mason, who is the pastor of the church Ms. Troh attends. ''We did not touch them. We kept about a three-foot distance from them at all times. This is simply a matter of extreme caution.''

The death Wednesday morning of Mr. Duncan, 42, the Liberian man at the center of a widening public health scare and the first person with a case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States, heightened anxiety and fear here. It also renewed questions about whether a delay in receiving treatment could have played a role in his death and what role it played in the possibility of his spreading the disease to others.

His death came on a day when a sergeant with the Dallas County sheriff's office who had been in the apartment where Mr. Duncan had been staying was rushed to the hospital and monitored for possible exposure to Ebola.

Federal health officials said that they had not confirmed whether the sergeant, identified as Michael Monnig, had definite contact with Ebola or definite symptoms of the virus, but that he was being assessed. Officials said it could take about 48 hours before they were certain of his condition. He was not one of the 48 people being monitored for the disease.

While there were condolences expressed throughout this city over Mr. Duncan's death, there were also renewed questions about the handling of Mr. Duncan's case by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and about whether Mr. Duncan would still be alive had he been admitted to the hospital when he first went to its emergency room on Sept. 25.

He was instead released, and returned three days later on Sept. 28 after his condition worsened.

''I trust a thorough examination will take place regarding all aspects of his care,'' Ms. Troh said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said officials there were considering investigating the delay in treating Mr. Duncan for Ebola, including the hospital's compliance with state health and safety laws and regulations.

Australian Nurse, Returning From Sierra Leone, Tested for Ebola

SYDNEY, Australia — An Australian nurse who worked for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] treating patients suffering from Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] has developed a fever and been admitted to a hospital in Cairns, in northeast Australia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/australia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The chief health officer for the state of Queensland, Dr. Jeannette Young, said on Thursday that the woman had returned over the weekend from a month of work in Sierra Leone. She landed in Brisbane, the state’s capital and most populous city, and then traveled to her home in Cairns.

“Importantly, she has reported that while in Sierra Leone strict personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., procedures were followed at all times and were not breached at any stage,” Dr. Young said in a statement issued by the state government’s Health Department.

The statement said the “broader community is not at risk of contracting Ebola virus disease regardless of whether this health care worker has the disease or not,” because the nurse followed strict protocols after returning to Australia, including taking her own temperature twice daily and remaining in isolation at home.

At a news conference held in Brisbane, Dr. Young said the 57-year-old woman, who has not been identified by name, was well when she returned to Australia.

“She has been exposed to people with the disease while working with people in Sierra Leone,” Dr. Young told reporters. “She has been in home isolation since then, following the protocol that we put in place nationally.

“This morning she rang up as part of that national protocol because she had developed a low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius,” or 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Young said. “We felt it important that she come into the Cairns hospital and be tested for Ebola virus disease.”

Blood samples have been taken from the woman to be tested in Brisbane, and results would be known in the early hours of Friday. She remains in isolation at the Cairns hospital.

The Health Department statement added: “While Ebola is a very serious disease, it is not highly contagious as it cannot be caught through coughing or sneezing; a person is not infectious until they are unwell with the disease.” It noted that the infection risk is extremely low unless there has been direct exposure to an infected person’s bodily fluids.

The Australian nurse is the second person in Queensland State to be tested for the Ebola virus. A 27-year-old man from the Gold Coast was tested Sept. 11, after he returned to Queensland from travels in Africa. The man’s test results were negative for the virus.

In a statement on Wednesday, the World Health Organization said that there were around 8,033 confirmed cases of Ebola and 3,879 people had died, including 725 confirmed deaths in Sierra Leone, one of the worst affected nations in the current outbreak.

The W.H.O. said the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, had reported a surge in new cases over the past seven to eight weeks. More than 200 health care workers have died from Ebola, most of them in West Africa.

Only two cases have been diagnosed outside West Africa: A Liberian man began showing symptoms four days after arriving in Dallas, Tex., and he died on Wednesday; and a Spanish nurse, working in Madrid, has tested positive for the disease after treating a missionary who had contracted the disease in Sierra Leone.

Spain Quarantines 3 More in Bid to Contain Ebola

MADRID — The Spanish health authorities said Thursday that the condition of an auxiliary nurse infected by Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] had worsened, three days after she became the first person to test positive for the disease in Europe.

The deterioration in the nurse’s condition came as the authorities announced that one more medical staff member had been quarantined, in addition to three others who were isolated overnight at the same hospital.

Altogether about 80 people are being monitored to see if they develop symptoms of Ebola as Spain seeks to prevent the virus from spreading. Seven people are now quarantined at the hospital, Carlos III, that Spain has designated to handle Ebola cases.

Yolanda Fuentes, the hospital’s deputy director, told reporters on Thursday that the condition of the infected nurse, María Teresa Romero Ramos, had worsened, without providing details. The brother of the nurse told a regional television station that he had been advised by one of the doctors treating his sister that there was “not much hope” that she could overcome the virus.

Ms. Romero tested positive for Ebola on Monday, six days after she first reported feeling ill and after tending to a Spanish missionary who died at the hospital on Sept. 25.

The efforts to contain the disease coincided with the launch of an investigation by Madrid’s public prosecutor into what went wrong and mounting criticism from medical staff members involved in treating Ebola patients about the safety rules under which they have been working.

The criticism is putting pressure not only on the regional authorities in Madrid but also on the central government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has turned down calls to dismiss his health minister, Ana Mato, over the handling of the Ebola case.

The case has also set off accusations among local politicians and health specialists, as well as criticism directed at Ms. Romero for allegedly failing to strictly follow Spain’s health safety protocol.

Francisco José Rodríguez, the official responsible for health issues within the regional government of Madrid, was forced to apologize Thursday after suggesting a day earlier that Ms. Romero “may have been lying to us” about her condition and the extent of her fever when she called health services to report being ill.

Mr. Rodríguez had also criticized the nurse for allegedly failing to inform the doctor who initially assessed her fever that she had handled an Ebola patient. After his comments sparked controversy, Mr. Rodríguez told the radio station Cadena Ser on Thursday that “if I have to resign, I will resign.”

Some health care employees have been protesting outside Carlos III and other medical facilities since Monday, and others have denounced the failures of the safety protocols.

Juan Manuel Parra Ramírez, a doctor who attended Ms. Romero when she was first hospitalized on Monday in Alcorcón, on the outskirts of Madrid, sent an open letter to Madrid health authorities criticizing the conditions in which he tended to her.

The sleeves of the protective suit he was given were too short, he said, while he learned only through the news media that Ms. Romero had tested positive for Ebola, according to his letter, which was published Thursday by Spanish newspapers.

On Wednesday, the authorities offered the first official explanation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/europe/spain-nurse-ebola.html] of how Ms. Romero may have been infected. A doctor who has been treating her said that, based on her own account, she touched her face with her gloves on after removing her protective suit following a visit to the room of Manuel García Viejo, the Spanish missionary who had Ebola.

Criticism has centered on just why the medical team that treated Ebola patients included people with relatively low qualifications like Ms. Romero, who volunteered, and why such staff members were then handed risky duties that involved direct access to the patient, including the removal of infected material from his room.

Unlike registered nurses, auxiliaries typically receive no advanced training and are generally assigned tasks like washing patients or bringing them food.

Some hospital staff members have said the safety protocol was not only inadequate but was also explained only in a single, short training session.

Another element of concern is why the protocol allowed Ms. Romero to go on vacation the day after the missionary died, putting her out of direct communication with her team and the hospital.

By contrast, the aid group Doctors Without Borders, which has been leading efforts to treat Ebola cases in Africa, requires staff members to remain under direct monitoring during the period after their duty tour.

Still, Rubén Moreno, a health spokesman for the governing Popular Party, told Spanish national television on Thursday that there was nothing wrong with Spain’s safety protocol, but that “you need to make adjustments” in any such protocol.

“It’s obvious that the patient herself has recognized she didn’t respect fully the protocol,” Mr. Moreno said. “The protocol is one thing and compliance another.”

Accounts differ over why Ms. Romero was not immediately hospitalized when she reported feeling feverish to a medical center on Sept. 30.

Six days later, on Monday, when Ms. Romero called health services to report that her condition had worsened, she was taken by a regular ambulance to a hospital in Alcorcón, near to her home, but which has no infrastructure designed to deal specifically with a disease like Ebola. She was then transferred to Carlos III Hospital shortly after midnight, several hours after she had tested positive for Ebola.

Officials disinfected Ms. Romero’s home on Thursday, a day after her dog, Excalibur, was put down as a precautionary measure[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/science/ebola-dog-excalibur-nurse-spain.html], amid protests from animal rights activists, who tried to block access to the home. Excalibur’s fate also incited widespread outrage on social media.

Britain to Screen for Ebola Amid Possible New Cases in Europe

LONDON — Concerns about the spread of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] grew in Europe on Thursday, as several possible new cases were reported and Britain said it would introduce measures at airports and rail terminals to screen passengers from affected countries.

The British move came after the United States announced Wednesday that it would enhance screening methods at five major airports for people arriving from the three West African countries hardest hit by the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus.

“Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals,” said a statement[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ebola-update-chief-medical-officer-advice-on-uk-screening] from Prime Minister David Cameron’s office, referring to the city’s international rail link with continental Europe. The statement said that monitoring had been in place in airports in the worst-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but that additional precautions would be introduced in Britain following advice from the country’s chief medical officer.

The measures will involve “assessing passengers’ recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel,” the statement said.

The announcement was an about-face for the government, which earlier had played down the need for tighter controls, saying entry screening in Britain “is not recommended” by the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

In Skopje, Macedonia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/macedonia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], a British man died of Ebola-like symptoms on Thursday, the authorities told Reuters. The hotel where he had stayed was sealed off, sequestering another Briton with whom he had been traveling and the hotel staff inside. A Health Ministry official said the man had arrived in Skopje from Britain on Oct. 2 and had been rushed on Thursday afternoon to the hospital.

The official, Dr. Jovanka Kostovska, of the ministry’s Commission for Infectious Diseases, said the man had been suffering from fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and internal bleeding, and that his condition deteriorated rapidly, Reuters reported. A Macedonian government spokesman told the BBC that he could not confirm that Ebola was the cause of death. He said samples of blood and tissue were being sent to a laboratory in Frankfurt for analysis. The man’s traveling companion told the authorities they had traveled to Skopje directly from Britain and had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks, the spokesman said.

Also on Thursday, a Prague hospital said it was testing a 56-year-old Czech man with Ebola-like symptoms, a hospital spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman said the man, who had traveled in Liberia, was in isolation at Bulovka hospital in Prague and that tests had been carried out and sent to a laboratory in Berlin. Results should be known on Friday, he said.

In Spain, where the first case of Ebola transmission outside of Africa surfaced this week, the health authorities said Thursday that the condition of the infected nurse, María Teresa Romero Ramos, had worsened.

The authorities also announced that one more health care worker had been quarantined, in addition to three others who were isolated overnight at the same Madrid hospital where the nurse works.

About 80 people are being monitored to see if they develop symptoms of Ebola as Spain seeks to prevent the virus from spreading. Seven people are now quarantined at the hospital, Carlos III, that Spain has designated to handle Ebola cases.

Yolanda Fuentes, the hospital’s deputy director, told reporters on Thursday that the nurse’s condition had worsened but declined to provide details. The nurse’s brother told a regional television station that he had been advised by one of the doctors treating his sister that there was “not much hope” that she could overcome the virus.

Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid, and Nicola Clark from Paris.

West Africans Make Plea for Long List of Ebola Needs

WASHINGTON — The presidents of the three West African countries most affected by Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] implored world leaders on Thursday to increase their support to fight the disease, saying that while the international response has expanded, it has been slow to be felt on the ground.

The African heads of state spoke at the World Bank[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org] headquarters here, where the world’s top financial and economic development leaders have gathered for annual meetings of the bank and the International Monetary Fund[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

No new money was committed, but the United States and the European Commission pledged to provide medical evacuation services for health workers deploying to the countries, removing a major obstacle to larger flows of skilled medical professionals to Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

“The fight on the ground in Sierra Leone urgently needs the help of the people gathered here today,” that country’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said via video link. “Commitment on paper and during the meetings are good. But commitments as physical facts on the ground are best.”

The aim of the meeting was to place the leaders of the three countries in front of the world’s most influential economic and political leaders to plainly state their case.

The president of the monetary fund, Christine Lagarde[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/christine_lagarde/index.html?inline=nyt-per], attended, as did Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations. President Alpha Condé of Guinea attended in person, while President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Liberia and Mr. Koroma appeared by video link.

“Today I’d like to invite the three heads of state to be very frank,” said Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. “We’re still way behind the curve.”

Mr. Koroma ticked off a long list of needs: treatment centers with 1,500 more beds; an additional 5,250 medical workers, including 750 doctors, 3,000 nurses and 1,500 support staff members; 200 ambulances; 1,000 motorcycles for workers tracking people exposed to Ebola; five new Ebola testing laboratories; and 200 vehicles for burial teams and other workers.

“We have clearly stated what is required, and what is required is required yesterday,” Mr. Koroma said.

Mr. Condé appealed to donors to work directly with each country’s government. A representative of Japan said his government’s shipment of 20,000 sets of protective gear left Japan on Sept. 18, but was stuck in an airport in Abidjan, a city in the Ivory Coast. Mr. Condé said he had raised this problem with the Ivorian prime minister.

“We get lost in bureaucracy and what is needed doesn’t get to the end user,” he said in an interview. The only protective gear that Guinea is now receiving comes from Unicef, he said.

Dr. Bruce Aylward, who began coordinating the Ebola response for the World Health Organization on Oct. 1, reported that although a lot of international workers are reaching cities in the region, yawning gaps remained at the district level, with very little coordination. He said he spent his first week in the region figuring out what each of the 45 affected districts in the three countries needed. He said that responders were trying to build a campaign against Ebola in weeks — in contrast to another ambitious push, the global effort to eradicate polio[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/poliomyelitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which he said took a decade and 7,000 workers.

He said he aimed to have a full inventory of each district’s capacities and systems for logistics and transfer of information within 60 days. He told the meeting that his goal was to ensure that 70 percent of burials were safe and 70 percent of Ebola cases were isolated within 60 days.

He set those goals because, as he put it, “I want people really scared every day.”

In a reminder of the pressing needs, Doctors Without Borders announced on Thursday that the number of Ebola cases in Conakry, Guinea’s capital, had suddenly spiked.

The aid group said in a news release that there had been 22 new patients admitted to the Ebola management center at Donka on Monday alone, and that the center is now exceeding capacity. Stephane Hauser, the group’s field coordinator at Donka, noted that cases had increased steadily since August and that there were new transmission chains “whose origins we don’t know at the moment.”

SUAKOKO, Liberia — Peering inside a red Nissan hatchback that had pulled up to the gate of an Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] treatment center here, a guard saw an older woman holding a tiny newborn, a young woman sprawled in the back seat and a man in his 60s crouched in the rear, gripping her clothing so she did not slide off.

The woman, the couple told aid workers who quickly gathered Saturday afternoon, was their daughter. She had been sick for a week and was bleeding profusely after giving birth prematurely about two hours before. Her boyfriend, the baby’s father, had recently been treated for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], they added.

Workers asked the couple to wait outside the gate, where a masked man with a chlorine sprayer soaked the ground around them. Before sending the car to the triage area, a doctor opened a back door and saw no movement. Realizing he needed protective gear, he went to suit up, then examined the woman and pronounced her dead.

For her child, there were no clear protocols. No one touched the tiny girl, aside from the grandparents holding her. No one at the center had any experience in dealing with babies in the Ebola crisis, nor could they fully evaluate the dangers. They were caregivers, after all, at a place of last resort. In a country devastated by a terrible disease, where the fear of it is pervasive, what do you do with a vulnerable infant?

“Every time somebody’s sick, people say Ebola,” John Yarkpawolo, 66, the baby’s grandfather, said later. “People are afraid.”

His wife, Annie Yarkpawolo, 64, a trained midwife[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/midwives/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], had sensed trouble when she received a phone call two nights earlier at her home in Gbarnga, she recalled. Emmanuel Dormeyan, the longtime boyfriend of her oldest daughter, Diana Flomo, 36, said he was bringing her from their home in Monrovia, more than four hours away.

“What happened?” Mrs. Yarkpawolo remembered asking. Mr. Dormeyan told her, “Your daughter can’t hear me, can hardly understand, can’t eat for a week,” she said.

The next morning, he dropped off Ms. Flomo, who was eight months pregnant and sold market goods in Monrovia. A day later, she suddenly gave birth and began hemorrhaging. While tending to her daughter, Mrs. Yarkpawolo tied plastic bags around her wrists and shoes, her usual protection during deliveries.

“She were bleeding, bleeding, water running,” she recalled. She and her husband, a social studies teacher, had no car, but found the young driver of the red Nissan willing to take them to nearby C. B. Dunbar maternity center.

There they waited for perhaps an hour and a half before a doctor became available. He offered no help, they said, but urged them to go to Phebe Hospital, also in Gbarnga. The family traveled on to Phebe, and again they waited. “She gave up,” Mrs. Yarkpawolo said of her daughter. She was not admitted. A doctor eventually sent the family a half-hour away to the Ebola treatment center, newly opened by the American charity International Medical Corps[https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/].

Many health workers in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and its virus-ravaged neighbors have contracted Ebola while attending to births and being exposed to blood and other body fluids, provoking fears of providing maternity care. Turning pregnant women away was such a common occurrence that Yekeh Gayflor, the guard at the treatment center, sized up the situation as soon as the Nissan pulled up. “We didn’t need to ask questions,” he said.

It was not clear whether Ms. Flomo had even had Ebola; her family did not mention a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which typically accompanies the disease, and her symptoms could be explained by other maladies common in the region. But the center did not have equipment to test for Ebola after death, such as by swabbing her mouth. If she did have it, her baby could have been infected.

There is little research, but doctors speculate that Ebola can be transmitted from mother to baby in utero or during exposure to fluids while passing through the birth canal. A high proportion of pregnant women with Ebola miscarry and die. In outbreak areas, one study[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/179/Supplement_1/S11.long] noted, every pregnant woman who is hemorrhaging should be viewed as a suspected victim of Ebola.

The International Medical Corps unit had never had a case like this in its three weeks of existence, and none of its doctors or nurses had treated Ebola before working here. “M.S.F. will know,” Sean Casey, the team leader at the center, said, using the French abbreviation for Doctors Without Borders. He called Dr. Anja Wolz, an Ebola treatment veteran based elsewhere in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], who had offered to give advice on tough cases. “The baby’s not ever eaten,” Mr. Casey told Dr. Wolz.

Dr. Wolz suggested that the baby not be admitted; if she was not infected, she could be exposed to the deadly virus. If the grandmother had symptoms and required admission, she suggested, perhaps a nurse could be found to care for the newborn, using protective gear just in case. She told Mr. Casey that she thought the baby had very little chance of survival.

How to feed the baby and give her a chance? Staff members found a can of powdered baby formula. They boiled water and filled a bottle, and Mr. Casey translated the French instructions for how much powder to add. But the directions were intended for babies of at least two weeks of age, and this was an hours-old preemie[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/premature-infant/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. The aid workers guessed at the right volume and walked down the driveway to the grandparents. But the baby was not sucking. Someone brought a small syringe, and the grandmother dripped the formula into the infant’s mouth.

Afterward, a nurse, Audrey Rangel, asked screening questions and found that neither grandparent showed any symptoms of Ebola. Their driver had left, so the charity sent them home with the baby in an ambulance, but notified a religious leader on the local county’s Ebola task force to help smooth their return and avoid stigmatization.

The couple were given gloves for handling the baby, a list of instructions written on a piece of notebook paper in English and a thermometer for monitoring their own temperatures in case they had contracted Ebola. They would also get a bucket and chlorine and instructions on how to clean the house where Ms. Flomo had given birth. Later, they were placed under quarantine by local officials, which made them worry about how they would get food during the 21-day period.

“This is new for all of us,” Mr. Casey said later, at once frustrated that the clinic could not do more and mindful that, as an Ebola unit rather than a hospital, it was not set up to do so.

“It still wasn’t the right solution,” he said, “but it was the best we could do.”

He sat down with the unit’s program coordinator, who grabbed a notebook and wrote “Hmm?” on top, then listed questions for which the unit needed to develop answers.

1. “Are there admission criteria for infants? Other children who can’t communicate symptoms?”

2. “What is the protocol for a child that cannot eat/care for themselves?

3. “What food for <2 wks. baby.”

Another question: how to coordinate with local contact-tracing efforts to help stop the spread of Ebola among people at risk from confirmed patients?

At the grandparents’ house the next day, the baby’s face was cocooned in sheets. Her father, Mr. Dormeyan, had come from Monrovia to meet her and named her Diana, just like her mother. He wanted his daughter tested for Ebola, he said, and was desperate to know how Ms. Flomo had died, a question that might never be answered. “I want to know what’s the cause,” he said.

Her mother was grieving. When one of Mrs. Yarkpawolo’s sisters came down a dirt path past banana palms to the yard outside the family’s modest home in a neighborhood of Gbarnga called Millionaire Quarter, the two women keened and rocked. “My oldest daughter has died,” Mrs. Yarkpawolo cried.

Diana was still being fed through the syringe and seemed to be doing well. But on Tuesday night she cried and did not sleep. On Wednesday morning, the formula seemed to stick in her throat. She vomited and breathed hard for a while, the grandparents reported. Then she died.

A county burial team sprayed the small body and the room she had been in with diluted bleach. Mr. Yarkpawolo traveled with the group to the Ebola treatment center. He wanted to make sure his granddaughter would be placed near his daughter, who had been interred three days before.

The smell of chlorine hung in the air. In a blizzard of spades, four men quickly filled the small hole, then tapped a marker — “In Loving Memory of Diana Dormeyan,” it said in handwritten letters — into the soft earth. Mr. Yarkpawolo wiped his face. “Thank you, man,” he said to a worker. “O.K., Pop,” the man replied.

City Hall Memo
N.Y. / Region
De Blasio’s Transparency Is Turning Opaque Under Fire

To Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the recent commotion over Rachel Noerdlinger[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/nyregion/new-york-city-said-to-open-inquiry-on-omission-by-top-aide-to-chirlane-mccray.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D], his wife’s top aide — who failed to disclose during a background check that she lives with a boyfriend who has a serious criminal history — is a tabloid-fueled personal attack that merits no further discussion.

“Case closed,” the mayor said this week, adopting the move-it-along-folks attitude that has quickly become a de Blasio signature during his first nine months in office.

It is not unusual for mayors to want irritating story lines to go away. But the Noerdlinger episode has fueled a broader question about Mr. de Blasio and the values of his young administration: how a onetime champion of transparency and accountability can square those ideals with the newfound power — and frustrations — of his office.

As a candidate, Mr. de Blasio pledged an ask-me-anything era at City Hall, promoting himself as a different, friendlier breed of political leader. And as public advocate, he frequently assailed former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for standing by senior aides, such as the former schools chief Cathleen P. Black[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/education/08black.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D], who had found themselves under fire.

Now, experiencing some of the same difficulties faced by his predecessors, Mr. de Blasio is responding with the same sort of peevishness and obfuscation he once bemoaned.

The mayor has shut down questions about why he phoned a high-ranking police official after the arrest of a campaign supporter, telling reporters, “That’s the end of the story.” Told by a television reporter that New Yorkers wanted to know why his police-issued S.U.V. was speeding on residential streets in Queens, the mayor replied, “I’m not interested in the construct of what you as an individual think many New Yorkers think.”

Even lighthearted queries can prompt a stony response. Last month, Mr. de Blasio refused to say how he felt after learning of the death of Staten Island Chuck, the groundhog who fell from his arms in a ceremonial mishap. “Talk to the Staten Island Zoo,” the mayor said, mirthlessly.

Determined not to let critics or news coverage set their agenda, Mr. de Blasio and his City Hall advisers have taken to ignoring inquiries on matters that displease them. His communications team believes strongly that most negative stories will disappear, or at least be forgotten by the time Mr. de Blasio’s re-election effort rolls around in 2017.

That approach is being tested again by the episode involving Ms. Noerdlinger, a former adviser to the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is paid $170,000 a year predominantly to shape the image of the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray.

The facts of the matter are not in dispute. Ms. Noerdlinger lives with a boyfriend, Hassaun McFarlan, who went to prison for manslaughter as a teenager and has been arrested several times since, including last fall when he nearly struck a New Jersey police officer while driving Ms. Noerdlinger’s car.

When she applied for her job, Ms. Noerdlinger informed the mayor’s team about her relationship. But she did not list Mr. McFarlan as a resident of her home on a formal background questionnaire used by the city’s Department of Investigation to vet candidates for high-ranking city positions.

If there is a simple explanation for the discrepancy, Mr. de Blasio and his team are not providing it. For a week, the mayor’s office has not answered questions about why Ms. Noerdlinger left out her boyfriend’s name, an omission that can be punished by dismissal.

Mr. de Blasio’s aides have also declined to release or discuss the contents of a letter sent to the mayor last week by Mark G. Peters, the commissioner of the Investigation Department, which conducted an inquiry into Ms. Noerdlinger’s actions. The letter summarizes the findings of the inquiry, but Phil Walzak, the mayor’s press secretary, said in an email that he could not discuss those findings “because this document is subject to privacy protections.” The mayor’s office has not provided a legal basis for those protections.

Instead, the mayor’s office issued a statement saying simply that the Investigation Department had found no “intent to deceive the mayor or City Hall” on the part of Ms. Noerdlinger, whom Mr. de Blasio chose not to discipline beyond a note in her personnel file.

Ms. Noerdlinger’s actions, by themselves, do not amount to a Watergate-size scandal. But the mayor’s response has troubled some who believe she is being afforded special protection.

“I would have expected at the very least a slap on the wrist,” said Kenneth Sherrill, who taught political science at Hunter College for 41 years. “I find it hard to believe that a rank-and-file public employee who even mistakenly filled out a form like that would not be punished.”

“I enthusiastically support the right of anyone to have a personal life,” Mr. Sherrill added. “The disclosure thing, obviously, is troubling.”

For the mayor, the political dynamics at play are complex.

Ms. Noerdlinger is black, and Mr. de Blasio’s team believes privately that the criticism of her has been racially charged. Police unions, angered by the influential role given to Mr. Sharpton in the de Blasio administration, have seized on reports about Ms. Noerdlinger’s boyfriend — including claims that he referred to law enforcement officers as “pigs” in online postings — to say she should not occupy a high-ranking place in City Hall.

Mr. de Blasio is also reluctant to acquiesce to pressure, believing that to punish Ms. Noerdlinger would amount to ceding personnel decisions to outsiders, advisers who are familiar with his thinking say.

“She is a good public servant, and that’s what I respect,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference on Staten Island this week, where he was repeatedly questioned about Ms. Noerdlinger’s omission (and where he made his “case closed” remarks).

To combat questions of transparency, the mayor’s press office often notes that it distributes a near-verbatim transcript of every mayoral news conference just hours after it has occurred.

But this week brought an unusual exception. Mr. de Blasio made his comments about Ms. Noerdlinger on Monday afternoon. By Thursday evening, the transcript from that event had still not been sent.

William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

SYDNEY, Australia -- An Australian nurse who reported a fever after returning from Sierra Leone, where she had worked at an Ebola treatment hospital, has been found not to have the disease, health officials said on Friday.

The nurse, a 57-year-old woman who was not identified, was tested on Wednesday after developing a low-grade fever on her return home to Cairns in Queensland from a monthlong assignment at a hospital in West Africa run by the International Red Cross. The Queensland Health Department said her tests came back negative.

She was the second person to be tested for the disease in Australia. A man from Queensland's Gold Coast also returned a negative test result on Sept. 11.

WASHINGTON -- Darkness is enveloping American politics.

With four weeks to go before the midterm elections, Republicans have made questions of how safe we are -- from disease, terrorism or something unspoken and perhaps more ominous -- central in their attacks against Democrats. Their message is decidedly grim: President Obama and the Democratic Party run a government that is so fundamentally broken it cannot offer its people the most basic protection from harm.

Hear it on cable television and talk radio, where pundits and politicians play scientists speculating on whether Ebola will mutate into an airborne virus that kills millions. See it in the black-hooded, machine-gun-brandishing Islamic extremists appearing in campaign ads. Read about it in the unnerving accounts of the Secret Service leaving Mr. Obama and his family exposed.

Republicans believe they have found the sentiment that will tie congressional races together with a single national theme.

The National Republican Congressional Committee is running ads warning that terrorists are streaming across the Mexican border. ''Evil forces around the world want to harm Americans every day,'' one commercial aimed at Representative Anne Kirkpatrick of Arizona, a Democrat, says. ''Their entry into our country? Through Arizona's backyard.''

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

Republicans like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana -- all possible 2016 presidential candidates -- have accused Mr. Obama of leaving Americans vulnerable to the Ebola epidemic. Conservative media like the Drudge Report have created crude puns to rhyme the president's last name with the virus. The Daily Caller has christened him ''President Ebola.''

And after news broke that the Secret Service had failed in several instances to adequately protect the first family, it was one of the president's biggest antagonists on Capitol Hill, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who convened a hearing and upbraided the agency's director for incompetence.

''I think Republicans want people to turn on the television and see that nothing is working,'' said Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's former spokesman.

Mr. Gibbs said he found it curious that John A. Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, used the word ''competence'' in a recent interview when describing what voters would care about. But whether voters will place all the blame on Democrats is another question. ''It will be interesting to see,'' Mr. Gibbs said, ''if they can convince people that they aren't part of that dysfunction.''

When Republicans picked up seats in the House and Senate in 2010, they did so by running on burning emotional issues like unemployment and anger over the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

While anger and economic unease have subsided, polls suggest that people are anxious. A recent survey by The Associated Press found that 53 percent of Americans believe the risk of another terrorist attack inside the country is extremely high or very high. In a new Pew poll, 41 percent said they had ''not too much confidence'' or ''no confidence at all'' that the government could prevent a major Ebola outbreak in the United States.

That lack of confidence in the government is a sentiment Republicans are trying to tether to Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party.

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, ticked off a list of distressing developments in the headlines -- the Secret Service problems, Ebola, the militant group Islamic State. ''It's the accumulation of ineptitude that's hovering over Obama and, in turn, his lieutenants that are running for U.S. Senate,'' he said in an interview.

Numerous political ads, paid for by both outside groups and the Republican Party, warn of the ''dangerous world'' we inhabit and ''imminent attacks'' being plotted by terrorists. One from the National Republican Senatorial Committee running against Senator Mark Udall in Colorado plays a clip of the senator saying that the Islamic State does not pose an imminent threat. ''Really? Can we take that chance?'' the announcer says.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

One Republican candidate for a House seat from Arizona used footage in an ad that aired in Phoenix this week showing an Islamic State member brandishing a knife at the journalist James Foley right before he was beheaded.

Even the infamous 1964 ''Daisy'' ad aired by President Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign -- which depicted a girl picking petals off a flower as the clock ticked down to a nuclear blast -- has been recycled by Rob Astorino, the Republican running against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.

Playing off feelings of anxiety is a powerful strategy for motivating the Republican base. And few issues have proven as potent when linked together as border security and the fear of terrorism. Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, said this week on Fox News that border agents had told him they apprehended 10 Islamic State fighters in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security said his statement was ''categorically false.''

The issue also surfaced in the race between Senator Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis in North Carolina. Mr. Tillis, the Republican speaker of the State House, tried to connect border security to terrorism and disease in a debate this week. ''Ladies and gentlemen,'' he said, ''we have an Ebola outbreak, we have bad actors who can come across the border. We need to seal the border and secure it.''

Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, made a similar charge on Thursday, saying, ''People with Ebola and other infectious diseases can enter the country without being challenged.'' The Obama administration countered that argument on Wednesday, saying that it would begin tighter screening of people entering the country from West Africa at five major airports, including checking their temperatures.

The Family Research Council recently convened a gathering of thousands of supporters in Washington, and one of the major topics on the agenda was terrorists sneaking across the border. The lieutenant governor of Texas, David Dewhurst, warned the group that prayer rugs had been discovered along the Mexican border. (Similar stories have popped up in the media since at least 2005.)

A sense that the country is dangerously off track is an increasingly popular topic of conversation in conservative media.

When Mr. Paul called into the Glenn Beck program the other day, Mr. Beck said he saw a pattern in Ebola, the lack of border security and gaps in Secret Service protection. (''I don't think the president is safe,'' Mr. Beck said. ''And that puts our entire system at risk.'')

Mr. Paul agreed, saying something in our society was deeply broken. ''The fundamental and inherent problem of government in general,'' the senator said, ''is trying to get government to work.'' He also said Mr. Obama's ''political correctness'' was keeping him from more aggressively containing the disease.

Erick Erickson, the conservative writer and radio host, wrote: ''At least this administration is consistent. It will let everyone and everything, including pestilence, cross our border.''

''I bet, if we are patient,'' he added, ''the administration will even place Ebola with a nice family somewhere in Middle America and give it government benefits.''

Republicans said the hyperbole highlighted the perception that the president, with his no-drama air, often plays down the seriousness of the problems facing the country.

''The recurring pattern here is his unwillingness to admit things are bad,'' said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist who was Mitt Romney's top adviser in 2012. ''It's sort of like saying the world isn't what it is, which is not an uncommon thing in the White House.''

A campaign ad aimed at Representative Anne Kirkpatrick of Arizona warning of terrorists and one in Colorado criticizing Senator Mark Udall's stance on the Islamic State. (A17)

Labor Secretary Emerges as a Top Candidate for Attorney General

Good Friday morning from Washington, where a Supreme Court ruling on voter ID has upset election plans in Wisconsin, President Obama is enjoying a hug from Hollywood and an obsessive artist has captured a new side of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The White House is moving more quickly than anticipated to select a new attorney general and is poised to announce President Obama’s choice before the Nov. 4 election, with Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez emerging as a leading candidate.

Many on Capitol Hill expected the president to wait until after the election to avoid making the nominee a campaign issue for embattled Democratic Senate candidates. But people familiar with the administration’s planning now say an announcement could come in the next few weeks.

No final decision has been made, they said, but Mr. Perez, 53, a former Justice Department civil rights official and the son of Dominican immigrants, is at the top of the list. His nomination would be applauded by many Hispanic leaders. And he has a compelling personal story, having worked as a trash collector to help put himself through Brown University.

Other candidates, including Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, remain under consideration. Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel, is still in contention, though a possible obstacle arose for her this week over her handling of an internal review into possible misconduct by White House staff traveling in advance of a presidential trip to Colombia in 2012.

The Washington Post reported[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-disputes-report-that-aides-had-not-thoroughly-investigated-cartagena-tie/2014/10/09/d076df86-4ff9-11e4-aa5e-7153e466a02d_story.html] that a hotel log suggested a young volunteer had a female guest in his room, possibly a prostitute, but that in an inquiry, Ms. Ruemmler found no wrongdoing. The White House stood by her, and allies suggested the episode did not disqualify her. But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the committee that would review the nomination, made it clear it would be an issue if she were nominated.

Mr. Perez was opposed for the labor post by Republicans, who branded him an ideologue who selectively enforced civil rights laws. But Democrats could push the nomination through in a lame-duck session on a simple majority vote. The fact that Mr. Perez went through the confirmation process and extensive background check as recently as last year is also an advantage.

With Voter ID Ruling, Justices Present Walker With a Challenge

The Supreme Court’s decision late Thursday to block Wisconsin from forcing voters to produce photo identification at the polls is a setback for the man who signed the bill into law, Gov. Scott Walker.

Mr. Walker, a Republican, had been expected to benefit from a Sept. 12 appellate decision that cleared the way for the ID requirement, which courts had delayed for several years. Critics say such laws are aimed at discouraging minorities, who are often seen as reliable Democrats, from casting ballots. And Mr. Walker is in a battle with Mary Burke, a Democrat, that could hinge on which of them can turn out the most of their base voters Nov. 4.

The Supreme Court ruling is also giving the nearly 2,000 clerks who handle Wisconsin’s highly decentralized voting system another case of whiplash. Since the appeals court ruling, they have been rushing to educate voters and poll watchers about the requirement. On Friday, the clerks are expected to, in essence, tell them, “Never mind.”

Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Walker, expressed confidence that Wisconsin would eventually be allowed to carry out the ID law.

Georgia Candidates’ Fiercest Backers: Mom and Grandma

Georgia has two candidates of famous lineage this cycle: Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter who is running for governor, and Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn who is running for the Senate herself.

But the more intriguing figures behind the scenes may be the families’ matriarchs: Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, and Michelle’s mother, Colleen Nunn.

Mrs. Carter, 87, is so eager for campaign updates that she sometimes reads them in the middle of the night so she can brief the former president when he wakes up. “He is the second-most political person in the couple,” Jason Carter said of the former president. “And he is the second-most engaged in the campaign of my two grandparents.”

As to Colleen Nunn: She is a one-time C.I.A. agent and Hawaii-based surfer who met her husband when they both worked at the United States Embassy in Paris in 1962.

She has been a frequent presence at campaign headquarters, and in an interview this year, she emerged as a fierce defender of her daughter – much more so than the mild-mannered Mr. Nunn. When a reporter mentioned that her daughter’s campaign had begun with a “rocky rollout,” Mrs. Nunn cut off the question: “I never heard that,” she said sharply. “What was the rocky rollout?”

A South Dakotan’s Senate Run, on a Shoestring Budget

He is suddenly one of the central figures in the fierce battle for control of the Senate.

Yet former Senator Larry Pressler is running a rather homespun campaign for his old South Dakota seat. He has little money and one paid employee. His wife, Harriet, is his driver and he posts his own news releases to his website.

The never-shy 72-year-old, who was defeated in 1996, is competing in what has become a fascinating four-way race. Polls show the long-presumed victor, Gov. Mike Rounds, a Republican, could be defeated, maybe even by Mr. Pressler, because of a state administration scandal. Democrats this week announced they would pour $1 million into the race, in a bank-shot bid to grab the seat and hold on to the majority.

Mr. Pressler, who has taught college since leaving the Senate, said he couldn’t very well urge his students to be active in public life if he stood by with Washington in disarray.

“I didn’t like the direction the country is going, in certain areas, so I decided to get off my behind and do something about it,” said Mr. Pressler, who is running as an independent though he served in Congress as a Republican.

Mr. Pressler, who runs five miles almost daily, has been traveling around the state, after loaning his campaign $100,000 and spending another $100,000 of his savings.

“I get more applause than anyone in the parades,” reported Mr. Pressler said proudly.

He noted that his wife isn’t keen on moving back to the District of Columbia, where the always optimistic Mr. Pressler once weighed a bid for mayor.

“I am going to be a happy man on Nov. 5 no matter the outcome,” he said, adding: “There are plenty of things to do in Sioux Falls.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Children’s advocates share Nobel Peace Prize.

Malala Yousafzai, 17, a campaigner for girls’ right to education, is the youngest winner[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/world/europe/kailash-satyarthi-and-malala-yousafzai-are-awarded-nobel-peace-prize.html] of the prize. She survived a shooting by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan two years ago.

Kailash Satyarthi of India also won, for leading peaceful demonstrations focusing on the exploitation of children for financial gain.

• Ebola’s reach.

Seven more people in Spain are being monitored for the virus, including two hairdressers who came into contact with a nurse, whose condition appears[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/10/world/europe/ap-eu-spain-ebola.html] to have stabilized after a downturn. [Those seven cases have not been confirmed, as we said early this morning.]

In the U.S., the House Homeland Security Committee holds a field hearing[http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-hold-dallas-hearing-government-coordination-combat-ebola-0] in Dallas today. It will focus on coordinating a response at the global, national, state and local levels.

• Sick day?

The North Korean leader didn’t appear in public today, a major national holiday, and his absence is fueling speculation[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/world/asia/in-north-korean-media-no-sign-of-kim-jong-un-at-key-ritual.html] about his condition and his grip on power.

• Voter ID laws blocked.

The Supreme Courtstopped[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-wisconsin-voter-id-law.html] the Wisconsin requirement late Thursday, and a federal trial court in Texas ruled against the law there.

Voters there will not have to provide photo identification before casting their ballots in the coming election.

• Clashes in St. Louis.

A peaceful protest turned chaotic[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/us/st-louis-police-shooting-protests.html] Thursday night as police officers in riot gear rushed into a crowd at the scene of Wednesday’s shooting, in which a black man was killed by an off-duty white police officer.

The trouble comes ahead of a planned “weekend of resistance” by residents of nearby Ferguson, Mo.

• New abortion and guns laws.

Also in Missouri, one of the nation’s most stringent abortion regulations goes into effect[http://www.missourinet.com/2014/10/08/missouris-72-hour-abortion-wait-already-having-impact/] today. It will require a 72-hour waiting period without any exceptions.

A gun rule[http://www.kfvs12.com/story/26751335/new-missouri-gun-laws-take-effect-friday] will allow for specially trained school employees to carry concealed guns on campuses.

• A new national monument.

This afternoon, President Obama, in San Dimas, Calif., will designate [http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-san-gabriels-monument-20141009-story.html]about half of the Angeles National Forest — around 350,000 acres — as the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in California.

Tonight, he attends a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser in San Francisco.

• Anti-E.U. victory in Britain.

The anti-European Union and anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party won a seat in the British Parliament[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/europe/uk-independence-party-british-parliament.html] for the first time and came close to securing a second, according to results announced today.

• Fighting over peace in the air.

Lawyers for the flight attendants’ union today argue before a federal appeals court that the government did not follow the law when they cleared passengers to use electronic devices[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/10/us/politics/ap-us-cellphones-planes.html] during takeoffs and landings.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are mixed after a 2 percent sell-off on Thursday. European shares lost more than 1 percent today, and Asian indexes sank about 2 percent.

• The energy sector was hit the hardest in Thursday’s tumble[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/sluggish-global-outlook-ripples-in-markets/] as the price of crude oil fell 1.5 percent to about $86 a barrel. It is down another 2 percent today.

• Amazon may or may not be opening a physical retail store in Manhattan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/business/amazon-shops-for-real-estate-in-new-york-city.html] — it won’t say. The online retailer is taking over an entire building on 34th Street across from the Empire State Building[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/empire_state_building/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

• Microsoft’s chief executive retracted his statement that women shouldn’t ask for raises[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/microsofts-nadella-backtracks-from-comment-about-women/] because they will get “good karma” instead.

• Tesla announced an all-wheel-drive[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-10/tesla-s-musk-unveils-all-wheel-drive-version-of-model-s-sedan.html]electric car[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/electric_vehicles/index.html?&inline=nyt-classifier] with two motors and extra safety and self-driving features.

NOTEWORTHY

• A reluctant journey home.

In “The Judge,” opening today, Robert Downey Jr. plays a hotshot Chicago lawyer who returns home, reuniting with family and old friends and becoming entangled in their drama.

A. O. Scott, our film critic, writes that the film[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/movies/the-judge-stars-robert-downey-jr-and-robert-duvall.html?ref=movies] adds up to “a sprawl of narrative that is as unconvincing as the suspiciously sprawl-free, nostalgia-tinged town where it all takes place.”

More than two dozen other movies open today[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/intheaters.html].

• Popular reads.

“Gone Girl,” the top film at the box office, has propelled the novel on which it is based to No. 1 on The New York Times’s fiction list. Check out all our best-seller lists[http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html].

• The chance to advance.

It’s Game 1 of the best-of-seven American League Championship Series[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/sports/baseball/alcs-preview-kansas-city-royals-vs-baltimore-orioles.html], between the Kansas City Royals and the Baltimore Orioles, and the winner goes to the World Series (8 p.m. Eastern, TBS)

• A fond farewell.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former White House press secretaries and journalists gather for a memorial service for James S. Brady, who died[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/politics/james-s-brady-symbol-of-fight-for-gun-control-dies-at-73.html] Aug. 4.

Mr. Brady, Ronald Reagan’s first spokesman, was partly paralyzed during the 1981 assassination attempt on the president and became a vocal advocate for gun control laws.

• Blast from the past.

The National Archives releases nearly 10,000 pages of records[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/10/us/politics/ap-us-clinton-documents.html] today from President Bill Clinton’s administration.

The topics include many of the controversies of the 1990s, including Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater, Vince Foster and the pardon of Marc Rich.

BACK STORY

It was created by Alfred Nobel to honor those who have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations.”

But some question whether the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize[http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/about_peaceprize/establishment/] have always lived up to such a lofty mantle.

Critics of President Obama say he didn’t deserve the 2009 award, and some have demanded that he give it back[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/06/dear-obama-it-s-time-to-return-your-nobel-peace-prize-here-s-why.html], citing drone attacks[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/unmanned_aerial_vehicles/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and other military actions.

Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, remains one of the most contested[http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2096389_2096388_2096386,00.html] laureates. In 1973, the year he won, two members of the prize committee quit in protest[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/kissinger-facts.html] over his central role in the Vietnam War.

Similar outrage followed the 1994 selection of the Palestinian[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] leader Yasir Arafat, chosen along with his Israeli counterparts after the Oslo Accords.

But the prize itself is an expression of conflict. Its creator bankrolled it from the fortune[http://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/] he made — worth about $265 million today — as a manufacturer of arms and the inventor of dynamite.

With Ebola’s Arrival at Nebraska Center, It’s No Longer a Drill

Correction Appended

OMAHA — There have been times when Dr. Philip Smith felt pressed to justify the existence of the biocontainment unit he opened almost a decade ago in an empty wing of Nebraska Medical Center. After all, the unit’s 10 beds sat empty for years, its team of specially trained doctors and nurses leaping into action only for periodic drills.

But with the arrival of two Ebola patients in the last six weeks, any doubts about the unit’s worth have vanished. Not only is it playing a central role in treating Americans returning from West Africa with the lethal disease, but Dr. Smith, the unit’s medical director, and his team members are fielding dozens of calls daily from anxious health care workers around the country who are suddenly eager to tap their knowledge about handling dangerously contagious patients.

“Everyone, everywhere, is thinking, ‘Are we really ready and what do we need to do?’ ” Dr. Angela Hewlett, the unit’s associate medical director, said. “We’ve been doing our best to respond to them as quickly as we can.”

The Nebraska Biocontainment Patient Care Unit, conceived of soon after the Sept. 11 attacks as a bulwark against bioterrorism, is now at the forefront of the nation’s response to Ebola. Should there be an actual American outbreak, the center is the largest of four units around the country that have been specially equipped to respond, and the only one designated for the general public. The others are at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Mont.

The unit here is now treating its second patient: Ashoka Mukpo, 33, an American freelance journalist[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/ashoka-mukpo-nbc-cameraman-with-ebola-to-return-to-us.html] who was airlifted from Liberia to Omaha, arriving Monday. He tested positive for Ebola last week and is receiving an experimental drug, brincidofovir, in the form of a twice-weekly pill. On Wednesday, he got a transfusion of blood plasma from Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary who was treated at Emory and recovered from the disease[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/two-us-ebola-patients-are-released-by-atlanta-hospital.html]. The unit’s first patient was Dr. Rick Sacra, another American missionary who contracted the virus in Liberia and spent three weeks here in September before being released, apparently recovered[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/us/aid-worker-recovering-from-ebola.html].

“There are certainly aspects of it that are stressful,” said Dr. Christopher Kratochvil, the associate vice chancellor for clinical research at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the hospital’s academic partner. “But this is exactly what we’ve been training to do, and a role the unit was intended to serve.”

Dr. Smith, an infectious disease specialist, opened the unit in 2005 with funds that Congress was granting to states for disaster preparedness. It cost $1 million to retrofit a former pediatric transplant ward on the hospital’s seventh floor, creating isolation rooms with concrete-block walls, tornado-proof windows and video links to the unit’s nursing station.

The unit is equipped to treat more than a dozen highly infectious diseases, including SARS, plague, monkeypox and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It has a steam sterilizer, known as an autoclave, for linens, scrubs and equipment, and a special air-handling system to keep germs from spreading beyond the patient rooms.

“At the time we were worried about smallpox,” said Dr. Harold M. Maurer, the former chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. “Then nothing happened. Some of the faculty called it Maurer’s Folly.”

Everything changed on Sept. 2, when the State Department called Dr. Smith and asked if the unit could treat Dr. Sacra. Three days later, Dr. Sacra arrived in Omaha, where he was brought to the hospital in an ambulance escorted by 14 police motorcycles and seven police cruisers. He received an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola and two blood transfusions from Dr. Brantly, as well as intravenous fluids and supplements to prevent electrolyte imbalance.

Ten days after Dr. Sacra left, the unit received Mr. Mukpo, who traveled from the Omaha airport with a somewhat smaller police detail. “We didn’t want to be caught unprepared,” Dr. Smith said, “so we overdid it the first time.”

Nurses on the biocontainment team have been working 12-hour shifts in the unit; they take turns spending four straight hours in Mr. Mukpo’s room in full protective gear, including full face shields and three pairs of surgical gloves duct-taped to water-resistant surgical gowns. A police officer guards the entrance to the unit around the clock, and team members who work in the “dirty” section shower before leaving.

The hours pass quietly for now. Mr. Mukpo has felt ill, with vomiting and diarrhea, and has generally not wanted to talk, Dr. Hewlett said. The nurses take his vital signs once an hour, monitor his intravenous fluids and draw blood once a day from a central line so they can avoid using needles. They are also responsible for changing his sheets and cleaning his bathroom, since the cleaning staff is not allowed in the unit.

“These are very positive and upbeat and can-do kind of people that we’ve hired,” said Shelly Schwedhelm, the unit’s nursing director. “We feel very confident in our supplies, in our protocols and in each other.”

The team also includes respiratory therapists, in case a patient needs a ventilator or expert monitoring of their breathing, nursing technicians who run the autoclave and help doctors and nurses don and doff protective gear, and doctors specializing in critical care and infectious disease. They get a small amount of bonus pay when the unit is activated, Dr. Hewlett said, but no other incentives.

Dr. Hewlett said it was crucial to have willing volunteers to staff such units, and to carefully screen applicants. “We don’t want to compel people to do this type of work,” she said.

In recruiting members, the team looks for people who are “meticulous and calm,” Dr. Smith said, adding, “We don’t want any hotheads.”

Dr. Smith and Dr. Hewlett have been on frequent conference calls with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and other clinicians who have treated Ebola patients outside Africa.

“Everybody’s feeling a different part of the elephant and we’re all sharing information,” Dr. Smith said. “We’re still learning the ropes.”

The unit tweaked a few of its procedures after Dr. Sacra was discharged, including adding an in-house laboratory for routine blood tests. The unit also sends daily blood samples to the C.D.C., which measures the patients’ level of Ebola virus. Neither of its patients has been violently sick so far, but in that case, health care providers spending time in their rooms would wear Tyvek protective suits instead of gowns.

In the event of an outbreak, Dr. Smith said the unit would not be able to expand beyond its current 10 beds. So much infectious waste is produced, he said, and the disease is so hazardous, that “we’re more comfortable taking care of one or two.”

Dr. Smith said he agreed with the C.D.C.'s recent statement that any hospital that can isolate a patient can treat Ebola, although he added that proper training of nurses would take time.

“You don’t need to have all the fancy things we have,” he said.

The soft-spoken Dr. Smith described the last six weeks as “exciting, gratifying, rewarding, exhausting, frightening.” He left an interview in a hospital atrium early to return to the unit.

Dr. Hewlett, who came to Omaha in 2009, spoke of the strangeness of interacting with patients through cumbersome protective gear that covered everything but her eyes. The nurses and doctors who treated Dr. Sacra still managed to bond with him, she said, even using their triple-gloved hands to play chess with him.

“He was actually able to memorize people by their eyes,” she said. “We all felt very connected to him.”

Correction: October 13, 2014, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the biocontainment unit at the Nebraska Medical Center, which is treating Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance journalist who contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia, misstated the dosage of the experimental drug brincidofovir that he is receiving. It is twice weekly, not weekly.

We recently introduced a new feature[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/], NYTLNreads, and are inviting students everywhere to participate by simply telling us[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/] what you’ve been reading in The Times recently, and why you think others would like it.

Below, the students of Samara Skolnik, who teaches ninth grade English at Garden City High School[http://www.gardencity.k12.ny.us/Domain/8] in Garden City, N.Y., suggest five recent articles on topics from space exploration to football to Ebola.

Times Recommendations From Students

Ian on Oleg Ivanovsky, Soviets’ Space-Age Designer, Dies at 92[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/europe/oleg-ivanovsky-soviets-space-age-designer-dies-at-92-.html]

This article is about the death of one of the Soviet Union’s greatest space scientists. Oleg Ivanovsky helped launch both the first man-made object and the first human into space. Although this man was an arch-nemesis of the United States during the Cold War, he is a hero to many young scientists around the world.

This article appeals to my love of space and science. Mr. Ivanovsky was a brilliant scientist who helped to make history, and he is an inspiration to many young Russian scientists. His story can help young people realize that space — the moon, Mars and beyond — is the final frontier and we aren’t far from having the technology to take it on.

Matthew on College Players Often Don’t Tell of Hits to Head, Studies Find[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/sports/ncaafootball/offensive-linemen-are-least-likely-to-report-concussions-studies-find.html]

This article exemplifies the violent nature of football. Many college football players are failing to report injuries sustained to the head due to the belief that either the coaches or their teammates will think less of them.

If someone plays football they are often perceived as tough and feel they should play through injuries. They don’t want to sit out, but sometimes they will think they can play through an injury because they do not always understand how dangerous it can be.

It is extremely important for football players to read this article. If they are not educated on the topic of head trauma they might make the same mistakes countless others have made before them. If a football player did not understand the severity of head trauma and tried to play through, he could end up regretting that decision for the rest of his life.

Valerie on A Smuggled Girl’s Odyssey of False Promises and Fear[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/world/americas/a-smuggled-girls-odyssey-guatemala-migration-abduction.html]

This article is about a 16-year-old Guatemalan girl named Cecilia. Now living in Miami, Cecilia is one of 50,000 unaccompanied minors who has come to the United States illegally from Central America.

I’d recommend this article because people should know how hard life can be for other families around the world. This young girl and her family have to deal with troubles like debts and smugglers most of us can’t imagine. The family is only trying to find peace by coming to America, even if they came over illegally.

Calum on An Imported Soda That Comes With Buzz[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/fashion/mexican-coca-cola-a-cult-classic.html]

The article was about how Coca-Cola imported from Mexico is being made with real sugar cane rather than the normal corn syrup, making it a more expensive drink, but higher quality.

In my marketing and advertising class we have been discussing how there has been a drop in soft drink sales and an increase in sport and energy drink sales, so it is interesting to see how soft drink companies are trying to increase sales. Also, many people get upset about “chemicals” being in their foods instead of natural flavors and natural preservatives. It is important for people to read this article and to think about what they find more important — something that is high quality or something that is cheaper.

Alexa on A Hospital from Hell, in a City Swamped by Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-spreading-in-west-africa.html]

The article is about a hospital in Sierra Leone that is having a hard time taking care of its many desperate Ebola patients. Though other nations are helping, Sierra Leone doesn’t have enough resources or money to produce vaccinations for their patients.

I think it is very important for other people to read this article to spread awareness of Ebola. The more people who read about the problems that are occurring in Sierra Leone, the more help the patients will receive in terms of medicine and money. Also, the more help people can give to the affected areas of Africa, the greater the chances are of stopping the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.

Samara Skolnik on How She Uses The Times in Her Teaching

The students in my classes are encouraged to take an interest in current events and the issues of the day, and they are often asked to use The New York Times to do so since it provides fair, balanced reportage on timely and worthwhile subjects.

Throughout the year, I ask students to peruse The Times and choose articles that they find relevant to the literature we read and to make connections between the questions and ideas we encounter in fiction and the issues highlighted in those articles.

To prepare for this task, my ninth graders first must become comfortable with the newspaper, so on Oct. 6 we held class in the computer lab in the library, where students were introduced to the layout of the New York Times’s website, which every student could access since our school recently purchased the new K-12 subscription[http://nytimesineducation.com/schoolwide/?campaignId=47FX8]. They became familiar with the different sections — from Science to the Arts — and after taking time to simply read and share articles of interest, they were asked to write responses to those that they found most important.

The variety they chose was wide. In addition to the articles chosen above, students also responded to pieces about training dogs to detect cancer cells by scent[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/training-dogs-to-sniff-out-cancer/], efforts to contain Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] and the N.F.L.’s decision to test players for use of human growth hormone[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sports/football/nfl-to-begin-hgh-testing-on-monday.html].

To me, hearing students carry conversation out of the room with them after the bell rings is a sign that a lesson has gone well — and that is exactly what happened as students shut down their computers and packed up their books. Snatches of their discussions about immigration, scientists and Ebola floated back to me as they exited the room; clearly they found the newspaper engaging.

What would your class recommend? Tell us below, on Twitter with the hashtag #NYTLNreads[https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23NYTLNreads&src=typd], or via the form in our introductory post[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/].

How Should We React to the Ebola Epidemic?

Three countries in West Africa — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — are roiling from a devastating Ebola epidemic. Experts say that the virus is unlikely to spread in countries with advanced health care networks like the United States. Yet authorities are still taking precautions such as hospital trainings, airport screenings and a protocol for quarantining anyone who might be exposed to the virus.

How should we react to the Ebola epidemic?

In the Opinion piece “In the Face of Ebola, Stay Calm,” [http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/in-the-face-of-ebola-stay-calm/] Anna Altman writes:

Back in August, at least six months into the largest outbreak of Ebola on record, Dr. Facely Diawara, who heads the Red Cross Society effort to control and treat the disease in Guinea, told the Christian Science Monitor, “Panic is our worst enemy.”

Dr. Diawara’s words came less than three weeks before a lockdown in Monrovia, Liberia, ignited panic and violence. West Point, a particularly hard-struck neighborhood there, was cordoned off with barbed wire. Several young men tried to storm the barriers and were met with live fire. Shakie Kamara, a boy of 15, was shot in the legs. Because of fear that the boy might be infected with Ebola and that his blood might transmit infection, bystanders did nothing to help him. Mr. Kamara died of blood and fluid loss several hours later. This, you might say, is what hysteria has wrought.

A man in Dallas was recently found to have Ebola, and authorities have sought to isolate as many as 100 people that may have had contact with him. To be sure, there is a lot that needs to be done to stem the spread of the disease — government oversight, preparing health workers, educating the public about symptoms and keeping isolated those who are potentially sick — but there is also the question of whether, and how much, hysteria and panic will hinder, or help, these efforts.

Students: Read the entire article, then tell us …

— How should we react to the Ebola epidemic? What have been your personal reactions to news about the virus?

— Do you think our primary concern should be assisting the three West African nations who are currently battling the epidemic? Is the world doing enough to help [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/health/how-to-help-in-efforts-to-stem-ebolas-tide.html]? Why?

— Do you think authorities are taking the right precautions to prevent Ebola from spreading in the U.S.? For example, should we prioritize airport fever screening [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/newly-vigilant-us-is-to-screen-fliers-for-ebola.html] or step up hospital preparations [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/nyregion/new-york-city-steps-up-preparations-to-be-ready-for-ebola-cases.html]?

— Are you hopeful that the world will find a vaccine or a cure to stop the spread of Ebola? Or, that researchers will find an effective treatment to the virus?

— Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, stated [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/newly-vigilant-us-is-to-screen-fliers-for-ebola.html] that the U.S. has “a much larger outbreak of anxiety than we have of Ebola.” Do you feel anxious? Have you noticed any signs of anxiety about Ebola in your community? How can anxiety in this situation be helpful? How can it be harmful?

Assurances Are Given and a Deputy Goes Home, but Ebola Fears Persist

DALLAS -- So far, there is no evidence the Ebola virus has spread in this vast metropolitan area of 6.5 million people. But fear has.

Officials on Thursday announced that a local sheriff's deputy examined for possible infection with the virus had tested negative and was sent home from the hospital.

None of the other 48 people who officials say had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died of Ebola at a hospital here Wednesday, have showed symptoms of infection. Because no one has been exposed in 11 days, officials say, the likelihood of a new case is diminishing.

But live images on local television of an ambulance racing the deputy to the hospital on Wednesday were enough to convince many here that Ebola was more dangerous than officials were letting on.

The deputy, Sgt. Michael Monnig of the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, had briefly been in the apartment where Mr. Duncan had fallen ill. News that he was hospitalized suggested Ebola could spread without direct contact.

Fearing infection, dozens of parents kept their children home. At Armstrong Elementary School in the affluent Highland Park neighborhood, 91 students -- one sixth of the school's total -- were absent Thursday after rumors spread among parents.

''People were calling last night warning we should stay home, saying all kinds of stuff on Facebook,'' said Matt Robinson, holding the hand of his second-grade daughter in front of the school Thursday afternoon. ''A lot of people bought into it, but I looked at the C.D.C. website and saw there was really no risk.''

Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the Ebola virus can spread only by direct contact with someone who is infected and showing symptoms or with their bodily fluids.

The school has been fielding concerns from parents all week, said its principal, Skip Moran, because the daughter of Clay Jenkins, Dallas County's highest elected official, is a student there. Mr. Jenkins had been in a room and a car with the fiancée of Mr. Duncan. The woman is now quarantined and considered to be at high risk for contracting the disease, but is not contagious because she does not have symptoms, officials say. Mr. Moran said he passed along to parents assurances from health officials that there was no risk, ''but once they saw the deputy might have caught Ebola, they weren't satisfied with our assurances anymore.''

Parents demanded action and pulled their children from school.

Christina Hoctor, picking up her daughter, said rumors were rampant on Facebook and she understood the concern.

''Honestly, it's the fear of the unknown,'' she said. ''And you worry what the kids think. I walked to school today ready to turn around. I didn't want to put my daughter in an empty classroom if there was no one here and have her be scared.''

Some people in the community have been shunned for their ties to Ebola. Erick McCallum, who owns the company that sterilized the apartment where Mr. Duncan became ill, said he lost a lot of business because of it. He said some of his employees, who also work as local firefighters, have been told not to come to work at the fire station for a few weeks.

''It's not rational, it's just a lack of knowledge,'' he said. The director of the C.D.C., Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, became frustrated upon hearing that parents were keeping their children out of school.

''Oh, my goodness,'' he said in a telephone interview, taking a long sigh. ''I sat on the couch of a survivor in Africa holding her hand. Her little child was bouncing off the walls because the neighbors would not allow her to go outside and play with the other children.'' He said he expected that type of reaction among uneducated people in developing countries, but not in the United States, adding, ''I'm saddened.''

Dallas may now be able to breathe a small sigh of relief because the latest developments concerning Ebola are generally positive. The 48 people being checked daily for signs of the virus have now gone 11 days without symptoms. Data on past cases released by the C.D.C. show that only about 7 percent of Ebola cases show up more than 11 days after exposure. Anyone with no symptoms after 21 days is considered Ebola-free.

But Prof. Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch who studies the disease, cautioned that onset might be slower in the United States. ''How you are exposed and the amount of virus you are exposed to makes a big difference,'' he said.

An injection to the bloodstream, Professor Geisbert said, can produce symptoms in a few days. Infection through a finger to the eye or mouth, for example, takes longer to build up and spread in the body, so symptoms might not show for two weeks or more.

''I definitely wouldn't say they are out of the woods yet,'' he said.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday released more details on Mr. Duncan, who died there and was cremated Wednesday, according to George Mason, a pastor who had spoken to his family.

Mr. Duncan spent 10 days at the hospital, having returned after being given antibiotics and sent home. In the hospital a team of more than 50 people cared for him in a 24-bed intensive care unit that had been cordoned off and is still sealed so that it can be ''aggressively decontaminated,'' according to a hospital statement.

The hospital also rebutted criticism that it had wrongly turned Mr. Duncan away when he first came there.

U.S.
Dallas Sheriff’s Official Tests Negative for Ebola

DALLAS — A sheriff’s sergeant who was hospitalized here out of concern that he might have been exposed to the Ebola virus has not been infected, a Texas health agency said Thursday.

The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement that the test on the sergeant, Michael W. Monnig, had come back negative for the virus.

Sergeant Monnig was taken to the hospital Wednesday after going to an urgent-care center outside Dallas with stomach pain. He told health care workers there that he had been in the apartment where Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian man who died of Ebola on Wednesday, had been staying.

None of the 48 other people who are being monitored for the disease after having had some contact with Mr. Duncan has shown any sign of the disease, officials said.

Also Thursday, Britain announced that it planned to follow the lead of the United States and introduce measures at airports and at an international rail terminal to screen passengers from countries affected by the Ebola virus.

“Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals,” Prime Minister David Cameron’s office said in a statement, referring to London’s international rail link with continental Europe.

The United States on Wednesday said it would begin requiring temperature checks at five major American airports for people arriving from the three West African countries hardest hit by the deadly Ebola virus — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The measures will go into effect on Saturday at Kennedy International Airport in New York, which receives about 43 percent of the people who fly to the United States from the three nations.

Screenings will begin next week at Washington Dulles International, which gets 22 percent of such travelers, and at Newark Liberty International, O’Hare International in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta.

After a passport check, airport workers will lead travelers to a special area and point a thermometer at their foreheads. The workers will also ask questions. Travelers with a fever will be taken to a quarantine area in the airports and be evaluated by an official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It will be up to local health departments whether to place them in quarantine.

The death of Mr. Duncan, 42, at the center of a widening public health concern, renewed questions about whether a delay in receiving treatment could have played a role in his death. Mr. Duncan went to a hospital’s emergency room on Sept. 25, but was not admitted. He returned three days later after his condition worsened.

“I trust a thorough examination will take place regarding all aspects of his care,” Louise Troh, Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, said in a statement Wednesday.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said Wednesday that officials there were considering investigating the delay in treating Mr. Duncan for Ebola, including the hospital’s compliance with state health and safety laws and regulations. But she added that the agency’s “top focus right now is the contact investigation and monitoring.”

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., told reporters Wednesday that although Ebola is fatal in a high proportion of patients, it is important for the disease to be diagnosed early.

“The earlier someone is diagnosed, the more likely they will be to survive,” Dr. Frieden said.

He declined to speculate on whether the delay had contributed to Mr. Duncan’s death. But agency officials have said generally that basic interventions — including intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and maintaining blood pressure — can significantly improve Ebola patients’ chances of survival.

The Latest on Ebola and Travel

The international response to the West African Ebola outbreak has affected travel by air, rail and cruise ship. And the news that a nurse who had cared for the first person in this country who died from the virus flew commercially from Cleveland to Dallas after exposure has stoked fears of further spread here. Here is a guide to what has changed, and what, if any, risk there is of transmission on public transportation.

How are air travelers being screened in the United States?

Enhanced screening measures [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/us-to-begin-ebola-screenings-at-5-airports.html?emc=edit_na_20141008&nlid=57704672] are being rolled out at five major hubs for passengers traveling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, federal officials said, including temperature checks and detailed questioning on arrival.

The screenings started over the weekend at Kennedy International in New York [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/nyregion/in-us-screening-for-ebola-jfk-is-on-front-lines.html] and will start this week week at Washington Dulles International, O’Hare International, Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International. Passengers will also undergo detailed questioning upon their arrival.

Passengers at other points of entry will continue to be screened by customs agents, who examine travelers for visible signs of illness and distribute fact sheets to those who have traveled in West African nations affected by the outbreak. In addition, the T.S.A. is providing guidance to airlines on how to identify passengers who are ill.

Travel within the United States is restricted only for those undergoing monitoring for exposure to the virus, the C.D.C. said on Wednesday. Those who have a certain level of contact must adhere to “controlled movement,” which requires that people do not travel by commercial plane, long-distance bus or train, and that they advise a public health authority of any travel plans. The nurse who treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian who died of the illness in Texas, violated the requirement by taking a commercial flight, the agency said. The agency said that in the future, it would enforce the restriction in coordination with state and local authorities.

Are passengers being screened elsewhere?

Britain has begun screenings at Heathrow airport in London [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/europe/britain-to-screen-for-ebola-amid-possible-new-cases-in-europe-.html] and plans to also do so at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals. Those screenings, too, apply to passengers who have traveled in countries affected by the virus.

Screenings are also taking place at Canadian airports and at Cairo as people return from Hajj.

France has also announced that it would screen air passengers arriving from the hardest hit countries but has not outlined its specific plans, and the E.U. is considering screenings as well.

The broader E.U. has no screening measures in place. Dr. Denis Coulombier, head of surveillance and response at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, said last week that in the wake of the death of Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian Ebola patient who died of the illness in Texas on Oct. 8, the agency — which coordinates the work of health agencies of the European Union’s 28 member states — was studying the possibility of screening those arriving in Europe from Ebola-affected countries.

People departing the West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak are screened before they fly [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/06/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa]. They must fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a visual assessment and a temperature check by a non-contact thermometer.

The efficacy of that system has been questioned, however, because Liberian officials say that Mr. Duncan slipped through the screening process in Monrovia after lying on his questionnaire [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/africa/dallas-ebola-patient-thomas-duncan-airport-screening.html], claiming that he had not been in contact with anybody sickened by Ebola when in fact he had helped transport an infected pregnant woman to a hospital and back [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?ref=africa]. Mr. Duncan had managed to take three flights to his destination in the United States.

Are there plans for a travel ban from West Africa?

A few officials have suggested banning [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/bobby_jindal_calls_for_restric.html]flights to and from affected countries [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/bobby_jindal_calls_for_restric.html], but the Obama administration has so far dismissed the idea, saying that a ban could slow the flow of aid to those countries. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said [http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/media/releases/2014/t1004-ebola-confirmed-case.html] that restricting travel to affected nations could drive traffic into other parts of Africa, making it even harder to contain and eliminate the virus. Several cruise lines have voluntarily altered their routes [http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/cruise-lines-to-avoid-west-african-coast/?ref=travel] to avoid the West African coast.

Are carriers still operating flights to affected nations?

Some international airlines, including British Airways and Kenya Airways, have suspended flights since August. But others, including Royal Air Maroc and Brussels Airlines, have regularly scheduled departures to destinations in West Africa. Keep in mind that the C.D.C. has advised avoiding nonessential travel [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/ebola] to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

What are air carriers doing?

Airlines have not made any broad shifts to deal with Ebola, according to representatives from several carriers. They follow general guidelines issued by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread.

Could you get Ebola by sharing a flight with someone who is infected?

It’s possible but not likely. The disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/understanding-the-risks-of-ebola-and-what-direct-contact-means.html] — blood, vomit, urine, diarrhea — of a contagious person, and those people are unlikely to feel well enough to fly. In one case a passenger traveling from Liberia to Nigeria —who is thought to have spread the illness to that country —was vomiting and had diarrhea during his flight but no passengers were infected.

Manager-in-Chief
The Upshot
Why 2016 May Be Mitt Romney’s Year

One of the main problems with Mitt Romney[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/r/mitt_romney/background/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s presidential candidacy was that it was never clear what he wanted to do if elected.

Mr. Romney’s case for himself was heavily bound up in his careers in consulting and private equity. He was the skilled manager who could identify problems, root out dysfunction and make anything work better. The guy who rescued the Olympics. The guy who led the search[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/pressed-for-anecdote-romney-recounts-tale-of-missing-girl/] for his co-worker’s missing daughter. The Romney pitch was, in large part, about being manager-in-chief. It was a pitch with little policy content.

That didn’t fly in 2012. But it might actually work pretty well in 2016.

The 2012 election had to be about the big “what is government for?” questions because huge policy decisions loomed in 2013. The Affordable Care Act would be implemented, or not; parts of the Bush tax cuts[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/taxation/bush_tax_cuts/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] would expire, or not; entitlements would be greatly reformed in an effort to shrink deficits, or not. A large fiscal adjustment was needed, if not right away, sometime within the next few years.

Whichever candidate won was going to have a lot of power to determine the shape of the federal government for years to come, so he had to talk about what he would have the government do.

Barack Obama defended the principle that government ought to take a strong and active role in the economy, by using fiscal policy to offset the effects of recessions, by regulating the financial sector more tightly, by offering a near-universal health care entitlement, and by taxing the rich more.

Mr. Romney proved an awkward messenger for Republicans’ big idea that the government should tax and spend less, and not discourage people from working and supporting themselves. The “47 percent[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-17/today-mitt-romney-lost-the-election.html]” speech — essentially, a declaration that we’d have to grow the economy by making Americans less lazy — was the clearest example of Mr. Romney offering a big-picture vision that did not sell.

That failure sounds like a good reason for Mr. Romney not to run again. But in 2016, he might actually be able to bracket the big ideological questions and run on the small stuff.

The big questions from 2012 mostly got resolved in 2013. Tax rates went up, the spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect, and the Affordable Care Act is proceeding. The federal budget[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] deficit has fallen below $500 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_debt_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] will be stable as a share of the economy over the next decade. As a result, Congress will probably leave the federal budget more or less on autopilot for the next several years.

The health act has already been de-emphasized[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/30/repeal-obamacare-not-on-the-2014-campaign-trail/] in 2014 midterm campaigns, in part because the existence of popular provisions in the law makes it awkward for Republicans to demand repeal without specifying a clear replacement.

While “what will government do?” was very much an open question in 2012, greater policy certainty means there will be more room to run on “I’ll be a better manager” in 2016. That will be especially true if the news continues to be dominated by stories of managerial and technical failure in the government.

Healthcare.gov was plagued by “glitches.” The Secret Service let a man with an arrest record and a gun get in an elevator with the president, and a man with a knife get near the Obamas’ private residence. The Department of Veteran Affairs failed to provide timely medical care to sick veterans, then falsified records to hide that fact. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was overwhelmed by a surge of child migrants. The administration has faced criticism[http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/whos-actually-leading-the-us-response-to-the-ebola-epidemic#3ir2pq7] on coordinating response to Ebola in West Africa.

Even the big scandal obsessions of the conservative fever swamps — the Benghazi attack, the I.R.S. scandals and Fast & Furious — are, after you strip away the conspiracy theories, fundamentally stories about managerial failure. And while foreign policy debates obviously have huge ideological components, there’s a lot of room for dissatisfaction with this administration’s execution on its strategies in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Whether the increase in gaffes is real or just perceived, there have been a lot of news stories that might lead voters to say, “Gee, this looks like the sort of problem Mitt Romney might have handled better.”

Of course, to get to the point of making this case in a general election, Mr. Romney would first have to be renominated. The Republicans haven’t renominated a losing presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1968, but then, no losing Republican nominee has sought renomination during that time either.

In most of the last 50 years, there has been a clear heir apparent for the Republican nomination, whether a sitting vice president or a runner-up in a former primary campaign. The existence of a strong next-in-line candidate has been one reason not to try again. In this case, nobody is next in line. Especially if Jeb Bush does not run for the nomination, the Republican establishment figures who backed Mr. Romney in the last campaign will have no obvious place to go, putting him in an unusually good spot to seek renomination.

Candidates run all the time on airy ideas about leadership and competence, and win. Look at Rick Snyder’s election as governor of Michigan in 2010, or Mr. Romney’s own election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002. It’s standard to say Washington is “dysfunctional,” but that can mean several different things. If people mean the government has the wrong priorities, Mr. Romney has already shown his difficulty in convincing voters he has the right ones. But if people mean the government is not executing well on the priorities it has, Mr. Romney may find himself on favorable ground.

Ebola Shocks Europe

The infection of a nurse’s aide with the Ebola virus in Spain has shaken Europe. Several individuals infected with the virus in West Africa have now been sent for care to the United States and Europe, but this is the first time someone has contracted the virus outside West Africa.

The Ebola virus was not supposed to be able to spread in Europe, where people enjoy access to some of the best health care in the world. But Spain appears to have stumbled in caring for an Ebola patient repatriated from West Africa to the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid. These missteps must be carefully investigated and efforts redoubled to make sure established protocols are strictly respected.

In the Spanish case, there have been reports that the aide’s protective clothing was inadequate or that she inadvertently allowed a glove to touch her face. Other reports suggested poor communication between the health authorities, the hospital where she worked and the doctor who saw her at another hospital on Monday after she complained of fever.

MobsLab, which is based at Northeastern University in Boston, projected that there is a 50 percent chance the Ebola virus could reach Britain and a 75 percent chance it could reach France by the end of this month. Both countries are scrambling to make sure any cases are identified and contained immediately. In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron called a special meeting of his government’s emergency response committee to discuss Ebola. In France, cameras have been installed in special Ebola isolation wards to monitor staff movements and make sure there are no lapses.

The World Health Organization’s European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said on Wednesday that cases of Ebola in Europe are “quite unavoidable,” given the volume of travel between Europe and West Africa. But she also said that Europe was “still at low risk” and that Western Europe, in particular, is “the best prepared in the world” to deal with an outbreak of the virus. In Spain, the Ebola-infected nurse’s aide, her husband and four other individuals who have been identified as being at risk are now in quarantine and 80 people are being monitored. Hopefully, these measures will contain the deadly virus.

For Dallas Official, the Best Way to Fight Ebola Fears Is in Person

DALLAS — Shortly after he tried to reassure this city at a news conference that he did not expose himself to Ebola by coming into contact with the quarantined family of the nation’s first Ebola victim last week, County Judge Clay Jenkins had a smaller audience to convince.

His neighbors. And his wife.

Hours after driving the quarantined family from their potentially contaminated apartment to their new temporary home on Oct. 3, Mr. Jenkins, 50, pulled up at about 10 p.m. to the house in the upscale Highland Park area where he lives with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. His wife greeted him at the door of the vehicle. She learned that he had escorted the family by watching it live on television. Soon his neighbors across the street came by to express their own concerns.

“Everything is a learning curve,” Mr. Jenkins said. “Marriage is a learning curve. I learned quite a bit when I got home that night. My wife is at the door of that S.U.V. like J.J. Watt” — defensive end for the Houston Texans football team — “and she is explaining to me that this is a marriage and we communicate with each other.”

That night, Mr. Jenkins, a trial lawyer, appeared to have swayed the jury, since those close to him — including some of his neighbors, his wife and his 82-year-old mother — have become supportive of his contact with the quarantined family. Calming Dallas has proved more difficult.

No local, state or federal official involved in the Ebola emergency in Dallas, which had the first case of the disease diagnosed within the United States, has put himself farther on the front lines and done more to humanize and personalize the government response than Mr. Jenkins. Such a hands-on approach has raised his political profile as he runs for re-election in November and helped counter the widespread misinformation about how Ebola spreads. But his involvement has earned him both praise and criticism as fear of the disease continues to fester.

Mr. Jenkins, soft-spoken to the point of a kind of whisper-drawl, a religious man who often speaks of his faith and regularly attends Highland Park United Methodist Church, makes for a quiet but commanding presence at the Emergency Operations Center, the hub of the Ebola response, on the third floor of the Dallas County Records Building downtown.

“The goal that I’m tasked with is containing the Ebola virus and stopping it here, and we’re going to do that no matter what it takes,” said Mr. Jenkins, the county’s chief executive and its director of homeland security and emergency management. “But we can choose to do that by creating a police state and taking steps that are scary to people, or we can choose to see people as our fellow human beings and treat them with compassion and respect. We chose the latter course.”

But as the concerns of his wife and neighbors illustrated, Mr. Jenkins’s handling of the response has at times heightened rather than alleviated fears. On Thursday, the day after Mr. Jenkins and a Baptist pastor went to see the fiancée of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to receive an Ebola diagnosis in the United States, to deliver the news that Mr. Duncan had died[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html], nearly 100 children were absent from Armstrong Elementary School, where Mr. Jenkins’s daughter is in the third grade. The typical number absent is about 12. Mr. Jenkins’s wife, who volunteers at Armstrong at lunchtime, was initially told by some at the school that she should not serve food to the children.

Officials with the Highland Park Independent School District, which includes Armstrong, sent out an email to parents and employees assuring them there was no cause for concern. In an unusual move, two officials — Dr. David L. Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, and Dr. Inger Damon, who is managing the Ebola response for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html] — issued letters stating that Mr. Jenkins’s interaction with the family had put neither himself nor others at risk, letters that were made public in part to calm Armstrong parents.

“Ebola is only spread by direct contact with an individual who is symptomatic,” Dr. Lakey’s letter read. “To date, the family members have shown no symptoms of Ebola. For this reason, Judge Jenkins was not at risk and posed no risk to others through his interaction with the family.”

Even before this incident, Mr. Jenkins’s flair for the dramatic and his on-the-front-lines management style, which he calls being “a servant leader,” had drawn widespread attention and controversy both locally and far beyond.

Amid the recent surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America, Mr. Jenkins announced a plan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/us/towns-fight-to-avoid-taking-in-migrant-minors.html] for Dallas County to house 2,000 of the children. Thousands of emails and phone calls in support and opposition flooded county offices. The plan, announced by Mr. Jenkins at the Texas Democratic Party convention, led Mr. Jenkins to take part in a meeting with President Obama when he visited Dallas. When word spread that one of the neighborhoods was reluctant to host the children, Mr. Jenkins knocked on the doors of residents to tell them about the plan and ease their concerns. He received threats after the housing announcement, and as a result he asked that the names of his wife and child not be published.

In 2012, as Dallas dealt with a deadly outbreak of West Nile virus[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/us/west-nile-virus-hits-hard-in-dallas-area-and-is-seen-spreading.html], Mr. Jenkins rode in the trucks that were spraying chemicals and was such a hands-on presence that he accidentally got doused with them.

“I just look at this as a job,” he said. “My mother and father didn’t get the opportunity to go to college. But they worked hard every day of their lives. And this is my job, and I’m working hard at my job.”

His personal involvement in the Ebola response, though in line with his style, has even surprised those close to him.

Mr. Jenkins drove Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, Louise Troh, and three others from their contaminated apartment to their new temporary home in a county-owned Ford Explorer S.U.V. He did so without protective gear, wearing, as he pointed out to reporters, the same dress shirt to a news conference that he wore in the vehicle. He went inside their old apartment twice before it was cleaned and has seen Ms. Troh and those quarantined with her — Ms. Troh’s 13-year-old son, Mr. Duncan’s nephew and another young man — about five times since Mr. Duncan was found to have Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/airline-passenger-with-ebola-is-under-treatment-in-dallas.html] on Sept. 30. Each time Mr. Jenkins has not worn protective clothing.

“He’s really a very caring person, and what he’s doing with the Ebola situation shows how caring he is,” said Nelson W. Wolff, 73, a Democrat and a former mayor of San Antonio who has been the county judge in Bexar County since 2001. “He’s stepping up and going beyond what a normal person would do, which is terrific.”

Mr. Jenkins, who became county judge in January 2011, is a Democrat in a county that is, along with San Antonio’s Bexar County, one of the few Democratic strongholds in a state dominated by Republicans. Many of his Republican critics have largely kept silent in public, wary of appearing to attack Mr. Jenkins while the situation is still unfolding. But privately they call him a fool, showboat or opportunist who has used the Ebola emergency to further his political career. The conservative website Breitbart.comran a story[http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/10/3/Naive-Liberal-Texas-Judge-Enter-Ebola-Apartment-Without-Protection] with this headline: “Naïve Liberal Texas Judge Enters Ebola Apartment Without Protection.”

“While I applaud his personal involvement, I am a bit perplexed as to why any elected official would go into the Ebola patient’s home with no protective gear,” said Toby Marie Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. “I understand that he may have wanted to show he wasn’t afraid of catching Ebola. However, that is not what many people I know thought. Instead of alleviating public fears, he stoked the fires of panic and distrust.”

Mr. Jenkins denies that he has been politically focused during his handling of the response, and said he understood why people would be concerned about the risk of exposure. But there was zero risk, he added.

“There’s not any time for politics when it comes to public safety,” Mr. Jenkins said. “Right now, the science is very unclear to people and I’ve made a lot of people who have always supported me extremely upset in doing this, but I can’t control when things like this happen. We have a job to do here in Dallas County.”

U.S.
Dallas Ebola Patient’s Fever Was Flagged in First E.R. Visit, Records Show

DALLAS — The medical records of the Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan showed that his temperature spiked to 103 degrees during his initial visit to an emergency room — a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that was flagged with an exclamation point in the hospital’s record-keeping system.

Despite telling a nurse that he had recently been in Africa and displaying other symptoms that could indicate the Ebola virus, Mr. Duncan, the only person to die from the disease in the United States, underwent a battery of tests and was sent home.

Mr. Duncan’s family provided his medical records to The Associated Press — more than 1,400 pages in all. They encompass his time in the emergency room and his urgent return to the hospital, and chronicle his steep decline as his organs began to fail.

He carried the deadly virus[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/airline-passenger-with-ebola-is-under-treatment-in-dallas.html?_r=0] with him from his home in Liberia, though he showed no symptoms when he left for the United States.

Mr. Duncan landed in Dallas on Sept. 20, and went to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital feeling ill on Sept. 25.

At that time, Mr. Duncan complained of abdominal pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/abdominal-pain/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], dizziness[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/dizziness/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a headache[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/headache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and decreased urination, the records indicate. He reported severe pain, rating it an eight on a scale of 10. Doctors gave him CT scans to rule out appendicitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/appendicitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], stroke and numerous other serious ailments. Ultimately, he was prescribed antibiotics[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and told to take Tylenol, then returned to the apartment where he was staying with a Dallas woman and three other people, according to the records.

Despite his fever, a physician’s note dated Sept. 26 said Mr. Duncan was “negative for fever and chills.”

“I have given patient instructions regarding their diagnosis, expectations for the next couple of days, and specific return precautions,” according to the emergency room physician’s note. “The condition of the patient at this time is stable.”

After his condition worsened, someone in the apartment called 911, and paramedics took him back to the hospital on Sept. 28. He was admitted and swiftly put in isolation.

The documents also showed that a nurse recorded early in Mr. Duncan’s first hospital visit that he recently came to the United States from Africa, though he reported having no contact with anyone who was sick.

A hospital spokesman, Wendell Watson, did not immediately respond to phone, email and text messages left on Friday. A doctor who evaluated Mr. Duncan did not respond to a message left at his office.

Global Response to Ebola Highlights Challenges in Delivering Aid

GENEVA — In the cool of a Geneva garden, Eugenia Cuesta and other volunteers spent two days this week wrestling in and out of protective suits and goggles, rehearsing the procedures for treating victims of the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus. Next week, Ms. Cuesta, a 28-year-old Spanish nurse, will be putting those drills into practice at a treatment center in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], working in searing heat and humidity.

“It’s scary for sure,” Ms. Cuesta said of her mission to fight an epidemic that has killed more than 4,000 people, including 233 health care workers. “But to be scared a certain amount is useful. It can protect you.”

Two months after the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org]declared the outbreak a global emergency[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html], the deployment of Ms. Cuesta’s team is one part of a rapid scaling-up of the international response the United Nations fervently hopes will contain and ultimately defeat the epidemic.

And yet the reliance on volunteers like Ms. Cuesta shows that the international effort is “still moving in the wrong direction,” according to Brice de le Vingne, operations director for Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the biggest and most experienced of the organizations tackling the epidemic.

Mr. de le Vingne said the group had repeatedly asked countries to deploy military personnel, the quickest way to set up treatment centers, “but that’s not happening.” He said they preferred to leave the task to nongovernmental organizations “because they did not want to take the political responsibility.”

A senior European diplomat in Geneva involved in health issues, who was not authorized to speak publicly, lamented the limited international response. “The scale of the epidemic is what the international community is still not getting,” the diplomat said. “It’s becoming obvious that what you need is to scale up by a factor of 20. There’s not enough international coordination and imagination going into this.”

In Sierra Leone, which with Guinea and Liberia is bearing the brunt of the epidemic, Ms. Cuesta will join a treatment center that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies opened last month.

The unit is one of several initiatives aimed at bolstering Sierra Leone’s fight against the disease. Cuba sent 165 doctors and nurses last week, China has expanded a medical team deployed there, and British personnel are scouting sites for at least five new centers and 700 additional beds that will bring the total closer to the World Health Organization’s target of about 1,300 beds.

In neighboring Liberia, the capacity of treatment centers has nearly doubled to about 615 beds in the past two weeks, according to the latest W.H.O. update, on Wednesday. It is expected to jump again in the next month or so to around 2,500 or more beds as the United States delivers on a pledge to provide up to 17 100-bed units[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html], said Dr. Ian Norton, who is coordinating foreign medical teams for the W.H.O. In Guinea, the W.H.O. says there are four treatment centers working with 160 beds available, with 100 more beds needed.

The World Food Program, acting beyond its core mandate as the United Nations agency responsible for fighting hunger, is also joining the drive, planning to build up to 30 Ebola treatment centers capable of handling 3,000 patients, said Denise Brown, the agency’s regional director for West Africa.

Under targets set last month, the W.H.O. hopes that the campaign will enable 70 percent of Ebola victims to find care in these countries by the end of November, Mr. Norton said. At that level of treatment, health experts suggest, the rate of infection could be curbed and the caseload would start to decline. By the end of the year, the new strategy aims to have capital cities of the affected countries cleared of the disease and all burials conducted safely.

But those targets appear remote from the reality on the ground. The disease is “entrenched” in the capitals of the three countries, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the deputy head of the W.H.O., said at a meeting attended by the three countries’ presidents in Washington this week.

Medical organizations thought they had the Ebola outbreak in Guinea under control several months ago, said Mr. de le Vingne of Doctors Without Borders, but the United Nations now reports that the virus is taking off in new areas bordering Ivory Coast. Sierra Leone reports the same experience.

“There is no evidence that the epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control,” the W.H.O.'s latest bulletin concluded.

Moreover, treatment centers are useless without trained workers to manage and operate them, Mr. de le Vingne said.

American troops are already on the ground in Liberia to build treatment centers, and Britain announced on Wednesday that it would send about 600 military personnel to Sierra Leone to build units and train local staff members. But it remains unclear who will manage and operate the units.

As for Doctors Without Borders, it has increased its staffing in the three worst-hit countries to around 3,000 today from 600 at the beginning of August. That number includes about 280 international workers, and is now “absolutely at the limit of our capacity,” Mr. de le Vingne said.

The fear and stigma associated with the Ebola virus contributes to recruitment problems. After Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines at the end of 2013, the W.H.O. had the support of 151 aid agencies. Six months into the Ebola crisis in three countries, only four medical organizations are on the ground.

Ms. Cuesta, trained as an emergency response nurse, said she traveled to Haiti without a second thought to help fight the cholera outbreak that came after the 2010 earthquake. Yet her decision to volunteer in Sierra Leone took a month’s careful reflection and consultation with family and friends.

Finding staffing for the center where Ms. Cuesta will be working has been “a bit of a headache,” said Saaristo Panu,the Red Cross’s emergency health coordinator. The unit opened last month with only 10 beds and despite the demand for treatment has yet to work at full capacity.

Under these circumstances, the lack of an established evacuation procedure for medical workers is a particularly grievous omission, Mr. de le Vingne said. Medical evacuation should be possible in 24 hours, he said; last month, the evacuation of a French nurse who contracted the disease took 40 hours.

The European Union announced Thursday that it would provide $3.8 million to fund such an operation, but no European country has stepped forward to provide the aircraft, personnel or other resources needed to make it work, Mr. de le Vingne said.

“It still amazes me completely. It’s absolutely crazy,” he said. “What is missing is only political will.”

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Acknowledging a major “defeat” in the fight against Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], international health officials battling the epidemic in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] approved plans on Friday to help families treat patients at home, recognizing that they are overwhelmed and have little chance of getting enough treatment beds in place quickly to meet the surging need.

The decision signifies a significant shift in the struggle against the rampaging disease. Officials said they would begin distributing painkillers, rehydrating solution and gloves to hundreds of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-afflicted households in Sierra Leone, contending that the aid arriving here was not fast or extensive enough to keep up with an outbreak that doubles in size every month or so.

“It’s basically admitting defeat,” said Peter H. Kilmarx, the leader of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s team in Sierra Leone, adding that it was “now national policy that we should take care of these people at home.”

“For the clinicians it’s admitting failure, but we are responding to the need,” Dr. Kilmarx said. “There are hundreds of people with Ebola that we are not able to bring into a facility.”

The effort to prop up a family’s attempts to care for ailing relatives at home does not mean that officials have abandoned plans to increase the number of beds in hospitals and clinics. But before the beds can be added and doctors can be trained, experts warn, the epidemic will continue to grow.

C.D.C. officials acknowledged that the risks of dying from the disease and passing it to loved ones at home were serious under the new policy — “You push some Tylenol to them, and back away,” Mr. Kilmarx said, describing its obvious limits.

But many patients with Ebola are already dying slowly at home, untreated and with no place to go. So officials said there was little choice but to try the new approach as well.

“For the first time, the nation is accepting the possibility of home care, out of necessity,” said Jonathan Mermin, another C.D.C. official and physician here. “It is a policy out of necessity.”

The vote on the new policy came on a day when international officials announced that the death toll from the epidemic in West Africa had surpassed 4,000[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/136161/1/roadmapupdate10Oct14_eng.pdf?ua=1]. Faced with similar circumstances in neighboring Liberia, where even more people are dying from the disease, the American government said last month that it would ship 400,000 kits with gloves and disinfectant.

“The home kits are no substitute for getting people” to a treatment facility, said Sheldon Yett, the Unicef director for Liberia. “But the idea is to ensure that if somebody has to take care of somebody at home, they’re able to do so.”

About nine months after the Ebola outbreak was identified in West Africa, the United Nations funding appeal remains woefully short, with countries pledging only one-fourth of the $1 billion that the world body says it needs to contain Ebola, the United Nations deputy secretary general, Jan Eliasson, told a meeting of the General Assembly on Friday.

Britain has pledged to get an additional 400 beds into urban areas around Sierra Leone by sometime next month. More rudimentary holding centers for patients awaiting space in hospitals are planned by the government here. And promises of international aid have increased substantially since the outbreak was first identified in neighboring Guinea in March.

But on Friday, Sory Sesay, 2, lay face down on a bench at his home, an arm dangling, his eyes open, listless and apathetic.

What remained of his family was sitting immobilized on the front porch with him at their house in Waterloo, just outside Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital. All of them were sick: his father, who had already lost his wife and daughter; his 11 year-old brother; and a 16-year-old neighbor, whose mother had already died.

They had no painkillers, no rehydrating solution, and only a sack of rice, placed at the edge of the house by a local politician, to eat.

“The government has not yet come in to assist us,” said Sheka Dumbuya, the local community leader. “Mr. Sesay is actually traumatized. We took them the day before yesterday to the health center, but there is no space for them.”

In a sign of the difficulties confronting the growing epidemic here, Stephen Gaojia, the head of the government agency overseeing the Ebola response here, angrily denied that the policy to help ailing families at home had been adopted. C.D.C. officials said he left the meeting before the vote took place.

“We are not so desperate as to go to that level right now,” Mr. Gaojia said.

An official with the World Health Organization in Sierra Leone, Dr. Zabulon Yoti, said that the decision on Friday would help people with no other options."We support the families,” he said. “They should have some basic things as they are struggling” to take care of their families.

Down the hilly dirt road from Mr. Sesay’s house, at the local health center in Waterloo, people with Ebola-like symptoms drifted in to be registered, but most of them “sneak away and go home” because there are no services for them, said Alhassan Bangura, a health worker.

A holding center is being set up — the government is banking on them all over the country — but in some places these facilities are little more than death traps, offering scant treatment or hope[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-spreading-in-west-africa.html?_r=0] for the people inside.

Nobody knows exactly how many have died from Ebola in this country. The government figure of 900 to 1,000 is thought by international health officials to be a serious underestimation. Even some senior figures in the government have suggested it is untruthful, and the situation in holding centers and cemeteries suggests the government number is far from reality[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/africa/23ebola.html].

A man arrived at the Waterloo health center on Friday, clutching his seriously ill 4-year-old daughter. He had ridden from a town more than 100 miles away in a taxi shared with others — possibly exposing them to the virus — and he was already exhibiting Ebola symptoms. The girl, her eyes open, was rigid in his arms. She had high fever, diarrhea and had vomited — classic Ebola symptoms.

A nurse shouted angrily at the man from a few feet, away close enough to be infected: “Are you trying to spread the virus?”

He was too ill to respond.

On the porch of the center lay a corpse, a man dead shortly after arrival. Perpendicular to him lay a patient, still alive but rigid, motionless and prostrate. Inside the center, a few yards away and unprotected from them, dozens of patients had crowded in, seeking treatment for other illnesses.

In another section of Waterloo, farther out in the bush, burial team workers said they had collected 15 corpses in less than a week, and they carried away another on Friday, spraying it with chlorine as they left.

Aissata Kargbo sat at the edge of her bed in a darkened house off the dirt road, trembling and unable to speak. Her brother, trying to take care of her, said he had no medicine, that there was no space at any treatment center, and that even an ambulance that had come into the community had no room for her.

“When people are sick, you want to touch them,” said the brother, Mohammed Kargbo. “Now, I cannot even touch her. It is a problem.”

When the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus began relentlessly spreading in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] months ago, government officials made an urgent plea to Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org], all that appeared to stand between the country and chaos.

“They asked us to be everywhere,” recalled Walter Lorenzi, the medical charity’s former coordinator in Sierra Leone. “They didn’t know what to do.”

Not long after, the group opened a treatment center in Kailahun, in eastern Sierra Leone, that was hacked out of the bush in just 12 days. Before opening another center three weeks ago in the southern city of Bo, the organization ran three shifts of workers, 24 hours a day, when daily rain and equipment breakdowns delayed construction.

The first to respond to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, Doctors Without Borders remains the primary international medical aid group battling the disease there. As local health systems have all but collapsed and most outside institutions, including the United States military, have yet to fulfill all their pledges of help, the charity has erected six treatment centers in West Africa, with plans for more. Its workers have treated the majority of patients, just as they have in previous Ebola outbreaks and some other epidemics in the developing world.

But it, too, has been overwhelmed by the scale of this disaster. In Sierra Leone, it has been strained by the caseload, though it was wary of a decision by other health and government officials on Friday to treat most patients at home because of a shortage of clinic beds. In Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] the day before, it reported that its two treatment centers were stretched to the limit. In Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the organization is trying to improve the quality of care at its Monrovia facility.

While also maintaining its outposts in war zones and other danger areas, the group has pushed in recent weeks to do more in the Ebola epidemic — tripling its staff on the ground, opening its training center in Brussels to outsiders for the first time and offering guidance to others joining the fight.

“We decided to scale up; we decided to do things we’ve never done before,” said Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of the group, which is also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, or M.S.F.

The group decided long ago that it could not depend on governments and other institutions, so it built a global infrastructure that sustains a robust supply chain to the field, like that of a far-flung army.

Its state-of-the-art supply depot in Brussels, for example, has sent hundreds of thousands of masks, protective suits, large tents and medical supplies to West Africa in recent months, getting them on the ground within 24 hours. To overcome obstacles, the Brussels logistics team is innovating — developing field tents rigged so workers do not get overheated, retrofitting body bags to absorb infectious fluids and seeking fast ways to dry wet boots that must be regularly disinfected.

To minimize risks, specialists in Brussels designed treatment centers that are precisely laid out: with single entry and exit points, strict separation of high risk and low risk areas, and space for health workers in a buddy system to watch over one another while removing contaminated protective gear. When a volunteer French nurse became sick last month, they resolved to make the safeguards even tougher.

And the group has drawn on its legions of volunteers and billion-dollar base of donors who are attracted by its insistence on independence and record of providing care in places where often no one else dares to go.

Other aid organizations occasionally grumble about cockiness among Doctors Without Borders workers, safety protocols so rigorous they can seem like overkill and a focus on immediate help that does little to buttress local health systems over the long term.

But the organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, usually delivers. Even leaders of groups that have been criticized by Doctors Without Borders for a slow response to Ebola have praised its performance in the hot zone in recent months.

“Most people equate M.S.F. with courage, operating in conflicts,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/dg/adg/aylward/en/], an assistant director general of the World Health Organization. “This is courage of an equal magnitude when you realize how few others responded.”

A Simple Mandate

Doctors Without Borders calls itself a movement, and that sensibility infuses the operation. The group created a center, called Crash, devoted to self-criticism of its work. The culture is flinty — aid workers eschew the fancy hotels where government or United Nations workers sometimes stay — and volunteer doctors and top executives alike are paid considerably less than their counterparts at some other aid organizations.

Jean Pletinckx, 47, a chain-smoker who wears a battered black jacket over a gray hoodie and is a veteran of aid missions in Chechnya, Congo and Indonesia, presides over the logistics team in Brussels. He takes a dim view of consultants and rebuffs donations he considers more trouble than they are worth (“That’s a joke for me,” he said of a business that offered 10,000 free face masks to protect against Ebola when he needs 200,000 each month).

“Every single bit of money should be used as much as you can for results at the field level,” he said.

The group emerged in the late 1960s, as Nigerian forces fought a secessionist struggle in Biafra. When the government refused to allow some young French Red Cross doctors to deliver food to the famine-stricken rebel territory, they revolted, breaking their Red Cross pledge of neutrality and silence.

They founded the group that would, in 1971, become Médecins Sans Frontières. Its first director, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, a media-savvy leftist who would become France’s foreign minister, described the mission: “It’s simple. Go where the patients are.”

Medical teams would tend to people wherever they suffered, regardless of political or military boundaries, with or without permission. The group’s workers would bear public witness to what they observed.

Today, Doctors Without Borders is the largest of the relatively few organizations devoted to providing urgent care in medical crises caused by armed conflict or natural disasters; many other groups offer aid but focus on building up health care systems. Most of its $1.3 billion in donations last year came from private individuals across the globe, according to financial reports; just 9 percent came from governmental agencies. The charity sent about 6,000 health, logistics and other experts to 67 countries last year, and hired 30,000 local workers. This year, those numbers are swelling.

Doctors Without Borders was already in West Africa when the Ebola outbreak was identified in Guinea in March. One of its teams was there battling malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a chronic killer; in neighboring Sierra Leone, workers were providing maternal and pediatric care.

The aid organization, which had developed expertise in epidemics by treating measles[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], meningitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/meningitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in refugee camps, and small outbreaks of Ebola in Central Africa since the 1980s, started efforts to halt the virus. A group of workers went to Monrovia, in April, setting up an Ebola treatment unit. As the cases multiplied across the region through the summer, the charity brought on more volunteers and local workers to try to keep pace.

Emily Veltus, a 29-year-old American volunteer who had been inspired to work in an Ebola outbreak since seeing news of one in the fourth grade, helped build community support in Sierra Leone. She hired 700 local workers in six weeks, significantly increasing the budget. “I had the freedom to do that,” she said.

Mary Jo Frawley, 59, an American nurse who also was posted in Sierra Leone and previously worked with Doctors Without Borders in various emergencies, credited local health workers for the aid group’s effectiveness. “Nurses came to us and said, ‘We want to work for you; you have the right stuff to be safe,’ “ she said. But as the human misery mounted in the West African countries, its leaders delivered dire warnings that catalyzed promises of action from other organizations and governments.

“That’s what we try also to teach to our younger colleagues,” said Dr. Jean-Hervé Bradol, director of studies at Crash. “It’s not only to be operationally very dynamic, with good technical support structures, but also to understand when crises should have a bit more political attention.”

One Crisis to the Next

Even though only 30 percent of volunteers return and the group had more vacancies this summer than ever before, the charity is highly selective for the Ebola mission, rejecting applications from qualified medical people who do not have experience in crises. But it has stepped up training of volunteers in Brussels and redeployed some of its experts on other missions to West Africa.

The logistics team has tapped additional suppliers and invented or adapted solutions to problems. The requests from the field attest to the grim labor: patient wristbands with bar codes that can withstand repeated dousing with chlorine, an industrial-strength vacuum cleaner to suck up contaminated fluids, a cart designed to move dead bodies in rough terrain. The team has begun sending out computers with communications systems that work in the bush so patients can share final words with their families. And it is providing 70,000 disinfection kits to patients’ families and others, including every taxi driver in Monrovia.

“Ebola is like having an earthquake that never stops,” said Mr. Pletinckx, the logistics chief. “It is a constant emergency for the supply chain.”

The group is deciding where to go next in Sierra Leone, Makeni or Freetown, or to expand at all. In Liberia, the worst-hit country, it is working to improve care at its 250-bed center in Monrovia, the largest it has ever run. Until last week, the center had stopped putting in intravenous lines for patients to combat dehydration[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/dehydration/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] because of safety risks for health workers. Admissions had briefly dipped, officials with the group acknowledged, possibly because of another center opening, bottlenecks with ambulance transfers and rumors and criticism about the care. “We’re very aware of the kind of compromises we’re having to make,” said Christopher Stokes, general director of the organization’s Belgium office, which oversees the Ebola response. “We’re trying to put a boost on quality.”

An article on Thursday about a decision to destroy the pet dog of an Ebola patient in Spain referred incorrectly to the results of a study that tested whether dogs can be infected with the virus. The researchers found Ebola antibodies, not antigens, in the animals' blood. (An antigen is a substance to which the body reacts by producing antibodies.)

DALLAS -- The medical records of the Liberian man who died of the Ebola virus, released Friday by the man's family, raised new questions about the treatment he received when he first sought care at a hospital here.

The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, had a high fever -- his temperature was 103 degrees -- during his four-hour visit to the emergency room of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25, according to 1,400 pages of medical records that Mr. Duncan's family provided to The Associated Press. Mr. Duncan reported severe pain, rating it an eight on a scale of one to 10. His fever was marked with an exclamation point in the hospital's record-keeping system, The A.P. reported.

But the hospital sent Mr. Duncan home, even after learning that he had recently arrived from Africa. He was prescribed antibiotics and was told to take Tylenol, then he returned to the apartment where he was staying with his fiancée and three other people. He returned to the emergency room on Sept. 28 and was immediately placed in isolation in the hospital. He died of Ebola on Wednesday, the only person to die from the disease in the United States.

The reported details about his condition contradicted the hospital's previous description of Mr. Duncan's first visit. Hospital officials had said that Mr. Duncan had a temperature of 100.1 degrees and that his symptoms ''were not severe at the time he first visited the hospital emergency department.''

On Friday, Wendell Watson, a spokesman for Texas Health Resources, the organization that oversees the hospital, said in a statement that it continued to ''closely review and evaluate the chain of events related to the first Ebola virus diagnosis in the United States.'' But the statement did not directly address Mr. Duncan's 103-degree fever or the hospital's initial claims that he had had a lower temperature of 100.1.

Mr. Watson said the hospital had ''made changes to our intake process as well as other procedures to better screen for all critical indicators of Ebola virus.'' He added, ''We are committed to providing the best possible care to every patient we see, and to sharing our experiences and learnings in managing this insidious disease with the broader health care community.''

Included in the records, according to The Associated Press, was an emergency room physician's note dated Sept. 26 that said Mr. Duncan was ''negative for fever and chills.'' The note read: ''I have given patient instructions regarding their diagnosis, expectations for the next couple of days, and specific return precautions. The condition of the patient at this time is stable.''

Mr. Duncan's brother, Wilfred Smallwood, who lives in Phoenix, said he had not seen the records. But told what they showed about Mr. Duncan's fever, he said it reinforced the family's belief that Mr. Duncan's case was not handled competently and that Mr. Duncan should not be held accountable for the nationwide health scare.

''I'm not a medical professional, but I think it's clear to the public that he went to the hospital the first time and was turned away and told, 'You're O.K.,' '' Mr. Smallwood said. ''Who do you blame for it happening now? One hundred and three, they said go home. Now he's dead. Who do you blame for this?''

Mr. Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, who provided the records to The A.P., said on CNN on Friday that his uncle would have received better treatment by the hospital had he been white. ''They treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin,'' Mr. Weeks said.

Mr. Weeks said he had requested that the hospital take certain steps to help Mr. Duncan survive, including having him transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and giving him blood transfusions, but he said he was turned down.

As the family continued to grieve, Saymendy Lloyd, an activist who identified herself as a spokeswoman for Mr. Duncan's fiancée, Louise Troh, said Mr. Duncan was unaware that he had Ebola when he left Liberia for the United States. Mr. Duncan helped take a pregnant woman to and from a hospital in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, in the days before he flew to America. The woman died of Ebola, as have others who came into contact with her.

''Not even her family members knew'' she had Ebola, Ms. Lloyd said at a news conference in Washington. ''She had no symptoms at all of Ebola. She had pregnancy symptoms.''

Ms. Lloyd also said Ms. Troh's and Mr. Duncan's son, Karsiah, a student at Angelo State University in San Angelo, Tex., has not been allowed back at school because of concerns about the virus. But Becky Brackin, a spokeswoman for the university, denied Ms. Lloyd's claim.

''Karsiah is welcome back on this campus at any time,'' Ms. Brackin said.

The hospital has made contradictory and inaccurate statements in recent days. It apparently provided the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its own administrators with the wrong date of Mr. Duncan's first appearance at the hospital, originally saying it was Sept. 26, but later saying it was Sept. 25. One of the hospital's news releases included the wrong date of Mr. Duncan's diagnosis, which was confirmed on Sept. 30 but was noted as Sept. 29 in the statement. And the hospital placed some of the blame about why Mr. Duncan was sent home after his first visit on a problem with its electronic records system, but it later said the system had operated correctly.

These conflicting communications, as well as the medical records, have intensified the uncertainty over why the hospital did not view Mr. Duncan as a potential Ebola case during his first visit to its emergency room.

Mr. Duncan first went to Texas Health Presbyterian after 10 p.m. on Sept. 25. In a statement it issued on Oct. 2, the hospital said he had a temperature of 100.1 degrees and had reported having abdominal pain, a headache and decreased urination. ''These symptoms could be associated with many communicable diseases, as well as many other types of illness,'' the hospital said.

Mr. Duncan was asked by nurses if he had been around anyone who had been ill, and told them he had not, the hospital said. But he also told nurses, when asked if he had traveled outside the United States in the last four weeks, that he had been in Africa.

The hospital had said there had been a flaw in its electronic records system and suggested that while the nurses may have had access to the information about his travel history, the doctor who treated Mr. Duncan had not. But the hospital later retracted that claim, explaining that there was no flaw in the system and the physician could indeed view information about Mr. Duncan's travels from Africa.

Initially, Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Resources, told reporters that information about Mr. Duncan's travel history was not ''fully communicated'' to the full medical team. Mr. Duncan was sent home because the diagnostic team believed he simply had a low-grade fever from a viral infection, Dr. Lester had said.

But the newly released medical records and the hospital's statement acknowledging there was no flaw in the records system makes it unclear why the doctor sent him home.

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/world/middleeast/iran-tehran-offers-incentives-to-middle-class-families-to-have-more-children-as-population-declines.html] on June 8 about concerns among Iran’s leaders over a steep decline in fertility rates misidentified the measure of population growth that hit a peak after the 1979 revolution. It was the fertility rate, or the average number of children born to a woman during her childbearing years — not the birthrate, which is the number of births per 1,000 people. The article also misstated the fertility rate at that time. It was seven children per woman, not 3.6 children per couple. This article was corrected on The Times website in September after further reporting, but editors did not follow through with this correction for print editions.

INTERNATIONAL

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/science/ebola-dog-excalibur-nurse-spain.html] on Thursday about a decision to destroy the pet dog of an Ebola patient in Spain referred incorrectly to the results of a study that tested whether dogs can be infected with the virus. The researchers found Ebola antibodies, not antigens, in the animals’ blood. (An antigen is a substance to which the body reacts by producing antibodies.)

BUSINESS DAY

Because of an editing error, an article [http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/sluggish-global-outlook-ripples-in-markets/] on Friday about ripples in the stock market misstated the price decline of crude oil on Thursday. It was 1.8 percent, not 1.5 percent.

NEW YORK

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/nyregion/new-york-city-council-passes-bill-lowering-the-speed-limit-on-most-streets.html] in some editions on Wednesday about New York City’s lowering its speed limit to 25 miles per hour, using information from an advocacy group, misstated the number of pedestrian fatalities so far in 2014, and also those at the same time last year. As of Monday, 97 pedestrians had died in 2014 compared with 122 at that time in 2013 — not 164 compared with 189.

•

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/nyregion/judge-in-etan-patz-case-to-decide-if-defendant-understood-rights.html] in some editions on Wednesday about the final day of a court hearing on whether the confessions of Pedro Hernandez, the defendant in the 1979 death of Etan Patz, should be allowed at his murder trial, misspelled the surnames of two prosecutors involved with the case. The lead prosecutor is Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, not Illuzi-Orbon. And a senior prosecutor to whom Mr. Hernandez gave a second taped confession is Armand Durastanti, not Durasanti.

•

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/nyregion/long-neglected-lakes-and-ponds-in-city-parks-will-get-some-attention.html] in some editions last Saturday about efforts to restore the health of lakes and ponds across New York City parks misstated the given name of the Queens borough president, who has allocated money to improve Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. She is Melinda Katz, not Melissa.

WEEKEND

Because of an editing error, a picture caption [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/television/the-affair-on-showtime-stars-dominic-west-and-ruth-wilson.html] on Friday with a television review of “The Affair” misidentified the network on which the show will appear. As the review correctly noted, it is Showtime, not HBO.

•

An entry [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/spare-times-listings-for-oct-10-16.html] in the Spare Times listings in some editions on Friday about a Revolutionary War commemoration scheduled for Sunday in Lower Manhattan misstated the telephone number for more information. It is 914-772-8213.

•

A picture credit [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/theater/trusty-sidekick-presents-immersive-pieces-at-park-ave-armory.html] on Friday with an article about immersive theater pieces for children at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan misspelled the surname of the photographer. Kyle Cassidy, not Cassiday, took the pictures of two performers.

•

A theater review [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/theater/matthew-broderick-nathan-lane-and-stockard-channing-in-its-only-a-play-on-broadway.html] on Friday about “It’s Only a Play,” at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater in Manhattan, rendered incorrectly the surname of the mayor of New York, one of many well-known people mentioned in the dialogue. He is Bill de Blasio, not DeBlasio.

OBITUARIES

An obituary [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/nyregion/robert-j-mangum-a-pioneer-for-black-causes-dies-at-93.html] on Thursday about Robert J. Mangum, a former deputy New York City police commissioner and chairman of the New York State Commission on Human Rights, misspelled the surname of his partner of 30 years in some editions. She is Barbara Baxter Cuyjet, not Cuylet.

The Upshot
The Unhealthy Politics of Ebola

What’s more dangerous — flying on an airplane or driving to the airport? In general, auto accidents are a far greater threat than plane crashes, but we tend to devote more attention to dramatic or novel risks like threats to aviation safety.

The same principle applies to the Ebola virus. Although the outbreak is a substantial threat in West Africa, a region plagued by weak government and failing public health systems, the risk to Americans is currently minimal. By contrast, the seasonal flu [http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]kills thousands of people [http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5933a1.htm] every year but receives relatively little attention.

That hasn’t stopped politicians from exploiting those fears. As Jeremy Peters of The New York Timesreported [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/us/politics/republican-strategy-midterm-elections.html?smid=tw-share] Thursday, elected officials like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and candidates such as Scott Brown, who is running for Senate in New Hampshire, are hyping the threat from the disease and using it to attack President Obama and Democratic candidates. The news media raised [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/mark-pryor-ebola_n_5945082.html] similar issues this week in questioning Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who used Ebola to attack his opponent in a misleading ad [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/mark-pryor/pryor-says-cotton-voted-no-pandemic-prevention-bil/] released in late August.

This political attention may be contributing to the shift in public focus toward Ebola and away from more significant health threats like the flu. Where Google Trends information is available on both diseases, the data indicate that the relative frequency of searches for Ebola has increased more during the last two weeks in states where the issue has been politicized. It’s possible that politicians in those states are reflecting public opinion rather than causing the shift, but either way the trend is troubling. (Besides the Pryor ad, the Times article mentions candidates and officials in Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire and North Carolina. I exclude Texas and Oklahoma from the data because of the Ebola case in Dallas, which caused a surge in searches in those states. See here [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/upshot/inequality-and-web-search-q-and-a-with-google-researchers.html?abt=0002&abg=0] for more on how Google Trends works.)

A similar approach finds no equivalent increase in flu searches, which are slowly rising but, not surprisingly, are dwarfed in frequency [http://www-google-com.proxy.bc.edu/trends/explore#q=ebola,+flu&cmpt=q&geo=US] by Ebola.

We shouldn’t be surprised that people are panicking about Ebola. It’s a fundamental part of human psychology to pay disproportionate attention to novel threats and risks. But it’s always troubling to see how often our institutions and elites encourage those tendencies rather than trying to counteract them.

Fear of Vaccines Goes Viral

Last month The Hollywood Reporter ran an illuminating investigation on immunization trends[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-vaccine-wars-20-notable-731609] in Los Angeles County, which revealed that vaccination rates on the city’s wealthy west side, in neighborhoods like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, had plummeted, as incidents of whooping cough surged. The piece had the virtue of offering New Yorkers yet another opportunity to feel smugly superior to their counterparts in L.A., because of course here on the East Coast we like our science to come from scientists, not from former Playboy models and people who feel entitled to pontificate about public health because they drink kefir.

In an interview with NPR[http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/30/351242264/vaccine-controversies-are-as-social-as-they-are-medical] last month about her new book, “On Immunity: An Inoculation,” the author Eula Biss presented the idea that vaccinating your children on schedule was now seen as “an extreme position.”

New York State and city have strict immunization requirements, which have been further strengthened over the past two years. It is not possible here, as it is in California, to obtain a philosophically based exemption from those rules for your child. In January, the city health department decreed[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/day-care-flu-faq.pdf] that all enrolled children from 6 months old through age 5, whether attending public or private schools, had to receive a flu shot before Dec. 31. Parents, though, can recuse their children from vaccination protocols with religious exemptions, which are relatively uncomplicated to obtain.

And certainly some exploitation of that loophole is exercised. Amanda Uhry, who runs a consultancy called Manhattan Private School Advisors, which, as its name suggests, helps parents through the private-school application process, said she recently turned down a half-dozen clients when she discovered that they were opposed to vaccination. For a long while she had never inquired about the issue, but a few years ago, a child she was working with missed his kindergarten interview because of whooping cough, which left her stunned.

“I thought, Whooping cough? Who gets whooping cough anymore?” she said. The episode compelled her to start asking about vaccination early on. “No application to any school asks, ‘Are you an anti-vaxxer?’ but these schools want to keep the anti-vaxxers out.” So, she said, “I ask people and if they get into the whole anti-vaxxer deal, I say, ‘Fine, we can’t work with you.’ ” You’re not, as she put it, “going to Horace Mann like this.”

There is enough appeal in anti-vaccination thinking among members of the affluent class that certain pediatricians in the city, as they have elsewhere around the country, have made it a policy in recent years to refuse to see children whose parents won’t have them immunized. A few years ago Pediatric Associates of NYC, which has branches in Murray Hill in Manhattan and Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, chose this course, David Horwitz, a partner in the practice told me, in large part because it simply became untenable to have unvaccinated children sitting in waiting rooms.

Within the American Academy of Pediatrics[http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/131/5/e1696.short] there has been a rancorous debate about whether doctors should see un-immunized patients, and the academy’s position has leaned toward an inclusive approach. But, Dr. Horwitz said, “we were spending a lot of time talking to parents who weren’t immunizing and who were terribly ill informed. A lot of people would continue to come back and come back and come back and we were spending so much time talking about vaccinations that we weren’t dealing with other things,” he said.

“We ultimately felt ethically uncomfortable seeing people who don’t vaccinate. We are advocates for children, not their parents.”

Among mothers and fathers coming in for an infant’s two-week visit, about 10 percent express opposition to vaccination, Barney Softness, a prominent Upper West Side pediatrician, told me, speaking of his practice. Dr. Softness works with patients to persuade them to immunize. Often he is successful, he told me, but often, “they give me lip service and then delay.”

Because so many New Yorkers are committed more to ambivalence than absolutism, and ultimately to their own neuroses above all else, the current moment of viral fear — the rise of Ebola and national reports of the spread of enterovirus 68 — is actually a fortuitous one for the project of shifting the opinions of deniers, even though there are no vaccines for those illnesses. A hepatitis-A scare on the Upper West Side last year led to a rush of patients coming in for various vaccines, Dr. Softness told me. “Nothing makes people want to get vaccinated more than reports of two cases of something in a ZIP code.”

Laura Popper, who has had a pediatric practice on the Upper East Side since the late 1970s, has never accepted families who refuse to vaccinate their children as patients. As a resident at Columbia nearly 40 years ago, she witnessed as two little girls who were sisters died of diphtheria after a relative visiting from the Dominican Republic turned out to be a carrier. The girls weren’t immunized. “I said to myself then, this will never again happen under my watch,” Dr. Popper said.

“My feeling is that it will take something like that on a very large scale to get upper-middle-class people to realize that this is serious stuff,” she said, even more so than terrorism or other global concerns. “You look around and most of the deaths in the world are from contagious diseases. Not ISIS.”

Business Day; Mutual Funds
In Emerging-Market Bonds, Political Risk Is a Constant

WHEN Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt in July, investors seemed to shrug. Money kept flowing into mutual funds[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/mutual-funds-and-etfs/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and exchange-traded funds that invest in emerging-market bonds, as it has for much of the last five years.

Indeed, many investors have been making room in their portfolios for this asset class. They’ve piled into emerging-market bonds from a variety of countries, as new investment darlings like Mexico and Indonesia have overshadowed Argentina.

“We consider emerging-market bonds as similar to high-yield debt — an in-between asset class” straddling stocks and bonds, said Francis M. Kinniry[https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/researchcommentary/contributor?cont=3], a principal in Vanguard’s investment strategy group. “If investors are looking for higher yield but aren’t ready for equities, they can be a good middle ground. An emerging-market bond fund is going to have nowhere near the risk of emerging-market equities — its downside looks nothing like equities.”

For the last several years, emerging-market bond mutual funds and E.T.F.s have offered better returns than developed-world debt. The emerging-market bond funds tracked by Morningstar returned an annualized average of 6.3 percent in the five years ended on Sept. 30, compared with an annualized average of 4.1 percent for the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.

It’s important to recognize that those higher returns come with higher risks. “It’s like somebody trying to get a mortgage[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/mortgages/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] with a lower credit score,” Mr. Kinniry said. “They may be able to get a loan, but the bank will charge them a higher rate.”

Emerging markets often have upheavals of a sort that developed countries rarely experience. There was Argentina’s failure to pay interest on its bonds this summer. And that may have been a minor event compared with Russia’s clashes with Ukraine, the warfare in the Middle East and the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus outbreak in West Africa. And last year brought turmoil of a different sort: the “taper tantrum” in financial markets, as prices for emerging-market bonds sagged on news that the Federal Reserve might begin to raise interest rates in the United States.

Such risks are a constant in emerging-market investing, said Michael J. Conelius, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond[http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/snapshot.do?ticker=PREMX] fund since 1994. “The political risk never goes away,” he said. “Ten years ago, we could’ve been talking about troubles in Africa and wars in the Middle East, too. But if there’s riskiness and we believe things are getting better, that’s an opportunity for our clients.”

Just as emerging-market countries can sputter while the American economy chugs along, they also can surge when it sags. These varying trajectories can add diversification to a portfolio, said L. Bryan Carter, lead manager of the Acadian Emerging Markets Debt[https://www.oldmutualus.com/companies/templates/mf_perf.asp?couFlag=0&curFlag=0&assetID=46&affiliate=2&product=1277&IsAIMR=0] fund. “Latin American countries, like Mexico and Colombia, are linked to the U.S.,” he said. “In contrast, Poland and the Czech Republic are much more linked to Germany. And in Asia, you have something else again, with money coming out of China and Japan and going into the emerging countries,” such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

The long debate about the benefits of active versus passive portfolio management crackles in this sector, as in every corner in the investment business.

Active managers say the greater risk and variety of emerging-market bonds bring opportunities for them to apply expertise and experience. “One reason that you might not want to use a passive strategy in emerging bonds is that all the countries aren’t created equal,” said Teresa Kong, manager of the Matthews Asia Strategic Income[http://matthewsasia.com/our-funds/f-17/matthews-asia-strategic-income-fund/overview.fs] fund. “My job is to understand the social fabric and the legal system. Everybody can do the math. But you need to look at the countries’ histories, too.”

An active manager can avoid troubled countries, while an indexed fund or E.T.F. must hew to the allocations of its underlying index. Todd L. Rosenbluth[http://us.spindices.com/events/sp-events/todd-rosenbluth], director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research for S&P Capital IQ, said, “The country can play a major role, from a political standpoint, in the selection of the bonds.”

Even so, he said, the average active fund has not beaten the market averages lately. Only 13 percent of actively managed emerging-market bond funds bested the Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate bond index for the three years ended on June 30. “It got better at five years — 36 percent,” he said.

Besides replicating a market’s average return, index funds and E.T.F.s offer low costs and transparency because their holdings mirror their indexes, said Francis G. Rodilosso, senior investment officer and fixed-income portfolio manager for Van Eck Global[http://www.vaneck.com/]’s Market Vectors E.T.F.s. “You’ll always know what your Russia exposure is,” he said.

Still, some long-tenured active managers in the sector manage not only to top their benchmarks but also to do so without undue risk, according to some metrics.

Consider the Fidelity New Markets Income[https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315910836] fund, managed by John H. Carlson. The fund returned an annualized average of 9 percent over the 10 years ended Oct. 6, compared with 7.7 percent for its Morningstar peers. The zigzags of its returns approximately equaled those of its peers.

That does not mean Mr. Carlson, the fund’s manager since 1995, avoids big bets.  As of Aug. 31, Venezuelan bonds accounted for 11.4 percent of the fund, about twice the Morningstar category average. “We diversify across 75 countries, so we’re balancing the riskier credits like Venezuela against investment-grade ones like Mexico,” he said.

HOW much of a portfolio should be allocated to emerging-market bonds? It depends on whom you ask, and on your risk tolerance.

“If you’re going to be up all night checking the latest movement of troops in the Ukraine, the right amount is nothing,” Mr. Carlson said. For a less skittish investor with an investment horizon of at least three years, 6 percent to 10 percent of a total portfolio could make sense, he said.

Karin S. Anderson, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says that if investors hold emerging bonds at all, the bonds should supplement, not replace, core holdings like Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. “You should keep them in the supporting-player role — a satellite bucket in your portfolio,” she said. And investors should study a fund before jumping in, she said.

Within the broad category of emerging-market bonds, managers can emphasize securities with varying levels of risk. Among the options are sovereign bonds denominated in dollars, sovereigns denominated in local currencies and emerging-market corporate bonds, typically denominated in dollars. An index fund or E.T.F. might own only one type of bond, but active managers will often juggle all three and might stash a little money in cash and stocks, and hedge currency risk with derivatives.

Another caveat is that many funds have short records. “About half of the emerging-market debt funds sold in the U.S. are less than three years old,” Ms. Anderson said. An investor might not be able to see how a fund held up in 2008, when the average emerging-market bond fund lost 17.6 percent. “These do tend to be the most volatile of the bond funds,” she added.

Peace Prize Awards Eclipse Grim Fears of Ebola

Horrors tend to hug the headlines, and the appearance of the Ebola virus in the United States and Europe, accompanied by some untoward panic-mongering and finger-pointing, was much in the news this past week. But it was encouraging news that carried the day: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to a pair of crusaders for children’s rights and the United States Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage and voting rights.

In a category of its own was the mysterious absence of North Korea’s pudgy tyrant, Kim Jong-un, last seen in public on Sept. 3 — with a limp. This was the sum total of known facts, but that did not prevent reams of speculation about what may be happening in the world’s most secretive and repressive hellhole.

Even if the North Korean leader was seriously sick or deposed, though, that would not necessarily mean the end of the outrageous personality cult created by Eternal Leader, his grandfather, or Dear Leader, his father. History shows that tyrannical regimes on the skids may deliberately create crises to keep their people in line.

Ebola Alarm

Fear that Ebola could spread outside Africa grew over the week with the death of the first person in whom the virus was diagnosed in the United States, the deteriorating condition of a nurse in Spain and a couple of potential cases of Ebola elsewhere. The cases were indeed alarming, given the rapidity with which the deadly disease has rampaged through Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and the high rate of death.

The United States and Britain announced measures to screen passengers arriving from these regions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/newly-vigilant-us-is-to-screen-fliers-for-ebola.html?_r=0]. The main purpose was apparently to reassure the public that something was being done. There seems little risk of a runaway pandemic in America or Europe, given the rich resources of the medical services there. But that did not preclude some Republicans from exploiting Ebola in their campaigns for the midterm electionsin November. Much of the Republican platform has been built around an America supposedly made weak and vulnerable by President Obama, and Ebola has been accorded a prominent place in that vision, alongside the Islamic State and a bumbling Secret Service.

Some of the cruder attacks have carried references to “President Ebola.” Others have somehow fused Ebola with immigration, as in Senator Rand Paul’s suggestion that the Mexican border is too porous to keep infected people out. The Kentucky Republican, a medical doctor and possible presidential candidate, also suggested that President Obama’s plan to send up to 4,000 soldiers to Liberia to help combat the virus could end up bringing a “whole ship full” of infected soldiers back to America.

In Spain, the decision to destroy a dog belonging to the infected nurse set off a major furor. More than 390,000 people signed an online petition to save the dog’s life, more than double the number who signed a petition exhorting the Food and Drug Administration to fast-track research on a potential vaccine.

And Now the Good News

The Norwegian committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize has been known to use its choice to make a political statement. This year’s choice managed to make several in awarding the prize to crusaders for children’s rights in Pakistan and India.

The Pakistani was Malala Yousafzai, the girl who attracted global attention and admiration after she was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 for her campaign on behalf of girls’ education. Ms. Yousafzai, then 15, recovered and became a global campaigner for and symbol of her cause. The Indian was Kailash Satyarthi, 60, a former engineer who for decades has fought against child slavery in India, liberating more than 75,000 bonded and child laborers in the country.

Lest the various strands of the award go unnoticed, Thorbjorn Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel committee, declared that the panel “regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism.” In that spirit, Ms. Yousafzai and Mr. Satyarthi agreed to work together to help children and to heal the rift between their countries.

Supremely

The Supreme Court decision on Monday not to reverse appeals court rulings allowing same-sex marriage in five states was as bland in its technicality and absence of explanation as it was stunning in its ramifications. In a world in which the marriage of two men or two women was so recently not only impossible but socially unthinkable, the highest court in the United States — one on which political conservatives and Catholics are a majority — may have marked a point of no return in the nationwide legalization of gay and lesbian marriages. The practical effect of the ruling could bring same-sex marriage to 30 states within weeks, and others are bound to follow suit. That the court would make the judgment seem almost routine followed a court tradition, when cases involve major social upheavals, of tacitly accepting what the public has made inevitable. In the case of gay marriage, what is especially striking is the speed with which American society, and societies in many other parts of the world, have shed the age-old abomination of homosexuality and the persecution of homosexuals.

For all the advances in tolerance, however, many parts of the world remain dangerous for homosexuals — much of Africa, some Muslim countries, Russia. In France, demonstrations against assisted pregnancies and surrogacy for gay couples drew tens of thousands into the streets of Paris and Bordeaux on Oct. 5. None of that, however, changes the fact that the world has witnessed a tectonic shift over the past two decades or so, and that this past week included a surprising milestone.

The Supreme Court also stepped into the volatile issue of voter identification laws with a ruling on Thursday blocking Wisconsin from imposing its voter ID laws in the midterm elections. At the same time, a United States district judge in Texas declared that a similar law amounted to an “unconstitutional poll tax” and struck it down.

Laws requiring photo identification to vote are believed to make it more difficult for blacks, Hispanics and the young to vote. These groups generally favor Democrats, and most such laws have been promulgated by Republicans. In Wisconsin, the Supreme Court ruling was a setback for Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican facing a re-election challenge from Mary Burke, a Democrat.

The Supreme Court ruling was issued without comment. Not so the one from the judge in Texas, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, who declared that the state’s voter ID law “was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose.”

In U.S. Screening for Ebola, J.F.K Is on Front Lines

As Ebola continues to ravage West Africa and fears grow that the virus will spread around the globe, enhanced screenings at American airports began Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

Travelers coming from three hard-hit African countries are being singled out, having their temperatures taken and questioned about their possible exposure to Ebola.

Kennedy is the first of five American airports to step up screening protocols and the new measures were the latest indication that of the risk the disease presents.

Airports in Canada and Europe also plan to take similar measures in coming days.

But even as nations try to reassure anxious citizens that they are doing all they can to prevent an outbreak within their borders, public health officials cautioned that the only way to truly eliminate the threat posed by the virus would be to defeat it in West Africa.

“As Ebola continues its slow-motion incursion into developed countries, right now the U.S. and Spain, there is an understandable level of fear growing among people about this terrible virus, even though the chances of seeing anything like the calamity in western Africa is profoundly remote,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and a special adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio.

While the screenings might catch a few cases, he said, the focus needed to remain on battling the disease at its source and reacting quickly and effectively to new cases when they appear.

The decision to screen travelers entering the United States was announced on Wednesday, the day t the first patient in the country to be given an Ebola diagnoses died.

That patient, Thomas Duncan, traveled to Dallas from Liberia and like all airline passengers leaving the West African countries at the center of the epidemic, he was screened for symptoms before being allowed to board his flight.

Over the last two months, 36,000 people have been screened in Africa and only 77 were kept off flights because of illness. While many of the 77 had malaria none were infected with Ebola.

Mr. Duncan did not yet have a fever or any other symptoms associated with Ebola when he left Liberia. He did not fall ill until several days after he arrived in Dallas.

People infected with Ebola usually can take up to 21 days to manifest symptoms, making the airport screening limited in the effectiveness.

Under the new protocols, Customs and Border Protection officers have been directed to single out travelers arriving from three countries – Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone – based on their passport information.

They will then be escorted to a special area where, under the guidance of the federal Centers for Disease Control, trained medical staff will take their temperature using a non-contact thermometer aimed at their foreheads. They will also be asked a series of questions.

If a traveler has a fever, other symptoms or is revealed to have possible Ebola exposure, they will be evaluated by a C.D.C. quarantine officer.

“The public health officer will again take a temperature reading and make a public health assessment,” according to the guidelines released by the C.D.C. “Travelers, who after this assessment, are determined to require further evaluation or monitoring will be referred to the appropriate public health authority.”

In New York City, officials have designated the Bellevue Hospital Center as the destination for any travelers who need to be put into isolation. Since September, the New York City Health Department has had the ability to test blood for Ebola and make a diagnosis within four to six hours.

Travelers who have no fever, symptoms, or known history of exposure will receive health information for self-monitoring.

Beginning next week, Washington Dulles, Newark, , Chicago O’Hare and Atlanta international airports will employ the same stepped-up screenings as those put in place at Kennedy. Around 150 people enter America every day from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and nearly all of them come through these five airports.

Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., has cautioned that the screening only offer limited protection and that sealing off the effected countries from the rest of the world through a total travel ban would be unwise and, ultimately, self-defeating.

To do so, he has argued, would make it harder to fight the virus.

So officials are turning to some of the oldest weapons in their arsenal in the long-running battle with disease.

Since at least the 14th century, when the bubonic plague devastated Europe, posting medical officers at a port of entry has been one of the main tools used to try and halt the spread of disease.

An outbreak of yellow fever in 1878 led the United States Congress to grant the federal government the authority to order a quarantine to prevent the spread of a disease.

Those powers were enhanced in 1892 to try and prevent another scourge, cholera.

For several decades, starting in the 1970s, the quarantine program in the United States was neglected.

It took another threat, severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, to spur Congress and the C.D.C. to bolster the program. In late 2002, medical officers were dispatched to 17 airports and a border crossing in El Paso to look out for communicable diseases.

Unlike SARS, Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air. It is only transmitted through close contact and bodily fluids and a person is only contagious when they are symptomatic.

There is no vaccine to prevent the illness and and no specific treatment for it.

The only way to stop an outbreak is to try and catch the virus early then to isolate each infected patient, trace all their contacts, isolate the ones who get sick.

That process must be repeated and repeated until there are no more new cases.

Ebola Victim’s Family Blames Hospital and State

DALLAS — Relatives of the first person to die of Ebola in the United States, joined by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., continued on Saturday to denounce the treatment he and his family had received from a hospital here and from Texas officials, claiming that he had been cremated without their knowledge or permission and given substandard care because he was African.

Josephus Weeks, a nephew of the Ebola victim — Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who died Wednesday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html] at the Dallas hospital where he had been found to have Ebola on Sept. 30 — said his uncle had been “handled poorly, unfairly, and an injustice was done.”

Mr. Weeks spoke to reporters on Saturday in Chicago with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Duncan’s mother, Nowai Gartay. They asked why Mr. Duncan had not been taken to Nebraska Medical Center, where two Americans who contracted the disease in West Africa have been treated. And they said the Dallas hospital, Texas Health Presbyterian, had not immediately informed them that Mr. Duncan had died and had led them to believe that he was still alive.

“I feel bad about my son,” Ms. Gartay said inside a chapel at the Chicago headquarters of Mr. Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. “We call the hospital — they know that my son died, and they didn’t tell me. They only told me, ‘You can’t talk to your son.’ ”

Mr. Jackson said the other Ebola victims in the United States “came back to Atlanta and Nebraska, got quick treatment and early treatment, and their lives have been spared.”

“That did not happen with Eric Duncan,” he said. “And the critical hours, critical days, were missed.”

Unlike Mr. Duncan, the other Ebola patients treated in the United States were diagnosed in Africa and then flown to American hospitals.

On Friday, Mr. Weeks released Mr. Duncan’s medical records to The Associated Press. Those documents raised new questions about why the hospital that treated him had sent him home after his first visit to its emergency room on Sept. 25. The medical records showed that during that first visit, his temperature had peaked at 103 degrees[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/us/thomas-duncan-had-a-fever-of-103-er-records-show.html] and he had reported severe pain, rating it an eight on a scale of 1 to 10.

The details contradicted the hospital’s initial description of Mr. Duncan’s condition. It had said that he had a temperature of 100.1 and that his symptoms “were not severe at the time he first visited the hospital emergency department.”

Mr. Jackson said Mr. Duncan had been very ill and feverish at the time of his initial discharge. “He left there on a stretcher and was put in the car,” he said. “He should never have left the hospital after he got there.”

Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, an infectious-diseases specialist and emergency-medicine expert at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who reviewed some of Mr. Duncan’s medical records at the request of The A.P., said that Mr. Duncan had not had a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] when he first arrived at the emergency room, but that he had complained of abdominal pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/abdominal-pain/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and a headache[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/headache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. About three and a half hours into his stay, his temperature reached 103 degrees, the highest reading during his four-hour visit.

Mr. Duncan’s symptoms, and the fact that he had recently arrived from West Africa, should have alerted the nurses and doctors treating him that he was a possible Ebola patient, Dr. Adalja said. The hospital has acknowledged that when asked if he had traveled outside the United States in the last four weeks, Mr. Duncan told nurses that he had been in Africa, where an Ebola outbreak in the west has killed at least 4,000 people.

“You have a person who arrived from Liberia in the last 21 days, who has abdominal pain and a headache and eventually exhibits a fever in the emergency department,” Dr. Adalja said. “That’s clearly a constellation of findings that meets the criteria for Ebola. From the very start, Ebola should have been in the minds of all the health care providers.”

Based on his review of the medical records, Dr. Adalja said the diagnosis given to Mr. Duncan before his discharge included sinusitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/sinusitis-chronic/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], from an infection. But Dr. Adalja said that sinusitis rarely caused a fever as high as Mr. Duncan’s and did not cause abdominal pain, and that a CT scan[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/ct-scan/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of Mr. Duncan’s head showed no evidence of sinusitis.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said the agency was considering investigating the delay in treating Mr. Duncan for Ebola, including the hospital’s compliance with state health and safety laws and regulations, but added that its immediate focus was on monitoring[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/ebola-dallas-thomas-duncan.html] those who had come into direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan.

Hospital officials have said that Mr. Duncan’s symptoms during his first visit could have been “associated with many communicable diseases, as well as many other types of illness,” but they have retracted their previous statement that a flaw in the hospital’s electronic records system was to blame. And they have said that after Mr. Duncan returned on Sept. 28 and was admitted, a team of more than 50 people “cared for him in a professional and compassionate manner.”

On Friday, Wendell Watson, a spokesman for Texas Health Resources, the parent organization that oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, said in a statement that the hospital continued to “closely review and evaluate the chain of events,” and that it had “made changes to our intake process as well as other procedures to better screen for all critical indicators of Ebola virus.”

In Chicago, Mr. Weeks said that Mr. Duncan had been cremated without his family’s permission, but that he could not explain the sequence of events.

“I need to find out,” he said. “They’re saying a whole bunch of stuff. They change the rules on us every single day.”

Guidelines issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the safe handling of the remains of Ebola patients in American hospitals and mortuaries states that the Ebola virus can be transmitted in post-mortem settings. The C.D.C. advises that the remains should be cremated or buried promptly in a coffin that has been documented as being hermetically sealed.

Officials have said that Dr. David L. Lakey, the commissioner of the state health services department, recommended cremation to the family and that the family agreed. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for the agency reiterated that the family had agreed to cremation, saying that officials had an oral and written agreement with Mr. Duncan’s next of kin. She declined to identify that person for privacy reasons.

Manny Fernandez reported from Dallas, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.

In Travel Out of Liberia, Nothing Is Simply Routine

MONROVIA, Liberia -- The woman at the Brussels Airlines city check-in office told me to arrive at Robertsfield Airport three hours before my 8:40 p.m. flight.

My sister, who still lives in my family's native Liberia, dropped me off at the airport gate at 5:15 p.m. You have to get your temperature checked simply to enter the airport grounds, so I got out of the car at the gate. I did not hug or kiss her goodbye.

I had dropped my luggage off at the city check-in office so I wouldn't have to deal with it again until Washington. I carried a blue canvas handbag crammed with wallet, laptop, two cellphones, passport, change of clothing, bleach wipes, and two Ziploc bags full of the malaria pills and immune boosters I had been taking for the two weeks I had been covering the Ebola outbreak. And now I was taking the same route to the United States flown by Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who, after traveling on to Dallas, fell to the disease.

At 5:23, the guard at the gate pointed his laser thermometer at my forehead. In the two weeks I had been in Monrovia, my temperature -- taken an average of six to eight times daily -- tended to hover between 35.4 and 36.5 degrees Celsius, which are normal body temperatures. Once it got up to 36.9 degrees, and I became alarmed. Above 38 degrees Celsius is when they start asking other questions. No one wants to be there.

At the Robertsfield gate, I was 36.4. ''Go wash your hands,'' the guard said, pointing to a big plastic jug of chlorine water. It was the ninth time that day that I'd washed my hands in bleach. Health officials say chlorine kills the virus instantly. In Liberia, people use a lot of chlorine now.

Outside the terminal, a woman gave me a health questionnaire that listed a bunch of symptoms -- fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes -- and asked if I had had any of them in the past two days. The form also asked, in several different ways, if I'd come into contact with anyone with Ebola. I X'd no to everything because I made a point to never touch anyone during my two weeks there.

At the terminal door, a guard glanced at my answers, then pointed to another jug. I washed my hands again.

Next stop was four health workers in goggles, masks, gloves and white coats, but not hazmat suits. One scanned my answers and put it in a stack. Another pointed his laser thermometer at me.

It read 36.4 degrees.

Finally, 43 minutes after I arrived at the airport, I walked into the terminal.

The immigration line was crowded, and it was almost impossible not to touch other people. Cursing myself for wearing my jacket around my waist instead of my shoulders, I hunched into myself to avoid human skin. The plastic-gloved security woman wanted to frisk me by hand and she touched my neck and my arm. Then she took off her gloves, threw them in a basket, and put on another pair for the next passenger. So she was changing gloves before each body check. Good.

But I still headed straight to the bathroom and used four chlorine wipes on my arms, neck, and face. And I put my jacket on.

Two hours later, the Brussels Air flight landed on Robertsfield's sole runway, and everyone in the terminal -- this being the only flight out Friday night -- surged toward the door. We stood around for 30 minutes, and then the health workers appeared before us with their laser thermometers. The left side of my face had been feeling hot as I waited in the terminal, and I was fretting. I went to the female health worker on my right. She checked my left side.

It read 35.4 degrees.

At the plane, we were greeted by flight attendants wearing masks and gloves. One of them kept his mask on for the entire six-hour flight. ''This is not very reassuring,'' the woman behind me muttered.

We took off a little late at 9:10. No one seemed to sleep.

BRUSSELS -- We landed at 5:49 a.m. There was no screening in Brussels. After a six-hour layover, my United flight to Washington was completely normal.

WASHINGTON-- We landed at Dulles at 2:20 p.m. The automated entry kiosk scanned my passport and spit out a customs receipt with a big X on it and instructions to take it to a passport officer. I went to the nearest one, showed it to him, and said, ''I'm coming from Liberia.''

''Ugh,'' he said. He told me to go to the next agent.

When I told the agent I'd flown in from Liberia, he said, ''Thanks for telling me,'' and put on gloves before taking my passport. He asked me how long I'd been there, whether I felt sick, and if I'd had my temperature taken. I told him two weeks, no, and three times the night before. ''That's great that they're doing that,'' he said, and told me to report to customs after getting my luggage.

At customs they sent me into the room for sketchy types, and told me to go to Line C. The agent called me up and asked me the same questions. He wore gloves, and gave me a sheet with the C.D.C. emergency phone number on it in case I started feeling symptoms. He said that he expected C.D.C. personnel to begin doing temperature checks next week, but that for the past two weeks, since Thomas Eric Duncan, they had just been taking these simple screening measures.

I walked out of Dulles at 3:30, one hour and 10 minutes after my flight landed. An hour later, I was home.

Liberian Army Sees Its Chance at Rebranding

MONROVIA, Liberia -- For decades, Liberians have referred to the Armed Forces of Liberia as ''soldiers them.''

As in, ''soldiers them came and raped my daughter.'' Or ''soldiers them beat my husband at the checkpoint in Paynesville.''

Now, ''soldiers them'' -- once responsible for toppling the government, killing civilians and setting the nation on a course toward a devastating civil war -- have suddenly become a linchpin in the fight against the Ebola virus rampaging through their country.

Huddled with American military personnel in the capital, Monrovia, Liberian soldiers rehearsed their roles in the effort to build 18 Ebola treatment units across the country.

''At the Monrovia medical unit yesterday, over 100 citizens were out there watching the construction,'' Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, the commander of U.S. Army Africa, noted pointedly. Be nice to them, he instructed the group.

Joseph F. Johnson, a deputy minister at Liberia's Defense Ministry, nodded in agreement.

''We're trying to rebrand the A.F.L. as a force for good,'' he said. ''Piggyback on this.''

That is no easy task. The room where the group was meeting is just a few yards from the beach where in 1980, drunken soldiers killed 13 top Liberian government officials after staging the coup -- a chilling start to the military dictatorship under Samuel K. Doe.

One of the new treatment centers being built to fight Ebola is just a few miles from a refugee camp where uniformed soldiers wielding machine guns and cutlasses slaughtered 400 men and women and 200 children in 1993 -- one of many atrocities committed during the civil war that began after rebels tried to oust Mr. Doe.

Replacing such images in the public consciousness with ones of Liberian soldiers working side by side with American troops and making nice with ordinary Liberians is a tough sell, even if the enemy now is a terrifying virus steamrolling through the country, killing more than 2,300 people in six months.

Many Liberians have a love-hate relationship with the military: they love the American military; they hate their own.

Beatrice K. Yates, 45, said that only last month, Liberian soldiers beat up her son, Titus, and a friend for standing on the porch of her family's home in Caldwell in violation of a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Ebola curfew.

''Those soldiers them came and said, 'oh, curfew now catch y'all,' '' Mrs. Yates said. ''Please tell the American military to help us.''

The faith in the American military is rooted in historical ties between the two countries that began in 1822, when Liberia was founded by freed American slaves.

Still, the relationship has been a complicated one. The American government openly supported Mr. Doe after the coup, despite the absence of elections for years.

After the civil war ended in 2003, the Liberian government disbanded the armed forces as part of an effort to demilitarize the country and soothe residents, showing that soldiers who had committed atrocities would no longer represent them.

President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who took office in 2006, promised a new, kinder and gentler army, made up of soldiers who had been vetted and actually went through basic training -- something many soldiers, particularly during the reign of President Charles G. Taylor, had not done.

The American military has had trainers in Liberia for years to help reinvent the country's army. Now, President Obama's decision to send American troops to build Ebola treatment units has added another layer to these already complex ties.

On Thursday afternoon, four Marine V-22 Ospreys landed at Liberia's international airport in a thunder of noise. General Williams, the American commander here, was making plans to buzz Monrovia with the $70 million aircraft, counting on the visual and audio impact to tell Liberians that they are not alone in the Ebola fight.

At every meeting and public appearance with Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Ziankahn, his Liberian counterpart, General Williams makes a point of mentioning the partnership between the armed forces of ''our great country and your great country.''

General Ziankahn is using the same playbook, and even chided the Americans for using the names of American football teams on a planning map for treatment units across the country.

''Let's make this a combined effort,'' he told the soldiers participating in the joint drill -- although later in the week it was unclear whether the country's Mighty Barrolle or I.E. (Invincible Eleven) soccer teams would join the Baltimore Ravens on the map.

General Ziankahn, the Liberian military's chief of staff, has suspended all other training and exercises so that he can throw his entire army into the war against Ebola. He is dispatching troops to each of the treatment centers under construction, and Liberian soldiers have deployed to the borders to enforce screening measures.

Today, there are only 2,000 enlisted men and women in the Liberian armed forces. They must have a high school degree, something that Mr. Doe, at the time a master sergeant, did not have when in 1980 he led the group of soldiers who stormed the Executive Mansion and disemboweled the president. Officers must now have a university degree.

Last year, a platoon of Liberian soldiers was dispatched for peacekeeping in Mali, the first time Liberian troops have been deployed to help in another country since 1962. The mission would have been unthinkable just 10 years ago.

Tall and athletic with a propensity for quoting obscure philosophers, General Ziankahn, 43, is the face of the new Liberian military. He got his master's in military arts and science at the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

He was 9 when Liberian soldiers overthrew the government and went on a reprisal spree of rape and killings. His first interaction with soldiers came when a group of them carrying M-16s showed up the day after the coup to arrest his next-door neighbor, who was a cabinet member.

The young Daniel and his friends had seen their neighbor flee into the swamp behind their house, where he hid in the water. The boys did not turn him in. ''He was good to us; he gave us yams,'' General Ziankahn recalled. ''This was my very first lesson on the importance of being good to people.''

Thirty-four years later, General Ziankahn says he is still trying to instill in his fledgling force the importance of that lesson. It has not always sunk in.

Two months ago, with no warning, the Liberian government sent the army and the police to impose a 21-day quarantine on West Point, a crowded slum where tens of thousands of people live, many in two-room shanties.

Clashes broke out as angry residents tried to get out. Shots were fired into the crowd, killing a 15-year-old boy.

''All those soldiers them were shooting,'' Nancy Jellehs, 76, a still-angry West Point resident, said recently.

General Ziankahn was doing a two-month course at Harvard University when the quarantine and shooting took place. He hurried home and opened inquiries into the behavior of the enlisted soldiers and the officers who gave orders, promising to punish those found responsible.

''Even if there had not been a shooting, we would still be investigating, because I saw the videos and there were other violations'' from soldiers, he said. Residents say that during the 10-day quarantine they routinely bribed soldiers to let them through the barricades.

Former Liberian soldiers from the war say the episode shows that even with their own bloody history, they would do a better job.

''We just coming from 14 years of civil war, and you have a soldier without experience in war as the army chief of staff?'' said former Col. Richard Boyle, who served in the Liberian Army during the Doe and Taylor years, arguing that disbanded members of the old army should be reinstated.

But the war memories remain fresh, even among the new crop of soldiers. While General Ziankahn has the ramrod bearing of a military man, his second in command, Col. Prince C. Johnson III, is slighter, quicker to smile, and appears very approachable.

But he has a rather glaring issue -- his name. Another Prince Johnson, also an officer in the Liberian armed forces, splintered off from Mr. Taylor in 1990 to form his own group of rebels. They eventually abducted and killed President Doe, videotaping themselves slicing off his ear while Prince Johnson watched, drinking a Budweiser from a chair as an assistant patted off his sweat with a towel.

So when people see Colonel Johnson's name on his uniform, they blanch, even though, at 38, he was only 14 when the elder Prince Johnson killed the president.

''Yeah, I know,'' Colonel Johnson said. Then he laughed. ''Because of that, my son is not named Prince. He is Philip.''

ONE feature of the tragic case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first traveler known to have carried the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus into the United States, rankles me as a physician: Even if every system in place to identify suspected carriers had been working perfectly, he may have still set off a mini-epidemic in Dallas.

Mr. Duncan, recall, was screened before his flight and found to have a normal temperature. Asked specifically about exposures, he denied any contact with the ill. On Sept. 25, when he first presented to the emergency room with a fever, he was discharged. He returned three days later with fulminant infection. But the fact remains that even if Mr. Duncan had been identified and isolated at the first visit, it may have been too late. He had probably been exuding the virus for days.

In the wake of the Duncan case, three strategies to contain the entry and spread of Ebola in the United States have been proposed. The first suggests drastic restrictions on travel from Ebola-affected nations. The second involves screening travelers from Ebola-affected areas with a thermometer, which the federal government is beginning to do at selected airports. The third proposes the isolation of all suspected symptomatic patients and monitoring or quarantining everyone who came into contact with them.

Yet all these strategies have crucial flaws. In the absence of any established anti-viral treatment, we may need to rethink the concept of quarantine itself.

“Quarantine” sounds like a medieval concept because it is. Invented in the mid-1300s to stop the bubonic plague, the word derives from the Italian for “40 days,” the time used to isolate potential carriers. Although the practice of quarantine has been reformed over the centuries, pitfalls remain. They are especially evident during this epidemic.

An indiscriminate ban on travel would make it impossible for aid workers to reach the most widely affected areas, obviously deepening the medical and humanitarian crisis. It would also encourage subversion: Travelers might pass through other countries, confounding efforts to track their origin.

Screening travelers from affected areas using questionnaires and temperature may prove effective, but here, too, there are profound weaknesses. Low-grade fevers can easily be concealed with antipyretics like Tylenol. More important, by the time an Ebola carrier has a fever, he or she is already in an infectious phase and may have exposed many others to the virus.

Isolating symptomatic patients is certainly effective, but it will not work as a proactive strategy of containment. By that point, a carrier may have already infected dozens of people. Even when surveillance is well deployed, the collateral costs associated with it are forbidding. Between July 31 and mid-September, the New York City Department of Health received 57 calls reporting suspected infections based on fevers. Of these, only six merited further testing. Three cases were caused by malaria and one by anaplasmosis, and two were of unknown causes. Ebola was not found in any of the 57 cases.

There is a fourth strategy, although it will need to be evaluated and deployed carefully. Since the 1990s, novel methods have allowed doctors to detect viruses in the pre-symptomatic phase of an infection, often with remarkable sensitivity and precision. One of these involves the polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., a chemical reaction that amplifies pieces of a virus’s genes floating in blood by more than a millionfold, which is what makes early, pre-symptomatic infections identifiable. The technique is not particularly cumbersome: As an oncologist working with blood cancers, I have been using variants of it to detect subclinical infections in patients for nearly a decade.

A study in The Lancet, published in 2000, illustrates the power of this approach. Twenty-four “asymptomatic” individuals exposed to Ebola were tested using P.C.R. Eleven of the exposed patients eventually developed the infection. Seven of these 11 tested positive for the P.C.R. assay, while none of the other 13 did. In 2004, virologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further refined this method to increase its sensitivity. The test now requires only a teaspoon of blood. The sample is transported on ice to a centralized lab. Results are back in a few hours.

Technologies like this allow us to imagine a new form of quarantine. Rather than relying on primitive instruments, indiscriminate profiling or questionnaires, we should consider running a pilot program to test asymptomatic travelers using sensitive P.C.R.-based techniques. Obviously, such technologies are expensive, but the cost is not prohibitive. A typical P.C.R. reaction, including the labor, costs between $60 and $200 (we have already spent 100 times more disposing of the contaminated sheets from the apartment Mr. Duncan stayed in). Since the test takes about a third of the time of a trans-Atlantic flight, the flight would become the quarantine.

Enormous logistical questions would need to be solved. Where would such a screening test be administered — in Liberia or Sierra Leone or upon landing in the United States? Could we imagine a walking quarantine in which travelers were granted provisional entry, but recalled if they tested positive? What infection precautions would need to be in place for such testing? What forms of consent would be required? Who would bear the costs? Who exactly would be tested?

Despite these questions, we should develop a pilot program, perhaps targeting the worst-hit regions of the epidemic. Currently, immigrants to the United States are screened with blood tests and chest X-rays to detect preclinical tuberculosis. Testing nonimmigrant travelers is obviously a much larger endeavor, but a targeted program is worth the effort.

One major issue with this kind of rapid-testing quarantine is the phenomenon of false positives. But P.C.R.-based testing for Ebola has a low false-positive rate (three per 1,000), and its accuracy could be further improved by focusing on patients who come from particular geographic regions or by using more refined questionnaires. The second problem is false negatives: missing actual carriers of the infection. And yet, at four false negatives per 1,000, the detection rate might be sufficient to keep Ebola from becoming epidemic in the United States. Even the presence of such a testing and tracking system would act as a deterrent to those who wish to evade detection.

A rapid-testing quarantine would be expensive, but a pilot program might teach us much more about how to move forward. It certainly does not solve the civil liberties questions of quarantining, but it makes them vastly more palatable.

Ebola is an ingenious virus. To fight it, we need to be just as ingenious.

Ebola caught by hospital employee in Texas; Despite protective gear, employee gets virus after assisting Liberian victim

A hospital worker in Dallas who helped treat the Liberian man who died of Ebola last week has tested positive for the disease, even though the worker was wearing a gown, gloves, mask and other protective gear when coming into contact with the victim, officials said Sunday.

The hospital employee, a woman whom officials did not identify, worked at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday after returning from Liberia.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news conference on Sunday that the worker had extensive contact with Mr. Duncan on several occasions after his second visit and admission to the hospital on Sept. 28 — a time when hospital precautions presumably would have been heightened.

Taken with the recent case of a Spanish nurse who became infected with Ebola — though she, too, was wearing full protective gear while treating a patient suffering from the disease — the Dallas case raises stark questions about the measures being taken even in modern Western hospitals, and whether those hospitals are being as rigorous and systematic in their training, practices and supervision as the deadly disease requires.

Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, said Sunday that the American worker was wearing protective gear when she came into contact with Mr. Duncan, though Dr. Varga did not provide details.

‘‘This individual was following full C.D.C. precautions,’’ Dr. Varga said, referring to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding, ‘‘Gown, glove, mask and shield.’’ Asked how concerned he was that even after those precautions the worker tested positive, he replied, ‘‘We’re very concerned.’’

Dr. Frieden said that the latest report of infection indicated a clear breach of safety protocol.

‘‘Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola,’’ he said. Everyone who treated Mr. Duncan was now considered to be potentially exposed.

‘‘We’re deeply concerned about this new development,’’ Dr. Frieden said. ‘‘I think the fact that we don’t know of a breach in protocol is concerning because clearly there was a breach in protocol.’’

At an earlier news conference in Madrid, Fernando Simón, the Spanish Health Ministry’s coordinator of emergency alerts, said that while the condition of the infected nurse had improved slightly, a review of practices at the Carlos III hospital, where she worked, found a problem with the airlocks leading into an isolation ward.

‘‘The airlocks were set up to deal with highly infectious situations, but what hadn’t been foreseen was a need for bulky outfits to perform certain medical procedures in,’’ Mr. Simón said, according to The Associated Press. He added that the airlocks were not large enough for such protective apparel.

Health authorities have said they suspect the nurse may have accidentally touched her face with a gloved hand while removing protective gear in a small airlock.

The new Ebola case in Dallas, which the C.D.C. had not yet confirmed with its own tests of the hospital worker’s blood, immediately broadened the scope of the response by local officials, renewed fears of the spread of the disease in a city already on edge and raised questions about whether officials have failed to monitor a large enough pool of people potentially at risk.

The case also raises questions about whether the protective equipment recommended by the C.D.C. is adequate.

The protective gear is meant to keep the patient’s bodily fluids from coming into contact with health workers’ skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth. But even if the gear seals out the virus, it can become contaminated, and health workers can infect themselves if they remove it improperly — the greatest point of risk, specialists say.

The protective garb is supposed to be peeled off layer by layer according to a strict protocol, with a helper supervising and disinfecting parts of it at certain steps.

The C.D.C. has said that for health workers in the United States, gloves, gowns, masks and face shields or goggles would be protection enough. But many American health workers, seeing images of people in the hardest-hit African countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — encased in full-body hazardous-material suits, have requested similar gear.

Dr. Jack Chow, a professor of global health at Carnegie Mellon University and a former official at the World Health Organization, said the new case reinforced health workers’ concerns about the adequacy of the gear and the guidelines for using it. ‘‘Treating Ebola cases is hazardous duty,’’ he said.

Health officials have been monitoring 48 people in the Dallas area who may have come into direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan before he was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 28, including health care workers and Mr. Duncan’s relatives. But they said the woman who tested positive was not among those under observation, and she had been ‘‘self-monitoring’’ to check for symptoms of Ebola.

Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive, said the C.D.C. would work with the hospital to start checking on those people who had been self-monitoring.

Dallas officials urged residents to remain calm and reminded them that their risk of exposure was low. ‘‘You cannot contract Ebola other than from the bodily fluids of a symptomatic Ebola victim,’’ Mr. Jenkins said. ‘‘You cannot contract Ebola by walking by people on the street or by being around contacts who are not symptomatic. There’s nothing about this case that changes that basic premise of science.’’

Officials have moved swiftly to clean and decontaminate many of the places where the new Ebola patient had been, including the worker’s apartment complex and car. A hazardous-materials team with Dallas Fire and Rescue cleaned the common areas of her apartment complex, and the police were prohibiting access.

Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University, strongly endorsed the response of the Dallas authorities, saying on CNN: ‘‘This is a beautiful execution of a very thoroughly thought-through plan. I was very impressed. They were prepared for all of these contingencies and they moved on them very expeditiously.’’

On Saturday, however, relatives of Mr. Duncan, joined by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., the civil rights leader, denounced the treatment Mr. Duncan and his family had received from the hospital and from Texas officials, claiming he had been cremated without their knowledge and given substandard care because he was African.

Josephus Weeks, a nephew of Mr. Duncan’s, said his uncle had been ‘‘handled poorly, unfairly, and an injustice was done.’’

He and Mr. Duncan's mother, Nowai Gartay, asked why Mr. Duncan had not been taken to Nebraska Medical Center, where two Americans who contracted the disease in West Africa have been successfully treated. And they said Texas Health Presbyterian had not immediately informed them that Mr. Duncan had died.

Mr. Jackson said the other Ebola victims in the United States ‘‘came back to Atlanta and Nebraska, got quick treatment and early treatment, and their lives have been spared.’’

‘‘That did not happen with Eric Duncan,’’ he said.

U.S.
Dallas Nurse Infected With Ebola, Elevating Response and Anxiety

DALLAS — A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected despite wearing protective gear and to monitor additional places and people possibly at risk.

The news further stoked fears of health care workers across the country, many of whom have grown increasingly anxious about having to handle Ebola cases. The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas — four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian national who arrived in this country in September — opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.

While the new Ebola patient was not publicly identified, officials said that she was a nurse who had helped treat Mr. Duncan at a hospital here and that she may have violated safety protocols. It was the first confirmed instance of Ebola being transmitted in this country. Officials expanded the pool of people they had been monitoring, because the nurse had not been among the 48 health care workers, relatives of Mr. Duncan and others whom they were evaluating daily.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that health officials look more closely at the protective gear that nurses, doctors and hospital assistants use when treating Ebola patients. It also, for the first time, was considering the idea that patients with the virus should be transferred to hospitals with special containment units and experience in treating the disease. The Dallas hospital at the center of the two Ebola cases — Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, which sent Mr. Duncan home on Sept. 25 under the mistaken belief he had a sinus infection[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/sinusitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], only to have him return Sept. 28 when his conditions worsened — was facing renewed scrutiny over whether it had properly trained its workers.

The C.D.C. said it would conduct a nationwide training conference call on Tuesday for thousands of health care workers to ensure they would be fully prepared to treat a patient with Ebola.

“The care of Ebola patients can be done safely, but it’s hard to do it safely,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., told reporters Sunday. “Even a single, inadvertent innocent slip can result in contamination.”

The stricken nurse reported a low-grade fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] overnight Friday, officials said. It appeared that she drove herself to the emergency room of Presbyterian Hospital, where she worked, and was admitted and put in isolation 90 minutes later, the officials said.

She had extensive contact with Mr. Duncan on multiple occasions after his second visit and admission to the hospital on Sept. 28, Dr. Frieden said.

The nurse had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola, under a regimen prescribed by the C.D.C. Health officials will now investigate who had been in contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital on Sept. 28 and while he was in isolation, Dr. Frieden said.

Before her trip to the emergency room, officials said, the nurse had not been at work for two days. A preliminary blood test was done at the state public health lab in Austin and the positive result was received late Saturday evening, officials said. Late Sunday afternoon, the C.D.C. confirmed that she had Ebola after completing its own tests.

The woman was in stable condition on Sunday. Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told reporters on Sunday that the worker had worn protective gear when coming in contact with Mr. Duncan, although he did not detail the type of contact.“This individual was following full C.D.C. precautions,” Dr. Varga said, adding, “Gown, glove, mask and shield.” Asked how concerned he was that the worker tested positive despite the precautions, he replied, “We’re very concerned.”

Despite Dr. Varga’s reassurances about C.D.C. precautions having been followed, Dr. Frieden said it appeared the woman had breached safety protocol at the hospital, possibly when removing the protective gear. Speaking on the CBS program “Face the Nation” and later at a news conference, he said that questioning of the worker had not identified precisely how a breach occurred, and that the cause of her infection was not known. Dr. Frieden said everyone who treated Mr. Duncan was now considered to be potentially exposed and that other cases of Ebola were possible.

“We’re deeply concerned about this new development,” he said on the talk show.

The C.D.C. has said that for health workers in the United States, gloves, gowns, masks and face shields or goggles would be protection enough. But many health workers across the country, seeing images of people in Africa completely encased in full-body, hazardous-material suits, have requested similar protection.

“A lot of us are starting to get worried,” said Debra Buccellato, an emergency room nurse in Santa Rosa, Calif. “I’m a single mom so if I got sick there’d be a huge void.”

Ms. Buccellato, 38, said supervisors at her hospital had distributed information about C.D.C. guidelines, but added, “I have not seen any active training or practice drills, and I haven’t seen any new or upgraded personal protective equipment.”

She said she had emailed her manager to ask for more training, but said she was not sure that hazardous material suits were the best option for her 90-bed facility, Sutter Santa Rosa Hospital.

“I don’t know how realistic it is to go to that level when you have X amount of patients to take care of and time issues,” Ms. Buccellato said. For now, she said she planned to start wearing a face mask for her entire shift.

On Sunday, National Nurses United, the country’s largest union and professional association of nurses, continued to sound the alarm and call for hazardous material suits at all hospitals.

“I’m angry about this,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director. “We want the first line of defense to be the most prepared. Our hospitals are resisting us. The C.D.C. doesn’t say that we need hazmat suits. If this doesn’t change dramatically, we will picket every hospital in this country if we have to.”

Dr. Ken Anderson, the chief operating officer of the American Hospital Association’s research arm, said his organization was recommending that hospitals follow C.D.C. guidelines and was not providing suggestions of its own. “We rely on the policies and procedures that are found at every hospital,” he said. “Their own best internal education is what’s going to make that most effective.”

President Obama on Sunday directed the C.D.C. to expedite its investigation into how the health care worker contracted the deadly virus, according to a White House statement.

In an indication that the White House was taking steps in advance of any possible spread of the disease, Mr. Obama also directed federal officials to make sure that hospitals and health workers across the nation “are prepared to follow protocols should they encounter an Ebola patient,” the statement said. Mr. Obama was briefed by Lisa Monaco, the president’s assistant for homeland security, and then spoke by telephone with Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services.

While there have been other patients with Ebola treated in the United States in recent weeks, the nurse is only the second person — after Mr. Duncan — whose condition was diagnosed in the United States. All of the other patients — including medical personnel, relief workers and journalists — received a diagnosis while working in West Africa near Ebola victims and were brought to this country for treatment.

Four hospitals in the United States — Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Mont. — have highcontainment units for isolating patients with dangerous infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and medical teams at those facilities have conducted extensive training and drills for dealing with pathogens like Ebola.

But in Dallas on Sunday, officials were trying to persuade residents to remain calm and reminded them that their risk of exposure was low.

“You cannot contract Ebola other than from the bodily fluids of a symptomatic Ebola victim,” said County Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive, who himself has had close contact with those who lived with Mr. Duncan. “You cannot contract Ebola by walking by people on the street or by being around contacts who are not symptomatic. There’s nothing about this case that changes that basic premise of science.”

City officials moved swiftly to clean and decontaminate many of the places where the nurse had been or had even briefly touched, including her apartment in a complex on Marquita Avenue, the complex’s common areas and the car she took to the hospital. Police officers were prohibiting access to her apartment. Officials believe the woman’s pet dog was inside the apartment, but was doing fine.

“We have a plan in place to take care of the pet, and we do not believe that pet has any signs, and we’ll move accordingly later today,” Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas said.

Remaining calm was easier said than done for many of the woman’s neighbors. Early Sunday morning, city officials knocked on the doors of nearby homes and called residences in the four blocks surrounding the complex to inform people that someone who lived in the neighborhood had tested positive for Ebola.

At the hospital, the car the woman arrived in was decontaminated and secured so no one could come near it, officials said. “We decontaminated hand-railings, everything in the parking lot, so everybody can feel comfortable that the exterior was taken care of,” Mr. Rawlings said.

The hospital also took the unusual step on Sunday of prohibiting ambulances from bringing new patients into its emergency room. Officials said the hospital was open, but said they had decided to put the emergency room on so-called diversion status because of staff limitations. “While we are on diversion we are also using this time to further expand the margin of safety by triple-checking our full compliance with updated C.D.C. guidelines,” hospital officials said in a statement. “We are also continuing to monitor all staff who had some relation to Mr. Duncan’s care even if they are not assumed to be at significant risk of infection.”

Reporting was contributed by Denise Grady and Jack Healy from Dallas; Sabrina Tavernise, Mark Landler and Emmarie Huetteman from Washington; and Pam Belluck from New York.

U.S.
For Infected Nurse’s Neighbors, Ebola Brings Worry to Doorstep

DALLAS — Carleen and Ed Guerrero were asleep when two police officers rapped on their door at 5 a.m. on Sunday to tell them that the Ebola virus had come to their leafy neighborhood just north of downtown.

One of their neighbors, a nurse from the beige-brick apartment building just down the street, had tested positive for Ebola, and hazardous-materials crews were cleaning her apartment building, officials told the couple.

It was, to say the least, unsettling news. For the past week, Mr. Guerrero had fielded worried phone calls from far-flung relatives, but reassured them that Dallas was a city of 1.2 million people and that he and his wife did not have the slightest connection to the disease.

The couple said they were still not worried about their health or safety, but no longer felt so distant from the virus that has dominated the news here. “It’s so close to home,” Ms. Guerrero said.

On Sunday, for the second time in two weeks, Ebola transformed part of this city into a scene of concern and contamination.

A biohazard barrel sat outside the apartment building where hazardous-materials crews had spent the morning. Police officers stood guard on the streets. The mayor paid a visit. Neighbors woke to Ebola-information pamphlets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on their doorsteps, and to another day of uneasy questions, this time about how a hospital worker who treated the Liberian man who died last week of Ebola could have been infected despite wearing protective gloves, a gown and mask.

“We’re waiting and seeing what’s going to happen next,” said Jennifer Staubach Gates, a City Council member whose district includes the apartment complex where the Liberian victim, Thomas Eric Duncan, had been visiting his fiancée when he fell ill and first went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25. “It’s just another level of this crisis that we’re having to deal with now.”

Texas Health Presbyterian, which treated the Liberian man and is now caring for the nurse, announced on Sunday that it was prohibiting ambulances from bringing in new, non-Ebola cases. The hospital said it was taking the step because of limited staff capacity.

Across Dallas, people still crowded coffee shops and brunch spots, farmers’ markets and the state fair on Sunday, but after public officials appeared on live television on Sunday morning to announce this city’s second Ebola case, concerns about Ebola and the response to it were never far from people’s minds.

And in Dallas’s M Streets neighborhood, a quiet area of brick Tudor homes and restaurants, those worries had come to their front doors. As they walked their dogs and wandered outside in pajamas, most residents on Sunday said they were rattled but not overly concerned about the case in their neighborhood. One woman said she was considering heading to her mother’s house for the night. Another woman, Heather Davis, who had been jogging to the gym, stopped at the scene and called her boyfriend, suddenly concerned about whether the nurse could have gone to her gym and used the same equipment. “It’s now traveled to within three blocks of me,” Ms. Davis said.

But Terry Pulling, who said she had been a nurse in the early days of the AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic, said fear and paranoia spread much more easily than the virus itself.

“You’re just not going to breathe it in,” she said.

None of the neighbors said they knew the woman who had been infected, and officials did not identify her, saying her family had asked for privacy. But even people who had never walked down the block on Marquita Avenue said the realization of the disease’s proximity to their homes had changed how they viewed the disease.

“I was freaked out,” said Michelle McCoy, 23, who lives a few streets down and stopped along the tree-lined street on Sunday afternoon to look at the clusters of police cars and phalanx of television cameras aimed at the building. “It really brings it home.”

Her friend Nicole Broome, 24, a dietitian at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said Mr. Duncan’s case had made health care workers across the city more vigilant, and she doubted that the disease had the potential to spread here. Still, she said that she felt a tremor[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/tremor/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of uneasiness when treating a patient who was feverish or nauseated, and that the hospital worker’s infection at Presbyterian showed the limits of gloves, masks and other measures to guard against Ebola.

“It could be anything,” she said. “It could be as simple as what piece of clothing you removed first.”

Neither of the women knew the hospital worker who was being treated in isolation for Ebola, but they said they admired her. “She stepped up to take care of this patient,” Ms. McCoy said. “Everyone else wants to run away. I guess we should just pray for her.”

U.S.
C.D.C. Will Offer More Ebola Training to Health Care Workers

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Sunday that the agency would take new steps to help hospital workers protect themselves, providing more training and urging hospitals to run drills to practice dealing with potential Ebola patients.

In response to the news that a health care worker in Dallas had contracted Ebola, a spokeswoman said the agency would also issue more specific instructions and explanations for putting on and removing protective equipment and would urge nurses and doctors to enlist a co-worker or “buddy” to watch them do so.

“Certainly this event has given us all a wake-up call that we really need to make sure that front-line health care workers are fully prepared to handle a patient with Ebola,” said Abbigail Tumpey, a spokeswoman for the agency. “Every U.S. health care facility needs to have the capability to initially handle a case. Even if the patient is going to be transferred to another facility, they need to be able to handle the first moments.”

The agency will conduct a nationwide training conference call for health care workers on Tuesday. And in New York City on Oct. 21, it will co-sponsor training for 5,000 people, including nurses, emergency technicians and environmental health workers, that will be streamed live to hospitals across the country.

The agency will also urge hospitals to conduct full-scale drills in which people pretending to be Ebola patients enter the hospital, forcing unsuspecting staff members to run through the process of diagnosis, isolation and potential treatment. Several hospitals have conducted such drills, and some have found holes in their systems, Ms. Tumpey said.

“We have told hospitals we will assist them with drills,” she said. “Our goal is to have at least one facility in every state that is thoroughly trained to manage one of these cases.”

Ms. Tumpey said the agency was not, for now, changing its recommendation that doctors and nurses wear standard personal protective equipment: gloves, waterproof gown, face mask and eye covering. She said that it would review whether to recommend full-body coverings or hazardous-material suits, but that there could be greater risks of infection associated with taking such suits off, especially when people are not used to wearing them regularly.

A higher priority is to make sure that health care workers are properly trained in using the standard protection.

“Following the protocols is one thing; appropriately implementing them is another,” Ms. Tumpey said. “A minor breach could potentially expose a person.”

Dr. Ken Anderson, chief operating officer of the American Hospital Association’s research arm, said his organization was recommending that hospitals follow C.D.C. guidelines and was not providing specific suggestions of its own. “We rely on the policies and procedures that are found at every hospital,” he said. “Their own best internal education is what’s going to make that most effective.”

For example, the association has not urged every hospital to conduct drills, because “we have any number of hospitals that have a variety of ways of educating their staff,” he said.

Ms. Tumpey said the disease agency might re-evaluate the best protective gear to recommend, but she said past experience with American hospitals had informed its recommendation on standard protection. For example, she said, in 2008, a Colorado hospital using standard precautions dealt successfully with a woman who returned from a Ugandan safari having contracted Marburg fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], another deadly virus. The staff there even performed surgery on the woman, removing her gall bladder, Ms. Tumpey said.

For now, she said, the agency is planning to “make our recommendations easier to understand” regarding standard protective equipment. The Dallas case “is going to only increase the fear of front-line health care workers to manage these situations,” she said. “We have our job cut out for us to assure them.”

Leaning Forward, MSNBC Loses Ground to Rival CNN

Rachel Maddow[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/rachel_maddow/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the biggest star on the MSNBC cable network, just posted her lowest quarterly ratings results ever.

“Morning Joe,” MSNBC’s signature morning program, scored its second-lowest quarterly ratings, reaching an average of just 87,000 viewers in the key news demographic group.

And “Ronan Farrow Daily,” the network’s heavily promoted new afternoon show, which stars a 26-year-old Rhodes Scholar with a high-profile Hollywood lineage, has been largely a dud.

Though it has mostly happened quietly, which may be a comment on the cable network’s larger status in the media landscape, MSNBC has seen its ratings hit one of the deepest skids in its history, with the recently completed third quarter of 2014 generating some record lows.

Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, acknowledged that his network had been struggling, but put it in the context of the overall drop in cable news. “This has been a tough year all around,” he said. “All three cable news channels are drawing a smaller combined audience than they were five years ago.” He also emphasized that despite the plunge that caused it to trail CNN in the last quarter, the network remained ahead of CNN for the full year.

In the past, MSNBC’s ratings have typically fallen during times of intensely followed major news events. The current period is awash in them, with stories like ISIS and Ebola commanding a high degree of international reporting. This plays well to CNN’s strengths.

MSNBC consciously established its brand as politics-centric, approaching stories from a left-of-center viewpoint, in deliberate contrast to the right-of-center approach of Fox News, which continues to dominate the news channel ratings. At the same time, MSNBC moved away from a close relationship with NBC News that it had during the early years of the network. Today, fewer NBC News correspondents appear on MSNBC.

Mr. Griffin said that a general apathy about American politics has also hurt the network. “You can look at the dysfunction in Washington, the wariness about politics, the low approval ratings,” he said. “That’s had an impact. But we’ve got to adjust; we’ve got to evolve.”

MSNBC’s recent results have not been encouraging. During the third quarter, Ms. Maddow reached an average of 183,000 viewers in the audience component that most matters to MSNBC’s advertisers, viewers between the ages of 25 and 54, her lowest total since she started her show in 2008.

More worrying is the slide for “Morning Joe,” which has, for much of its time on the air, enjoyed status as one of the most talked-about shows in media industry circles. Now the heat around the show seems to have dissipated. For four straight months, and six of the last eight, “Morning Joe” has trailed CNN’s new morning entry, “New Day.”

One longtime news executive who has worked for both network and cable news organizations said the problem with “Morning Joe” was partly a broader issue with MSNBC. “ ‘Morning Joe’ has been hurt because no one is tuning in to watch the channel now; they go right by,” he said. “The show took its eye off the ball, but you can’t discount the fact that nobody is watching the channel.”

The executive, who asked not to be identified because of potential future business with MSNBC, said Ms. Maddow remains a draw, but her format has grown tired. “In terms of Rachel, everybody knows every night what she’s going to say,” he said. “The network just doesn’t surprise you.”

MSNBC’s other numbers are no prettier. Over all in prime time, MSNBC, which for years had squashed CNN head-to-head on weeknights, has recently dropped consistently behind that network. The falloff over the last five years is stark. In the first quarter of 2009, MSNBC averaged 392,000 viewers in the 25-54 demographic for its weeknight lineup. In the third quarter of this year, the number was down to 125,000.

The network’s newest prime-time host, Chris Hayes, also hit a low in the third quarter, averaging 129,000 viewers in the 25-54 category, his worst since his show began in the second quarter of 2013.

The median age of the MSNBC viewer has also ticked upward. Five years ago it was 58; now it is 61. CNN has edged down a bit, from 62 five years ago to 59. Fox News has aged from 65 to 68.

On Monday and Friday of last week, only one MSNBC show all day, “Hardball” with Chris Matthews, even topped 100,000 viewers in that 25-54 group. And the daytime numbers are much worse. Mr. Farrow’s show averaged just 45,000 viewers in the preferred group, down 51 percent from other programming in the same slot last year.

Some of the losses at MSNBC reflect a drift away from cable news channels in general, as Mr. Griffin noted. Over the last five years, Fox News and CNN are both down 13 percent in total audience in prime time; MSNBC is down 21 percent. Fox has little to worry about because its numbers so dwarf the others. CNN has responded with a new strategy that mixes its traditional hard news approach with a regular lineup of pre-produced original series. It had a major success last week with the latest of them, “Somebody’s Gotta Do It,” with Mike Rowe.

As for MSNBC, Mr. Griffin remained optimistic despite the challenges. He defended the network’s approach, but also hinted that it had to broaden its programming beyond politics.

“We have a good brand, a strong brand,” he said. “But we’ve got to get outside Washington and open up our aperture a little.”

First Draft
If Cuts Could Kill: Democrats Fight Back on Ebola

The public health panic spreading around Ebola has now infected both political parties and generated a finger-pointing policy debate just weeks before the midterm elections.

For a week, Republicans have advocated pulling up the drawbridge and severely limiting — if not eliminating — flights from West Africa, accusing President Obama of complicity in a looming epidemic for failing to take their advice.

Now Democrats have joined the fray, blaming Republican budget-cutting for the government’s failure to prepare for or even cure Ebola. A little-known liberal group, the Agenda Project Action Fund, unveiled a 60-second advertisement[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3D0DxjgPB0] on Monday that it says will run in Kentucky. It includes gruesome images of dead and dying West Africans.

“Republican cuts kill,” the ad says to the sound of breathing through a respirator. “Vote.”

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3D0DxjgPB0]]

Since the West Africa Ebola outbreak grabbed the public’s attention, Republicans have had the political field to themselves. They have largely lumped imagery of the rampaging virus with other frightening video clips[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/us/politics/republican-strategy-midterm-elections.html] of Islamic State fighters, illegal border crossings and terrorism to perpetuate a sense of dread ahead of the Nov. 4 midterms.

The liberal response has just begun. Democrats are noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has had its budgets cut by $585 million since 2010. The National Institutes of Health have not had real budget increases since 2003, before across-the-board “sequestration” cuts siphoned off $446 million.

And in recent days, the debate has turned toward policy. Last Wednesday, 27 House members — including three Democrats — wrote to Mr. Obama, asking him to impose a complete travel ban and visa restrictions for citizens of West African countries battling the epidemic.

BACK STORY

Fighters with the Islamic State group have spent the last month trying to capture the Syrian town of Kobani, despite U.S.-led airstrikes targeting them.

Capturing the town would give the militants full control of a long stretch of the border with Turkey, something Turkey urgently wants to avoid.

But nearby Turkish troops and tanks have been standing idle.

That’s because Kobani’s population is Kurdish, and Turkey’s president is afraid of strengthening the Kurds.

He knows that Kobani’s fall would set the Syrian Kurds back in their quest for autonomy.

And he hopes that it would discourage restive Kurds in Turkey, thousands of whom died in a separatist guerrilla campaign that lasted decades[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/world/europe/kurdish-rebel-group-to-withdraw-from-turkey.html].

Rebel commanders involved in that fight have threatened[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/world/middleeast/kurdish-rebels-assail-turkish-inaction-on-isis-as-peril-to-peace-talks.html] to resume their battle within Turkey if the government does not help save Kobani.

Good evening.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Time-honored tactic.

Cornel West, the activist and professor, was among the dozen or so protesters arrested[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/st-louis-protests.html] today in Ferguson, Mo., bringing the anger against law enforcement there back into focus.

He was just the latest recognizable figure to put his prominence in the service of civil disobedience, “a surefire way to bring attention to the cause,” says Adam Nagourney, our national correspondent.

“Few media outlets can resist the image of a public figure in handcuffs,” he says.

The shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent violent showdown in the streets captured the nation’s attention for weeks.

But in a busy season of news, the media moved on to other stories, like Ebola and the fight against ISIS.

So an event like today’s “can be particularly valuable,” Mr. Nagourney says, “presenting a fresh news hook to media organizations that are looking for one.”

• The line of duty.

“It’s hard to use this stuff right. It’s not just putting on a gown and you’re safe.”

That’s Elisabeth Rosenthal, our national correspondent and a former emergency room doctor, on how protective gear can’t guarantee the safety of those treating patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola.

Health officials said today that they needed to “rethink”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/dallas-nurse-ebola-patient.html] the way Ebola control was handled, after a nurse in Dallas contracted the disease from a patient who later died.

But, Ms. Rosenthal says, “it’s hard to insulate yourself totally from risk.”

Medical workers are exposed to all kinds of things. “You get a lot of colds,” she says, and there are many more potent dangers: tuberculosis, or getting stuck by a needle infected with H.I.V.

Plus, with Ebola, the learning curve is steep. Even a failure as simple as giving into an impulse to scratch an itch could have harmful consequences, she says.

“One mistake can be really, really dangerous in these situations.”

• “Agency capture.”

That’s what happens when regulators are more concerned with the well-being of the companies they are supposed to monitor than that of the general public.

Critics accuse regulators of that all the time, says our reporter Matthew L. Wald.

The latest case is the basis of one of our best-read stories today, a report[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/business/highway-guardrail-may-be-deadly-states-say.html] on how the Federal Highway Safety Agency has continued to allow the use of a redesigned guardrail despite evidence that it effectively turns into a spear when hit head-on.

“A lot of the decisions these agencies make are too obscure to attract much public attention,” Mr. Wald says of the regulators.

But the commercial interests that have a stake in the outcome are actively engaged, he says.

“Companies file comments, show up at hearings and generally work hard to try to get the rules written in ways they like.”

Calculating the Grim Economic Costs of Ebola Outbreak

The topic everyone on Wall Street is discussing urgently but quietly isn’t the volatile stock market.

It is Ebola.

While thousands of health care workers seek to control the deadly virus in West Africa, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and other medical professionals seek to prevent its outbreak in the United States, financial analysts and others have been trying to estimate — or “model,” in Wall Street parlance — the potential effect on the global economy.

The math is not pretty.

The most authoritative model, at the moment, suggests a potential economic drain of as much as $32.6 billion by the end of 2015 if “the epidemic spreads into neighboring countries” beyond Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to a recent study by the World Bank[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

That estimate is considered a worst-case scenario, but it does not account for any costs beyond the next 18 months, nor does it assume a global pandemic.

Over the weekend, the topic of Ebola was front and center at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and World Bank in Washington, where central bankers, world leaders and some of Wall Street’s senior executives held a series of meetings and dinners.

Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., was seen wearing a button that read: “Isolate Ebola, Not Countries.” She implored the audience: “We should be very careful not to terrify the planet in respect of the whole of Africa.”

That’s because the economic cost of fear, far more than medical costs, may be the most expensive outcome.

“Economic consequences also result when fear and concern change behavior,” David R. Kotok, the chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, wrote in a report late last week, addressing the potential fallout on gross domestic products. “If consumers and businesses retrench by reducing flights on airplanes, changing vacation plans or altering business connections in a globally interdependent world, G.D.P. growth rates will fall farther. We do not know how much, at what speed, or for how long.”

Shares of airline stocks like United[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/united_airlines/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and American fell on Monday as some investors began to worry about the prospect of travel bans for airlines from West Africa to Europe and the United States.

Andrew Zarnett, an analyst at Deutsche Bank[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=DB&inline=nyt-org], wrote a recent report that examined the potential effects of Ebola and compared it to the economic toll of the SARS epidemic, which cost Asian airlines about $6 billion[https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/Documents/economics/Avian-Flu-Impact.pdf] in 2003.

“History has shown us that should the Ebola epidemic spread domestically, it will have a significant impact on the airline and the entire hospitality sector,” he wrote, according to FXStreet[http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?storyid=835ff834-3750-4359-96cc-2cd7ff353385], a financial news service.

And nobody has yet fully calculated the numbers on the cost to the health care system: training, testing, treatment, waste disposal — and all the hospital beds that are sitting unused in isolation areas. (Perversely enough, many of the health care costs could conceivably help that industry in the short term because additional money is being spent.)

Of course, the greatest economic danger is in the economic isolation of countries. “By default or design, it really is an economic embargo,” Kaifala Marah, finance minister of Sierra Leone, said over the weekend about his country, which has been all but cut off from the outside world.

The newest estimates about the economic cost of Ebola, conducted by John Panzer and Francisco Ferreira of the World Bank, may be the deepest look at the problem by any analyst or economist. The report notes that in the very short term, assuming that the spread of Ebola is contained, the economic costs should be low, about $359 million.

The study gets more worrying as the authors examine the economic prospects 18 months out.

The authors developed the “Ebola Impact Index.” As one of their advisers, Marcelo Giugale[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcelo-giugale/the-economic-impact-of-eb_b_5951458.html], senior director of the World Bank’s global practice for macroeconomics and fiscal management, wrote of the index: “It roughly tells you how likely countries in Africa, Europe and the U.S. are to be affected by Ebola. They then used some pretty sophisticated statistical tools to model the economic links between West Africa and the rest of the world. And finally, they built two ‘scenarios’ for how governments and people might behave.”

One scenario contemplates containment of the virus with no more than 20,000 cases. That’s the good version. The bad version is this: Governments make a series of mistakes that lead to 200,000 cases of Ebola.

It is that scenario that they estimate would cost $32.6 billion. (This may sound cynical, but that is still lower than one-quarter of Apple’s annual revenue.)

“What makes all this very interesting is that the final economic toll of Ebola will not be driven by the direct costs of the disease itself — expensive drugs, sick employees and busy caregivers. It will be driven by how much those who are not infected trust their governments,” Mr. Giugale wrote.

Wall Street has long built spreadsheets trying to estimate employment, economic growth figures and the values of businesses. But the economic variables of a true pandemic are almost incalculable. It becomes a series of guesstimates about the psychology of global citizens.

Right now, the economic challenges of the outbreak of Ebola are minimal. Let’s hope they remain that way.

With Electronic Medical Records, Doctors Read When They Should Talk

Will history someday show that the electronic medical record almost did the great state of Texas in?

We do not really know whether dysfunctional software contributed to last month’s debacle[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html] in a Dallas emergency room, when some medical mind failed to connect the dots between an African man and a viral syndrome and sent a patient with deadly Ebola back into the community. Even scarier than that mistake, though, is the certainty that similar ones lie in wait for all of us who cope with medical information stored in digital piles grown so gigantic, unwieldy and unreadable that sometimes we wind up working with no information at all.

We are in the middle of a simmering crisis in medical data management. Like computer servers everywhere, hospital servers store great masses of trivia mixed with valuable information and gross misinformation, all cut and pasted and endlessly reiterated. Even the best software is no match for the accumulation. When we need facts, we swoop over the surface like sea gulls over landfill, peck out what we can, and flap on. There is no time to dig and, even worse, no time to do what we were trained to do — slow down, go to the source, and start from the beginning.

On the hospital wards, mixed messages abound. A couple of months ago, I was on the receiving end of a furious, expletive-laden outburst from one sick patient, the printable fraction of which ran, “Can’t you people read?”

This man had by then recounted the long story of his bad leg to three separate teams of doctors and nurses. I was the 14th interrogator by my count, and despite my standard opening gambit (“I know you’ve been over this before”) I was the one to flip his switch: The patient ordered me and my team out of his room and pulled the covers over his head.

Who can blame him for assuming that in this day and age, once told, his story needed only to be retweeted. But medical care requires dialogue. Although we plucked some information from the glut of words in his chart and cobbled together a plan, we didn’t do him justice, not by a long shot.

The fact is that even if all the redundant clinical information sitting on hospital servers everywhere were error-free, and even if excellent software made it all reasonably accessible, doctors and nurses still shouldn’t be spending their time reading.

The first thing medical students learn is the value of a full history taken directly from the patient. The process takes them hours. Experience whittles that time down by a bit, but it always remains a substantial chunk that some feel is best devoted to more lucrative activities.

Enter various efficiency-promoting endeavors. One of the most durable has been the multipage health questionnaire for patients to complete on a clipboard before most outpatient visits. Why should the doctor expensively scribble down information when the patient can do a little free secretarial work instead?

Alas, beware the doctor who does not review that questionnaire with you very carefully, taking an active interest in every little check mark. It turns out that the pathway into the medical brain, like most brains, is far more reliable when it runs from the hand than from the eye. Force the doctor to take notes, and the doctor will usually remember. Ask the doctor to read, and the doctor will scan, skip, elide, omit and often forget.

The same problem dogs other efforts to reduce the doctor’s mundane history-taking responsibilities. For instance: Why not leave it to the nursing staff to ask all those dull questions about smoking, drinking, social activities and recent travel? They will write it all down. The doctors will review.

And then the next thing you know, that unimportant background information explodes all over the nightly news, because the doctors failed to review, or failed to remember what they reviewed, and key travel details simmered unnoticed in the bowels of some user-unfriendly electronic medical record.

Over and over again we are forced to admire the old traditions. As we tell the students, it’s not that complicated. You say hello, you sit down, and you have a conversation.

A few months after our expletive-spewing patient got better and went home, our team went to see a more cooperative young man admitted to the hospital with a fever. This one had gotten sick after a camping trip in California, and the words “camping” and “California” were repeated over and over again in his chart, escalating into the general conviction that he had come down with a serious fungal infection that can be acquired from the soil in some parts of Southern California.

If this patient had refused to talk to us, we might have been tempted to treat him for that infection, which would have been a big mistake. Fortunately, he politely led us through his entire hike, which proved to have skirted the habitat of this fungus by hundreds of miles. We could tell his other doctors to stop focusing on his travels and pay attention to his heart murmur instead, the real clue to his problems.

Like good police work, good medicine depends on deliberate, inefficient, plodding, expensive repetition. No system of data management will ever replace it.

Ask Well: Ebola on Airplanes, Ebola in Sneezes

Q. I’m flying soon. What is the risk of contracting Ebola on a flight?

A. Not high. Top Ebola experts have said they would not expect to be infected even if they were sitting next to another passenger with Ebola – unless that passenger actually vomited or bled on them. Patrick Sawyer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/africa/ebola-in-nigeria.html], the Liberian-American who brought the virus to Nigeria in July, was so sick he had to be helped off the plane in Lagos. He had vomited while on board. There were about 200 passengers on the plane, according to Nigerian health authorities, and not one of them got infected.

Q. Isn’t the virus airborne if a sneeze can move it three feet? What is the likelihood that Ebola will mutate into an airborne virus?

A. Although both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention take the position that Ebola is not transmitted through the air, scientists are publicly battling, on news websites[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/opinion/what-were-afraid-to-say-about-ebola.html] and science websites[http://www.virology.ws/2014/09/18/what-we-are-not-afraid-to-say-about-ebola-virus/] over whether it is possible in rare cases — or could become possible if the virus mutates.

Much has been made of two small studies in which the virus appeared to have passed through the air between monkey cages[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2895%2992841-3/abstract] or between pigs and monkeys caged above them[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/srep/2012/121115/srep00811/full/srep00811.html]. It does appear, some scientists argued, as if prolonged exposure to airborne droplets under laboratory conditions might pass the disease. However, others argued[http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20121116.1412991] that transmission might be an accident of cage cleaning, feeding or urine splashes.

Also, in 1989, 100 rhesus monkeys shipped from the Philippines to a government research lab in Reston, Va., started an outbreak[http://ispub.com/IJPRM/2/1/12768] of a variant of Ebola that does not harm humans. Ultimately, to stop the outbreak, all 600 monkeys in the building were killed. Some scientists who worked there believe the virus spread between cages and perhaps even between rooms when monkeys sneezed or coughed.

There are two kinds of airborne transmission. An infectious dose of measles, smallpox or chickenpox virus can be contained in a droplet small enough to hang in the air, so the next person to walk through that “sneeze cloud” catches it, or the disease transmits through ventilation systems. Influenza is thought to need bigger doses in larger droplets that fly as far as six feet but then fall to the floor.

No human airborne transmission of Ebola has been confirmed, even though there have been multiple outbreaks in Africa since 1976, and many crowded places – like minibus taxis – providing opportunities.

If Ebola was transmitted like influenza, experts point out, an outbreak would echo the spread pattern of the 2009 flu pandemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/world/asia/12flu.html], and by now there would be millions of cases around the globe.

Ebola does not typically cause sneezing or coughing and saliva does not normally build up large viral loads until late in the disease. But because patients can cough vomitus or blood, or vomit violently, caregivers routinely wear masks and goggles.

No one can say exactly what the likelihood is that the virus will mutate to definitively become airborne, but it is not thought likely. No virus has ever been known to change its mode of transmission. H.I.V. mutates incredibly rapidly — as much in one day as flu does in a year, according to C.D.C. scientists, and H.I.V. has not become airborne.

Since Ebola is good at finding hosts, it is under no great Darwinian pressure to change. On the contrary, since human Ebola victims die so fast that they can’t spread it to many others, the more likely change is for the virus to become milder so victims live longer.

Airborne viruses have surface proteins that attach to cells in the nose and throat. Imagine throwing magnetized BB’s into a cast-iron pipe; all would stick. Ebola, lacking those proteins, is like marbles, falling down the pipe into the gut, where it attaches. It may take a lot of mutation to do the equivalent of changing a marble into a magnetic BB.

W.H.O. Chief Calls Ebola Outbreak a ‘Crisis for International Peace’

GENEVA — The Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa is “unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times,” Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org], said Monday.

Dr. Chan, who dealt with the 2009 avian flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] pandemic and the SARS outbreaks of 2002-3, said the Ebola outbreak had progressed from a public health crisis to “a crisis for international peace and security.”

“I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries,” she said. “I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.”

More than 4,000 people have died from the Ebola virus, all but a handful of them in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to W.H.O. estimates issued last week, although Dr. Chan declined to expand on those figures because they were still rising “exponentially.”

Instead, in a statement delivered on her behalf to a conference in the Philippine capital of Manila and released by her office in Geneva, Dr. Chan drew a number of lessons from the outbreak. Most notably, she emphasized “the dangers of the world’s growing social and economic inequalities.”

“The rich get the best care,” she said. “The poor are left to die.”

Ebola emerged 40 years ago, and, Dr. Chan said, there were no vaccines or other remedies because it has traditionally been confined to poor African countries. A profit-driven pharmaceutical industry had no incentive to make products for countries that could not pay, she said.

The risks of neglecting health care in developing countries are global, Dr. Chan said, adding that “when a deadly and dreaded virus hits the destitute and spirals out of control, the whole world is put at risk.”

Moreover, she said, inadequate health care means that the kind of shocks the world is experiencing with greater frequency — including extreme weather events resulting from climate change, armed conflict or “a disease run wild” — could “bring a fragile country to its knees.”

A second lesson drawn from the crisis was that “rumors and panic are spreading faster than the virus, and this costs money,” Dr. Chan said, noting a World Bank estimate that 90 percent of the economic costs of any outbreak “come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection.”

The final message she wanted to deliver, however, was that “the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained and threatening public health emergency.”

The international health regulations review committee of the W.H.O. had reached that conclusion five years ago after the avian flu pandemic, Dr. Chan said, and the Ebola virus outbreak showed that it was “spot on.”
