On a Monday evening last month in Liberia, at Grand Gedeh County’s main hospital, two nurses knocked on a patient’s door. The patient was being treated for malaria and typhoid, but had also recently tested positive for Ebola — though he didn’t know it yet. I was doing training on Ebola at the hospital, and had seen him from a distance just that morning. He smiled and gave me a thumbs up.

Dressed in their full Ebola combat gear — body suit, apron, head cover, face mask, goggles, face shield, boots and rubber gloves — the nurses tried to avoid alarming him by saying that they needed to take him to Monrovia, 300 miles to the northwest, for further testing. Then they walked him to an ambulance and began driving to their actual destination, the newly constructed Ebola treatment unit in the neighboring county of Bong.

On a road anywhere in the West, it would take less than four hours to cover the 190-mile trip. But the Liberian roads, especially in the rainy season, are deadly traps of red mud, riddled with craters sometimes as deep as a car. Add to this drivers’ testosterone and you soon have trucks and cars stuck in all directions.

This was the situation the nurses and their patient found themselves in after two hours of driving. It was midnight, pouring rain, and their only option was to wait until morning. Despite being drenched with sweat, the nurses could not risk removing their protective suits. The patient seemed to be getting a little sicker now, his eyes bloodshot and his temperature rising. During the night, they helped him out of the car several times to urinate, carefully spraying with chlorine everywhere he had stepped.

The ambulance finally reached the Ebola treatment unit the next day at 2 p.m. That’s when the patient realized why he had been brought there and refused to get out of the ambulance. ‘‘You kill me or I kill you,’’ he said. Two hours of laborious negotiations ensued, and it was only after witnessing a family cheering their loved one being discharged from the place that he relented and stepped out. After all, there might be hope in there.

After disinfecting the inside and outside of the ambulance, the nurses were at last able to get out of their suffocating suits. Wednesday morning they were once again on the road back to Grand Gedeh County.

I heard the whole story two days later, on Friday. I was trying to reach the capital, along with an Ebola response team from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. It had been a 10-hour trip and counting. I was taking shelter from the sun by a truck on the side of the road while our driver battled the mud, when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder. It was one of the nurses, still on their way back to their hospital, where the blood sample of yet another patient suspected of having died from Ebola was waiting for them to drive it to Monrovia for testing.

There have been over 4,000 cases of Ebola in Liberia, and the World Health Organization warns that there could be up to 10,000 new cases every week in West Africa if more isn’t done now.

Liberia’s dysfunctional transportation system is standing in the way. Patients have died on grueling journeys to treatment units. Blood samples have sat waiting for days, eventually becoming invalid.

Perhaps small bush planes could help transport Ebola patients in remote parts of the country, but it would be hard to get pilots to volunteer.

The best solution is removing the need to travel altogether by building more easily accessible treatment centers all over the country, where patients with confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola can be housed and treated. The United States military is building these structures, but it is taking time. Nimbler nongovernmental organizations must also step in. Save the Children has already done so and is also building smaller community care centers — sort of homes away from home, where families can continue to care for their sick loved ones safely removed from the community. A makeshift center with tents instead of permanent structures could be set up within a week.

We must also decentralize laboratory testing of Ebola blood samples and make more portable laboratories available in all counties in Liberia. It is unacceptable that a test that should take four to six hours to process becomes a terrifying four-to-six day wait. Quarantined patients who will test positive are mixed with those who won’t, inevitably increasing infections. Until then, we have to find a way to fly blood samples to Monrovia.

Monrovia remains the epicenter of the epidemic in Liberia, but the virus is inexorably spreading across the country. With just six Ebola treatment units operational of the 28 that are planned, and equipment not reaching all of Liberia’s clinics and hospitals, transportation issues only exacerbate the enormous difficulties of combating this disease.

For now, health care workers and ambulance drivers put their fears aside and work nonstop to ensure that, no matter the cost, blood samples can be analyzed, and patients can reach a place where better treatment options await.

A Steady Loss of Confidence

WASHINGTON -- In taking office during two overseas wars and the Great Recession, President Obama set out to restore society's frayed faith in its public institutions, saying that the question was not whether government was too big or small, ''but whether it works.'' Six years later, Americans seem more dubious than ever that it really does.

With every passing week or month, it seems, some government agency or another has had a misstep or has been caught up in scandals that have deeply eroded public confidence. The Internal Revenue Service targets political groups, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed by children illegally crossing the Rio Grande, the Department of Veterans Affairs covers up poor service, and the Secret Service fails to guard the president and his White House.

Now public esteem for the long-respected Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has plummeted with the arrival of Ebola on American shores. A new CBS News poll found that only 37 percent of Americans thought the centers were doing a good job, down from 60 percent last year. In fact, of nine agencies tested, seven that were judged highly by a majority of Americans last year have now fallen below 50 percent. Only one, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was rated well by a majority, and that by just 51 percent.

The disenchantment stretches beyond individual agencies to the nation's leadership. Heading into the last election that will directly influence his presidency, Mr. Obama remains at or near his lowest approval ratings, with his handling of various matters called into question by many voters. The only solace for him is that Congress, gripped by gridlock, is held in even lower regard, with its approval rating in single digits.

''As Bill Clinton used to say, most Americans start out thinking the federal government couldn't run a two-car funeral,'' said Bruce Reed, who was a top White House official under Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama. ''Now they worry that one of the two cars should have been recalled and the other can't go anywhere because Congress is still fighting over whether to fix the road.''

To be sure, it remains debatable whether government really is more dysfunctional than in the past. During war and depression, during the civil rights movement or the Watergate scandal or Hurricane Katrina, institutions struggled to meet public needs. But today's disillusionment has been turbocharged by the relentless pace of the modern news media, the unforgiving glare of social media and the calculating efforts of partisans.

And it has come to shape the national debate leading to the midterm congressional elections to be held in less than two weeks. Republicans are trying to capitalize on the sour mood to argue that Mr. Obama and his party have proved that they cannot be trusted to govern, a case bolstered by continuing foreign policy crises in places like Syria and Ukraine. Democrats accuse the opposition of mindless obstructionism, deliberately sabotaging government, or at least tearing down belief in it, out of ideological fervor and political ambition.

''There's a sense that things simply don't work in Washington, and Congress, in particular, seems to be completely gridlocked,'' Mr. Obama told donors in Chicago on Monday night. ''And so all of this adds together to a sense on the part of folks that the institutions they rely on to apply common-sense decisions and to look out for working families across the country, that those institutions aren't working the way they're supposed to.''

The broader trend precedes Mr. Obama and extends beyond politics, but has not improved as the president once hoped. Polling by Gallup shows that since June 2009, in the heyday of the new Obama presidency, public confidence in virtually every major institution of American life has fallen, including organized religion, the military, the Supreme Court, public schools, newspapers, Congress, television news, the police, the presidency, the medical system, the criminal justice system and small business.

The only institutions that Gallup tested that showed slight improvement from June 2009 to June 2014 were banks, organized labor, big business and health maintenance organizations. Even so, all four of them had the confidence of just roughly a quarter of the population or less.

David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama, attributed the doubts about public institutions in large part to a political and news media culture that has gone well beyond healthy skepticism and scrutiny, all the more so in an election season.

''Look, I think cynicism is a marketable asset these days, and you see it very clearly in this Ebola story,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''There's an impetus to create fear and then market it, exploit it. And that's true on the part of the media, and that's true on the part of the politicians.''

Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization, said Democrats were at a strategic disadvantage in arguments over efficacy of government. ''Conservatives have every interest to attack things government does because they don't want government to do things,'' she said. ''Democrats don't have an interest in attacking everything government does because they want government to work.''

Republicans call that a convenient excuse for a president who has turned out not to be up to the task of running a complicated and vast organization. Before his 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama had little history of managing anything larger than a Senate office. To his critics, the breakdowns in various agencies are the natural result of that inexperience, a conclusion that really began taking hold with the botched rollout of his own health care program last year.

''That ultimately may be the most damaging critique,'' said Lanhee Chen, a scholar at Stanford University's Hoover Institution who was Mitt Romney's chief policy adviser in the 2012 presidential campaign against Mr. Obama. ''I've heard it come from both the right and the left. People don't feel that he's a competent manager of government.''

To the extent that election forecasts are to be believed, Republicans seem to have gotten the better end of that argument. By most accounts, they will ride dissatisfaction with Mr. Obama to keep the House and quite possibly take control of the Senate.

Yet there is a paradox in that, because no matter who wins the upper chamber, voters seem poised to return more than 90 percent of incumbents in both parties to a Congress they say they loathe. Expressing disapproval is fashionable, but Americans still rely on the institutions they disapprove of. A Pew Research Center poll showed that despite low marks for the C.D.C., 54 percent of Americans express confidence in the government to prevent a major outbreak of Ebola in the United States.

Tom Davis, a Republican former congressman from Virginia, said both parties had contributed to the toxic environment, as had an obsessive news media. Every element in the system is rooting for failure. In January, Mr. Davis will publish ''The Partisan Divide,'' a book on polarization in Washington written with Martin Frost, a Democratic former congressman from Texas, and Richard E. Cohen, a former National Journal columnist.

''Part of it is just the whole atmosphere in Washington -- the gotcha mentality; we're just going to stick it to you,'' Mr. Davis said, adding, ''We focus on what's not going well because our political system rewards that sort of thing.''

The U.S. Will Collaborate With Cuba … on Ebola

After wrestling for days with the diplomatically awkward reality that Cuba could turn out to be America’s best ally on the effort to stem the Ebola epidemic, the Obama Administration has belatedly come around to a sensible conclusion: It’s willing to coordinate with the Cuban medics dispatched to treat patients in West Africa.

In a remarkably conciliatory statement, the State Department said on Tuesday night that it “welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with Cuba,” which has pledged to send hundreds of doctors and nurses to treat patients in the three countries where the virus is spreading fastest.“Cuba is making significant contributions by sending hundreds of health workers to Africa,” the State Department said.The Ebola outbreak has presented the two nations with a rare opportunity to work collaboratively on a high profile global issue at a time when there is growing interest on the part of both governments for a rapprochement.

Former Cuban President Fidel Castro called on the United States this weekend to set aside its long term differences with Havana in order to make headway on the fight against Ebola. Cuba recently dispatched 165 doctors and nurses to Sierra Leone and a new group of 91 was set to travel to the region on Tuesday. The government has trained more than 400 health care workers on the precautions that must be taken to treat patients with Ebola.

The United States and the European Union have pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build up the beleaguered health care infrastructure of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. But the international community has struggled to put together a medical corps willing to treat patients with the highly contagious virus.

The Times editorial board on Monday called on the United States to coordinate with Cuban medics and to offer them assistance in the event any contract the virus. The State Department statement did not address whether American personnel would be willing to treat or evacuate Cuban health workers. American officials say they are still sorting out the broader issue of how medical evacuations of all foreign health care workers will be handled.

Donations for Ebola relief efforts are slow to gain speed; Initial lack of publicity may have stymied flow of cash to aid agencies

When Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million last week to support the treatment of Ebola victims and their families, they gave the gift to the foundation that funnels private donations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not one of the nonprofit groups that Americans typically shower with money during a humanitarian crisis.

Compared to the rush to donate after major disasters of the last decade or so, charitable giving to address the Ebola tragedy is almost nonexistent, and the relief agencies that typically seek donations after a catastrophe are mostly silent. ‘‘Have you had any email solicitations?’’ asked Patrick M. Rooney, associate dean at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. ‘‘If there had been an earthquake or tsunami, my question would be who had solicited you and how many times? Americans aren’t giving because they haven’t really been asked.’’

Ever since terrorists took down the World Trade Center in 2001, Americans have generously supported the organizations that swing into action after earthquakes, floods, cyclones, mudslides and other disasters. Propelled by the Internet and cellphones, which make giving as easy as clicking a button, Americans donated billions of dollars to help victims of the 2004 tsunami that devastated countries around the Indian Ocean, the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan, and the 2010 Haitian earthquake, among other calamities.

But the Ebola crisis is different, charity officials and experts say, though it is hard to say exactly why. Perhaps it lacks the visual drama of a natural disaster. Or it is harder for people to understand what their money can do to fight a disease with such a high mortality rate and no sure treatment. It is not even clear that providing food, housing and protective equipment will have any impact — or how those things will get where they are most needed.

‘‘It’s just been more difficult to raise money around this,’’ said David Whalen, chief development officer at Partners in Health, founded by the physician Paul Farmer to help bolster health care in poor regions.

For one thing, Mr. Whalen and others said, news coverage of Ebola did not begin to ramp up until an American missionary and a doctor working for Samaritan’s Purse contracted the virus and were taken to Atlanta for treatment in early August. The C.D.C.’s first notice about the current outbreak, noting 86 suspected cases in Guinea, drew little attention four months earlier.

In addition, charities initially had small operations — or none at all — in the stricken region for which to raise money, and there was hope that the outbreak would be contained.

Médecins Sans Frontières, known in the United States as Doctors Without Borders, was on the ground at that time, working to fight the disease. But the organization saw no uptick in fund-raising until late July, said Thomas Kurmann, director of development for the United States branch.

‘‘The real spike came in September,’’ Mr. Kurmann said, when representatives of the organization addressed the United Nations. ‘‘There was a lot of media coverage, and that translates into additional donations.’’

Doctors Without Borders asks donors not to earmark their contributions for a specific emergency because it wants to be able to deploy its money where it is most needed. But it does not reject earmarked gifts. So far, it has received about $31.5 million in private donations designated for the Ebola crisis, about $7.3 million from United States donors, Mr. Kurmann said.

Including money given to the organization by governments, Doctors Without Borders has collected about $56.7 million restricted for use in fighting Ebola, Mr. Kurmann said. In comparison, the group received $138 million in restricted donations after the Haiti earthquake.

Partners in Health only recently started soliciting private contributions, after having first filed requests for support with the United States Agency for International Development and the Department for International Development in Britain, which are leading the medical efforts to address the crisis.

The International Medical Corps already has some 200 medical employees working in a 70-bed Ebola treatment center in Bong County, about 120 miles outside Monrovia, Liberia, and is working to construct and open a 50-bed center in Sierra Leone.

The Medical Corps started quietly fund-raising — there are no photos of its Ebola-related activities on its home page — in late July. ‘‘It was slow going at first,’’ said Rebecca Milner, chief fund-raiser for the organization. ‘‘I think the pivotal moment was when the missionaries were brought back to the U.S. We’ve seen the interest and concern increasing since then.’’

She said the slow pace of fund-raising reminded her of efforts to raise money for famines. ‘‘You really have to beat the drums and hope the media gets there to shine a spotlight on the issues,’’ Ms. Milner said.

The group has raised about $2.5 million in cash and in-kind contributions so far — and it would rather have the cash than donations of equipment. It needs only very specific types of ‘‘personal protective equipment’’ — the gloves, hoods, jumpsuits and other gear health care workers need to protect themselves.

Getting a variety of different types of suits, gloves and goggles greatly complicates the training process, Ms. Milner said. ‘‘Your life literally depends on knowing the exact right way to put the gear on and the exact right way to take it off, and we can’t train for a variety of different equipment,’’ she said.

Direct Relief, which collects and distributes medicines and supplies to health care workers on the front lines, like those at Last Mile Health in Liberia, got ‘‘masses of gloves,’’ according to Thomas Tighe, Direct Relief’s chief executive.

When it went to charter a 747 airplane to ferry supplies to Monrovia, Direct Relief had raised just $100,000 that was earmarked for Ebola relief. ‘‘I kept wondering if we would get an overdraft charge from the bank,’’ Mr. Tighe said.

Americans who are worried about the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States can take heart from two recent successes. In Texas, 43 people who were being monitored because they had had direct or indirect contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died of Ebola in a Dallas hospital, were found clear of the Ebola virus on Monday.

Also that day, the World Health Organization declared Nigeria free of Ebola. The Nigerian health authorities were able to snuff out a small outbreak that could have spread through the crowded slums of Lagos, a city with 21 million people, and beyond.

The Nigerian success can be attributed primarily to an extraordinarily vigorous effort to track down everyone who had contact with a possibly infected person and isolating and treating anyone found to have the disease so that they would not infect anyone else. This strategy is what American health officials mean when they say Ebola can be contained through standard public health measures of tracking and isolation.

An all-out effort to find and isolate hundreds of potential contacts in Lagos and other parts of the country held the outbreak to only 19 patients who came down with Ebola, of whom seven died. That was deemed a ‘‘spectacular success story’’ by the W.H.O. Another West African country, Senegal, which had a single imported case and a smaller number of contacts to trace and isolate, was declared free of Ebola on Friday.

In Dallas, the 43 people being monitored emerged from the 21-day incubation period for the virus without a single one becoming sick. That includes Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, who cared for him when he was sick, and three other family members in the same apartment.

It remains possible that additional health care workers — beyond the two nurses who are already infected — will come down with Ebola. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital made mistakes in dealing with the Ebola patient and the nurses who cared for him. They have now taken steps to prevent further mishaps. The danger of an outbreak affecting the public of the United States is very, very slight, and the experience in Nigeria and Senegal shows that diligent responses can work.

Ebola raises demand for protective wear; As hospitals gear up, manufacturers increase production of equipment

At manufacturing plants in North Carolina, Mexico and Honduras, the machines are standing ready.

The plants, which make gowns and other protective equipment that medical staff need to treat Ebola patients, have hired extra workers to make sure the machines can run all night.

Some already are.

‘‘We are not at our maximum capacity yet,’’ said Judson Boothe, the senior director of products supply for Halyard Health, a unit of Kimberly-Clark that operates the plants (it is soon to be spun off from its parent). ‘‘But we’re getting closer every day,’’ he said, adding that Halyard did hit its cap during the SARS outbreak.

Major manufacturers of personal protective equipment say they have already experienced a significant spike in demand for their products, as hospitals across the United States brace for potential new cases of Ebola, which has already killed more than 4,500 people, most of them in West Africa.

The Cleveland Clinic, part of a health system that is monitoring five nurses who were on the same flight as a nurse who contracted Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died in a Dallas hospital, says it has seen slight delays in shipments of new supplies.

‘‘We don’t have everything we need yet, but I have not heard from our leadership or anyone that there’s a panic that we’re not getting what we need,’’ said Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the clinic.

Mr. Boothe says that orders for personal protective products have risen more than 30 percent above normal levels for this time of year, when medical workers typically prepare for flu season. Halyard also packages kits of fluid-resistant products, including a gown, gloves, a shoe covering and a face mask, that sell for about $10 to $12 each.

DuPont, which makes body suits from Tychem or Tyvek, two types of fluid- resistant material, says it has tripled production for products that can be used to protect from Ebola. And Medline, a manufacturer and distributor of health care supplies, has recently begun selling specialized kits of equipment, at the request of its clients, that are designed with Ebola in mind.

Demand for specialized kits is up tenfold in the past month, according to a Medline spokeswoman, Kathryn Cummings, while demand for gowns and other protective gear has grown 25 percent in the last few weeks.

‘‘We receive 30 to 40 calls a day inquiring about our kits,’’ said Dante Tisci, the president of one of Medline’s manufacturing divisions.

After the death of Mr. Duncan this month, Mr. Tisci said, many of those calls have come from Texas, although Medline has received more inquiries from the East Coast recently.

‘‘I would definitely say that the demand during this specific pandemic has been much larger than in the past,’’ he said.

Manufacturers like Halyard and Medline typically sell their products to hospitals, or third-party distributors, and not directly to consumers.

‘‘We are definitely open to that market if that market presents itself,’’ Mr. Tisci said, adding that almost all of the increase in demand had so far come from institutional clients.

While consumers are not rushing to pick up industrial-grade protective equipment from companies like Halyard, they may be looking for smaller ways to stay safe. Rite Aid, which sells masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and similar products, has seen a slight increase in demand.

‘‘Store shelves have ample inventory, and we have access to additional inventory if necessary,’’ said Ashley Flower, a company spokeswoman. ‘‘We continue to closely monitor the situation and are prepared to respond as needed.’’

Walmart and the Walgreen Company declined to comment on whether they were seeing any increase in sales. CVS/Caremark did not respond to requests for comment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for what medical workers should wear to treat Ebola patients, like fluid-resistant gowns that shield them from splashes of blood, feces and other fluids that transmit the virus.

But removing the equipment presents its own challenges. Officials said that a nurse who treated Mr. Duncan and tested positive for Ebola may have been infected in the process of removing her protective gear.

Mr. Tisci said that Medline would include use instructions only at the request of its customers, who provide the detailed directions themselves.

‘‘We’re not telling our customers the proper way to gown and degown,’’ Mr. Tisci said. ‘‘A lot of our customers are really just following the C.D.C. guidelines.’’

The C.D.C. says that medical personnel should wear fluid-resistant gowns and other protection that gives them 360-degree coverage. Hospitals around the country have had to quickly figure out which suits work best for them, and train their employees accordingly.

‘‘The features of the actual personal protective equipment are the fluid resistance, but there’s also the ease of getting into it and more importantly out of it correctly,’’ said Dr. Lisa Maragakis, the director of hospital epidemiology and infection control at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ‘‘I don’t know if saying that it’s difficult is right, except to say that you have to be trained and practiced.’’

Dr. Maragakis said that the staff at Johns Hopkins had been practicing getting into and out of gowns using red paint to show whether or not they were contaminating themselves when taking the gowns off. (The Cleveland Clinic uses chocolate syrup, Ms. Sheil said.) Dr. Maragakis said that the hospital decided to use fluid-resistant gowns instead of Tyvek suits after finding that the suits were more difficult to remove without contamination.

‘‘How a jumpsuit fits depends a lot on size much more than a gown does,’’ she said. ‘‘If you’re a taller person and the shoulders are on tightly, it’s harder to get your arm out of that sleeve.’’

Suits typically have a zipper and often provide head-to-toe coverage, or at least shoulder-to-feet. Gowns typically cover shoulders to knees, and could provide the kind of coverage Ebola requires through overlapping layers and a tie. Gowns, like the fluid-resistant versions sold by Halyard and others, are often used in the operating room or in the trauma department when dealing with open wounds, Mr. Boothe said.

For now, manufacturers of personal protective equipment say they can handle any increase in demand. Medline said that it could produce up to one million fluid-resistant ‘‘coveralls’’ now, as the World Health Organization predicts that Ebola could reach 10,000 new cases a week by December.

‘‘We just don’t know at this point how far it will progress, and how fast,’’ Mr. Boothe said.

Putin and the pope
BY THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

Reading the papers these days I find that the two world leaders who stir the most passion in me are Pope Francis and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. One is everything you’d want in a leader, the other everything you wouldn’t want. One holds sway over 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, the other over nine time zones. One keeps surprising us with his capacity for empathy, the other by how much he has become a first-class jerk and thug. But neither can be ignored and both have an outsized influence on the world today.

First, the pope. At a time when so many leaders around the world are looking to promote their political fortunes by exploiting grievances and fault lines, we have a pope asking his flock to do something hard, something outside their comfort zone, pushing them to be more inclusive of gays and divorced people.

Yes, Francis was rebuffed by conservative bishops at a recent Vatican synod when he asked them to embrace the notion that ‘‘homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,’’ adding, ‘‘are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities?’’

But, as an editorial in this paper noted: ‘‘The very fact that Francis ordered church leaders to address these challenges seems a landmark in Vatican history.’’ The pope asked that rejected language be published for all to see, while also cautioning against ‘‘hostile inflexibility — that is, wanting to close oneself within the written word, and not allowing oneself to be surprised by God.’’

‘‘Hostile inflexibility?’’ Whose leadership does that describe? Look at Putin’s recent behavior: His military was indirectly involved in downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine and his K.G.B. has not only been trying to take a bite out of Ukraine but is nibbling on Estonia, Georgia and Moldova, all under the guise of protecting ‘‘Russian speakers.’’

I opposed NATO expansion because I believed that there are few global problems that we can solve without the help of Russia. By expanding NATO at the end of the Cold War, when Russia was weak, we helped to cultivate a politics there that would one day be very receptive to Putin’s message that the West is ganging up on Russia. But, that said, the message is a lie. The West has no intention of bringing Ukraine into NATO. And please raise your hand if you think the European Union plans to invade Russia.

Yet Putin just exploits these fears for two reasons. First, he has a huge chip on his shoulder — no, excuse me; he has a whole lumberyard there — of resentment that Russia is no longer the global power it once was. But rather than make Russia great again by tapping its creative people — empowering them with education, the rule of law and consensual politics to realize their full potential — he has opted for the shortcut of tapping his oil and gas wells and seizing power from his people.

And instead of creating a Russia that is an example to its neighbors, he relies on the brute force that his oil and gas can still buy him. While he rails against NATO, he is really afraid of European Union expansion — that Ukrainians would rather embrace the E.U. market and democracy rules than their historical ties to Russia because they know that through the E.U. they can realize potentials that would never be possible with Russia.

By seizing Crimea and stoking up nationalism, Putin was not protecting Russia from NATO. He was protecting himself from the viruses of E.U. account-ability and transparency, which, if they took hold in Ukraine, could spread to Moscow, undermining his kleptocracy.

Normally, I wouldn’t care, but when the world is dividing between zones of order and disorder, and the world of order needs to be collaborating to stem and reverse disorder, the fact that Putin is stoking disorder on Russia’s borders, and not collaborating to promote order in the Middle East, is a real problem. What’s more worrying is that the country he threatens most is Russia. If things go bad there — and its economy is already sagging under Western sanctions — the world of disorder will get a lot bigger.

That is why Putin’s leadership matters, and so does the pope’s. I’m focused on Putin because I think he is making the world a worse place for bad reasons, when he could make a difference in Europe and the Middle East with just an ounce more decency and collaboration. America, too, has plenty to learn from the pope’s humility, but say what you will, we’re still focused on trying to strengthen the global commons, whether by protecting people from jihadists in Iraq or fighting Ebola in Africa. We could do more. Putin needs to do a lot more.

‘‘The best leaders don’t set timid and selfish goals that are easy to meet but instead set bold and inclusive goals that are hard to achieve,’’ remarked Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, who has just written a book on leadership, ‘‘Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most.’’ ‘‘We’re all looking for ways to make sense of a world without a center, but we’ll only find that in people who lead with authentic humility and reckless generosity.’’

EBOLA

The Natural and Human History of a Deadly Virus

By David Quammen

119 pages. W. W. Norton & Company. $13.95.

Ebola has come to be described in horror-movie terms as an affliction, in the words of the journalist David Quammen, that “seems to kill like the 10th plague of Egypt in Exodus — the one inflicted by an angel of death.” With a mortality rate as high as 90 percent, it kills painfully and swiftly, with a seemingly remorseless calculus. There is even an article on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that compares Ebola to the ghastly scourge in “The Masque of the Red Death,” the Edgar Allan Poe story that begins: “The ‘Red Death’ had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous.”

In “Ebola: The Natural and Human History of a Deadly Virus,” Mr. Quammen puts both the frightening reality of Ebola — and the heightened language and hyperbole surrounding it — into perspective. This slender book is an expanded extract from his 2012 book “Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/books/review/spillover-by-david-quammen.html?pagewanted=all],” and it does a nimble job of situating this year’s unnerving events in historical context, going back to the first recorded occurrence of the virus in 1976 and chronicling the scientific and medical efforts to understand it since.

As he did in earlier natural history books like “The Song of the Dodo[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/quammen-dodo.html]” and “Monster of God[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/26/books/books-of-the-times-it-s-a-jungle-out-there-for-the-fearsome-beasts.html],” Mr. Quammen combines on-the-ground reporting with research and interviews to give the reader a sharp-edge understanding of the subject at hand: what is known, what is not known and what may be in dispute. His book, like most writing about Ebola, is deeply unsettling, but it’s also sober minded, and in this respect, a standout in the floodlet of Ebola books, many of them quickie scare guides and medical thrillers (with portentous titles like “Ebola: The Final Plague,” “Ebola: Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid,” “Ebola: The Preppers Guide to Surviving Ebola,” “The Trojan Virus: An Ebola Bioterrorism Thriller” and “The Ebola Conspiracy”) , which seem intended to exploit public fears.

In these pages, Mr. Quammen takes Richard Preston — the author of the 1994 best seller “The Hot Zone[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/books/the-hot-zone-author-tracks-ebolas-evolution.html?_r=0]” — to task for his melodramatic approach to the subject, writing that readers should not take Mr. Preston’s lurid descriptions of Ebola’s consequences literally — liquefying organs until “people were dissolving in their beds” or causing victims to “weep blood.” (In a recent interview[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/books/the-hot-zone-author-tracks-ebolas-evolution.html?_r=0] with The New York Times, Mr. Preston said he now wants to update his book and make “the clinical picture of the virus more clear and accurate.”)

Mr. Quammen — like the journalist Laurie Garrett in her illuminating and encyclopedic book “The Coming Plague[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/books/books-of-the-times-a-frightening-portrait-of-a-threat-to-the-species.html]” — shows in these pages that the reality of the virus is horrifying without any apocalyptic embellishment. He writes that experts “aren’t sure exactly how the virus typically causes death”; rather, multiple causes — including liver failure, kidney failure, breathing difficulties, diarrhea — seem to converge in “an unstoppable cascade.” The “idea of immune suppression by ebolaviruses has also appeared lately in the literature,” he says, “along with speculation that it might allow catastrophic overgrowth of a patient’s natural populations of bacteria, normally resident in the gut and elsewhere, as well as unhindered replication of the virus itself.”

Much of this book reads like a detective story, tracing the intrepid efforts of microbe hunters to understand how this dangerous virus works — the dynamics of transmission, the geographical pattern of outbreaks — and possible approaches to treatment. There are some harrowing accounts of forays by scientists into disease-ridden (and cobra-infested) bat caves in Uganda, and an equally chilling story about an infectious-disease research scientist who accidentally stuck herself with a syringe that she’d been using to inject Ebola-ridden mice.

Over the years, considerable attention has been devoted by scientists to unraveling the mystery of where the virus lurks when it is not infecting humans, i.e., an animal host or reservoir, where it can exist more or less benignly. The chief suspected reservoirs, Mr. Quammen says, are certain types of fruit bat, which are present in parts of Central and West Africa. The diversity of bats (“one in every four species of mammal is a bat,” he writes), “their ancientness” (they evolved “to roughly their present form about 50 million years ago”) and their abundance in large, intimate communities, he argues, might have contributed to their capacity to host a wide variety of viruses, just as their migratory habits (some journey as much as 800 miles between their summer and winter roosts) might have increased “the likelihood that they, or the viruses they carry, will come in contact with humans.”

Why do “zoonoses” (animal infections that jump over into humans, like Ebola, SARS, AIDS, Lyme disease, West Nile fever, swine flu, bird flu) seem to be more and more common? Mr. Quammen suggests that when humans “encroach upon the host populations” of a pathogen — “hunting them for meat, dragging or pushing them out of their ecosystems, disrupting or destroying those ecosystems” — “our action increases the level of risk.” As a veterinary disease ecologist named Jon Epstein observes, “It increases the opportunity for these pathogens to jump from their natural host into a new host.”

In some cases, the microbe remains benign in the new host as it was in the old one. In other cases (like HIV), the pathogen — especially RNA viruses given to high rates of mutation and replication — not only gets a foothold in the new host, but also adapts and evolves and causes serious illness.

An important study published[http://www.aaas.org/news/science-ebola-genomes-provide-new-information-west-african-outbreak] by the journal Science in August, Mr. Quammen says, addressed the Ebola virus variant involved in this year’s outbreak, which is the worst in the history of the disease. The study, he writes, indicated that “the virus was mutating prolifically and accumulating a fair degree of genetic variation as it replicated within each human case and passed from one human to another.”

The high rate of mutations in the virus suggest “that continued progression of this epidemic could afford an opportunity for viral adaptation,” it said, “underscoring the need for rapid containment.” Or, in Mr. Quammen’s words, “The higher the case count goes, the greater the likelihood that Ebola virus as we know it might evolve into something better adapted to pass from human to human, something that presently exists only in our nightmares.”

As for our still highly provisional scientific understanding of ebolaviruses, Mr. Quammen reminds us that it “constitutes pin pricks of light against a dark background.”

Kissing Your Socks Goodbye

By her own account, Marie Kondo was an unusual child, poring over lifestyle magazines to glean organizing techniques and then stealthily practicing them at home and school, confounding her family and bemusing her teachers.

As she writes in “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,” which comes out this month in the United States and is already a best seller in her native Japan and in Europe, she habitually sneaked into her siblings’ rooms to throw away their unused toys and clothes and ducked out of recess to organize her classroom’s bookshelves and mop closet, grumbling about poor storage methodologies and pining for an S-hook.

Now 30, Ms. Kondo is a celebrity of sorts at home, the subject of a TV movie, with a three-month waiting list for her decluttering services — until recently, that is, because she has stopped taking clients to focus on training others in her methods. Last Friday, I brought her book home to practice them.

What better moment to drill down and ponder the fretful contents of one’s sock drawer? Global and national news was careering from the merely hysterical to the nonsensical (the Ebola cruise ship incident was just peaking). Closer to home, other anxieties beckoned. But in my apartment on Second Avenue, the world was no larger than my closet, and I was talking to my T-shirts.

Let me explain. Ms. Kondo’s decluttering theories are unique, and can be reduced to two basic tenets: Discard everything that does not “spark joy,” after thanking the objects that are getting the heave-ho for their service; and do not buy organizing equipment — your home already has all the storage you need.

Obsessive, gently self-mocking and tender toward the life cycle of, say, a pair of socks, Ms. Kondo delivers her tidy manifesto like a kind of Zen nanny, both hortatory and animistic.

“Don’t just open up your closet and decide after a cursory glance that everything in it gives you a thrill,” she writes. “You must take each outfit in your hand.”

“Does it spark joy?” would seem to set the bar awfully high for a T-shirt or a pair of jeans, but it turns out to be a more efficacious sorting mechanism than the old saws: Is it out of style? Have you worn it in the last year? Does it still fit?

Alone in my bedroom, with the contents of both closets strewn over every surface, I fondled stretch velvet pants (don’t judge me) and enough fringed scarves to outfit an army of Stevie Nicks fans, and shed a tear or two for my younger self. (Where did the time go?)

“Sparking joy,” I realized, can be a flexible concept: That which is itchy, or too hot, is certainly joyless. So is anything baggy, droopy or with a flared leg.

Tidying is a dialogue with oneself, Ms. Kondo writes.

Of course, after 10 or 12 hours of this, you get a bit silly. You forget to thank your discards. (Country music can help. Try George Jones and Lucinda Williams.) By 9 p.m., I had lost Ms. Kondo’s book in the layers of clothing, hangers and shoe boxes. And my glasses, too.

How to distinguish one black turtleneck from another? Why would anyone buy purple tights? What is joy, anyway?

At 1 a.m., my daughter appeared, raised an eyebrow at the piles still obliterating my bed and offered up her own. But I was ready to fold, the primal act of Ms. Kondo’s method.

You can find YouTube videos of her technique, but it’s not so hard: Fold everything into a long rectangle, then fold that in upon itself to make a smaller rectangle, and then roll that up into a tube, like a sushi roll. Set these upright in your drawers. And pour your heart into it, Ms. Kondo urges: Thank your stuff, it’s been working hard for you.

“When we take our clothes in our hands and fold them neatly,” she writes, “we are, I believe, transmitting energy, which has a positive effect on our clothes.”

She proposes a similarly agreeable technique for hanging clothing. Hang up anything that looks happier hung up, and arrange like with like, working from left to right, with dark, heavy clothing on the left: “Clothes, like people, can relax more freely when in the company of others who are very similar in type, and therefore organizing them by category helps them feel more comfortable and secure.”

Such anthropomorphism and nondualism, so familiar in Japanese culture, as Leonard Koren, a design theorist who has written extensively on Japanese aesthetics, told me recently, was an epiphany to this Westerner. In Japan, a hyper-awareness, even reverence, for objects is a rational response to geography, said Mr. Koren, who spent 10 years there and is the author of “Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers.”

“Think of the kimono, and the tradition of folding,” he said. “There is also the furoshiki, which is basically a square of flat cloth used daily to wrap packages. Folding is deep and pervasive in Japanese culture. Folding is a key strategy of modular systems that have evolved because of limited living space.”

He added: “More spiritually, the idea of non-dualism is a relationship to reality that proposes that everything is inextricably connected and alive, even inanimate objects. If we are compassionate and respectful to everything that exists, then we would have to be compassionate about the socks in the drawer that aren’t folded properly.”

Indeed, Ms. Kondo’s instructions regarding socks are eye-opening. Socks bust their chops for you, and if you ball them up, they don’t get a chance to rest. As she puts it, “The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday.”

Mine were obviously having a terrible time, torqued and twisted like coach passengers on an overcrowded flight to Europe.

My weekend was lost to Ms. Kondo. After three days, I had given four bags of clothing and two bags of shoes to the Salvation Army, along with two dead computers. (Like Staples and Best Buy in New York City, the Salvation Army is a recycling drop-off location for electronics.) Two-thirds of my fridge — jam dating to 2010, undated tubes of tomato paste — ended up in the trash.

“Where is all the food?” my daughter wailed.

Giddy, I twirled ribbons into circles and nestled them in a drawer with a stack of tissue paper, notecards and rolls of Scotch tape. I threw lone gloves out with near drunken abandon. And I smugly noted that my hoarding habits could be worse. In a section titled “Astounding Stockpiles I Have Seen,” Ms. Kondo writes of the client with 60 toothbrushes and of another with 80 rolls of toilet paper. The record, she says, was the client who stockpiled 20,000 cotton swabs.

Of the toothbrush hoarder, Ms. Kondo muses: “It’s interesting how the human mind tries to make sense even out of the nonsensical. I found myself pondering whether she would go through one a day if she brushed her teeth too hard, or if perhaps she used a different brush for each tooth.”

I filled two 60-gallon trash bags with miscellaneous garbage: shirts with ink stains on the pockets, old clippings, appliance warranties, credit card statements. For Ms. Kondo’s instruction on sorting papers is perhaps the most liberating of all her maxims: Just throw them all away. (She is equally ruthless about buttons.)

“There is nothing more annoying than papers,” she says firmly. “After all, they will never spark joy, no matter how carefully you keep them.”

9 in Connecticut Being Watched for Symptoms of Ebola

Nine people in Connecticut who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus have been told to stay at home and are being monitored by local health authorities for symptoms, a spokesman for the State Public Health Department said on Wednesday.

The people in question were not sick, the spokesman, William Gerrish, said, but were being watched under an order signed by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/dannel_p_malloy/index.html?inline=nyt-per] on Oct. 7, declaring a public health emergency in the state.

They were not publicly identified because of privacy concerns, but officials said three were Yale University students and the others were from one family. At least some had traveled to West Africa.

Mr. Malloy’s order enabled him to give the public health commissioner, Dr. Jewel Mullen, the power, “under conditions prescribed” by her, to order the isolation or quarantine of anyone she reasonably believed to have been exposed to Ebola, infected with it or at risk of transmitting it. Officials said that the quarantining of the nine people was voluntary, and that none had objected to it.

On Wednesday, federal health officials said that starting next week, travelers arriving in six states from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone must have their temperatures taken and stay in touch with health officials daily for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. Connecticut is not one of those states.

“The governor has asked the department to act out of an abundance of caution, and that’s exactly what they are doing,” a spokesman for Mr. Malloy said.

Mr. Gerrish said the nine people would be confined to their homes for 21 days and would be checked by public health authorities.

How to Defeat Ebola

An alarming new symptom of Ebola in America: It seems to make brains mushy and hearts hard.

In New Jersey, two students from Rwanda, which has had no Ebola cases and is 2,800 miles from the affected countries in West Africa, are being kept home[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Ebola-Fears-and-Arrival-of-2-African-Students-Prompt-Parents-to-Keep-Kids-Home-From-Local-School--279718882.html]. Navarro College in Texas rejected applicants from Nigeria[http://www.cnbc.com/id/102087542#], initially stating that it would not accept students from countries with Ebola cases — a bit problematic because that would mean no longer accepting Americans.

The former executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, Todd Kincannon, suggested (perhaps satirically) one way to control the disease: All people who tested positive for the Ebola virus could be “humanely put down.”

Many Republicans and some Democrats have been calling for a ban on flights from the Ebola-affected West African countries. A Reuters poll[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/21/us-health-ebola-travel-idUSKCN0IA2BI20141021] indicated that almost three-quarters of Americans favored such a ban on flights.

It’s a superficially attractive idea, but also a reflection of our mixed-up notions of how to protect ourselves. The truth is that Ebola is both less serious and far more serious than we think.

It’s less serious here because, in the end, the United States and other countries with advanced health systems can suppress Ebola outbreaks. Granted, the Dallas hospital bungled its response. Still, if Nigeria and Senegal can manage Ebola successfully[http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-nigeria-senegal-ebola-20141022-story.html], so can the United States. We won’t have an epidemic here.

Yet Ebola is more serious because there is a significant risk that it will become endemic in West Africa and spin off to other countries in the region or to India, Bangladesh or China. Ebola in India would be a catastrophe.

Oxfam rightly warns[http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2014-10-18/ebola-more-military-medics-money-needed] that more resources are needed to prevent Ebola from becoming the “definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation.” And if the virus lingers or spreads among poor countries, it will periodically travel to America. In a globalized world, Ebola anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.

There are also security risks. Aum Shinrikyo[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weaponized-ebola-is-it-really-a-bioterror-threat/], a Japanese terrorist group, tried to collect Ebola samples in Congo in 1992 for bioterror weapons but failed. Today, it would be easy to collect the virus, and a few suicide operatives could deliberately contract Ebola and then travel to the United States to spread the virus. (However, if the aim is mass murder, it would be simpler and probably more effective just to set off bombs.)

In any case, the point is that global health is not just a warm and fuzzy kind of aid. It’s also self-interest. It’s also national security. The best way to protect ourselves is to eradicate Ebola at its source.

A flight ban would hamper that effort by making it more difficult to get health workers and supplies to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Dr. Peter Piot, who helped identify Ebola in 1976[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/04/ebola-zaire-peter-piot-outbreak], tells me that flight bans would be counterproductive because they would “make aid really more difficult and expensive.”

Likewise, Dr. Paul Farmer[http://www.lrb.co.uk.proxy.bc.edu/v36/n20/paul-farmer/diary], founder of Partners in Health[http://www.pih.org/], tells me bluntly: “A ban would be worse than ineffective, and would certainly hamper the efforts of groups like ours — and worsen the epidemic.”

Even airport screenings may be a feel-good distraction. An editorial in BMJ[http://www.bmj.com.proxy.bc.edu/content/349/bmj.g6202], a medical journal, noted that Canada used questionnaires and thermal scanners to screen hundreds of thousands of people for SARS, spent $15 million, and didn’t find a single case. The editorial suggests that airport screening “will have no meaningful effect” and that resources would be better used fighting Ebola in West Africa.

For all the fuss about our own borders, not nearly enough is being done where it counts most: in West Africa. Bravo to President Obama for pledging up to 4,000 troops[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/national/archive/2014/10/the-us-military-wages-war-on-ebola/381197/] to fight the disease there, but the United States and other countries must do far more — and quickly! — if Ebola is to be defeated.

The number of Ebola cases[http://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/10/13/ebola-trends/] is still doubling every two to four weeks, and these countries can’t defeat the outbreak on their own. Liberia is said to have only 50 practicing doctors, according to Reuters[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-rt-uk-health-ebola-20141010-story.html], and there appears to be more Liberian doctors practicing in the United States than in Liberia. That brain drain means that Liberia, in effect, is providing medical foreign aid to the United States.

These are lovely countries with friendly people and some heroic health workers, but roads, electricity and other infrastructure are desperately weak. All Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/what-uses-more-electricity-liberia-or-cowboys-stadium-on-game-day/] consumes at peak times.

That’s why the American military’s help in West Africa is crucial, and why it’s a disgrace that less than half of a Sept. 16 United Nations target for Ebola response funds has been raised.

Our values and interests coincide here. So let’s calm down and get to work protecting America from Ebola by stopping this disaster at its source.

U.S. Plans 21-Day Watch of Travelers From Ebola-Hit Nations

Federal health officials Wednesday placed new restrictions on travelers from West African countries with Ebola outbreaks, requiring that they report their temperatures daily for three weeks, along with any other potential symptoms of the disease.

The regulations, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], are meant to monitor everyone at risk of developing Ebola symptoms from an infection acquired overseas, while not shutting the borders and not overwhelming state and local health departments with having to hunt down hundreds of newly arrived visitors.

The announcement came amid good news about two nurses who became infected after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the Ebola patient who died in Texas on Oct. 8. Family members of one nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, said they had been told that her body was clear of the virus and that she was being moved out of isolation. The other nurse, Nina Pham, had her condition upgraded to good from fair on Tuesday.

The new federal rules take effect next Monday. All travelers who have visited Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone will be required to provide home and email addresses, telephone numbers and other contact details for themselves and at least one friend or relative.

Once a day for the next 21 days, they will have to check in with their state or local health departments and report their morning and evening temperatures and list any other symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], muscle aches[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/muscle-aches/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or bleeding.

State and local health departments will be required to have plans for finding and potentially detaining anyone who fails to check in.

On arrival at an airport, each of those travelers will receive a packet with a thermometer, a card describing Ebola symptoms and a card to be given to a doctor or nurse if the traveler develops symptoms and is ordered to go to a hospital.

The new restrictions apply to citizens of every country, including the United States. “They include C.D.C. employees, journalists, everyone,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the executive director of the centers, said in a telephone news conference.

Some members of Congress have demanded a complete ban on arrivals from the three West African countries, but health officials have argued that was unnecessary and would cripple efforts to stop the disease.

In Washington, President Obama praised the C.D.C.’s plan and said the government “would continue to put in place additional measures as they make sense.”

His remarks came after an hourlong meeting with top advisers, including his new “Ebola czar,” Ron Klain, a former chief of staff for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

White House aides said Mr. Klain would probably keep a low profile as he coordinated the government’s response to the crisis.

Mr. Obama said Mr. Klain, other aides and the C.D.C. would “systematically and steadily just make sure that every hospital has a plan.”

A series of mistakes at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas that led to the infection of two nurses called into question American hospitals’ Ebola preparedness.

Separately, a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services said the government was creating a network of “maybe up to 20” hospitals to which Ebola victims could be safely sent, in addition to the handful with special isolation units to which other Ebola patients, like the nurses, have been transferred.

In a phone call with hospital administrators, Dr. Nicole Lurie, the department’s chief of preparedness, said the intent was to make sure that an Ebola victim anywhere in the country was no more than an eight-hour ambulance ride from a hospital with a staff trained to handle Ebola patients.

Public health officials like Dr. Frieden have said that a complete travel ban would do more harm than good. Pilots and others ferrying supplies and personnel to the three countries must be able to fly in and out, and the heads of medical charities and the American military supervising troops need the same flexibility. Dr. Frieden himself visited all three countries in August.

Also, if doctors and nurses could not come home from working there, they would be unlikely to volunteer to go.

Under the new rules, they will be able return but must be monitored.

The rules will be enforced starting Monday in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Georgia — the destinations for about 70 percent of all travelers from West Africa — and rolled out in other states soon after, Dr. Frieden said.

The Department of Homeland Security recently announced that all travelers to the United States who have visited the three West African countries must enter through one of five international airports[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/us/ebola-west-africa-united-states-flights.html] where health officials are stationed to take their temperatures and travel histories and get their contact details.

They include Kennedy International in New York, Newark Liberty International, Washington Dulles International, O’Hare International in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. Those airports account for 94 percent of all arrivals from the affected countries.

About 150 travelers whose trips originated in those countries arrive in the United States each day — or about 3,000 in any 21-day period, Dr. Frieden said.

He said it was important to sort out travelers with routine illnesses from those who might have Ebola; especially as flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] season begins, some travelers without Ebola are likely to develop common symptoms like fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], nausea and vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

As doctors who have worked in the three countries have pointed out, visitors can return with more common but still serious illnesses such as malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or Lassa fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Such patients need to get to hospitals quickly, and monitoring them could speed that process.

The legal power to impose the new restrictions exists in federal law controlling the borders and in state and local laws, which usually give health officials very wide latitude to take measures to stop the spread of infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Nigeria recently quenched its Ebola outbreak, in which one traveler from Liberia infected 19 Nigerians, seven of whom died. Health workers tracked nearly 900 people who had contact with Ebola victims, making nearly 18,500 home visits, taking temperatures twice daily for 21 days.

Home visits are not necessary for all returning travelers, Dr. Frieden said, but could be for people who were definitely in contact with Ebola victims. It would be up to state health departments to decide how to enforce restrictions. For example, he said, travelers might be required to report in via a service like Skype or FaceTime, which would allow health officials to see what travelers look like.

If a traveler who has been in one of the three West African countries within 21 days arrives at a port of entry that is not one of the five designated arrival airports, Dr. Frieden said, they will be held there until the same screening could be done.

After years of gains, West Africa teeters; Ebola outbreak threatens to unravel hard-won stability in fragile region

Nineteen thousand doctors and nurses will soon be needed to make a dent in West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, but the world has yet to send more than a small fraction of them, the United Nations says. Of the 1,000 vehicles needed to help the effort, only 69 have arrived. Of the 500 burial teams needed to ensure that infected corpses do not spread the disease, only 50 are on the ground — and there is no clarity on who will pay them.

In the breach, Ebola is fast washing away the small gains made over the last decade in war-scarred parts of West Africa, as schools shut down, immunization campaigns are suspended and a food crisis looms as farmers abandon their fields.

Donors had spent millions of dollars in an effort to strengthen the public health systems of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone long before the three countries became the center of the Ebola outbreak. Aid agencies of the United Nations have been active there for decades, with projects to train health workers, improve child mortality rates and get more children into school. United Nations peacekeepers helped shore up Sierra Leone for 20 years, since the end of its crippling war; Liberia had some 5,000 peacekeepers when the outbreak began this year.

Now, a virus that doctors have controlled elsewhere has ballooned in West Africa, unraveling many of the gains made in these countries in recent years and potentially threatening the hard-won stability of this tinderbox part of the world.

Some clashes and strikes have broken out. Tensions are simmering between neighbors in the region, who have long fueled wars in one another’s countries. The International Fund for Agricultural Development, another United Nations agency, warned last week that the Ebola epidemic could ‘‘lead to a hunger crisis of epic proportions.’’

Yet, only two months ago, the Security Council was considering scaling back its peacekeeping mission in the region more quickly, because United Nations troops were required in other countries. That proposal has since been suspended, and the United Nations is now trying to make sure it can hold on to the blue-helmeted soldiers that it has on the ground, which may not be easy. The Philippines has announced it will pull its troops from Liberia, citing Ebola risks.

‘‘It seems obvious now that the health crisis could have knock-on effects on the economy and so on, but that wasn’t apparent’’ earlier, said a United Nations diplomat who did not want to be identified in keeping with diplomatic protocol.

The United Nations has taken pains to assure diplomats that the peacekeeping mission has done all that it could to fight Ebola, including by spreading public health messages on its radio network, donating cars and body bags to the Liberian government, and helping to level the ground for the construction of treatment centers, according to a confidential memo to the council. The United Nations has spent upward of $8 billion on the peacekeeping mission in Liberia since 2003.

Now, the United States is sending 4,000 soldiers to build Ebola treatment centers in Liberia. Britain and France are separately sending their own forces to build centers in their former colonies, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The biggest gap now is staffing. The United Nations emergency Ebola mission says the 19,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics are needed by Dec. 1. By then, 10,000 Ebola patients could be pouring in each week. To turn around the transmission rate, the United Nations has set an ambitious goal: to isolate at least 70 percent of the sick and conduct safe burials for at least 70 percent of the dead.

The scramble follows a Security Council resolution, passed in mid-September, declaring Ebola to be a potential threat to peace and stability in the region. The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has appealed for nearly $1 billion in aid; on Tuesday his trust fund had a cash deposit of just under $9 million. Donors have separately given money and noncash contributions to specific programs, adding up to about $386 million, or just under 40 percent of what Mr. Ban has asked for.

‘‘There’s nowhere close to the money we require, nowhere close to the personnel we require, nowhere close to the assets we require,’’ Anthony Banbury, the head of the United Nations mission to contain Ebola, said by phone from Accra, Ghana, after reviewing the needs on the ground. ‘‘It’s unconscionable.’’

Jan Egeland, a former United Nations official and now head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said his group could not send health experts to West Africa until they were assured of proper care if they get Ebola and of being treated in an Ebola-free hospital.

The United States military is building a treatment center for foreign aid workers in Monrovia, the Liberian capital; it is projected to be ready by early next month. The European Union recently announced a medical evacuation system for international health workers.

‘‘All of this should have been fixed early on’’ by the United Nations, in cooperation with the United States and European Union, Mr. Egeland said.

Aid has picked up since the Security Council’s appeals. The United States plans to build 18 treatment centers across Liberia. Germany is building a treatment center in Sierra Leone and another in Liberia, and using its military aircraft to transport supplies for the United Nations. China announced that it would send motorcycles to help track the disease, along with $6 million for food to those who are quarantined. A consortium of East African countries has promised to send 600 health workers.

But hospitals are needed for non-Ebola patients, too, and even before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia had a severe shortage of medical staff.

‘‘The focus, rightly so, has been to set up treatment centers, but if you have people coming to them with malaria, labor complications or other health needs, there are currently no hospitals or clinics to safely refer them,’’ said Kris Torgeson, a liaison officer for Doctors Without Borders in Liberia.

Firms to rush testing of new Ebola vaccines; Even if proven effective, drugs may not be ready in time to stem epidemic

The health authorities and pharmaceutical companies are planning to test several new vaccines to prevent Ebola infection over the next few months, including one that is taken as a tablet, making it easier to deploy in West Africa.

The plans signify that a response to the Ebola outbreak is finally gathering steam. It is still unclear if any of these vaccines will work, however, and even if they do, they may not be ready in time to help stem the current epidemic.

Starting in January, two vaccines will be tested in large studies in the West African countries most affected by the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday. At least three other vaccines will begin safety testing in healthy volunteers outside the outbreak zone in the first quarter of 2015.

One of those three is actually a combination of two inoculations being developed by Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, a Danish company.

Johnson & Johnson announced early Wednesday that it was committing $200 million to the program, including making an equity investment of about $43 million in Bavarian Nordic to help pay for that company’s part in the project. It says it plans to begin safety trials in January and hopes to produce one million doses in 2015, with 250,000 available for broad application in clinical trials by May.

‘‘Typically, you don’t make hundreds of thousands of vaccines before you know what the safety and immunogenicity is,’’ said Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson. ‘‘This time, we will do that.’’

The two most advanced vaccines in terms of development are each undergoing testing in about 250 healthy adult volunteers in the United States and other countries outside the outbreak region.

One of the vaccines was developed by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline. The other was initially developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics, a company in Iowa.

The studies, known as Phase 1 clinical trials, are determining if the vaccines are safe and generate an immune response. Preliminary results are expected by the end of the year, Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organization’s assistant director general for health systems and innovation, said in a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.

But she said her organization was not waiting for those results. It is already planning the next stage of testing, to be ready to start in January if the vaccines pass the initial tests. Those new trials would take place in the affected countries in West Africa and would involve tens of thousands of doses, she said.

There are various scientific and ethical issues to be worked out, including who should receive the vaccine and whether it would be ethical to give some participants a placebo instead. Initial studies are likely to involve health care workers but might also involve others at high risk of infection. ‘‘We are doing everything we can to produce as many doses as we can as quickly as we can,’’ said Dr. Ripley Ballou, who leads the vaccine effort for GlaxoSmithKline.

Dr. Ballou said that while Glaxo would not have enough doses to vaccinate millions of Africans against Ebola, there should be enough by sometime next year to help slow the outbreak by protecting health care workers or those close to infected people.

Dr. Kieny said that three other vaccines would be ready early next year to enter Phase 1 testing, starting with the combination from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic.

A second is being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a small company in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The third is from Protein Sciences of Meriden, Conn., which already sells a flu vaccine.

Dr. Kieny also said her organization was trying to find out more about vaccines being developed in Russia. She did not mention the tablet vaccine, which Vaxart, a privately held company in California, is developing.

Wouter Latour, the chief executive, said in an interview that after recent discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company hoped to start a Phase 1 safety trial toward the end of the first quarter of 2015.

Science
Scientists Consider Repurposing Robots for Ebola

Robotics scientists nationwide are pondering an intriguing possibility: Might robotic technologies deployed in rescue and disaster situations be quickly repurposed to help contain the Ebola epidemic?

A robot that could perform even some of the tasks of a human, such as waste removal or the burial of bodies, would have significant lifesaving potential. So, with the assistance of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy[http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp], scientists are planning a series of brainstorming meetings. The first round will be held Nov. 7 at four locations: Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts; Texas A&M; the University of California, Berkeley; and in Washington.

The problem, scientists say, is that the technology is still limited when it comes to medicine. While mobile robots now can disarm roadside bombs and drive cars, they are taking only the first tentative steps toward the human levels of dexterity required in health care.

“You see the situation that the medical teams are facing, and I don’t even know if a robot is a solution,” said Taskin Padir, an assistant professor of robotics engineering at Worcester Polytechnic and an organizer of one of the meetings.

Still, he has been considering ways to repurpose an existing robot project as a tool for more safely performing decontamination tasks, like spraying bleach solution on clothing exposed to infected body fluids.

“As was the case in Fukushima, the Ebola crisis in Africa has revealed a significant gap between robot capabilities and what is needed in the realm of disaster relief and humanitarian assistance,” said Gill A. Pratt, a roboticist who is a program manager at the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency[http://www.darpa.mil/default.aspx]. “We have a moral obligation to try and select, adapt and apply available technology where it can help, but we must also appreciate the difficulty of the problem.”

Many of the countries experiencing the worst of the Ebola epidemic are in no position to deploy robots. But rudimentary models are widely used in medical settings in the United States, and already nervous hospital administrators are reaching out to manufacturers.

The phone has been ringing continually in recent weeks, said Yulun Wang, the chief executive of InTouch Health[http://www.intouchhealth.com/], a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based maker of telepresence robots used in hospitals for stroke diagnosis and other medical tasks.

Clients like Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Baylor University Hospital are asking whether the robots can be used to help diagnose Ebola infection, without a human present, or to facilitate virtual family visits for patients in isolation.

“They acquired our solutions for a very different purpose, and now they are wondering whether they are applicable for Ebola care,” Mr. Wang said.

The company makes a robot that travels around hospital corridors, guided by a physician at a remote location who “sees” via an Internet-connected device. Normally used to observe patients with the aid of high-quality video and audio, the robots could also be programmed to train health care personnel, Mr. Wang said.

“There isn’t a lot of Ebola expertise in the United States,” he said. “We can beam those experts into the 1,000 hospitals that have our systems instantly.”

Robots might be programmed to provide interactive checklists to medical personnel who are putting on and taking off gowns, much in the way aircraft pilots work from checklists on takeoff and landing.

Some experts have also suggested that telepresence robots might help language interpreters offer assistance in the field.

But dexterous robots that move without human guidance are only beginning to appear in laboratories. A robot that could work in close contact with a patient, replacing a nurse or a doctor, is still years away.

Humanoid rescue robots were on display in December in Florida at a contest created by Darpa, part of the Defense Department, which is hoping to spark innovation in the design of machines that are capable of operating autonomously in hostile environments.

But even the best robot, designed by a group of Japanese researchers, could drive a car only in a halting fashion, and only after the robot was attached to the steering wheel and brake and accelerator pedals. The challenges in a health care setting could be even greater.

One small example: Glass beakers and test tubes are extremely challenging for machine vision systems. Even the newest and least expensive versions, like Microsoft’s Kinect, struggle to recognize transparent glass objects.

Research efforts begun now may not bear fruit until the next epidemic, according to a number of the researchers.

Ken Goldberg, a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley, worries that the robotics researchers might seem opportunistic if they rush forward with unproven technology.

“We don’t want to be seen as capitalizing on the tragedy,” Dr. Goldberg said. “You don’t want to be seen as, ‘We’re sending in the robots.’ It sounds insensitive and crass.”

Scientists also cited cultural obstacles to the adoption of robots for medical uses.

“One of the first things I heard from medical responders is that one of the bottlenecks is in handling bodies,” said Robin Murphy, a specialist in rescue robotics and a professor of computer science and engineering at Texas A&M.

Families often cannot accept the idea that a loved one’s body might be handled by a machine. “It’s something we can do, but it has to be culturally sensitive,” she said.

Health
Ebola Guidelines for Doctors’ Offices Are Called Vague and Vary by State

In Texas, doctors are told the best protection against the Ebola virus is not an impermeable suit, face mask or double set of gloves. It’s the telephone.

Every patient who calls for an appointment at a doctor’s office should be asked about symptoms and travel history before arriving and mingling with other patients. If Ebola is suspected, the patient should be sent immediately to a hospital emergency room.

But that advice did not come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Texas Medical Association drew up the recommendations, and other states are offering different advice to their doctors.

While federal officials have been preoccupied with revamping hospital protocols for handling Ebola patients, critics say guidelines for doctors’ offices, walk-in clinics, blood-testing centers and other outpatient settings have remained spotty and vague.

That has often left local officials and medical associations to fill in the gaps and develop their own policies.

“The C.D.C. has had a good deal of guidance on the hospital environment, but less about the ambulatory environment; there’s been little guidance on that score,” said Dr. Rocco Orlando III, the chief medical officer at Hartford HealthCare.

A C.D.C. spokeswoman said that the agency had provided some guidance to state health departments[http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/responders/ebola/Documents/ebola-preparedness-considerations.pdf], but that private physicians, who are licensed by the states, should seek recommendations from the local authorities.

“They’ve been given information, and more information is forthcoming,” said Amesheia Buckner, the spokeswoman.

Americans make more than a billion visits to the doctor every year[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/nchs/fastats/physician-visits.htm], according to the National Center for Health Statistics; 82 percent of adults have contact with a health care professional during the course of a year.

Most outpatient facilities do not stock personal protective equipment of the kind required to contain the Ebola virus. Private doctors’ offices and outpatient facilities have latex gloves, and may have gowns. But they rarely have impermeable gowns or plastic face shields and goggles.

“Most of the information that has been disseminated is about containment at a hospital, but what we’re going to see in most cases is someone showing up in a physician’s office first, and physicians’ offices don’t have the equipment necessary,” said Matthew Katz, the executive vice president and chief executive of the Connecticut State Medical Society.

Outpatient facilities are unlikely to have a room with a private bathroom where a possible Ebola patient can be isolated, as recommended by the C.D.C. Also, recommendations for managing patients in these settings vary.

Dr. Jay Varma, the deputy commissioner for disease control at New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the chances of an acutely ill patient seeking help at a private doctor’s office were exceedingly low. Most of these patients will probably go to a hospital emergency room, he said.

“People who are in the early stages are not very infectious,” Dr. Varma said. “The risk of transmission in an outpatient doctor’s office will probably be less than in other settings.”

In Ohio, where dozens of residents are being monitored after exposure to an infected nurse visiting from Dallas, the Ohio State Medical Association urges physicians “to make a diagnosis by phone, when possible.” In New York City, health officials do not advise doctors to screen patients on the telephone before they come in.

A handful of recent incidents have raised questions about how possible cases of Ebola should be identified and contained outside hospitals.

This month, dozens of workers and patients were quarantined for several hours at a group medical practice in Braintree, Mass., after a patient who had visited Liberia came in complaining of head and body aches. The patient was eventually found to be at low risk for the infection.

After a Yale student with symptoms who had returned from West Africa was tested for Ebola, Mr. Katz received dozens of calls from concerned physicians. (The student tested negative[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/nyregion/yale-graduate-student-with-ebola-like-symptoms.html].)

Among their questions, he said: “How do you isolate someone in your office? How do you transport them? What do you do for the day and a half while you wait for a test to confirm the diagnosis? Do you close your office? Do you isolate your staff? Do you need to have the office decontaminated?”

Physicians are also asking whether other outpatient settings, like dental offices and labs that draw blood for testing, should take precautions, and whether contact tracing is necessary if a patient in a waiting area is found to be infected.

“We don’t have clarity,” Mr. Katz said. “We have some guidance, but there are a lot of gaps in the information.”

Guidelines from New York City’s health department urge outpatient health care providers to ask patients about symptoms and travel, but not necessarily before the visit.

Dr. Varma, the disease control official at the department, suggested that doctors who saw many patients from West African countries where Ebola was rampant may want to screen patients by telephone. But, he said, “the risk is not the same on the Upper East Side compared with the Little Liberia neighborhood in Staten Island. Providers should use their judgment.”

Several health care systems have developed more stringent guidelines for physicians and other outpatient settings in their networks. North Shore-LIJ Health System tells front desk staff members to ask patients about symptoms and international travel before scheduling their appointments.

Dr. Orlando said Hartford HealthCare’s outpatient facilities would screen new patients by phone, but not necessarily “an 80-year-old coming in for a blood pressure[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/blood-pressure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] check.” If a suspected Ebola patient is identified in an office, the health care system will send its environmental services team to decontaminate the office.

The Yale Medical Group has announced new recommendations requiring that outpatient facilities ask questions about recent travel as well as contact with others who have visited West Africa. The system’s computers will not let patients make appointments without the answers.

The clinic will also be buying personal protective gear to distribute to all its office locations, at significant cost, said Dr. Ronald J. Vender, the chief medical officer of the Yale Medical Group.

“It will be very expensive, and hopefully completely unnecessary, but we are going to prepare for it anyway,” Dr. Vender said. “We’re preparing for the one-in-a-million situation.”

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/greathomesanddestinations/renovating-a-home-in-a-flood-zone-without-drowning-in-debt.html] on Oct. 9 about the renovation of a home in Red Hook, Brooklyn, misidentified the material used for the garage door at the back of the house. It is glass, not plastic.

•

The Deals column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/garden/discounts-at-cucina-tavola-broadway-panhandler-artemide-and-company-c.html] in the Currents section on Oct. 9 misstated the original and discounted prices of the Demetra LED table lamp from Artemide. It was originally $635, not $1,045, and will be available through Oct. 31 for about $540, not $888.

•

Because of an editing error, a report[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/garden/hudson-valley-toile-wallpaper-from-sheila-bridges.html] in the Currents section on Oct. 9, about a wallpaper by Sheila Bridges called Hudson Toile, misstated the number of years Ms. Bridges has owned a home in the Hudson Valley. It is 15, not 20.

•

The On Location article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/greathomesanddestinations/spirits-they-can-live-with-.html] on Sept. 25, about a house in Provincetown, Mass., owned by David Bowd and Kevin O’Shea, misspelled the name of the county in England where Mr. Bowd lived. It is Staffordshire, not Stratfordshire.

An article on Friday about the experiences of an American physician, Steven Hatch, at an Ebola treatment center in Liberia misstated the circumstances surrounding a blood test for an elderly man who was examined by Dr. Hatch. The test was delayed and the sample carried an incorrect number, but there was no test mix-up that initially suggested that the man was infected with Ebola.

White House Fence-Jumper Is Met With an Unmuzzled Response

Good Thursday morning from Washington, where, with 12 days to go until midterm elections, Republicans are maintaining a 67 percent chance[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/] of retaking the Senate. President Obama is turning to a team of scientists for new ideas on battling Ebola, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is making yet another trip[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/03/?entry=mb-4] to Iowa, and the White House’s fence remains as penetrable as ever.

With faith in Washington ebbing, the two most popular government employees on Thursday morning are surely a pair of dogs.

As most government employees were heading home from work on Wednesday night, and many Americans were tuning in to the World Series, two Belgian Malinois were on the job at the White House. The reputation of the Secret Service and the credibility of its new chief, Joseph Clancy,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/retired-veteran-of-presidents-detail-will-temporarily-lead-secret-service.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As] were riding on eight paws.

The K-9s, who had spent years training as attack dogs, are part of a beefed-up guard that the Secret Service has put in place since a fence-jumper made it to the East Room[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/us/white-house-intruder-got-farther-than-first-reported-official-says.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As] last month after rushing across the North Lawn and through the unlocked North Portico doors.

The new security procedures were put to the test at 7:15 last night, when 23-year-old Dominic Adesanya, of Bel Air, Md., climbed that same Pennsylvania Avenue fence. Last time, Secret Service agents failed to release the dogs. This time, they didn’t.

Showing the sort of teamwork notably absent from the nation’s capital, the dogs stopped Mr. Adesanya from getting anywhere near the front door. But he fought back, kicking one of the dogs before being knocked down by the other. He struggled to his feet, picked up the second dog, threw it to the ground and punched it repeatedly[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/22/?entry=3333]. Officers moved in to handcuff him.

The dogs were immediately taken to a veterinarian by the Secret Service. They had gnawed Mr. Adesanya so severely that he had to be taken to the hospital.

The bad news for the Secret Service is this: The agency’s new measures failed to prevent the fence from being scaled.

Now the good news: The intruder was stopped.

– Michael S. Schmidt

Elizabeth Warren Warms Up for Another Shot to Beat Scott Brown

For Senator Elizabeth Warren, Scott P. Brown’s run for the Senate in New Hampshire is as unlikely as Bergman walking into Bogart’s saloon in “Casablanca”: “Of all the gin joints … .”

“Never in a bazillion years did it cross my mind that Scott Brown would pack up and move to his vacation house in New Hampshire to run against our friend Jeanne,” Ms. Warren wrote in an email in support of Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent.

Bogart was unnerved at the unexpected turn of events; Ms. Warren appears to be relishing it.

She has already defeated Mr. Brown once, in Massachusetts in 2012. His campaign next door in New Hampshire gives Ms. Warren a chance, as she put it, “to make sure our neighbors know as much about Scott Brown’s record as the voters of Massachusetts did when they decided to turn him out.”

She heads to New Hampshire on Saturday to campaign with Ms. Shaheen and spread the message: “We can beat him.”

The Brown campaign is counterprogramming with appearances by Republicans like Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire’s other senator, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who as a presidential candidate has enjoyed significant support from the state’s crucial independents.

– Katharine Q. Seelye

$4 Billion in Election Spending? That’s a Lot of Candy Corn.

Every campaign season breaks spending records. So it’s hardly a surprise that the midterms are shaping up to be the most expensive ever — more than $4 billion[http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/10/election-to-cost-nearly-4-billion-crp-projects-topping-previous-midterms/] spent on congressional races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

That number can be hard to fathom. So by way of comparison:

• It’s bigger than the annual economic output of 35 countries[http://databank.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/data/download/GDP.pdf].

• You’d have to add the market value of the Boston Red Sox ($1.5 billion), San Francisco Giants ($2 billion) and Kansas City Royals ($500 million) to reach that figure[http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2014/03/26/baseball-team-values-2014-led-by-new-york-yankees-at-2-5-billion/].

• It’s roughly the annual budget of the Army Corps of Engineers, one of the biggest public construction operations in the world, with more than 35,000 employees.

As vicious and annoying as campaign ads can be, the billions give a jolt, however small, to the economy, providing thousands of jobs in consulting, advertising and other fields.

Besides, Americans will spend nearly twice that amount[https://nrf.com/resources/halloween-headquarters] this year on Halloween costumes, decorations and candy.

– David S. Joachim

World Series Causes a Rift Among House Democrats

We know how much Representative Nancy Pelosi of California loves baseball. She often sports the orange and black of the San Francisco Giants during the season and has been spotted at more than a few playoff games.

But the upstart Kansas City Royals have their own Democratic superfan: Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, who is in his fifth term from Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District and who owns six of the team’s jerseys. He can recite the Royals roster and has been to countless games, including all three home games of the Royals’ last World Series, in 1985.

On Tuesday, his Twitter followers were told of a pending “important announcement.” Hours later, he posted a video of himself[http://instagram.com/p/udsX8zyOOv/?modal=true] decked out in Royals gear and taunting the House minority leader: “Ring around the rosie, it’s time to beat Pelosi.” (The two have a friendly bet[http://www.kmbc.com/news/cleaver-pelosi-make-friendly-wager-over-world-series/29199930] involving San Francisco chocolates and Kansas City barbecue.)

Tickets in Kansas City are so hot that Mr. Cleaver was able to snag seats only for Game 6. He said he would watch earlier games “on television and prepare to receive my candy from Nancy Pelosi.”

“I don’t want to be a good winner,” he added. “I wanna rub it in.”

– Nick Corasaniti

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama is bringing together his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to help come up with new ideas for combating Ebola.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is back in Iowa, giving the campaign of Joni Ernst, the Republican Senate hopeful, a push.

Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a potential presidential candidate, is making two campaign stops and attending a fund-raiser for Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina.

Secretary of State John Kerry will be talking about work-life balance at an event at the State Department[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/appt/2014/10/233280.htm] at 12:15 p.m.

Paul Has a Foreign Policy. And Now It Has a Name.

Senator Rand Paul’s foreign policy is getting a rebranding.

Assailed by many of the Republican Party’s hawks as too soft on defense — or as an “isolationist,” a term he loathes — Mr. Paul is giving his worldview a new name: Conservative Realism.

That is the title of a speech he will give Thursday evening to the Center for the National Interest in New York, the institute founded by Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Paul will call for a robust national defense and a prudent approach to engaging overseas. He will say the American military should not be overextended and on the ground in too many places. And he will assert that Congress needs to play a larger role in shaping how the nation commits its forces.

“France doesn’t send our men and women in uniform to war,” Mr. Paul will say, according to a preview of the speech his staff provided to First Draft. “The United Nations doesn’t send our soldiers to war. Congress, and only Congress, can constitutionally initiate war.”

– Jeremy W. Peters

What We’re Reading Elsewhere

New York magazine says a Republican-controlled Senate could be a “shutdown nightmare.”[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/what-happens-when-republicans-take-the-senate.html]

Bloomberg Politics profiles Vincent Harris [http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-10-22/the-man-who-invented-the-republican-internet], the 26-year-old whose digital talents helped Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, win his seat. The article calls him “the man who invented the Republican Internet.”

Michelle Nunn has gained traction[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/washwire/2014/10/22/politics-counts-why-outsourcing-attacks-hit-home-in-georgia/] in the Georgia Senate race by attacking her opponent, David Perdue, for outsourcing jobs, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Mia Love, who is expected to win a congressional seat from Utah, may be “the great black G.O.P. hope,”[http://www.ebony.com/news-views/is-mia-love-the-great-black-gop-hope-403#axzz3GvvDOUSx] Ebony magazine says.

Pittsburgh City Paper details how, and why, Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania[http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/monster-upset-tom-wolf-has-tom-corbett-and-the-gops-gubernatorial-legacy-on-the-run/Content?oid=1786045] fell so far behind in the polls.

Work has started on a movie about Dan Rather and his infamous report on George W. Bush‘s Air National Guard[http://variety.com/2014/film/news/dan-rather-political-drama-truth-to-shoot-in-australia-1201337022/] service, Variety reports. It will star Robert Redford and Cate Blanchett.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Questions in Canada.

Canadian police officials said today there was only one gunman [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/world/americas/ottawa-canada-parliament-attack.html]in the shootings in Ottawa[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/world/americas/canada-parliament-gunfire.html] that left an assailant and a soldier dead.

The man who killed a guard at the tomb of the unknown soldier was identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a convert to Islam.

The attack in the nation’s capital heightened fears that Canada was targeted for its support of the global fight against the Islamic State.

• Europe’s agenda.

More funds to fight the Ebola virus, which has killed nearly 5,000 people, will be sought at the meeting of European Union heads of government today and Friday in Brussels.

But the main topics are meant to be climate change targets[http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-summit-climate-change-ebola-ukraine/26651540.html] and Ukraine’s access to Russian gas supplies[http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope/2014/10/23/eu-leaders-meet-for-a-gas/] for the winter.

• Blackwater legacy.

Four security guards for the government contractor Blackwater Worldwide spent the night in jail[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/us/blackwater-verdict.html] after their murder and manslaughter convictions Wednesday.

A jury found that their killing of 17 Iraqis in a Baghdad square in 2007 was criminal and not an act of war.

• Quarantines in Connecticut.

Nine people in Connecticut who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus are being quarantined at home and monitored[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/nyregion/9-in-connecticut-being-watched-for-symptoms-of-ebola.html] by health authorities.

Three are Yale University students and the others are from one family. At least some had traveled to West Africa.

A Texas task force on Ebola holds a public hearing today, as two Dallas nurses who contracted the disease remain hospitalized.

• Corruption cases.

Only four of 34 countries are prosecuting international bribery, 15 years after they signed a global anti-bribery convention, the nonprofit Transparency International said today[http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/23/australia-slow-to-tackle-international-corruption-with-just-one-case-in-court].

While the United States, Britain, Switzerland and Germany are actively investigating corruption, more than half of the countries are doing “nothing or little.”[http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/23/australia-slow-to-tackle-international-corruption-with-just-one-case-in-court]

• Success, this time.

Two Secret Service dogs stopped a 23-year-old Maryland man on the grounds of the White House[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/23/?entry=3372] around 7 p.m. Wednesday after he scaled a fence on Pennsylvania Avenue.

• Under fire.

The suspended speaker of the South Carolina House, accused of using campaign funds for personal use[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/10/23/indicted-south-carolina-house-speaker-to-resign/], pleaded guilty[http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/26873905/bobby-harrell-pleads-guilty-to-six-counts-of-misuse-of-campaign-funds-resigns-from-house] to criminal charges today and resigned from the legislature.

• Barnstorming.

Less than two weeks before the midterm elections, the first lady will be in Colorado[http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2014/10/22/things-know-michelle-obamas-visit-csu/17733051/] campaigning for Senator Mark Udall. The vice president[http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2014/10/20/vp-biden-to-hold-rally-for-nolan-in-hibbing/] and Hillary Rodham Clinton[http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/279768412.html] make stops in Minnesota for Democratic candidates.

Jeb Bush goes to South Carolina[http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/22/3761198_jeb-bush-stumping-for-gov-nikki.html?rh=1] for the Republican governor, Nikki Haley, and Marco Rubio stumps for G.O.P. candidates[http://nhgop.org/events/event/1623-senate-pac-reception-with-senator-marco-rubio] in New Hampshire.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are well higher on earnings from Caterpillar and others after a downer Wednesday. European shares closed with a mild rally, and Asian indexes ended slightly lower.

• Unilever, the maker of Dove soaps, Lipton teas and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, posted weak results[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-23/unilever-posts-slowest-quarterly-sales-growth-since-2009-on-asia.html], while Credit Suisse said third-quarter profits more than doubled[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/credit-suisse-profit-more-than-doubles-in-third-quarter/].

Other earnings today include Amazon[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/technology/amazon-spends-and-grows-but-still-wants-for-money.html], Microsoft[http://www.forbes.com/sites/narrativescience/2014/10/22/decline-expected-for-microsoft-earnings/], G.M.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/business/gm-posts-solid-third-quarter-earnings-exceeding-expectations.html], 3M[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/3m-3rd-quarter-net-income-percent-26395891], Comcast[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/business/media/comcast-reports-rise-in-third-quarter-earnings.html], United Continental[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/ual-results-idUSL3N0SI43Z20141023] and Southwest Airlines[http://www.cnbc.com/id/102111853].

• The chairman of Tesco, the world’s second-largest retailer behind Walmart, is stepping down[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/business/international/tesco-plc-chairman-richard-broadbent-profits.html] after the company said it overstated its first-half profit by more than originally estimated.

• Nissan recalled 260,000 vehicles today over a defect in driver-side airbags made by Takata. U.S. regulators expanded the number of Takata-equipped vehicles that may be affected to 7.8 million.

NOTEWORTHY

• Spicing up the Series.

In a game that featured a heated exchange between players[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-kansas-city-royals-beat-sf-giants-in-game-2.html], the Royals evened the World Series with a 7-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Kansas City. Game 3 is in San Francisco on Friday.

• Art, deflated.

The leading fair for contemporary art, called FIAC[http://www.fiac.com/paris/en], opens in Paris[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/arts/international/fiac-the-paris-contemporary-art-fair-is-adding-satellite-events.html] today minus one exhibit: a huge inflatable green sculpture outside the Hotel Ritz that some critics panned as an oversized sex toy[http://www.france24.com/en/20141021-paris-art-extravaganza-butt-plug-picasso-fiac-orsay-louvre-louis-vuitton-france/].

The American artist Paul McCarthy decided to scrap the display after vandals unplugged its air pump[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/paul-mccarthys-sex-toy-sculpture-removed-permanently-from-place-vendome-in-paris] — and after he was slapped on the street by a detractor.

• Musician and, now, author.

Herbie Hancock is a keynote speaker tonight at the Boston Book Festival,[http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/10/20/what-new/OC4uZ1HJ2gYXe9XgplaE7O/story.html] where he will talk about “Possibilities,” the new memoir of his jazz career.

On Friday night, the Jazz Foundation of Americahonors the musician[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/quincy-jones-jazz-foundation-america-110000540.html] with its lifetime achievement award at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.

• Their games can begin.

Kosovo can send a team to the 2016 Olympic Games[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/olympics_2016/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Rio de Janeiro. The Olympics Committee cleared the country despite opposition from Serbia, from which Kosovo declared independence in 2008.

• No smoking.

The maker of Camel cigarettes will ban smoking[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/business/maker-of-camel-cigarettes-to-end-smoking-in-its-offices.html] in its buildings next year.

BACK STORY

Today is Mole Day.

Not the furry, subterranean type of mole. Today’s celebrations extol the glories of a number beloved among chemists.

Just as farmers count eggs in dozens, scientists count atoms and molecules by moles[http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/quantchem/moleavo.html]. It takes just 12 things to make a dozen, but nearly a trillion trillion (6.02×10²³) to make one mole.

That’s why National Mole Day starts at 6:02 on 10/23.

It is one of a wave of geeky holidays set decades ago. There’s a Square Root Day[http://www.squarerootday.net/] (3/3/09, 4/4/16, etc.). Pi Day[http://www.piday.org/] comes on 3/14.

The National Mole Day Foundation (established in 1991) sets up an annual theme — this year’s is “Mole-O’Ween”[http://www.moleday.org/index.php/past-themes.html] — and a variety of projects to promote chemistry education.

YouTube has a surprisingly large section of mole tribute videos, many with a distinct “my chem teacher made us make Mole Day projects” vibe.

We’re especially fond of the Mole Day Rap[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwjGot_prOs], featuring these immortal lyrics: “A mole is a unit/it’s a unit/yeah, that’s the only fact I’ve found.”

Stacy Cowley and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.

Tucked away in the forested hills of Bong County, Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], something strange has sprouted: a bright patch of makeshift blue tents and plastic orange barriers. Within, about 150 nurses, doctors, cleaners, drivers and laborers are joined in one battle against the deadliest Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in modern history.

This short documentary follows three of those workers. A nurse quietly nurtures the sick. A doctor swelters underneath his protective suit. A local man lends his muscle, digging grave after grave.

The 70-bed clinic is funded by the United States Agency for International Development, was built by the nonprofit group Save the Children and is operated by the International Medical Corps[http://internationalmedicalcorps.org/ebola-emergency-response], a Los Angeles-based charity. Each day brings tragedy and hope. A baby is buried[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/africa/heart-rending-test-in-ebola-zone-a-baby.html] beside her mother. A patient who has survived the disease is released. A worker dreams of the moment, perhaps far in the future, when he will tell his children how he helped vanquish Ebola.

Workers at the International Medical Corps treatment center in Suakoko, Liberia, use faith, hard work and caution as they face a stream of sick people in this remote hilltop east of Monrovia. | Ben C. Solomon

Can You Get Ebola From a Bowling Ball?

Q: Can you get Ebola from a bowling ball?

A. Dr. Craig Spencer, the patient with Ebola currently in isolation in Bellevue Hospital, went bowling in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn on Wednesday evening. According to city health officials, he had been taking his temperature twice a day since he left Guinea on Oct. 14. His temperature was normal on Wednesday evening, and he did not yet have any other symptoms, such as nausea or diarrhea. Ebola experts say the disease cannot be transmitted before the appearance of symptoms.

Although the surface of a shared bowling ball is a likely place to find germs — and some people avoid bowling for this very reason — it is extremely unlikely that Ebola could be passed that way. There is no evidence that it has been passed, as colds or flu sometimes are, by touching surfaces that someone else touched after sneezing into their hand. Ebola is normally passed through contact with blood, vomit or diarrhea.

If someone left blood, vomit or feces on a bowling ball, and the next person to touch it did not even notice, and then put his fingers into his eyes, nose or mouth, it might be possible. But, the Ebola virus does not not normally build up to high levels in saliva or mucus until very late in the disease — several days after the initial fever sets in — and it is unlikely that someone that ill would have just gone bowling. Also, the Ebola virus is fragile and susceptible to drying out. It does not normally survive for more than a few hours on a hard, dry surface.

Good blustery Thursday morning to you.

Little did you know as the rain fell last night that you were living through a record-breaking storm.

But there it was: the rainiest Oct. 22 ever recorded in New York City, 1.51 inches worth, beating the high of 1.45 inches set in 1984.

Your reward for enduring this ordeal is one more rainy day[http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&lon=-73.96940231323242#.U7NsoS8ohI6], courtesy of the coastal low that drifted up from off the Delmarva Peninsula.

“It’s just going to meander southeast of us throughout the day,” said Michael Silva of the National Weather Service.

No records will tumble, but we could see another half-inch by the time the rain tapers[http://curiousanimals.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/mam-20and-20baby-small1.jpg] around lunchtime, more on Long Island, where nearly 2,000 homes[https://www.psegliny.com/c.cfm/Outage?stop_mobi=yes] are without power.

It will be raw, too, with 20-mile-an-hour winds gusting to nearly 40 and making it feel a lot chillier than the high of 58 degrees.

Today makes 11 days out of 23 in October with measurable rainfall. We’ve already received more than a month’s worth.

That goes a long way toward wiping out the near-drought[http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?NY] that had descended upon the region after a bone-dry late summer[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/new-york-today-the-rain-weve-missed/].

For Trick or Treaters, Skip the Candy and Give Cash

Last year, a man in New Jersey met each child who came to his door on October 31 with $1.50 in quarters, pre-rolled.

When my brother-in-law told me about this fellow, it was like a door opened in part of my brain. What if lots of people handed out money on Halloween? What sort of lessons could we teach as children figured out what to do with it? What kinds of conversations might it inspire?

I mused about it on Facebook[https://www.facebook.com/ronlieberauthor/posts/710428362373025] and got some comeuppance relatively quickly: Why does everything need to have a lesson? Must grown-ups update every childhood tradition to imbue it with teaching moments? And what is so wrong with just letting kids gorge themselves on treats once in a while?

But then there were some fond recollections. Turns out the guy in New Jersey was not an innovator at all. Plenty of people have taken fun, clever approaches to giving money away in lieu of candy on Halloween.

Kay H. Kamin, the mother of an old friend of mine, has for years put out 400 pennies and told kids to take whatever they thought a piece of candy would normally cost. No limits. Some years, the trick-or-treaters in her Chicago neighborhood have cleaned her out, but there have been leftover coins too. The current market price at Target is about a dime,[http://www.target.com/p/nestle-harvest-minis-butterfinger-baby-ruth-crunch-19-75-oz/-/A-16193395#prodSlot=medium_1_9&term=halloween+candy] in case you were wondering.

Ms. Kamin, an attorney and financial planner, noted that this approach is cheaper for parents than buying lots of candy. It appeals to kids with food allergies as well, who may not be able to eat the mini Almond Joy bar.

In the 1980s, the house in Springfield, N.J., that gave out pennies was on Henshaw Avenue, according to Kathleen Farrell, who now lives with her family in Wellington, Fla. There were 10 coins, pre-wrapped in aluminum foil. Often they were old, so old that some of them were wheat pennies or the treasured non-copper kind from the World War II era.

I heard from a handful of people who give out money if they run out of candy. But a more common approach nowadays seems to be to buy the bag full of candy off the kids a day or two into November. Micaela Gunther and her husband, who live in Eureka, Calif., pay $.25 per item for Halloween candy (and anything that arrives home from a birthday party, having fallen out of a piñata). Other parents, who intend to eat the candy themselves, might offer a higher price for the best stuff, like any full-size candy bar or a favored brand. Haggle some, just for the fun of seeing where children set the price points and how low they will go.

Many dentists[http://www.halloweencandybuyback.com/] are in on the act too, offering cash, toothbrushes or coupons at local businesses in exchange for Halloween candy. They then ship the candy off to members of the United States armed forces serving outside of the country.

The Halloween haul would probably not be the object of parental confiscation if it wasn’t almost entirely candy. Sure, collecting coins and nothing else around the neighborhood wouldn’t be much fun for many children. But imagine if, say, 25 percent or 50 percent of the homes did something fun with money?

Children would bring home a more reasonable amount of sweets. Split among the grown-ups in the house, too, it probably wouldn’t add up to more than a few pieces a day per person for a week or two. And if 10 or 20 houses on the route gave out money instead, kids would have enough to put toward something more substantial.

One money tradition has long been part of Halloween. The Unicef boxes are still available, and the organization has Ebola-relief efforts up and running. Children could also make their own box and pass the money they collect on to Doctors Without Borders or local people in need. If they’re bold enough to ask for donations in lieu of, or even in addition to candy, their take is likely to be pretty high.

Earlier this week, I mentioned to my 8-year-old daughter the idea of giving money away instead of candy. Her judgment was swift. “Dad,” she said. “No.”

But she eventually warmed to the idea of surprising a few lucky kids. We’ll have the usual selection of name-brand mini candy bars in three large bowls. Tucked away at the bottom, however, will be a handful of folded $2 bills, waiting for children who are paying close attention and curious enough to dig them out.

Will they choose to take them, rather than a piece of candy worth 5 percent as much? It seems like an easy call to us. Though I won’t let them escape without a quick conversation about what they want or need most and how the money will help get them there.

Investors Are Eager for African Sovereign Debt, Despite Plenty of Risks

Five men in dark business suits gathered before Maria Kiwanuka in a semicircle. They were international bankers and they had a pitch to make.

Ms. Kiwanuka, the finance minister of Uganda, was sitting up on a small riser, her bright pink and gold dress a sharp contrast to the men’s suits.

Bankers are jockeying for the next sovereign debt deal in Africa, a continent that foreign investors have long been wary of for its economic woes, rampant poverty and political instability. Now that narrative is changing, and one sub-Saharan nation after another is jumping into the debt market.

The Ebola outbreak, which is ravaging West Africa, could cost $33 billion, the World Bank estimated, prompting worries about the continent’s growth prospects. But the sovereign debt market is booming, with sub-Saharan African countries raising nearly $7 billion so far this year, more than in all of 2013, according to Dealogic, a market research firm.

The yields on many of the new bonds in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria have dipped even as the Ebola crisis has intensified. That means that the market’s outlook for those countries has improved, although that could change, particularly for West African countries, if health officials’ warnings for the region turn increasingly dire.

The pitch to Ms. Kiwanuka took place at the London office of Standard Bank, based in Johannesburg, during an African investment conference the lender hosted this summer. Only a few days before, the bank was one of three to manage Kenya’s $2 billion debut in the sovereign debt market. Now, it wanted to do the same for Uganda.

“They’re about to make the hard sell,” said an executive in the room, who was watching from a distance.

Uganda could use the money for power plants, rail lines, roads or similar projects it has planned. Countries around the continent are generally using proceeds from the bond sales to improve infrastructure, restructure debt and finance deficits.

Rwanda, for instance, is finishing a convention center and building a new hydropower plant. Senegal is fixing roads and the electric grid. Kenya is expanding its ports and railway system, as well as paying off a higher-cost loan.

After the meeting, Ms. Kiwanuka said such pitches had become routine.

“They do want us, and I am flattered that they are acknowledging our macroeconomic stability, because no one wants to get in bed with a basket case,” she said. “I don’t see the sovereign bond as the end of the story. It’s just a tool to get things sorted.”

African nations have been borrowing in a variety of ways over the years, issuing bonds on their domestic market and taking out loans directly from foreign banks, as well as relying on aid from foreign governments.

But they have also been known in the West for their inability to repay debts because of wars, political upheaval and economic tumult, leading the U2 singer Bono and the Live Aid founder Bob Geldof to campaign in years past for lenders to forgive African debts. Many sub-Saharan nations are still unrated by the major credit ratings agencies.

Sovereign bonds, which are typically denominated in dollars, can be a far cheaper way to raise money than local lending rates, though they are more expensive than direct aid or low-rate loans from government aid groups, which often come with oversight requirements. Before 2006, only South Africa had issued a sovereign bond. Now more than a dozen sub-Saharan countries have tested the market.

“It shows the opening up of Africa to private capital. It shows that private capital is replacing development aid as a source of capital flows to the continent, and that’s good,” said Kingsley Chiedu Moghalu, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, in an interview. He participated in Nigeria’s promotional tour before it issued its first sovereign debt in 2011. “From the point of view of the young man sitting at a hedge fund in London, it’s a new frontier,” he said.

But it is not without pitfalls. Because they are borrowing in a foreign currency, countries can quickly find that any cost advantage disappears if their own currency weakens. And investors can become jittery, going suddenly cold on regions, as happened with emerging markets after the Federal Reserve started pulling back on its stimulus efforts.

The appeal to investors is clear enough. Federal Reserve policies after the financial crisis pushed interest rates to record lows, making American debt less appealing and the higher yields offered by emerging market debt more enticing. The yields on sub-Saharan debt can be more than three times as high as those on United States Treasury securities.

But investors, too, face risks. Among other concerns, many sub-Saharan countries have a history of fragile institutions and corruption, and some countries have defaulted on other forms of debt. Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, restructured its debt four times from 1986 to 2000 but defaulted on the agreements nonetheless, according to its debt management office.

“My belief is always that you’re a successful participant in the international capital markets not when you’ve issued your first bond, but when you’ve repaid it, and that time is still to come for all of those large bond issuances,” said Moritz Kraemer, the chief sovereign ratings officer at Standard & Poor’s, in an interview.

Sometimes it is not always clear what the money will be used for. Mozambique’s foray into the market last year was controversial. The country set up a tuna fishing company that raised $850 million through bond offerings, but the International Monetary Fund has raised questions about whether the proceeds were being used for more than tuna boats and asked for more transparency.

For now, bond investors seem relatively unfazed by the potential economic fallout from the Ebola epidemic. While the countries hardest hit — Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone — have not issued sovereign bonds, Ivory Coast, which borders both Liberia and Guinea, received a warm reception when it returned to the market in mid-July. Even now, the yields on its bonds are only modestly higher than when they came to market.

“Right now, market conditions are such that lowly rated sovereigns can get access,” said Mr. Kraemer. For a while during the eurozone crisis investors could earn a higher interest rate from Spanish bonds than from those of Zambia, he said. “From our perspective, given what our ratings are, that makes no sense at all.”

Many institutions and people, including the International Monetary Fund and Joseph Stiglitz, a winner of the Nobel in economic science, have urged caution.

Mark Roland Thomas, an economist and Africa expert at the World Bank, said the trend “does say something genuine and true about the progress Africa has made in the last couple of decades.”

But he added: “Does it create more challenges and does it mean that macroeconomic management has become more complicated? Does it mean that relatively small economies are now more exposed to international economic conditions? Yes, and our clients are aware of that.”

Demand remains strong, though prices vary.

Ghana returned to the sovereign debt market last month, even as it seeks help from the I.M.F. The country, which in the past has been seen as a beacon of stability, has looked shakier of late. Protesters took to the streets of Accra, Ghana’s capital, this summer as its currency plummeted and inflation soared.

Mr. Kraemer of Standard & Poor’s called Ghana “a cautionary tale.”

Richard Segal, an analyst at Jefferies, said, “Typically, the idea is you would have discussions with the I.M.F. and have them be conclusive, have the I.M.F. make recommendations, have the loan program in place, and then go to the markets.”

But investors flocked to the bond offering anyway, showing more faith than a leading opposition politician who warned that the proceeds would be squandered. Ghana raised about $1 billion with a coupon, or interest rate, of 8.125 percent on a bond coming due in 2026; it is now trading just below 8 percent, compared to about 2.3 percent for an analogous United States Treasury bond.

Ivory Coast priced a 10-year bond more favorably this summer at 5.6 percent, despite defaulting three years ago during a civil war. Investors have become more bullish since the fighting ended and political tensions have eased. The yield on the bond is now slightly above 6 percent.

Uganda, though, is remaining on the sidelines, at least for now.

“Our debt service is still below 10 percent of our total budget,” Ms. Kiwanuka said. “We don’t want it to spiral.”

Fearing Ebola, North Korea Won’t Accept Tourists

For those who have been looking forward to that long-planned getaway to Pyongyang, there’s bad news.

Fearful that Ebola could find a foothold in North Korea, officials in the reclusive country have abruptly shut down its small and tightly-controlled tourism industry.

“We have just been informed by our partners in North Korea that tomorrow North Korea will stop accepting international tourists due to the threat of the Ebola virus, effectively closing its borders,” the Beijing-based tour operator Koryo Tours told followers on Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/koryotours]. The announcement was also sent in an email to prospective customers.A more frugal travel company in the North Korea market, Young Pioneer Tours [http://www.youngpioneertours.com/], which boasts of being the first operator to “offer budget tours to the Democratic Republic of Korea,” posted a similar message on its website. It said that “tourists of any country, regardless of where they have visited, will be temporarily suspended from entering North Korea.”

There was no word on how long Pyongyang intends to quarantine itself from the world. Beset by sanctions from the West, Pyongyang has come to rely heavily on the cash tourists inject into the economy.

North Korea may not be on any mainstream top-ten honeymoon destination lists. Still, each year, a few thousand adventure seekers hop on flights from Beijing to Pyongyang eager to catch a glimpse of one of the world’s most hermetic and enigmatic societies. Upon arriving, tourists are kept on tight leashes and may not roam around the countryside, lest they take a wrong road and stumble into a gulag. (No photos, please)

Having recently secured the release [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/world/asia/north-korea-jeffrey-fowle-kim-jong-un.html] of one of three American citizens being held in North Korea, the Ebola travel ban will probably delight the State Department. Its travel warning [http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/north-korea-travel-warning.html] for the country notes that United States citizens have been “subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention,” even when they entered the country with a valid visa.

U.S. to monitor travelers from nations hit by Ebola

United States health officials have placed new restrictions on travelers from West African countries with Ebola outbreaks, requiring that they report their temperatures daily for three weeks, along with any other potential symptoms of the disease.

The regulations, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are meant to monitor everyone at risk of developing Ebola symptoms from an infection acquired overseas, while not shutting the borders and not overwhelming state and local health departments with having to hunt down hundreds of newly arrived visitors.

The announcement Wednesday came amid good news about two nurses who became infected after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the Ebola patient who died in Texas on Oct. 8.

Family members of one nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, said they had been told that her body was clear of the virus and that she was being moved out of isolation. The other nurse, Nina Pham, had her condition upgraded to good from fair on Tuesday.

The new federal rules take effect on Monday. All travelers who have visited Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone will be required to provide home and email addresses, telephone numbers and other contact details for themselves and at least one friend or relative.

Once a day for the next 21 days, they will have to check in with their state or local health departments and report their morning and evening temperatures and list any other symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches or bleeding.

State and local health departments will be required to have plans for finding and potentially detaining anyone who fails to check in. On arrival at an airport, each of those travelers will receive a packet with a thermometer, a card describing Ebola symptoms and a card to be given to a doctor or nurse if the traveler develops symptoms and is ordered to go to a hospital.

The new restrictions apply to citizens of every country, including the United States. ‘‘They include C.D.C. employees, journalists, everyone,’’ Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the executive director of the centers, said in a telephone news conference.

In Washington, President Obama praised the C.D.C.’s plan and said the government ‘‘would continue to put in place additional measures as they make sense.’’ His remarks came after an hourlong meeting with top advisers, including his new ‘‘Ebola czar,’’ Ron Klain, a former chief of staff for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

North Korea has announced that it will not accept any foreign tourists beginning Friday because of fear of the Ebola virus, Choe Sang-Hun in Seoul, South Korea, reported three agencies that take tourists to the isolated country as saying on Thursday.

The news came as the country said it was stepping up inspections and quarantine measures at its airport, borders and ports to guard against the spread of the deadly virus, which has killed thousands of people in the latest outbreak.

‘‘Three days ago, they said that anybody who’s been to West Africa would have to provide a doctor’s certificate stating that they don’t have Ebola,’’ said Gareth Johnson of Young Pioneer Tours, a travel operator based in China. ‘‘And then today, they just said no foreign tourists at all.’’

Dr. Nancy Snyderman Encouraged to Take a Break From NBC News
By BILL CARTER

NBC News appears to be looking for time and the intrusion of other news stories to tamp down negative attention that has surrounded its chief medical editor, Dr. Nancy Snyderman, following news that she violated a self-imposed quarantine after being potentially exposed to Ebola in Liberia.

The network’s news president, Deborah Turness, issued a memo to staff members on Wednesday that included the announcement that Dr. Snyderman would take a break from her duties. (The network subsequently emphasized that this move was not a suspension.)

Ms. Turness told the staff that the longtime medical journalist had finished her 21-day quarantine and was symptom free, but that she and those who had traveled with her to Liberia had been encouraged to “take some time with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives.” Ms. Turness said they would return “next month.”

She couched that decision in positive terms, saying the news organization would “look forward” to that return. And she pointedly praised Dr. Snyderman’s work on the Ebola outbreak as “first class, firsthand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story.”

Critics in the media and in some health care circles had taken Dr. Snyderman to task when news reports said she had been seen outside her home in New Jersey during the period when she had said she would restrict her public activities. State health officials in New Jersey quickly imposed a mandatory quarantine on her. In a subsequent statement, Dr. Snyderman did not directly acknowledge that she violated the voluntary quarantine, but said instead that “members of our group” had.

In an Associated Press story this week, Kelly McBride, a co-author of “The New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century” who comments on journalism ethics for the Poynter Institute, said that in the future “some news consumers are going to see the woman who put others at risk, rather than the reporter and professional with great experience.”

At the same time, many NBC executives and staff members spoke highly of Dr. Snyderman, whose career in network news began at ABC 25 years ago. (She joined NBC News in 2006.)

The move this week to reduce her profile could also be seen as a plan to keep her out of the public eye until the Ebola crisis has subsided and other news has seized public attention. On Wednesday, the attack on the Canadian Parliament dropped the Ebola stories out of the lead position in most news reports, and next week the midterm elections are expected to be the biggest story.

Paul Allen to Give $100 Million to Tackle Ebola Crisis

The billionaire Paul G. Allen said on Thursday that he would donate $100 million to the fight against Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which has killed almost 5,000 people so far and crippled Western Africa.

The amount roughly quadruples his earlier commitment of about $26 million to nonprofit groups and government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], making him one of the largest individual donors in the Ebola crisis.

“Everybody feels called sometimes to really pursue a certain thing that resonates with them, and this has resonated with me,” Mr. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.

He said when he first began hearing about the Ebola outbreak in July, he had a “nagging sense” that it could spiral out of control. “We’re up against an extremely tough opponent here,” he said. “The exponential nature of the growth of this disease is really a challenge — we’ve already seen in the U.S. where one case quickly became two.”

Ebola has stymied the nonprofit fund-raising machine, which quickly floods inboxes, social media and airwaves with solicitations after a major disaster strikes. But in the aftermath of a flood or earthquake, there is a promise of recovery, whereas the odds of recovering from Ebola are daunting and the type of assistance needed that would make a difference is less clear.

Mr. Allen has created a website, www.TackleEbola.com[http://www.TackleEbola.com], to direct small donors to projects that need financing, like 6,000 hand-washing stations or beds for a center treating patients infected with the virus, and he is underwriting the administrative costs of the highlighted projects. The website also spotlights organizations working to fight Ebola that Mr. Allen is supporting.

So far, though, it has attracted only a small number of donors. Seven donors have contributed a total of $583.66 toward the hand-washing stations, though Mr. Allen said he was hopeful that awareness was growing. He also has underwritten public service announcements and been posting on Twitter from @PaulGAllen – “Congress’ quick approval to clear $750M for Ebola confirms the need to come together to contain the virus in W Africa. Follow @TackleEbola [https://twitter.com/TackleEbola]” was his tweet on Oct. 10.

“I’m trying to galvanize and coordinate some of the different groups and the attack on some of the key issues,” he said.

Part of Mr. Allen’s money will go to the University of Massachusetts Medical School to underwrite training, medical workers and lab equipment in Liberia, where the public health system struggles for funding and many district hospitals are closed. The goal is to reopen these medical facilities so they not only can care for victims but also provide routine health care that has been all but abandoned during the crisis.

“I got a taste when I was in Kenya a while ago of what medical care was in rural Africa,” Mr. Allen said. “I was in a town of about 10,000 people, and a shipping container with a rusty microscope was their medical clinic.”

Another problem is recruitment of medical professionals, in part because there is no clearly defined system laid out for their treatment and evacuation should they become infected. Mr. Allen’s money will go toward the development of two evacuation and containment units in partnership with the United States State Department. Additional money will help the World Health Organization better coordinate the logistics involved in getting health care workers to where they are needed.

More of his money will help create a fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation designed to cover the gap between what insurance would cover should a medical professional need evacuation and the actual cost.

“This is really more about trying to attack every element of this problem,” Mr. Allen said. “This disease expands at an exponential rate, so there is a need for exponentially more health care workers.”

Mr. Allen, who can be shy, has been a quiet philanthropist, giving away some $1.5 billion of his wealth through a family foundation he established with his sister, Jody. His philanthropy has backed institutes for brain science and artificial intelligence, and he has also given money for the School for Global Animal Health at Washington State University.

He also has supported causes and interests through a film company called Vulcan Productions (in a nod to Mr. Allen’s passion for space travel) that has produced documentaries like “Girl Rising” and television series like “Strange Days on Planet Earth.”

In 2005, “Rx For Survival: A Global Health Challenge,” produced by Vulcan and narrated by Brad Pitt, was shown on PBS. Ebola was one of the challenges facing the world that was covered in the series.

But it was perhaps an earlier contribution to underwrite research on an Ebola vaccine at Kansas State University that prompted his interest in and concern about the disease. “There was a vaccine that got developed and was tried in chimps, but its efficacy was never tested,” he said. “It was a bit of a dead end, but it planted a seed in my consciousness.”

Correction: October 23, 2014, Thursday

An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to two institutes supported by Paul Allen’s donations. The institutes for brain science and artificial intelligence that he has backed are in Seattle, not at Washington State University.

Cheaper Fuel Helps Airlines to Record Profits
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DALLAS — Saving a nickel or a dime per gallon might not seem like much to the average motorist, but for airlines that use hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel every month, it adds up quickly.

Profits are soaring at the biggest airlines, and some of the credit goes to those savings at the pump. Heading into the busy holiday travel period, the airlines expect to see even cheaper fuel prices, thanks to a recent slide in crude oil prices.

Continued strong travel demand is also allowing airlines to push fares higher, and there are no signs that Ebola is scaring away travelers.

The results were there to see Thursday, as several leading airlines reported financial results for the third quarter, which included the end of the heavy summer vacation travel season.

The world’s biggest airline operator, American Airlines, earned a $942 million profit in the third quarter, which runs from June through September. The company said it was its biggest profit ever for a quarter, and it was an 87 percent increase over the amount that American and US Airways earned separately last year before their December 2013 merger. Doug Parker, the airline’s chief executive, predicted more records for fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.

United Continental posted net income of $924 million, up from $379 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, its adjusted profit was a record $1.1 billion.

Southwest profit rose 27 percent to $329 million.

All three companies beat Wall Street expectations for earnings.

United cut its fuel bill by $135 million compared with last year’s third quarter, a reduction of 4.1 percent on its largest single expense. Southwest saved $64 million, or 4.4 percent, on fuel compared with last year — and the savings are likely to increase. The airline predicted that it would pay $2.70 to $2.75 per gallon in the fourth quarter.

Airlines could share that windfall with passengers in the form of cheaper tickets, but that does not look likely, at least not yet.

The big airlines just pushed through a modest fare increase on domestic routes even though oil prices have fallen by about one-fifth since the last such fare increase back in April. Recent mergers have reduced competition and helped the airlines limit the number of flights, making it easier to increase fares.

The four largest airlines in the United States sold at least 83 percent of their seats in the third quarter. A decade ago, more than a quarter of seats went empty.

Southwest is one of the few airlines that reports details on fares. Its average one-way price inched higher, to $160.74, an increase of $1.35 over the same time last year but up nearly $50 in the last five years, a period in which mergers reduced the number of competitors and fuel prices rose.

American, which does not give fare figures, said that the amount passengers paid to fly each mile, a figure called yield in the airline business, set a record.

Airline investors were worried by the appearance of the first cases in the United States of the deadly Ebola virus, especially the news this month that a nurse had flown on two Frontier Airlines flights shortly before testing positive. That fear started to subside last week when the chief executive of Delta Air Lines expressed confidence that authorities would prevent an outbreak at home.

On Thursday, United officials said that they saw no indication that Ebola was affecting bookings. While not addressing Ebola, the chief of Southwest, Gary Kelly, said his airline’s trend toward higher revenue had continued into October, and bookings for November and December looked good.

JetBlue Airways, which is about to change C.E.O.s, reported net income of $79 million. Its earnings and revenue both fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Alaska Air’s earnings topped Wall Street forecasts.

Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf

GALVESTON, Tex. — Almost a decade ago, scientists from Canada and the United States reported that they had created a vaccine that was 100 percent effective in protecting monkeys against the Ebola virus. The results were published in a respected journal[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/nm/journal/v11/n7/abs/nm1258.html], and health officials called them exciting. The researchers said tests in people might start within two years, and a product could potentially be ready for licensing by 2010 or 2011.

It never happened. The vaccine sat on a shelf. Only now is it undergoing the most basic safety tests in humans — with nearly 5,000 people dead from Ebola and an epidemic raging out of control in West Africa.

Its development stalled in part because Ebola is rare, and until now, outbreaks had infected only a few hundred people at a time. But experts also acknowledge that the lack of follow-up on such a promising candidate reflects a broader failure to produce medicines and vaccines for diseases that afflict poor countries. Most drug companies have resisted spending the enormous sums needed to develop products useful mostly to countries with little ability to pay.

Now, as the growing epidemic devastates West Africa and is seen as a potential threat to other regions as well, governments and aid groups have begun to open their wallets. A flurry of research to test drugs and vaccines is underway, with studies starting for several candidates, including the vaccine produced nearly a decade ago.

A federal official said in an interview on Thursday that two large studies involving thousands of patients were planned to begin soon in West Africa, and were expected to be described in detail on Friday by the World Health Organization.

With no vaccines or proven drugs available, the stepped-up efforts are a desperate measure to stop a disease that has defied traditional means of containing it.

“There’s never been a big market for Ebola vaccines,” said Thomas W. Geisbert[http://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/Geisbert.asp], an Ebola expert here at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and one of the developers of the vaccine that worked so well in monkeys. “So big pharma, who are they going to sell it to?” Dr. Geisbert added: “It takes a crisis sometimes to get people talking. ‘O.K. We’ve got to do something here.’ ”

Dr. James E. Crowe Jr.[http://crowelab.com/], the director of a vaccine research center at Vanderbilt University, said that academic researchers who developed a prototype drug or vaccine that worked in animals often encountered a “biotech valley of death” in which no drug company will help them cross the finish line.

Up to that point, the research may have cost a few million dollars, but tests in humans and scaling up production can cost hundreds of millions, and bringing a new vaccine all the way to market typically costs $1 billion to $1.5 billion, Dr. Crowe said. “Who’s going to pay for that?” he asked. “People invest in order to get money back.”

The Ebola vaccine on which Dr. Geisbert collaborated is made from another virus, V.S.V., for vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. It had already been used successfully in making other vaccines.

The researchers altered V.S.V. by removing one of its genes — rendering the virus harmless — and inserting a gene from Ebola. The transplanted gene forces V.S.V. to sprout Ebola proteins on its surface. The proteins cannot cause illness, but they provoke an immune response[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immune-response/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that in monkeys, considered a good surrogate for humans, fought off the disease.

The vaccine was actually produced in Winnipeg by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Canadian government patented it, and 800 to 1,000 vials of the vaccine were produced. In 2010, it licensed the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, to NewLink Genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], in Ames, Iowa.

The Canadian government donated the existing vials to the World Health Organization, and safety tests of the vaccine in healthy volunteers have already begun.

NewLink’s product is one of two leading vaccines being tested. The other, which uses a cold virus that infects chimpanzees, was developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline. The first tests of an earlier version of it, employing a different cold virus, began in 2003.

Several other vaccine candidates, not as far along, are also in the pipeline and may be ready for safety testing next year. Once any drugs or treatments pass the safety tests they will be available for use in larger numbers of people, and health officials are grappling with whether they should be tested for efficacy in the traditional way, in which some people at risk are given placebos instead of the active drug.

Governments and the military became interested in making vaccines against Ebola and a related virus, Marburg, during the 1990s after a Soviet defector said the Russians had found a way to weaponize Marburg and load it into warheads. Concerns intensified in 2001 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] mailings.

“The National Institutes of Health came up with a program called Partnerships in Biodefense that partnered researchers like me with companies, usually small companies,” Dr. Geisbert said.

The government money led to major advances in the laboratory, Dr. Geisbert said, but was insufficient to cover the huge costs of human trials. Nor could the small companies that were involved in the early studies in animals afford to pay for human trials. No finished product came to market.

Dr. Geisbert moved on, working on treatments for Ebola and another version of the V.S.V. vaccine. For the vaccine work, his main collaborator has been Dr. Heinz Feldmann, the chief of virology at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont., part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The newer version of the vaccine uses a slightly different form of V.S.V., one that Dr. Geisbert said he thought might be less likely to cause side effects, and more likely to gain quick approval because it has already been used as the basis for an H.I.V.[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] vaccine and is known to the Food and Drug Administration. But the new version, VesiculoVax, made by Profectus Biosciences in Baltimore, has not yet been tested in humans.

The V.S.V. products are live vaccines, with replicating viruses that may cause a reaction. It is not clear what level of side effects will be considered acceptable.

Chills and nausea are possible, Dr. Geisbert said, but he added, “Who cares, if you survive Ebola?”

Most vaccines are given to prevent disease before people are exposed to it, and the plan is to use Ebola vaccines that way. But the V.S.V. vaccines have also been shown to protect monkeys even after the animals have been exposed to a heavy dose of Ebola — if they are given soon after exposure.

Researchers hope that they will work that way for people, too. If they do, health workers and family members who have been in contact with a patient might be protected, instead of having to spend 21 days of dread, waiting to see if they get sick.

Dr. Geisbert spends much of his time working with Ebola and other deadly viruses in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory at the Galveston National Laboratory, where the researchers wear spacesuits that each come with an independent air supply, and visiting journalists are required not to report which floor the labs are on.

This month, one of his tasks is to test the Profectus vaccine and an experimental treatment against the Ebola strain that is causing the current epidemic. The virus is from a species called Ebola Zaire, against which the products have already been shown to work. But different strains within a species can vary genetically by 2 percent to 7 percent, Dr. Geisbert said.

Most of the time, those small variations do not matter, and a drug or treatment that works against one strain will work against all. But once in a while, the difference matters.

“We don’t know for 100 percent certainty until we prove it in animals,” Dr. Geisbert said. “The companies I work with are smart. They want that answer sooner rather than later, before they go investing millions of dollars to put this into humans.”

Beyond Screening for Ebola

The new monitoring rules[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/health/us-to-monitor-travelers-from-ebola-hit-nations-for-21-days.html] to be placed on travelers coming into the United States from three Ebola-affected countries in West Africa form a smart and workable response to a complex public health question. The new measures should be more effective than a misguided ban on all travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as many in Congress have been demanding.

Starting Monday in six states, and rolled out in other states soon after, travelers who visited those countries will be required to report their temperature and any other symptoms to state or local health officials daily for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the disease to develop. The officials will be responsible for finding and possibly detaining anyone violating these rules.

The domestic Ebola concerns began with the case of a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who had no temperature or other symptoms when he passed through screening in his home country and only became visibly sick after arriving in Dallas, where he died in a major hospital and infected two nurses who cared for him. The worries increased Thursday when an American doctor who had treated patients in Guinea and returned to New York tested positive for the virus.

Mr. Duncan’s case led federal officials to add a layer of screening at this end, requiring travelers to have their temperature and symptoms checked and to be questioned about possible contacts with Ebola. This week, the administration said travelers who have been in the three African nations can enter the United States only through the five airports[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/us/ebola-west-africa-united-states-flights.html] that have health screeners in place. But it is not clear that airport screening would have identified Mr. Duncan, since he was not yet ill and may not have realized he had contact with an Ebola victim. The tighter monitoring announced Wednesday, however, probably would have identified him earlier and prompted treatment that might have saved his life and reduced possible exposure.

The new measures surely make unnecessary a harmful ban on all travelers who have been in the three countries. Federal health officials say most travelers returning from those countries are either American citizens or longtime legal residents. They include volunteers who have been battling the epidemic, journalists and federal health experts, among others. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who visited West Africa recently, would presumably have been prevented from returning if there had been a travel ban.

A ban would discourage volunteers from joining the fight against Ebola and make it harder to bring the epidemic under control, the surest way to protect this country from imported cases.

W.H.O. pressures Europe on Ebola; Scale of crisis overtakes E.U. gathering amid plea for increase in funding

European leaders came under heavy pressure on Thursday to take more robust action to fight Ebola, with Britain set to announce a sharp increase in funding for West Africa and Prime Minister David Cameron pushing fellow leaders at a summit meeting here to come forward with similar pledges of their own.

The number of people infected by Ebola in the three hardest hit countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — is still rising ‘‘exponentially,’’ senior World Health Organization experts said on Thursday. The only good news, they added, is that there is so far little evidence of the infection spreading beyond Africa on a significant scale.

The number of people infected with the Ebola virus has risen to more than 9,900, and more than 4,877 people had died from it, Keiji Fukuda, a W.H.O. assistant director, told a news conference in Geneva presenting the conclusions of a meeting by the organization’s emergency committee.

The scale of the crisis pushed Ebola to the center of a gathering of European Union leaders that had been intended to focus on trying to reach a deal on cutting greenhouse gases and increasing clean energy after 2020. Leaders were still trying to hash out a deal in talks late Thursday night but they also were having to juggle those complex negotiations with even more immediate concerns including the Ebola outbreak.

‘‘Risk number one is obviously the crisis of Ebola,’’ Mr. Cameron told reporters at the start of the two-day session in Brussels. ‘‘Britain has been leading the way,’’ he said, noting that his country had already pledged 125 million pounds, or roughly $200 million, to battle the virus in Sierra Leone, a former British colony. ‘‘But we need other European countries to do more,’’ he said.

Later on Thursday, Mr. Cameron was expected to pledge a further £80 billion to the struggle against Ebola, according to a British government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement.

France has also been active in fighting Ebola, sending troops to Guinea to build treatment centers, but many other countries in the 28-nation European bloc have stayed on the sidelines.

Facing criticism that it did not respond swiftly enough to the scale of the current Ebola outbreak, the European Commission, the bloc’s administrative arm, on Thursday announced 24.4 million euros, or $31 million, in new research funding, part of which will go to finance the large-scale testing in West Africa of treatments that use antibodies taken from recovered Ebola patients.

Johan van Griensven, a researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is leading an international team behind the testing program, said in a telephone interview that tests on hundreds of people suffering from Ebola would be carried out in Guinea and could pave the way for treatments that sharply reduce death rates.

A cure, he said, is not on the horizon but treatments that may cut the death rate from its current level of around 70 percent to around 30 percent would ‘‘be a big step in the right direction.’’ This, he said, would not only reduce deaths but also ‘‘send a strong signal of hope to communities’’ and encourage people who contract the virus to seek help quickly.

The expected pledge from Britain would consist of £50 million to establish about 200 Ebola care units in Sierra Leone, and £10 billion to help with burials in that country, according to the British official. The remaining £20 million would go to a United Nations fund, the official said.

The British government has been pressing for the European Union to contribute an amount adding up to €1 billion toward fighting the virus. According to European Commission figures, the bloc as a whole and individual countries have so far pledged about €600 million of that mount, with Britain being the single biggest donor.

European leaders have struggled to adopt a common position on whether to implement screening at airports to detect passengers who might have Ebola or whether to maintain flights to the most affected countries. Britain has suspended all flights to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but Belgium has not.

The W.H.O. emergency committee, which met on Wednesday in Geneva, called for normal air and travel, emphasizing that a ban could do more harm than good by increasing the economic damage already inflicted by the epidemic, increasing the risk of uncontrolled migration from the worst hit countries, also raising the risk of spreading the disease internationally.

Committee members ‘‘were really struck’’ and reassured by how few cases had occurred of travelers carrying the disease abroad from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, Dr. Fukuda said.

The current Ebola epidemic has so far infected just a handful of people in Europe but, in West Africa, it has already killed more people than all of the 23 previous outbreaks of the disease recorded in Africa since the 1970s. Beating it therefore depends on not only expanding the number of treatment centers but also on developing better treatments.

‘‘The scale of the epidemic is a threat not only to the economy and the stability of the affected countries, but also to the region as a whole,’’ stated draft conclusions for the summit that were seen on Thursday by The New York Times. ‘‘Helping West Africa to cope with the crisis is the most effective way to prevent a serious outbreak of the disease elsewhere,’’ the draft said.

Fallacies Are Spreading as Readily as the Virus Has

Even as American hospitals prepare for new cases of Ebola, they must brace for a more familiar invader. The flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] season will arrive soon — although exactly when, scientists cannot say.

Unlike Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}], the influenza[http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] virus is truly airborne. And if recent history is any guide, it will kill thousands in the coming months.

Flu viruses and Ebola viruses take different routes to the same biological goal: to get into new hosts and replicate. Scientists have learned a great deal about the devious ways in which they manage to do it.

Yet misconceptions about how they travel continue to circulate, including the persistent notion that Ebola, like influenza, is airborne. The uncertainty only grows when possible new cases are identified, as happened on Thursday in New York[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html].

Recently on “Fox News Sunday,” political commentator George Will said[http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2014/10/19/exclusive-party-chairs-square-joint-interview#p//v/3847898734001], “There are now doctors who are saying, ‘We’re not so sure that it can’t be in some instances transmitted by airborne.' ”

When another guest on the show started to explain that experts have said this is not true, Mr. Will interrupted to say, “Every expert that you’ve seen. Here we go again.”

When scientists refer to an airborne virus, they mean one that gets into droplets called aerosols that are so tiny they can float on air currents instead of falling to the ground. Influenza can spread this way, as people cough and sneeze. All the evidence scientists have gathered about Ebola, on the other hand, indicates that it spreads through contact with fluids from infected people. During an infection, the virus makes huge numbers of copies that contaminate the victim’s vomit, blood, diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], urine and saliva.

The sheer numbers of viruses in those fluids raise the odds that anyone who makes contact with them will be infected. “This virus only needs a little opportunity,” said Vincent J. Munster, a virologist at the National Institutes of Health.

Ebola victims can release large, virus-laden droplets — if, for example, their vomit hits the floor. These droplets may strike people in close range or land on a wall or some other surface, where they can stay infective for hours or days, depending on factors like temperature and humidity.

Unlike the flu, Ebola does not lead to the kinds of coughs and sneezes that create a cloud of aerosols around a patient. Scientists who track the spread of Ebola have found that close contact with an infected person is necessary to become infected.

“The people who pass by the door and knock and say hello, we don’t find they get infected,” said Daniel G. Bausch, an associate professor of tropical medicine at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

That’s not the pattern that airborne viruses produce. Dr. Bausch, for example, has treated hundreds of patients with Ebola and related viruses without protection from aerosols.

“If it happened frequently, I would be dead,” he said.

The outbreak of Ebola in Dallas has followed the pattern Dr. Bausch has seen in Africa. Thomas Eric Duncan, the infected man from Liberia, stayed in an apartment for eight days without passing the virus on to other people there.

The only two people to become infected were hospital nurses who took care of Mr. Duncan when he was most infective.

“If it were really highly contagious like the flu, there would be a whole lot more people infected with it,” said Thomas W. Geisbert[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/opinion/sunday/thomas-w-geisbert.html], a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

Influenza, on the other hand, is extraordinarily good at spreading fast, traveling the globe every year. But scientists still are not sure how it does it so well.

“We do not know how influenza and other upper respiratory diseases[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/respiratorydiseases/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] are transmitted,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an environmental health scientist at Columbia University. “We know how they can be transmitted.”

That’s an important distinction. Influenza viruses turn up in fine aerosols, in big droplets and on contaminated surfaces. Just how important each route is for spreading the virus is not known.

To get some answers, Donald K. Milton, a virologist at the University of Maryland, and his colleagues find students sick with the flu and pay them to stick their faces in a large cone for half an hour. The cone sucks up flu-laden droplets, which the scientists measure and inspect for viruses.

In 45 percent of their samples, aerosol droplets contained flu viruses. The aerosols actually hold more pathogens than the bigger droplets, each carrying a hundred flu viruses or more.

“That suggests aerosols are important, but just how important we don’t know,” said Dr. Milton. “When you want to protect hospital workers, how do you make health care facilities safe places to go when there’s a flu pandemic? We need to know this.”

After this year’s flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, the virus will flare up in the Southern Hemisphere for a few months before coming back.

After past Ebola outbreaks, on the other hand, the virus has simply vanished from humans. Scientists suspect it lurks in the wild before coming back.

Dr. Munster, of the N.I.H., is trying to understand how the Ebola virus spreads in animals. He and his colleagues have trapped hammer-headed bats in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and they have found that 10 percent of them carry antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to the virus.

That indicates that at some point in the past they have had Ebola. But it is very hard to find bats with live virus replicating in their bodies. It is possible that Ebola spreads harmlessly from bat to bat, never causing widespread outbreaks.

So how does the virus return to humans every few years? Most likely not through the air. Dr. Munster suspects that the more contact humans make with bats — eating their meat, for example, or fruit that bats have handled — the more likely they will encounter an infectious animal.

“In the end,” said Dr. Munster, “it’s a numbers game.”

Vaccine Trials for Ebola Are Planned in West Africa

Federal officials and pharmaceutical companies are planning in the near future to start two large clinical trials of Ebola vaccines in West African countries devastated by the outbreak, a government official said Thursday.

The trials will run separately — one in Liberia, the other in Sierra Leone — and involve different designs to ensure at least one produces usable information.

“It’s very important to make sure that, given how challenging these trials might be, that we take no chances, that we have more than one trial going on,” this official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the studies have not been formally announced.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] held a meeting in Geneva on Thursday involving governments, pharmaceutical companies and charities, among others, to discuss Ebola vaccine trials. Conclusions of the meeting are expected to be announced Friday.

W.H.O. officials said earlier this week that trials of two vaccines furthest along in development would start in West Africa as early as January. But the details have not been known.

Participants will be people at high risk of infection, including health care workers and possibly others, including burial workers and those caring for family members with the disease.

The trials will be challenging because health care systems in countries with Ebola are breaking down. And there are sensitive issues such as whether to give some participants a placebo. A placebo-controlled trial can produce the quickest answers about whether a vaccine works, experts say. But some critics have said it is unethical to offer people placebos instead of a vaccine that might save their lives.

One trial will test the two vaccines against each other and against a control. One-third of participants will receive a vaccine being developed by GlaxoSmithKline. Another third will receive a Canadian vaccine licensed to NewLink Genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. The rest will get a vaccine for a disease other than Ebola, such as flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — essentially a placebo in terms of preventing Ebola infection.

That trial will probably involve about 9,000 people in each segment, the official said. It will take place in Liberia under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and Liberia’s Health Ministry.

For the other trial, everyone at a particular site, such as a treatment center, will be offered a vaccine. Different centers will offer vaccines at different times. In that design, no one gets a placebo. That study will take place in Sierra Leone and is being planned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

Ebola Crosses New Border as Mali Confirms a Case

DAKAR, Senegal — Mali on Thursday became the sixth West African country to confirm an Ebola case, indicating again the disease’s barely controlled spread across porous regional borders.

A spokesman for the country’s Health Ministry said Thursday night that a girl 2 to 3 years old had tested positive for the disease and was in isolation at a hospital in one of the country’s provincial hubs, Kayes, on the western border with Senegal.

It was the country’s first case, the spokesman said.

The girl had come from Guinea, where the worst-ever outbreak of the disease began and where it is still raging, according to the spokesman, Markathé Dao. She was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday. “Now we have got to follow all this case’s contacts, and this is what we are going to do,” he said. Guinea shares a long border with Mali; both are among the world’s poorest nations.

At least one of the girl’s parents has died, probably from Ebola, Mr. Dao said. He said a grandmother of the girl had traveled to Guinea from Mali to fetch her. In one potentially worrying aspect of the case, the little girl spent time in Mali’s densely packed capital, Bamako, a city of about two million people, before traveling to Kayes, the spokesman said.

But he insisted that she was not suffering from any symptoms while she was in the capital, and “was certainly infected in Guinea.” Mr. Dao added that “we are now visiting everybody with whom she had contact in Bamako.” Malian news websites said several of the girl’s relatives had been put in isolation.

Three West African nations — Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia — continue to have “persistent and widespread transmission,” according to the World Health Organization. Transmission is “intense” in the heavily populated capitals of these countries, the agency said. Nearly 5,000 people have died, the organization reported — though the actual number is unknown as the region’s governments have undercounted the dead.

Senegal and Nigeria, two other West African nations, have had isolated cases of the disease and have managed to eradicate it, for now, the health organization said.

But Mali, a former French colony, is poorer than those two countries, its health care resources considerably less ample, and its governmental structures more rudimentary. It is also still shaky from the political turbulence[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/world/africa/rebuilding-of-mali-is-daunting-task-despite-aid.html] of a rebellion and a 2012 coup d’état that led to an Islamist takeover of much of the country.

Whether it will now be able to confront Ebola as energetically as Senegal and Nigeria did is unclear.

Neighbors Say Patient Is Fast to Lend a Helping Hand

Craig A. Spencer, the New York City doctor who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, has dedicated himself to dealing with medical emergencies in faraway places.

Just 33, Dr. Spencer has worked on projects in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He returned this month from a trip to Guinea, where he worked with Doctors Without Borders, helping to treat Ebola patients.

At home, he is an attending physician at NewYork Presbyterian/Columbia, about 20 blocks from the apartment in Hamilton Heights in Upper Manhattan that he shares with his fiancée, Morgan Dixon. The couple is scheduled to marry next fall in Detroit, according to an announcement posted online.

Neighbors said that they did not see much of Dr. Spencer and that he seemed to be working most of the time. But when they had encountered him — often in his hospital scrubs — he had been friendly and quick to offer a hand carrying groceries into the building, a six-story, brick-faced structure just off Broadway.

“He’s a nice guy, and kind of, wow,” said a neighbor, John Reston, upon hearing that Dr. Spencer had tested positive for the deadly disease. “He’s a nice guy, friendly, jovial. And I know he’s really dedicated to his work. That he’s with Doctors Without Borders says who he is.”

Mr. Reston said he learned of Dr. Spencer’s affiliation with Doctors Without Borders, the humanitarian aid organization, through Ms. Dixon when he bumped into her in an elevator while Dr. Spencer was in Guinea. Mr. Reston said he had not seen the doctor since his return, but had seen him having a beer with friends at Harlem Public, a tavern a couple of blocks up Broadway.

Another resident of Dr. Spencer’s building on West 147th Street, Ricardo Lawrence, said he was less worried about the disease’s spreading than for the doctor’s welfare. “I’m more concerned about him, especially because he went over there to help people,” Mr. Lawrence said, adding that he did not know him beyond exchanging greetings in the hallways.

“I think he works all the time,” Mr. Lawrence said. “There’s a group of us in the building who are close, but everyone who lives here works such weird hours, we’re all like ships passing in the night.” 

Dr. Spencer grew up on a middle-class block of single-family homes in Grosse Pointe, Mich., where he attended Grosse Pointe North High School, recalled Lauren Smith, a former schoolmate of his.

Ms. Smith, a 31-year-old financial analyst, said Dr. Spencer was “the typical guy next door.” She said he was “friendly to everyone he could be friendly to,” but “there was nothing standout about him.”

Today Dr. Spencer’s résumé would indicate otherwise. After graduating from Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, he earned a master of public health degree at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, and he recently completed a fellowship in international emergency medicine at NewYork Presbyterian/Columbia. His profile on LinkedIn states that he is fluent in Chinese, French and Spanish. He studied Chinese at Henan University in China, which is where he met Ms. Dixon.

But judging by the online announcement of their wedding, scheduled for Sept. 5, 2015, he is not all work and no play: “Craig’s friends say he’s a goofball, incredibly gifted in both art, music and science, and a go-getter.”

Lots of high-profile Democrats like former President Bill Clinton have been trooping to New Hampshire to campaign for Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who is locked in a tough race with her Republican challenger, Scott Brown.

Mr. Brown has been taking every chance to lash Ms. Shaheen to President Obama, whose job approval numbers in New Hampshire are at historic lows.

During a debate with Mr. Brown on Thursday night, Ms. Shaheen was asked why she did not want Mr. Obama to campaign with her.

“I never said I didn’t want President Obama to come and campaign,” Ms. Shaheen replied. “The fact is he’s busy in Washington. He’s dealing with the Ebola threat. He’s dealing with the threat from ISIS. I think he’s exactly where he needs to be.”

The debate moderator, Wolf Blitzer of CNN, noted that Mr. Obama had been campaigning elsewhere and asked Ms. Shaheen again if she wanted him by her side.

“We have a lot going on,” she said. “I don’t think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire right now.”

New Ebola Screening Measures

The international response to the West African Ebola outbreak has affected travel by air, rail and cruise ship.

Here is a guide to what governments and the travel industry are doing.

How are air travelers being screened in the United States?

Enhanced screening measures are in effect at five major hubs for passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, including temperature checks and detailed questioning on arrival.

The screenings are taking place at Kennedy Airport in New York, Washington Dulles International, O'Hare International, Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International. Passengers will also undergo detailed questioning upon their arrival.

Passengers at other points of entry will continue to be screened by customs agents, who examine travelers for visible signs of illness and distribute fact sheets to those who have traveled in West African nations affected by the outbreak. In addition, the T.S.A. is providing guidance to airlines on how to identify passengers who are ill.

On Oct. 27, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will begin implementing a post-arrival monitoring plan for nonsymptomatic travelers arriving in the United States from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone.

The plan calls for state and local health departments to begin checking in with those travelers every day for the 21 days following their departure from West Africa, the length of time in which Ebola can remain dormant.

Upon arrival in the United States, each passenger will receive a Check and Report Ebola kit, which includes an information graphic on monitoring their health for three weeks, a thermometer and instructions for tracking and logging body temperature, pictorial descriptions of Ebola symptoms and a card with instruction on whom to contact should symptoms arise.

Passengers will be asked to check in daily with state or local health departments in order to report their temperature, any other symptoms and any travel plans, including both in or out of state. If a traveler does not report in, public health officials are to take steps to locate the person and ensure that active monitoring continues.

Six states, including Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, which together receive more than 70 percent of those passengers traveling from West Africa, have already been prepared to begin post-arrival monitoring. Anyone showing symptoms will be isolated and by local health officials trained in protocols to limit exposure, and will be directed to a medical facility trained to receive potential Ebola patients.

The C.D.C. will assist the effort by informing state officials of passengers who will require monitoring and by providing extra technical support, guidance or funding, as necessary.

''Post arrival monitoring is an added safeguard that complements the existing exit screening protocols, which require all outbound passengers from the affected West African countries to be screened for fever, Ebola symptoms, and contact with Ebola and enhanced screening protocols at the five U.S. airports that will now receive all travelers from the affected countries. All three of these nations have asked for, and continue to receive, C.D.C. assistance implementing exit screening,'' the C.D.C. said in a statement Wednesday.

Are passengers being screened elsewhere?

The European Union said that it would look into whether screening at points of origin in West Africa is sufficient, Reuters reported, and that if not, it would strengthen that process. It also plans to better coordinate screening at some airports within the union.

Britain has begun screening travelers from affected West African countries at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports and plans to also do so at Eurostar terminals. And France has announced that it would screen air passengers at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, according to The Associated Press.

Screenings are also taking place at Canadian airports and at Cairo's.

People departing the West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak are screened before they fly. They must fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a visual assessment and a temperature check by a noncontact thermometer.

Hong Kong International Airport has begun encouraging travelers who have been to Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo within the past three weeks, or who hold a passport or other travel document from those countries, to fill out a voluntary screening questionnaire upon their arrival at the airport, Mashable.com reported. The questionnaire covers a person's travel history, health status and any contact they may have had with infected persons.

Travelers exhibiting symptoms of Ebola or who may have been exposed to the virus will be referred to the Infectious Disease Center of Hong Kong at Princess Margaret Hospital for further testing and evaluation.

''These are supplementary measures to existing border control measures,'' Dr. Edwin Tsui, Hong Kong's chief port health officer for the Department of Health, said at a press conference on Monday. ''Now we have temperature screening measures at borders and also ongoing health screening activities at borders to advise those incoming travelers who present illness to seek help from our port health officers,'' he said. ''We hope these new, voluntary health surveillance questionnaire measures can supplement and also enhance our capacity to detect Ebola virus.''

Are there plans for a travel ban from West Africa?

While the idea a travel ban on flights to and from those West African countries affected by Ebola is being debated, the Obama administration and the Department of Homeland Security announced that beginning Wednesday, anyone traveling to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will have to fly into one of the five United States airports where enhanced screening procedures were taking place, Reuters reported.

''We are working closely with the airlines to implement these restrictions with minimal travel disruption,'' Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security said in a statement. ''If not already handled by the airlines, the few impacted travelers should contact the airlines for rebooking, as needed.''

About nine people per day will have their flights rerouted due to the new restriction, according to a statement from Airlines for America, a trade group made up of several major U.S. carriers.

North Korea, citing fears of Ebola, has banned all foreign tourists.

Several cruise lines have voluntarily altered their routes to avoid the West African coast.

Are carriers still operating flights to affected nations?

Some international airlines, including British Airways and Kenya Airways, have suspended flights since August. But others, including Royal Air Maroc, have regularly scheduled departures to destinations in West Africa. Keep in mind that the C.D.C. has advised avoiding nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

What are air carriers doing?

Airlines follow general guidelines issued by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread.

The C.D.C. has asked United States airlines and international airlines with direct flights to or from the United States to begin asking any sick passengers if they had traveled to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in the past 21 days. If the answer is yes and the passenger is exhibiting symptoms of Ebola specifically, the airline must report the incident immediately to the C.D.C. and follow the agency's infection control guidelines, according to the agency's Ebola Guidance for Airlines advisory.

In general, the guidelines call for flight crews to take steps to protect themselves as well as other passengers, including washing their hands often and thoroughly, wearing waterproof gloves and face masks when dealing with a sick passenger and treating any and all bodily fluids as if they were contagious. Sick passengers are also advised to wear a face mask, unless they are nauseated or vomiting.

To minimize exposure, the C.D.C. also advises isolating sick passengers as much as possible and minimizing crew and passenger interactions with them.

Strict cleaning procedures are also outlined for in-flight and ground crews, both of which are instructed to wear personal protective equipment like aprons, goggles and other gear typically included in a Universal Precaution Kit, which the International Civil Aviation Organization has recommended all airlines traveling to countries affected with Ebola carry.

Plastic bags are to be used to dispose of tissues and any other waste that might have been used to clean the area in which the passenger is seated, and then must be sealed tightly, much as a hospital does with biohazards. Once on the ground, any soiled area of the plane that cannot be thoroughly disinfected is to be removed, according to the C.D.C.

If flight attendants become sick midflight, they are required to stop work immediately and isolate themselves.

Airlines are working closely with the C.D.C. and the Department of Homeland Security to mitigate risk to the traveling public and airline employees, as they have done in the past during SARS and H1N1 Virus outbreaks, Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines For America, the trade group for major airlines, said in an email. Crew members have been trained in the C.D.C.'s infection control procedures and all members of the group carry Universal Precaution Kits aboard their planes, she confirmed.

Flight attendants have been trained to passively screen passengers for several types of illnesses, she continued. ''Once someone does appear to have symptoms, airlines have had the ability to directly connect with medical experts midflight to consult on whether there is an actual concern about Ebola. This includes connecting with the C.D.C. emergency operations center.''

Should that rare situation occur, she said, airlines are instructed to do everything they can to isolate the passenger to the best extent possible, while also complying with all F.A.A. safety rules, including having all passengers remain in their seats.

Can you get Ebola by sharing a flight with someone who is infected?

It's not likely. The disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids -- blood, vomit, urine, diarrhea -- of a contagious person, and those people are unlikely to feel well enough to fly. And in one case in which a passenger who was vomiting from the illness did fly from Monrovia to Lagos in late July, none of the roughly 200 people on his flight fell ill.

New York Today: Ebola Arrives, and Calm Is Urged

Good morning on this cool, clearing Friday.

The first positive case of the Ebola virus[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html] was confirmed in New York on Thursday.

While it is a significant development, officials said Thursday night[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBH4m1U-0R0&list=UUlnI1zhyzv_BPb-VSHEtniw] that there was little chance of contagion.

“There is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed,” Mayor de Blasio said. “Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract.”

Health officials first said that Craig Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/neighbors-say-patient-is-fast-to-lend-a-helping-hand-.html], a doctor who had worked with Ebola patients in Guinea, had a 100.3-degree fever on Thursday when he first reported his symptoms. He was then placed in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center. But on Friday, health officials said that was incorrect and that Dr. Spencer reported having a 100.3-degree fever. They said the mistake was because of a transcription error.

He had left his apartment on 147th Street in Harlem on Wednesday and taken the A and 1 trains in Manhattan and the L train to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but officials believe he was not symptomatic at the time.

He also took an Uber car, visited the High Line and went for a jog. See map[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/23/nyregion/new-york-city-ebola-patient-map.html].

Dr. Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said it was “extremely unlikely” that problems would arise from his taking the subway.

People infected with Ebola are not contagious unless they are showing symptoms.

Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids and secretions. It is not spread through the air.

Experts, too, stress that contracting the virus on public transit is “extremely unlikely.”[http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2014/10/03/ebola-ask-well-spread-public-transit]

Nevertheless, the authorities took extra precautions, tracing Dr. Spencer’s possible contacts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/tracing-patients-possible-contacts-creates-host-of-challenges-for-the-city.html] and placing his fiancée in isolation at Bellevue. Two other friends will also be quarantined.

The Gutter[http://www.thegutterbrooklyn.com/], a bowling alley and music site in Williamsburg that he visited Wednesday night, was closed[https://www.facebook.com/thegutterbrooklyn/posts/10153293725324128] on Thursday.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in New York City, and President Obama said that an additional C.D.C. response had been sent.

Call 911 if you have traveled to West Africa and develop Ebola symptoms[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html]. The first sign of illness is often a fever followed by muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

Bellevue is the main treatment center for possible Ebola cases in the city, but other hospitals are also on alert.

Here’s what else you need to know.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Ebola confirmed in Manhattan.

New York City officials are retracing the recent movements[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html] of a doctor hospitalized overnight with the virus, while his fiancée, two friends and his Harlem apartment are quarantined.

The doctor treated Ebola patients in Guinea before returning to the city on Oct. 17. He reported a fever on Thursday.

• Responding to the epidemic.

The Ebola virus and response to it are taken up today at events held separately by a House committee and the World Health Organization.

The W.H.O. announce[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-health-ebola-vaccines-who-idUSKCN0ID18820141024]d[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-health-ebola-vaccines-who-idUSKCN0ID18820141024] plans to speed up the development of experimental vaccines, which officials aim to have in Africa by the middle of 2015. This comes as Mali became the sixth West African country[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/us/ebola-crosses-new-border-as-mali-confirms-a-case.html?_r=0] to confirm a case of Ebola.

• Virus-free.

Nina Pham, one of two nurses who became infected while treating an infected man in Dallas, has tested negative and will be released from the hospital, according a statement from the National Institutes of Health[http://www.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/news/health/oct2014/od-24.htm].

• Climate-change breakthrough.

The 28 leaders of the European Union overcame national divisions today to agree on targets for protecting the climate[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/world/europe/european-leaders-agree-on-targets-to-fight-climate-change-.html], the first major agreement ahead of a U.N. meeting next year on the subject.

They pledged to slash emissions by at least 40 percent, compared with 1990 levels, and to generate at least 27 percent of E.U. energy from renewable sources by 2030.

• Last chance in Brazil.

Brazil’s presidential candidates meet in their final debate[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-23/brazil-s-jobless-rate-unexpectedly-falls-to-september-record-low.html] today ahead of Sunday’s neck-and-neck runoff election.

• Speaking from experience.

The parents of two children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting[http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/e5a6a06ec6464fbeb3f031b1ff769564/CT—Newtown-School-Shooting] today address the Connecticut commission on school safety, mental health and gun violence prevention.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are mostly flat after a rally Thursday. European indexes are down, and Asian shares ended mixed.

• The value of the ruble fell today in anticipation of Standard & Poor’s new rating of Russia’s sovereign bonds.

Traders were expecting a downgrade to junk bond status[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-24/ruble-extends-drop-as-bank-of-russia-raises-band-amid-s-p-woes.html].

• Ford, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Procter & Gamble and UPS posted third-quarter earnings today that exceeded analyst expectations.

• The investor Carl Icahn said the Trump Taj Mahal casino, which he has a deal to buy but which is running out of money, “will almost certainly close[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Icahn-Says-Taj-Casino-Likely-to-Close-280267342.html].”

It would be the fifth Atlantic City casino to close this year. Union employees plan to picket tonight to protest the end of their health care and pension plans.

NOTEWORTHY

• Fewer eyes on the ball.

Game 3 of the World Series shifts to the San Francisco Giants’ home park tonight (8 o’clock Eastern, Fox).

The first game drew only 12.2 million viewers, making it the lowest-rated Game 1 on record[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-baseball-is-no-longer-center-of-attention-in-new-landscape.html]. Game 2, which left the best-of-seven series with the Kansas City Royals even at one victory apiece, brought 12.9 million.

• Making the World Trade Center home.

The publisher Condé Nast will become the first tenant of One World Trade Center[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/cond-nast-moving-into-1-world-trade-center-next-month.html], leasing about one-third of the building erected on the site where nearly 2,800 people were killed on 9/11.

• R.F.K. strategist dies.

Frank Mankiewicz, a Democratic political strategist who was Senator Robert F. Kennedy’s press secretary and directed Senator George S. McGovern’s losing 1972 presidential campaign, died Thursday at age 90[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/us/politics/frank-mankiewicz-press-secretary-to-robert-f-kennedy-dies-at-90.html].

• Sympathetic portrait.

“Citizenfour,” the documentary about Edward J. Snowden, was made with his authorization by Laura Poitras, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize working with him in disseminating the classified information he acquired.

The film, opening today, “emphasizes his bravery and his idealism, and the malignancy of the forces ranged against him,” writes our critic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/movies/citizenfour-a-documentary-about-edward-j-snowden.html] A.O. Scott.

• An avalanche of anxiety.

In “Force Majeure,” opening today, a barrage of snow hitting a family vacationing at an upscale mountain resort disrupts a seemingly perfect family at its core.

“This brilliant, viciously amusing takedown of bourgeois complacency, gender stereotypes and assumptions and the illusion of security rubs your face in human frailty,” writes our critic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/movies/force-majeure-a-dark-swedish-comedy.html] Stephen Holden.

Here’s what else[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/intheaters.html] is coming to theaters today.

• How to party online.

That’s what J. Nathan Matias, a doctoral student at M.I.T., wants to find out at the annual Mozilla Festival[http://2014.mozillafestival.org/], a conference on the future of the web that starts in London today.

He is researching software that lets people who can’t be physically together celebrate in the same online space[http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2014/09/whats-the-best-way-to-throw-a-party-online/].

• LOL.

Five comedians from around the world compete in the Funniest Person in the World finals[http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Contest-seeks-world-s-funniest-person-with-5837488.php] in Las Vegas tonight.

BACK STORY

By this point in the school year, the rules about children’s digital screen time have probably long been abandoned over frustration (parents) or abuse (children).

Some tips to help restore the balance — pretty good advice for everyone, not just parents and students:

• Ban screens from the bedroom. Make sure they have alarm clocks so they don’t need their phones to get up for school.

• Change your phone plan to put data limits on their smartphones.

• Use a seven-day digital timer on the modem and program it to turn off at set hours on school nights.

• Seek out the advice of other parents[http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/23/living/parents-kids-addicted-cell-phones/] or books from experts[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/books/3-books-offer-ways-to-cut-the-cord-if-only-briefly.html].

• Lead by example[http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2014/09/26/ban-electronics-in-kids-bedrooms-expert-says]. Parents need to ditch their phones at the supper table and other family times, too.

Still having trouble? Here are three compelling arguments to use on them:

• Sacrificing screens improves your social skills[http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/will-an-internet-break-make-you-socially-smarter/], some experts say.

• A full night’s sleep is actually a learning tool[http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/want-to-ace-that-test-get-the-right-kind-of-sleep/] — it helps our brains consolidate knowledge and even lets us do better on tests without even trying.

• Steve Jobs limited his children’s tech time[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/fashion/steve-jobs-apple-was-a-low-tech-parent.html], and so do many other Internet C.E.O.s.

New York’s Line on Ebola: We’re on Top of This

Good Friday morning from Washington, where Republicans’ chances of controlling the Senate have slipped to 63 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/]. Midterm elections are 11 days away, and the campaign trail will be crowded, with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachussetts stumping in Boston and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey getting ready for a weekend trip to Iowa. Meanwhile, Congress is holding a special session on Ebola, which has made it to New York[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=BannerSubHedSumLargeMedia&module=a-lede-package-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news].

If there was one message government officials tried to convey in New York on Thursday after the discovery that a doctor had contracted Ebola, it was a simple one: We are on top of this.

It’s a lesson they learned in Dallas, where a fumbling, hesitant response left the public nervously wondering why government at all levels — federal, state and local — seemed to be playing catch-up.

But Mayor Bill de Blasio, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and, by phone, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, went out of their way on Thursday to describe how the recent case in New York City was being handled. They were unflustered and detailed in their description of the condition of the patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, and they repeatedly emphasized how prepared both the city and its healthcare workers were.

Dr. Frieden’s participation was notable. Federal officials were heavily criticized in Dallas for their uneven response, and his leadership and judgment in particular were questioned[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/14/health/cdc-frieden-facing-criticism/].

The setting they selected to break the news to the public was fitting. They held the news conference at Bellevue Hospital Center — where Dr. Spencer was being treated and his fiancée was quarantined[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=Banner&module=span-ab-top-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news].

Bellevue, founded in 1736[http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhc/bellevue/html/about/history.shtml], is the nation’s oldest continually operating hospital and has been a leader in handling infectious diseases. In 1985, during the early days of the AIDS crisis[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/us/aids-bellevue-tries-to-cope-with-disease-it-cannot-cure.html], one-quarter of the patients in the hospital’s Department of Medicine had the disease.

It may yet turn out that problems are discovered or that lapses in protocol emerge in New York. But with the Dallas experience on their minds, officials clearly wanted to offer a confident and transparent description of why they believed in their ability to confront and contain the disease.

Paul’s Star on Display as Big Names Turn Out for Policy Speech

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is probably the biggest political curiosity in America. And for proof, consider the boldface names who turned out to hear him speak on a dreary Thursday night in Midtown Manhattan.

There were figures of the political right like Peggy Noonan, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Reagan speechwriter, and Grover Norquist, the antitax crusader. James O’Keefe, the conservative filmmaker and provocateur, looked on from a corner table.

There were titans of business like Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, and Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO. (They were both seated at the head table with Mr. Paul.)

The occasion was Mr. Paul’s speech, to the Center for the National Interest[http://www.cftni.org/], in which he described his foreign policy doctrine of “Conservative Realism.”

In the speech, Mr. Paul went where few other Republicans have been willing to go, criticizing the American military’s drone program because it “may create more jihadists than we eliminate.”

And he was sympathetic to Muslims who feel tainted by association because of the extremists who carry out terrorist attacks in the name of their religion. “The world does not have an Islam problem,” he said. “The world has a dignity problem, with millions of men and women across the Middle East being treated as chattel by their own governments.”

Mr. Norquist was pleased. “I think I just heard Ronald Reagan speaking,” he said after the speech.
