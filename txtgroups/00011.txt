Next few days key to survival for Pauline, says top doc

BY ADRIAN SHAW THE nurse battling Ebola is at risk of suffering organ failure, an expert warned yesterday.

Health worker Pauline Caff-erkey, 39, is fighting for her life in a specialist isolation unit where her condition has deteriorated.

Dr Martin Wiselka, a consultant in infectious diseases, said: "The next few days are critical."

He explained: "What tends to happen with Ebola is you end up with organ failure. That is a risk.

"Another of the things that happens is your blood clotting becomes difficult.

"It's potentially survivable. It is a matter of keeping the patient alive long enough for them to develop some immunity."

Pauline, a cousin of former Ireland goalkeeper Packie Bonner, became ill after returning to the UK from Sierra Leone, where she had been working at a treatment centre.

She is being treated at Royal Free Hospital, North London, where a spokesman described her condition as "critical" yesterday.

Pauline is being given an unnamed antiviral drug and blood plasma from survivors.

However, she has not received ZMapp, the experimental drug that helped British nurse William Pooley, 29, make a full recovery at the same hospital.

Stocks worldwide have been exhausted and there is no hope of a fresh supply for several weeks.

Dr Wiselka, who works at Spire Leicester hospital, added: "I don't know exactly what treatment is involved in Ms Cafferkey's case.

"All I can say is that she is in the best possible hands. The Royal Free Hospital has already had some experience with William Pooley."

Yesterday David Cameron also spoke of Pauline's fight for survival. The PM told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: "All of us are thinking of her and her family.

"And also how incredibly brave these people are, not only doctors and nurses from our NHS but also people from our Armed Forces who have been working in West Africa in very difficult conditions."

Asked if airport screening is failing, he said: "If we need to change further, if the chief medical officer says we need a system of quarantine or anything like that, then we should put that in place.

"But it is important to listen to the medical experts and then make the decision."

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "It's sad and distressing to hear that Pauline Cafferkey is now in a critical condition. The thoughts of the entire nursing profession are with her and her family at this time."

Royal Free Hospital has insisted there is "no danger to patients or staff " as it stays open as usual.

Fury as British TV station plans to screen comedy series based on Ireland's Famine

A BRITISH TV station was rapped yesterday for commissioning a comedy show based on the Irish Famine.

Channel 4 asked Dublin-based screenwriter Hugh Travers to pen the sitcom Hungry, set during the mid-1800s when more than a million men, women and children died of starvation.

He said: "We're kind of thinking of it as Shameless in famine Ireland."

But the plan was slammed by Fianna Fail county councillor David McGuinness.

He said: "I am angry one of the most defining eras in Irish history will be the source for a new sitcom and I hope Irish-based television outlets, as well as the Irish people, will not support the programme.

"I firmly believe the Irish people and Irish diaspora throughout the world will join me in condemning Channel 4's financing of a show to embarrass and denigrate this important event in Irish history."

US-based Irish journalist Niall O'Dowd said on Irish Central: "What's up next? A sitcom on The Holocaust maybe with funny fat Nazis eating victims alive? Or how about a comedy about Ebola with black kids dying on screen?" Almost 5,000 people had last night signed a Change.org petition calling on Channel 4 to stop development of the series. "Famine or genocide is no laughing matter," it says.

Dublin TV production company Deadpan Pictures will be getting to work on the project early in the year.

Around 400 people died every day from 1845 to 1852 as Ireland suffered a devastating blight and one million more emigrated.

But the award-winning screenwriter defended the move.

Mr Travers said: "I don't want to do anything that denies the suffering that people went through but Ireland has always been good at black humour. We're kind of thinking of it as 'Shameless' in famine Ireland."

The concept was defended by the Rubber Bandits, who tweeted: "Re C4 Sitcom and outrage. One of the greatest pieces of comedic satire was about the famine."

They claimed to be making reference to A Modest Proposal, a satirical essay by Jonathan Swift in 1729 suggesting Ireland's poor could ease their money worries by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies.

THE Ebola outbreak that has killed 8,000 will end in 2015, a UN chief has said.

Still Anthony Banbury, head of the UN team fighting the disease, claimed the end was not close, adding: "We're engaged in an epic battle."

The bug has killed mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where it started in December 2013.

All UK-based passengers and crew aboard two flights taken by British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, have been contacted by medical authorities.

Public Health England said those who flew from Heathrow to Glasgow and UK-based passengers who travelled to London from Casablanca "have been given advice and reassurance".

International agencies are contacting foreigners from the Casablanca flight.

EBOLA nurse Pauline Cafferkey was being closely monitored yesterday after being given an experimental drug and blood plasma from survivors of the disease.

The doctor treating her, Michael Jacobs, said she was going through a "crucial few days". He is also considering whether to use further experimental drugs.

Pauline, 39, from South Lanarkshire, is being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital after contracting Ebola while nursing victims in Sierra Leone.

Public Health England is believed to have traced most of the 200 people who may have come into contact with Pauline between Casablanca and Glasgow on the second and third legs of her flights from Sierra Leone.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has claimed a further 317 victims since Christmas Eve.

EBOLA NURSE: I WILL BE A HUMAN GUINEA PIG

Doctors have consulted with Pauline on pioneering treatment

She is 'not feeling well' but is still sitting up, eating & drinking

THE doctor treating Ebola nurse Pauline Cafferkey warned last night her experimental treatment would take her into unknown territory.

Dr Michael Jacobs said there was a risk that the hero medic - who spent five weeks caring for victims of the deadly disease in Africa - might deteriorate.

He added: "We cannot be as confident as we would like that she will survive as she enters a crucial few days."

He added: "We have been able to have detailed discussions with her - she's a professional nurse - and we've sought advice from our wide network of colleagues in the field."

If successful, the breakthrough could be rolled out to other victims of the deadly disease. The current outbreak in west Africa has killed nearly 8,000 people. More than 20,000 have been infected.

DEADLY Pauline, who is a cousin of Irish goalkeeping legend Packie Bonner, is believed to be among just a handful of Ebola patients to try a combination of the unnamed drug and convalescent plasma from the blood of a recovered patient.

Dr Jacobs said the NHS nurse of nearly 20 years, "remained positive", despite the deadly nature of the illness. He added: "She's not feeling well, but it would be fair to say that she's as well as could be hoped for at this stage.

"I can't emphasise enough that it's very early on in the course of the illness." And he joked: "I'm sure this isn't how she intended to spend New Year's Eve."

Pauline, whose late grandmother was from Kincasslagh in Donegal, was able to sit up and has been eating, reading books, and chatting to family and friends via the intercom next to her £25,000 quarantine bed at London's Royal Free Hospital.

Dr Jacobs revealed the Royal Free had been unable to obtain ZMapp, the drug used to treat British Ebola survivor Will Pooley, because "there is none in the world at the moment".

Experts around Europe had decided the most appropriate plasma for Pauline. Dr Jacobs added: "It's plasma from a patient who has survived."

In a day of dramatic developments, it emerged health officials are yet to speak to dozens of passengers who travelled on flights with the nurse when she returned home three days ago.

The authorities are trying to find more than 200 people who may have come into contact with Pauline between Casablanca and Glasgow on the second and third legs of her flights from Sierra Leone via Heathrow on Sunday.

It is understood more than 60 are yet to be contacted. And the Department of Health said yesterday screening for Ebola will be reviewed after Pauline was given the all-clear at Heathrow where she had her temperature tested seven times when she complained of a fever.

A probe has also been launched by the nurse's employers Save the Children, to discover whether Pauline caught the disease at a Sierra Leone Christmas service.

Pauline, a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre, South Lanarkshire, was part of a 30-strong team sent to Africa by the Government last month and was based in Kerry Town.

While waiting for her connecting flight on Sunday she was forced to queue at Heathrow after health workers there were recently axed. She and 29 other medics returning from Africa suffered "long, long delays" during screening.

Around 30 of 42 workers at Heathrow Airport Health Control have been sacked by Public Health England in the last few months. A PHE spokeswoman insisted the job cuts did not mean there was a "degradation of the ability to respond to a serious illness, like Ebola".

But Dr Martin Deahl, 58, who sat next to Pauline on the plane, said: "Airport precautions and checks were shambolic." The Government's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, yesterday said questions should be raised about the airport screening procedure for Ebola but insisted the nurse's temperature was not unusual.

Two other groups of health care workers were sent earlier this month and are still in Africa. A team of 25 went out on December 6 and a dozen medics flew there on December 21.

Medics returning to the UK from Sierra Leone are allowed home if they show no symptoms. In the US they are put into quarantine.

Five have died of Ebola after returning to the West -16 recovered and three are in treatment.

Police are probing complaints about a Twitter rant by TV personality Katie Hopkins in which she moaned of "little sweaty jocks… sending us Ebola bombs".

LOOKING BACK ON HIGHS AND LOWS OF THE YEAR

AS we wave goodbye to 2014, it is only right to look back on the highs and lows the year has brought for the people of Northern Ireland.

It ended on a positive note for our politicians as a deal was reached after weeks of intensive talks at Stormont. But earlier in the year the political scene said farewell to Ian Paisley, one of its most divisive figures.

Other sad losses in 2014 included much-loved little Oscar Knox and brave cancer campaigner Una Crudden.

In the world of sport, Rory McIlroy started the year engaged to tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki but ended the relationship just months later. However, there were plenty of ups for him including winning The Open.

There were also a number of Northern Ireland families who celebrated big Lotto wins.

THE son of a taxi driver who picked up Pauline Cafferkey slammed screening procedures that let her leave Heathrow.

The cabbie drove Pauline from Glasgow Airport after she returned on Sunday from working with Ebola-infected patients in Sierra Leone.

Health officials contacted the driver - a grandfather in his late 40s - shortly after it was confirmed the nurse had the virus. He has not yet been tested as he has not shown any symptoms, but was given advice by health workers.

We have chosen not to name the man, who operates a private hire car in Glasgow, as it may damage his business.

But his 21-year-old son hit out at health authorities on social media for failing to stop Pauline travelling. He raged: "Just found out that my dad picked up the woman that might have Ebola from Glasgow Airport last night, and now has to go get tested.

"Why the f*** are we letting nurses who have been in contact with Ebola patients back into Scotland without getting quarantined? F****** mutants."

But the cabbie last night said it was "just one of these things".

Speaking from his home in East Renfrewshire, the dad of two told our reporter: "At the early stages, the only way you can transfer it is through bodily fluids. The woman wasn't showing any symptoms.

"She was standing there, just like you are standing there now.

"It is not an airborne virus. I am not worried in the slightest."

Sealed in plastic tent to contain killer virus

THE TREATMENT

PAULINE Cafferkey is getting the best treatment available in the UK in the only ward in the country that is equipped to cope with Ebola.

In the high-level isolation unit at the world-renowned Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London, she is being kept behind plastic sheeting 24/7. Her sealed-off bed protects doctors, nurses and other patients from infection.

Ebola is an extremely infectious virus, spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat.

Every member of hospital staff coming into contact with Pauline is covered head-to-toe in a protective suit.

Inside the hi-tech room, within the protective tent, she is being treated on a £25,000 bed that will be burned immediately after she leaves hospital.

Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses are allowed to enter the unit.

Dr Michael Jacobs said her family were unable to touch Pauline but can see her and converse through an intercom system hooked up to the tent.

He said: "They can see each other clearly. They are talking face to face but without direct contact between the two.

"She's inside a big tent so her family obviously can't touch her or hold her, which I'm sure they'd like to do, but they can talk to her. She has the option sometimes to phone out as well." A filtration system sucks air away from inside the tent, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building.

The air inside the tent is also being kept under negative pressure to stop vapour escaping from the tent.

Human waste is being collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker, kept underneath her bed, before being decontaminated and disposed of.

Pauline is being treated with an antiviral drug as well as blood from a survivor of Ebola.

But her treatment is likely to focus on replacing the fluid she loses through internal bleeding. An intravenous drip is pumping saline solution into her body to try to stop her organs failing.

Doctors will also treat any bleeding from her nose, eyes and ears. Dr Jacobs said: "We are naturally cautious, particularly when we are aware that this disease is so variable in what it does. I make no prognosis about the next days, until we see what happens."

He said a lot had been learned about the disease, but that it was still unpredictable. He added: "We are left with that uncertainty, and we are just going to have to take this day by day."

He suggested he might need to use other experimental drugs in the future.

He said: "We'll be able, in a few days' time, to give you a clearer picture about the choices we've made."

The best is the NHS and the military, which flew her from Scotland to a special hospital unit in London, to save her and protect us.

We can all be proud of the expertise, professionalism and dedication of public services which are second to none.

The worst is David Cameron's useless, incompetent border checks, including advice to health workers returning from Ebola countries not to travel on public transport as they fly home on a packed plane.

We applaud the NHS response. The Prime Minister deserves only jeers.

PAULINE Cafferkey could be given blood from Ebola survivors in an effort to beat the killer disease.

Will Pooley was the first Briton to be infected but chief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said the experimental drug ZMapp used to treat him was "not available".

She said: "We do have available a small amount of convalescent plasma. Plasma is the liquid of blood and convalescent is the recovery phase.

"Will Pooley gave a donation and the theory is as we fight off infections we make antibodies.

"If you harvest the plasma you get a source of antibodies that you can put into someone and you'd expect it to work."

She said treatment plans would be discussed between Miss Cafferkey and her doctor but "the cornerstone is fluid and electrolyte treatment".

Mr Pooley recovered from Ebola in September at the hospital where Miss Cafferkey is being treated.

KILLER VIRUS IN THE UK: NURSE IN ISOLATION UNIT

Doc slams Ebola screening at airport and quarantine rules

Chief medic admits allowing victim home may be an error

A DOCTOR who flew from Africa with nurse Pauline Cafferkey last night branded Heathrow's Ebola testing system "chaotic" after she was allowed to carry on to Glasgow despite feeling ill.

Consultant psychiatrist Martin Deahl said the 39-year-old should have been taken to hospital when she complained of having a high temperature - a main symptom of the killer virus - on Sunday.

Pauline, who had spent five weeks caring for victims of the disease in Sierra Leone, was diagnosed within hours of landing in Scotland. She was flown back to the capital early yesterday on a military plane to be treated in quarantine by experts at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.

And officials were locked in a hunt to trace more than 200 people who shared her flights home from Casablanca.

Health chiefs insisted Pauline was given the green light to continue her journey from Sierra Leone via Casablanca and London because seven successive tests recorded her temperature as normal.

But Dr Deahl claimed border staff at Heathrow missed a chance to stop her potentially spreading the disease when she complained she was unwell. He added: "The precautions and checks at the airport were shambolic. They ran out of testing kits and didn't seem to know what they were doing. Now all these people on that flight to Glasgow will be scared witless and it could have been avoided.

"We got to Heathrow and then got to UK Border Agency staff who checked the passports. We were identified as having come from Sierra Leone and escorted to a suite of rooms where we waited to have our so-called health check.

"The rooms were very small, the staff were small in number and seemed inadequately prepared. If there had been alternative arrangements for poor Pauline, an awful lot of people on that flight to Glasgow wouldn't be going through the anxiety and the stress that I am sure they are going through at the moment."

Dr Deahl also slammed Public Health England's rules on travel, which warn "high risk" medics returning from Ebola-hit regions should take public transport home but then avoid planes, trains and buses for three weeks after that.

He said PHE's "illogical" rules meant public health had been put at risk.

Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies admitted there were questions over whether officials should w have prevented Pauline from travelling to Glasgow after she complained about feeling unwell.

She said: "She was cleared to travel because she did not have a significant raised temperature.

"It does raise a question whether we should be more precautionary. That is why we look at what we do all the time to see if we should be more precautionary." Pauline could be given blood donations from Ebola survivors including Brit Will Pooley in a bid to overcome the deadly bug.

The 29-year-old nurse, who caught the virus in Sierra Leone, was last night being treated at the Royal Free.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Pauline was doing "as well as can be expected".

Public Health England medical director Professor Paul Cosford pledged a review of the Ebola screening processes.

And Labour MP Keith Vaz said: "There needs to be a review of what we are doing. But we need to go back to the hubs where these people are coming from and give them help."

Officials revealed they had traced 45 out of 133 people on the same Royal Air Maroc flight AT0800 Pauline took from Casablanca to Heathrow.

They had also tracked down 56 out of 72 on British Airways flight BA1478 from Heathrow to Glasgow, which landed at 11.30pm on Sunday.

It meant by 4pm yesterday just 104 out of 205 people have been traced. Prof Cosford said the process was delayed as many passengers booked through travel agents, making it slow to trace their details. The eight people sitting closest to Pauline are being hunted as a priority. They will be told to take their temperatures regularly until January 18.

Dr Deahl said it was likely Pauline caught Ebola while off duty in Sierra Leone. He added: "I would bet anything that she caught this while out in the community. I went to church on Christmas morning and I have no doubt Pauline probably contracted the virus doing something similar. We had a rule known as ABC, which stood for Absolute no Body Contact, but when you are in the community it is difficult to stick to the rules and easy to become complacent.

"It is also difficult when children come up and hug you."

Pauline was one of a group of 30 NHS healthcare professionals, including GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants who had been in West Africa treating victims and had flown home together.

Dr Deahl revealed medical staff out there always wore hazard suits at work but some did not when out in the wider community.

He told how the volunteers were "kissing and hugging" farewell at Freetown airport as they left the country - including Pauline, an associate public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.

She returned home from Glasgow airport in a taxi, before ringing the NHS when her condition worsened.

In an interview before going to West Africa, Pauline admitted there was "a certain element of fear" about working in the virus-hit country.

She had been volunteering at a Save the Children treatment centre near Freetown. Prof Davies stressed the risk in Britain remains very low. Ebola is only transmitted through bodily fluids of an infected person and not in the air or by skin to skin contact.

She said her prediction several months ago that the UK would have a "handful" of cases over the course of the outbreak remained unchanged.

Two more people were yesterday being tested after reporting potential symptoms - one at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and one at Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro.

David Cameron chaired a meeting of Cobra, the Government emergency committee, with Ms Sturgeon joining by video link.

A No 10 spokesman said: "He was reassured robust and well-practised procedures that had been put in place were being followed."

A memo of official advice, photographed as it was carried out of the meeting, revealed Pauline's flat, the aeroplanes and the taxi she travelled in would not need to be disinfected.

Ebola has killed more than 7,800 people, mostly in West Africa, since it broke out a year ago.

A BOY aged two who played near a tree used by infected free-tailed bats is the most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of Ebola in west Africa.

Described by scientists as the index case, or patient zero, he was the first to die in his village in Meliandou, Guinea.

The virus spread into Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal killing 7,857.

WHEN the Ebola crisis hit Pauline Cafferkey felt compelled to volunteer with Save the Children and flew out to Freetown in November.

While she was working on the front line, the nurse wrote this moving diary for The Scotsman newspaper in Edinburgh: WEEK ONE: The minute I step off the plane in Sierra Leone, the smell of chlorine hits me.

The area where the Ebola patients are is classed as the infective Red Zone.

We find ourselves saying "good luck" to our colleagues prior to entering the Red Zone, a sobering reminder of what we are doing. WEEK TWO: My dreams always seem to have an Ebola theme, it seems to be all-consuming. WEEK THREE: Had an awful shift this week. I was with a lady who was dying. I could tell she didn't have long, so I was trying to make her comfortable. There was a young boy standing at the window looking in and I waved to him.

A few minutes later she had passed away and I heard the boy crying outside the ward.

When I went to him, he asked if she had died.

I said yes. He said she was his mother. He had already lost his father to Ebola.

As I tried to console him, he said he had a sister who came to the treatment centre with his mother, but he did not know where she was.

A young girl had died that morning. I could not be sure that it was his sister, so I wasn't able to offer him any news. I took him back to his ward and gave him a drink.

I checked the notes and confirmed that the girl who died was his sister. His mother had seen her daughter die in the bed opposite.

The sad thing is this is a regular occurrence.

We see and hear of whole families being wiped out by this awful disease.

WEEK FOUR: A brother and sister were discharged. There were lots of smiles, and they were fortunate to have a mother and father to take them home, which is not often the case.

When this happens it does wonders for staff morale, as some of the things we see are very unpleasant. It helps remind us of the good work we're doing and the reason we're all here.

LEO Varadkar has played down fears that Ebola is en route to Ireland.

The Health Minister said the Scottish aid worker who has contracted the deadly virus had no connection with any Irish person.

He said he had a conference call with the chief medical officer in London's Royal Free Hospital.

Mr Varadkar explained: "It is important to point out this is a case of somebody who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone.

"They are a returned aid worker. Nobody has actually contracted Ebola in Britain.

TRACING "Contact tracing is under way but as far as we know at this stage there were no Irish people on the flights concerned or any people travelling on to Ireland on the flights concerned.

"So in that sense we don't believe there is any immediate threat or any immediate danger here in Ireland but we are of course in contact on a daily basis with the British and European authorities."

The Dail's Health Committee was told in October 14 people here had been tested for Ebola but none of them were positive.

Chief medical officer Tony Holohan said there were 12 beds available in the isolation unit in Dublin's Mater Hospital ready to deal with cases.

Doctors have complained about the failure of health officials to prepare for a possible outbreak.

But Mr Varadkar said: "This situation is still evolving - we need to learn and adapt to it as it happens.

"I am satisfied we are ready but the situation is escalating and we need to escalate our response to that from now on and also get ready to de-escalate it should it be contained in West Africa."

Nurse is UK's first confirmed diagnosis

Passengers on her flight home hunted

A HEALTHCARE worker yesterday became the first person to be diagnosed with the killer Ebola virus while in the UK.

The woman, believed to be a nurse, flew from Sierra Leone to Heathrow via Casablanca then transferred on to a flight to Glasgow, where she arrived late on Sunday.

Officials last night launched a desperate bid to trace her fellow passengers and crew who shared the planes from Africa and internally.

She was admitted to hospital after feeling unwell. At 7.50am she was put in isolation in the specialist Brownlee Unit for Infectious Diseases at Glasgow's Gartnavel Hospital.

The carer, who had helped people hit by the disease in West Africa, flew on a Royal Air Maroc flight from Sierra Leone capital Freetown to Casablanca in Morocco on December 28.

She took another Royal Air Maroc flight from Casablanca to London.

Her final journey was on BA flight 1478 from Heathrow, landing in Glasgow at 11.30pm on Sunday.

Health officials have urged the 71 passengers on the BA flight to ring a hotline set up for everyone on board.

The Scottish government said the risk to others is "extremely low" and it is thought the patient may have only had direct contact with one other person since she was diagnosed. An NHS infectious diseases consultant last night said the woman was stable, which "should translate into a good prognosis". Charity Save the Children said the nurse was one of a group of NHS volunteers at the British-built Ebola treatment centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, which opened in November. It is understood the unnamed woman was screened at Sierra Leone and Heathrow but did not show symptoms of Ebola.

She is due to transfer to an isolation unit in London's Royal Free Hospital as soon as possible.

A spokesman for the hospital, where UK nurse William Pooley was successfully treated this year, said the transfer timing was not yet clear. He added: "We are expecting to receive a patient who tested positive for Ebola."

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said officials are trying to find her fellow passengers "as a precaution".

But he insisted: "The risk is very low to other passengers."

Mr Hunt chaired a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee last night.

Public Health England's medical director Professor Paul Cosford said: "For Ebola to be transmitted, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed. The individual involved did not experience any symptoms consistent with this. So the risk to others is extremely unlikely.

"But as a precaution, PHE is following up all those on the her flight to the UK." Ebola has so far killed 7,693 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

FINDING upbeat news stories in 2014 was harder than trying to find a race or country Jeremy Clarkson didn't offend.

The spread of Ebola, the IS beheadings, the Russian annexation of Crimea, planes falling out of the sky, England's World Cup performance, the rise of UKIP, X Factor taking Christmas Number One again - all made you want to reach for the absinthe.

Then there were the deaths of legends like Tony Benn, Joan Rivers, Bob Crow, Robin Williams, Billie Whitelaw, Rik Mayall, Bob Hoskins, Roger Lloyd-Pack, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joe Cocker,

But there were some chinks of light in the darkness. European scientists beat NASA to land on a comet, the UK stayed united, 6.996 billion people DIDN'T re-tweet that Ellen DeGeneres Oscar selfie, the British people once again gave record amounts to charity and Labour go into a General Election year ahead of the Tories.

Pope's prayers for terror victims

THE Pope used his Christmas message to condemn Islamic State for its "brutal persecution" of religious and ethnic groups - hours after making a surprise phone call to refugees driven out by the terrorists.

Thousands of people gathered in St Peter's Square to hear Pope Francis say people must not be indifferent to the suffering of so many around the world.

He prayed for the people of Iraq and Syria who "for too long now have suffered the effects of ongoing conflict".

He said: "May Christmas bring them hope, as indeed also to the many displaced persons. May indifference be changed into closeness and rejection into hospitality, so that all who now are suffering may receive the necessary humanitarian help to overcome the rigours of winter, return to their countries and live with dignity."

Pope Francis also appealed for an end to conflicts in African nations and called for talks between Israel and Palestine.

He also condemned the attack by Taliban militants that killed more than 130 students in Pakistan last week, and thanked people helping victims of the Ebola epidemic.

On Christmas Eve, Pope Francis, 78, phoned Christian refugees in a camp in Ankawa, Iraq. Via satellite phone, he told them: "You are like Jesus on Christmas night. There was no room for him either."

Ebola test for ill Archbishop

THE ailing Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was tested for Ebola prior to cancelling yesterday's Christmas sermon.

Officials confirmed that he did not have the disease after visiting Sierra Leone last week but had a "heavy cold" which left him too ill to give his annual address.

Dr Welby had spent three hours in the West African country, where he visited children affected by the disease and delivered a sermon in the capital Freetown. A three-day "lockdown" has since been enforced in the north of the country in a bid to contain the spread of Ebola.

Lambeth Palace said Dr Welby had been looked over by Public Health England on his return and added: "He has been fully checked out. He was suffering for a head cold before going to Sierra Leone."

The Archbishop was due to give his sermon at Canterbury Cathedral and talk about the truce between British and German troops in 1914.

He would have said: "The truce illustrates something of the heart of Christmas whereby God sends his Son to a weary war-torn world.

"The problem is that the way it is told now it seems to end with a happy ever after. That is not the world in which we live. Truces are rare."

In a Christmas message released before his planned sermon, he also warned of the scourge of Ebola.

VOICE OF THE

YET again the Queen has shown her ability to sing the tune the rest of the country is humming.

Her Christmas message captured what many of us are feeling about a momentous but at times divisive year.

The Commonwealth and Invictus Games showed the best of our nation. As did the armed forces who served in Afghanistan and the volunteers helping Ebola victims in West Africa. Yet this was also a year marked by the bitterness of the Scottish referendum and tawdry political gamesmanship.

Which is why Her Majesty's call for reconciliation is so important. She noted how a breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process showed the result of reaching out to people.

It is a lesson we must not lose sight of in 2015.

GARETH DUNLOP

Tonight - Flowerfield Arts Centre, Portstewart

It's been another fantastic year for Mr. Dunlop, who's continued to add to an army of fans following a lovely mess of festival appearances, headline shows and notable supports. Leading the way amongst a new wave of troubadours from Northern Ireland that are as forward thinking as they are fantastic, Gareth Dunlop is probably the finest songwriter East Belfast has produced since....well I'm sure he's sick of that comparison so let's leave it there.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

'Lay it Down' is a favourite of mine - rapturous, gospel fused greatness from an act who usually keeps things a little dark and understated.

ASPEN PALES

Saturday 20th December - INF, Warrenpoint.

Weird one this, in that I'd never heard of Aspen Pales this time last week. Then I stumbled upon a song called 'Blue' and became a big fan...within seconds. Beautifully subtle - it's a curious little gem - all dreamy vocals and trippy guitars. Four young lads from Rostrevor, Aspen Pales are launching their debut album at this gig - a collection of songs I'm now very excited about hearing for the first time.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

The aforementioned 'Blue'. Falling for a band based on a single song may be a little daft, but it really is that good.

OH VOLCANO

Tuesday 23rd December - Voodoo, Belfast

You may not have heard of Oh Volcano yet - but you probably have heard of General Fiasco - who also featured the Strathern brothers Owen and Enda. While the charm of General Fiasco remains, Oh Volcano seem comparitively understated and a little more adventurous. As a songwriter Owen Strathern really can do no wrong, so they're definitely a band worth getting excited about nice and early. Also on the bill for this Christmas special are Queer Giraffes, a collective of ridiulously talanted musicians led by social butterfly Steven Toner.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

Queer Giraffes 'Don't be So Sentimental', a dark and quirky duet from Steven Toner and Cara Cowan, is in my top five tracks of the year.

GOOD VIBRATIONS SPECIAL GIGS

Sat 20th Dec - North Street, Belfast / Sun 28th Dec - The Limelight

With Terri Hooley poorly and finally taking some enforced downtime - some of his many, many friends have got together to make sure the legendary Good Vibrations record store keeps ticking over during that all important Christmas rush. A full day of live music and DJs is planned for the shop (now on North St) tomorrow - so make sure pop in if you're doing any last minute shopping. Then Sunday week a major event takes place at The Limelight, with Bap Kennedy, Tony Wright, Iain Archer and Nathan Connolly all on a bill headlined by Tim Wheeler of Ash. Given Terri Hooley has been supportive of the local scene for longer than some of you reading have been alive - it feels like a nice opportunity to help him and his shop out in a time of need. And be entertained somewhat in the process....

LISTEN OUT FOR...

The inevitable cover versions, collaborations and....cameos.

HOZIER

Sunday 21st December - The Ulster Hall, Belfast

This one's very, very sold out of course - Andrew Hozier is one of the biggest and most successful new acts in the world, after all. In fact, his breakthrough track 'Take me To Church' is currently the second most popular song in America (only Taylor Swift is above it) - not bad for a young lad from Wicklow. On record he's incredible, but even with that it's onstage you really see the attraction. A troubadour in the truest sense of the word - his lyrics are hugely engaging and painfully honest. He even looks like someone who's busked his way round the world and lived out of a battered old suitcase. Make sure get down early - cellist and singer Alana Henderson is opening. Not only is she a great artist in her own right, but she also features in Hozier's live band.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

'From Eden' - the vocal in which and story within showcases everything we love about Hozier. Just a perfect little song.

THE ANSWER

Sat 20th December - The Diamond Rock Club, Ahoghill

The Diamond Rock Club is a curious prospect - a tiny bar in a tiny Antrim village that has such a reputation for hosting quality rock n' roll acts that the biggest rock n' roll act in the country - The Answer - are residents of sort. Every turnaround they'll scale down their mammoth live show and play in a venue about a tenth the size of what they're used to. Like a bull in a China shop, you can only imagine the carnage. The Answer should be in splendid form - having only recently completed their forthcoming new album 'Raise a Little Hell'.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

'Spectacular' is the band at their epic, bluesy best.

GARY LIGHTBODY

Tuesday 23rd December - Bangor Abbey, Bangor

Gary Lightbody's a good lad. Every Christmas he performs a show back home, always for a great charity. This year sees him in his home town of Bangor, raising funds for The Northern Ireland Children Hospice, victims of Ebola and the Bangor Abbey Fabric Fund. These shows are always, as you'd expect, extremely intimate and very, very special. Nathan Connolly from Snow Patrol, who's had a great year launching his new band Little Matador will join long time Snow Patrol collaborator Iain Archer on the support bill. Looking a ticket? Don't be silly - they sold out in under a minute.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

'Run' seems like an obvious choice, but given the rendition on this occasion will no doubt feature its co-writter Iain Archer, it should be extra special.

ATL CAROL SERVICE

Monday 22nd December - Studio 8, Belfast

Sort of cheating here, given this one isn't an actual gig any of you can attend. But you can listen, of course! The ATL Carol Service is always my favourite show to present from the entire year. The idea is we get a load of our favourite acts to perform festive songs just for us - either in advance or live in the studio, on the night. In the past this has seen A Plastic Rose collaborate with Hugo Duncan, Bell X1 incorporating elements of Jennifer Lopez into 'Little Donkey', Neil Hannon doing his best choir boy impersonation and Lafaro somehow turning a Queens of the Stone Age track into a sweet little Christmas ditty. Special things happen during the Carol Service and I'm extremely proud to be part of it! Monday evening, 8-10pm, BBC Radio Ulster. Have it soundtrack present wrapping and mince pies!

LISTEN OUT FOR...

BICEP

Friday 26th December

Shine's annual boxing day feast has turned into something of a showcase for the healthy state of the house and techno scene in Northern Ireland. Belfast house duo Bicep have had a remarkable year - enjoying festival headline slots, sold out shows all over the world and a residency at Space in Ibiza. They're curate the main room under their 'Feel my Bicep' moniker. Also on the bill - local producers and DJs done good Swoose, Cromby and Schmutz. Detroit Techno legend Jeff Mills is the icing on the (Christmas) cake. Shine also present a NYE party with the focus on local talent, headlined by Ejeca and Phil Kieran.

AXIS OF

Wednesday 31st December - The Empire, Belfast

A ballsy move having an album launch of New Years Eve - a night people generally don't associate with quality live music, let alone quality north coast punk. But Axis Of are a ballsy lot - already responsible for 'Finding St. Kilda', a raucous debut album that gathered them quite a following on release in late 2012. The follow up 'The Mid Brae Inn' is set to be a real development, if the wonderfully poppy first single 'Wetsuit' is anything to go by. More Than Conquerors, BeeMickSee and Team RKT complete a quadruple bill showcasing the fantastic variety amongst the music scene in Northern Ireland at present. Even with my dayjob as a DJ playing out big tunes to the masses - I'd recommend this over any DJ playing out big tunes to the masses.

LISTEN OUT FOR... All four bands have any number of big tunes, but I'm very curious as to what we'll hear at midnight. A punk pop version of 'Auld Lang Syne'? Probably not as that would sound dreadful, but I'm sure someone has a wee party piece up their sleeve....

CASHIER No. 9

Wednesday 31st December - Voodoo, Belfast

Also on New Year's Eve, the continuing return of Cashier No 9 - the until recently MIA band responsible for the album 'To the Death of Fun', released way back in 2011. Primarily the work of supremely talanted Carryduff native Danny Todd (with David Holmes on production duties) that album will stand the test of time and be regarded as something of a modern Northern Irish classic. To say the follow up is long awaited is something of an understatement and this gig gives fans an opportunity to see just how Cashier No.9 are are going to attempt to top that joyous collection of songs. Staples of the local scene and real favourites of mine - Desert Hearts will make for a pretty unmissable double bill.

LISTEN OUT FOR...

'Goldstar' - the opening track on the aforementioned album - is so glitzy and passionate it's practically festive.

She's most Googled female star

IT seems internet users are still Crazy In Love with Beyonce as the singer was the most searched for female star on Google this year.

The 33-year-old was at the centre of a frenzy of internet interest after her husband Jay Z's high-profile bust-up with her sister Solange Knowles in a hotel lift.

Video footage of the ruck went global and speculation over the celebrity couple's relationship dogged them for months.

Hunger Games beauty Jennifer Lawrence was the second most searched for female on Google. And Great British Bake Off queen Mary Berry also made the top 10 of online requests for information along with Harry Potter actress Emma Watson, and singers Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.

Chart-topper Ed Sheeran was the most searched for male celebrity, ahead of Jay Z, One Direction hunk Harry Styles and Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch.

Google's annual review of who's hot and the most talked about events of the year found Ebola was the No1 news story. Luis Suarez's World Cup bite, Scottish independence and the police raid of Sir Cliff Richard's home also made the top 10.

The untimely deaths of Peaches Geldof, Robin Williams, Lynda Bellingham and Rik Mayall captured hearts with millions of fans posting their condolences.

Budget chain New Look was the UK's most searched for fashion brand. Google's Stephen Rosenthal said: "Our Year in Search gives us the best snapshot of what moved, inspired, shocked and intrigued us."

INTIMATE XMAS BANGOR GIGS ANNOUNCED

It wouldn't be Christmas time without a traditional festive homecoming show from the nation's prodigal sons, would it? Snow Patrol, well Gary and Nathan anyway, have just announced the details of super special, intimate acoustic shows at Bangor Abbey on Tuesday December 23.

Both Gary and Nathan will be performing solo gigs, along with a few collaborations no doubt, and will also be joined by long-time song-writing partner and extraordinary artist in his own right, Iain Archer. Again, Iain will be doing a solo acoustic set of his own thing and we assume, although don't quote us on this, will join the lads for a few numbers in what sounds like an occasion that will be very special and memorable.

Snow Patrol, as we know them, have been enjoying a bit of an unofficial hiatus; Gary forging ahead with his beautiful, superstar-filled Tired Pony project and Nathan blazing a trail with the amazing Little Matador. Both bands, who couldn't be further be further apart in terms of sound and performance, have been a remarkable success. Tired Pony's stripped back, countrytinged folktronica has really brought Gary's incredible lyrical and songwriting talent while Little Matador's full-on, driven midwest rock vibes have channelled Nathan's core rock persuasions into a blistering live band that are like very few others.

This will be the first time in ages the guys have performed together locally and probably the smallest venue since the early days of gigging upstairs in Morrisons. Originally established in 558, Bangor Abbey includes a tower which dates back to the 14th Century and In recent times the Abbey has hosted concerts by the likes of David Gray and Bonnie Prince Billy. It is also where Foy Vance recorded his forthcoming live album.

Having been to the past few festive shows the guys have played, we can testify to how amazing they are - a hybrid of laid back acoustic treatments and a few quirky surprises.

And in addition to all of this, all proceeds from the event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Children's Hospice, The Church of Ireland Bishop's Appeal - Ebola Crisis, and Bangor Abbey fabric fund.

We do have some bad news, though. Tickets go/ went on sale this morning at 9am via ticketmaster. ie and you don't need us to tell you that Bangor Abbey ain't the Odyssey. These will be gone quick time - if you're lucky enough to snap one up, here's to a special gig that will linger long in the memory.

The Bangor singer surprised residents this week when he announced he would play an intimate Christmas show at the town's Abbey.

Thousands are expected to try and get tickets today for the one-off gig on December 23.

Gary has travelled the world with his Ivor Novello winning band but has never forgotten his hometown.

In 2007 he organised for Snow Patrol to play a gig to thousands in Bangor's Ward Park. It was so popular that the band staged a similar event in 2010.

Now he is to return for a solo turn at Bangor Abbey for an acoustic show, with special guests Nathan Connolly and Iain Archer.

All proceeds from the event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Children's Hospice, The Church of Ireland Bishops' appeal - Ebola Crisis, and Bangor Abbey fabric fund.

A source said: "It is the place where Gary grew up and he was very keen to play it. It all came together very quickly."

Gary will perform tracks he wrote in memoriam of Seamus Heaney, alongside a selection of Snow Patrol and Tired Pony songs.

Tickets for the gig go on sale at 9am today at £17.50 at Ticketmaster outlets or online at www.ticketmaster.ie[http://www.ticketmaster.ie] or on 0870 243 4455.

6 People getting in a lather about Imperial Leather's "Wash Posh" products failed to lift profits at PZ Cussons. The group said trading in its washing and bathing division in the UK had been strong in the six months to November 30 and operating profits in Europe and Asia were higher than at the same stage last year. However, overall profits were 4% down on last year because of troubles in its African division, mainly Nigeria. PZ said sales had been hit by the weaker economy and currency volatility in the West African state, while the Ebola crisis had affected cross-border trade.

We must stop Ebola killing kids' education

As epidemic closes African schools and children are forced to work to survive, the former Labour PM pleads for help...

Bodies lying randomly strewn across pavements, cowering children standing too close, their faces full of fear. And always the image. The Ebola virus. A yellow worm. A background badge on every television report. Deadly. Terrifying.

As the world watches this relentless crisis unfold and prays for cure and for containment, the day-to-day reality has created nightmarish suffering in West Africa. The outbreak is now nine months old. Since March 2014 it has wiped out the lives of 5,000 people.

And the impact has taken a resounding toll on already vulnerable communities - the marginalised, the poor, people living in rural areas, the illiterate, women and girls.

But as fear sweeps across three nations in particular, Ebola is also putting the lives of five million children on hold. These boys and girls are the victims of widespread classroom closures in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. They need to learn and they can't. The consequences could be disastrous.

A day in the typical life of a child in one of these three countries is vastly different from a year ago.

Where then they had a safe environment for learning, now they have nothing. Many of their schools have been closed as a preventative measure to stop the spread of the epidemic. Other schools are being used to care for Ebola patients.

This means the education system instantly breaks down. Young people congregate on the streets or other public places, which is completely at odds with the public health rationale for closing schools.

Without schools, the daily life of a typical girl leaves her at much higher risk. Reports indicate increased child pregnancy rates and some girls who should be at school are already planning early marriages.

Many young children are being forced into child labour, working to make up for the lost wages of parents or relatives affected by the epidemic, or to help keep a family afloat during difficult times.

And the real tragedy is that if these children miss a year or more of school, it is 50% more likely that they will never return. Closing schools could shut the doors of opportunity for ever for five million children.

Distance learning and technologybased education are possibilities, but the lack of infrastructure means they are not immediately available for most children.

Africa's business community, led by Strive Masiyiwa and Aliko Dangote, are leading the way in a new Global Business Coalition and A World at School report calling for the immediate provision of education and a rapid, responsible reopening of safe schools.

Nobel Peace Prize winners Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi, who collect their shared award in Oslo today, have backed the plea.

Some schools may need to be temporarily closed to control the spread of Ebola. But once that initial need has passed, schools can be the first line of proactive defence in preventing the spread of Ebola and keeping children safe. The new report highlights some of the main components of a safe school - including adequate public health training for teachers, twice-daily temperature checks, education programs on public health and Ebola transmission, school feeding and establishing plans to monitor and trace the epidemic, including plans for isolation of suspected cases.

Safe schools can restore hope and help curtail the impact of Ebola. And the use of schools in the middle of a public health crisis does have a proven track record. During the SARS outbreak in Asia teachers performance twice-daily temperature checks and it was instantly effective in stopping the spread.

In Nigeria, all state Ministries of Education were ordered to ensure that at least two staff in each school were properly trained on Ebola by health workers.

In the United States the use of schools to prevent flu is estimated to stop 63 million cases each year.

So there is a strong precedent for using schools to help prevent the spread of disease. But for something with such clear benefits, financing it is always the key challenge. Surely no price is too big to pay for saving a child's life, let alone five million? One of the great tragedies of our age is that despite its known benefits, education in emergencies typically receives less than two per cent of humanitarian response funding.

And it's not just Ebola - we have seen also vacuums in the international system for providing education for the children of Syria, girls in northern Nigeria and in South Sudan, to name just a few immediate instances.

Hope can only be restored through education. But in the absence of international mechanisms and pooled funds for education in emergencies, we must go donor by donor to get the response children deserve and to build up the capacity needed to deliver.

United Nations agencies are ready to move and are working handin-hand with governments to establish clear guidelines for the reopening of safe schools and draw up the necessary plans.

Now we must give these governments the confidence needed to move forward with a swift and deliberate plan of action to put the reopening of safe schools into action.

One more preventable case of Ebola, one more child marriage, one more child forced into labour is one too many.

The children of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone deserve our full support to reopen safe schools immediately.

Safe schools can re-open as a first line of defence to stop the spread of the disease

BOB Geldof has said Band Aid's critics can "f*** off ". The Boomtown Rats frontman told William Pooley, the Ebola survivor who slammed the charity single, he needs to relax.

The nurse caught the disease while working in Sierra Leone.

He criticised the record, saying it implied Africans don't know it's Christmas.

Mr Pooley said: "It's Africa, not another planet. That sort of cultural ignorance is a bit cringeworthy.

"There's a lyric about 'death in every tear'. It's a bit much."

But Geldof, 63, hit back saying: "Please. It's a pop song. Relax. It's not a doctoral thesis. They can f*** off.

"The reality behind the pop song - Christmassy, corny, whatever you think about it - the reality behind it is stark."

THEY already rule the pop world and last night One Direction made it to Parliament - as a video of Band Aid 30 was projected onto the building.

Harry Styles and his bandmates were shown with the rest of Sir Bob Geldof 's charity supergroup on the side of Westminster as it shone in the dark.

It came ahead of the single's release on CD today. All the money raised will go towards fighting Ebola in West Africa.

Describing the track as a "small weapon", Sir Bob, 63, said: "We need to keep up momentum. I want us to raise £5million but we need people to understand we've only got three weeks to make a difference."

The song was No 1 after it came out online on November 24. But today CDs costing £3.99 hit the shelves and Sir Bob is urging people to buy them, as they will raise more than a 99p download. The Boomtown Rats star said last night: "There is one thing that unites Parliament, the Mirror, Band Aid and the whole country.

"And that is to give the children who have survived the death of their parents from Ebola a home and a life, to help stop any further agony, to support the doctors, and perhaps to allow the dying to do so with more dignity and less pain."

Along with 1D, the fourth version of the hit - originally out 30 years ago - features stars such as Bono, Ed Sheeran and Ellie Goulding. Sir Bob has also changed the lyrics.

He said: "The worst thing I can think of is not being able to comfort your child who is dying, so I changed it to 'where to comfort is to fear and where there's death in every tear'. This thing is spread by body liquids. If you wipe a child's eyes, there's a 60% chance you may get it."

Sir Bob had asked Commons Speaker John Bercow for rare permission to project the Band Aid 30 video onto Parliament. Watching the display at 5pm, Mr Bercow said: "It looks fabulous, it has literally lit up the Speaker's House. It's made my day."

Sir Bob now hopes to mirror the success of this year's charity Ice Bucket Challenge with his own Band Aid Challenge.

People are being asked to belt out Bono's "Tonight we're reaching out and touching you" line online, donate cash, and nominate three pals to do the same. Sir Bob said: "I've got a bunch of celebs lined up to do it."

Geldof ribs star on why he isn't on Ebola crisis song

BOB Geldof has hit back at claims Band Aid 30's track is "smug" and "hypocritical".

The star also explained why he didn't ask Paul McCartney to perform on it, joking that the Beatle "didn't make the cut".

After the latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas? became the biggest selling downloaded single of 2014, the popular philanthropist, 63, is now releasing a CD of the song.

All proceeds again go to fundraising efforts in West Africa in a bid to end the Ebola crisis.

Asked why McCartney was not invited to contribute, he said: "Because Macca's always done stuff. He was in the band in 2004 - him, Radiohead and Damon."

He then joked: "But look, on this we've got from the newest to the hippest to the oldest... and he hasn't made the cut, what can I tell you? The thing is, there's only so many lines, so what do you do? At one point Midge Ure was like, 'We can't take more', so you try and make it the girls and the boys, that's the first thing.

"Then it's who's happening in America - that's really important as sales are quantifiably more over there.

"Ellie Goulding, Ed Sheeran, One Direction, Coldplay, Sam Smith, U2... all these people are caning it in America."

On claims the song is hypocritical and smug, Bob revealed many of the artists involved gave time and money to the project.

He said: "Should we take a pop at everybody who is immensely talented and has money?"

EVERYDAD, Alan Titchmarsh (yes, he's a national treasure, but I can't stand that term) who worked his way up from a working-class lad to a national… err... everydad, is cross.

He's miffed because he worked hard to achieve his success but reckons success breeds envy in some.

"But then when you've got on," he says, "why are you vilified? You lose your right to an opinion."

I don't know, Alan. But you are correct. Just ask Russell Brand, whose scalp is currently being hunted for having the temerity to be well-off, while simultaneously standing up for those who aren't.

Revolutionary Russell who, I concede, I do have a very soft spot for, had a turbulent upbringing following his parents' separation when he was just six months old. His commitment phobia stems from witnessing his dad having a series of girlfriends.

He says his childhood, during which he was sexually abused by a tutor, was lonely and isolated.

He lived with relatives when his mum was fighting cancer and left home when he was 16 because he didn't get on with his mum's partner.

His young life, then, was anything but privileged or idyllic. He has worked hard to lift himself from an existence that wasn't sustainable. He has, hopefully, left the difficult parts behind but they will be forever ingrained in his make-up.

He knows what having a tough life is, what it means, how it's like crashing into the buffers every day. How when you're at your lowest, people treat you as though you are the lowest.

How banks shun you, how no one values you, how unscrupulous landlords screw you for inflated rent.

So, on Monday, he took to Downing Street to join a rent protest.

He could have had a lie-in in his rented flat, which is apparently worth £1.5million. Or penned another book. But he didn't - he wanted to help draw attention to the hordes of renters being ripped off, and sometimes ruined by, greedy landlords.

What is the problem with that? The man's done well. Good on him. Most successful people pull the ladder up behind them, while seeking the best tax-dodge to further feather their nests.

Does Brand's success mean he doesn't have an opinion any more? Does it mean he couldn't give a toss? Bob Geldof hasn't contracted Ebola in Africa. Does it mean he can't speak out about it? The Queen cannot possibly know how most of us live. Does that mean she can't represent us? It is ludicrous - as well as undemocratic - to suggest Russell Brand doesn't possess empathy because he possesses a good income.

Roll on the Russell Revolution!

Macca: I lost a stone in one week with mystery stomach bug on Japan tour

PAUL McCartney lost a stone in just one week after being rushed to hospital in Japan with a mystery bug.

Speaking for the first time about the drama in May he said: "It was some stomach thing and I was throwing up and didn't eat for a week, which is one way to lose weight.

"That's not recommended. I lost nearly a stone or something."

Sir Paul, 72, praisedTokyo who nursed him back to health, saying: "They looked after me amazingly and by then I was on the drugs anyway, so I didn't care. I felt great."

The bug forced the star to pull out of a string of Asian concerts.

He said he "wasn't worried about it being life-threatening" but added: "It was enough to lay me up quite quickly whatever it was and then they said 'Take six weeks off '. "My friends said 'Normally, you'd hate that 'cos you love working'.

"But I took six weeks and came back stronger than ever."

Paul has vowed to return to Asia to continue the tour, adding: "I'm going back to Japan next year."

The former Beatle was speaking in front of a hologram of himself to launch his new song Hope For The Future, released on Monday.

He had a full body scan in LA to produce the image but insisted the process was "not scary". He also revealed that Bob Geldof did not call him to join the Band Aid 30 lineup to record Do They Know It's Christmas? despite his featuring on the original recording in 1984.

He joked: "I was away in Brazil so they didn't ring me.

"What are you playing at, Bob? I was in the original.

"I think the new one is OK. It's great that it's raising a lot of money for Ebola victims. That's the main thing."

Paul, whose new single was written for record-breaking video game Destiny, insisted he would never follow U2 and give away an album on iTunes.

He said: "I don't think I'd do that. I wouldn't want people asking to delete it. That slightly backfired, didn't it? "I'm not sure those grand gestures are cool to do.

"You talk about it - you always have a meeting and you go 'Oh, shall we just drop it like Beyonce?'

But half an hour later you go: 'Nah.'"

SCIENTISTS yesterday began a second wave of trials on an Ebola drug to see if a booster injection gives increased protection.

Half the 60 volunteers who tried the experimental vaccine at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in November will now be given a follow-up vaccine.

Prof Adrian Hill said: "There is uncertainty about what level of immunity is required to protect people."

The trial has led to promising immune responses in 20 volunteers. The virus has so far killed 6,000 people.

Experts warn of food price hikes

FAMILIES are being urged to start stocking up their freezers as food prices are set to soar faster than wages and above inflation.

Experts predict a budget-busting 3.5% hike in groceries next year as the cost of staples - from chicken and cheese to chocolate - rockets.

A Food and Drink Inflation Report reveals 2015 will see an end to some of the lowest prices for 14 years.

Butter and cheese will become more expensive and pasta prices will increase because of the poor harvests in Canada - a main producer of durum wheat.

The cost of British-reared chicken is also likely to rise as farmers struggle to keep up with demand.

And chocoholics should stock up before fears of Ebola reaching cocoagrowing nations send costs sky high and turn the treat into a luxury.

The report, by industry analysts Prestige Purchasing, also warned of the practice of "reducing sizes of products but retaining or increasing the price".

HERE'S a first look at the new Vauxhall Viva - and it is nothing like the 1963 original.

The car giant has revived the name to replace the Agila. Unlike BMW's Mini there's no retro styling. But the new Viva will be cheaper than the original. Made in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, it sold for £527, around £9,000 today.

The new one, out next spring, will cost a lot less at £7,500.

MODEL HAS GUESTS BROUGHT TO HER AT PARTY

She might have mellowed in recent years, but Naomi Campbell can still display some diva-like behaviour.

The supermodel, 44, didn't budge from her spot at the VIP launch bash for her Fashion For Relief Pop-Up.

So instead of moving around and chatting to people, guests were brought to her. A source close to Naomi tells 3am that this was apparently done "for ease" at the do.

The style veteran, who is raising funds for the DEC Ebola Crisis Appeal, arrived fashionably late, keeping everyone waiting at Westfield in West London for an hour and a half. The source adds: "Naomi and her entourage had a nightmare getting to the venue due to parking issues.

"It was unexpected and she was anxious to arrive."

Once their star had settled into her spot - with optimum complimentary lighting - Naomi told 3am: "The Ebola crisis is scary. We're waiting to find out about a vaccine. What do we do to protect ourselves? You know, we're just washing our hands constantly.

"It's nice to be given information as we get it so we know what to do. You see in the airports, people are a bit more tentative."

The Face judge, who was discovered at the age of 15 and is estimated to be worth £30million, called on all her contacts in the fashion industry, including Givenchy, Kate Moss and Stella McCartney, to donate designer items to her charity pop-up shop, which is open until Thursday.

But Naomi - who posed for a picture with hunky actor Idris Elba - insists persuading pals was easy as it's such a worthy cause.

She says: "People help because they want to. They know that I will only get behind something that's really important - they also feel the same. Kate has given us something very lovely, but I'm keeping it a secret."

Naomi, who is renowned for a diva reputation and has faced court over violent outbursts, insists she's more Zen now.

She said recently: "You have to be happy and have a positive mind. I do yoga and Pilates and sometimes bootcamp. I am at peace. If I wasn't, you would know."

In 2000 Naomi pleaded guilty to assaulting her personal assistant with a mobile phone and seven years later pleaded guilty to assaulting her former maid with a BlackBerry. In 2008 she spat at two police officers at Heathrow in a row over luggage.

At least these days she's fuelling her inner diva for a good cause.

She arrived fashionably late and then did not budge from her spot

Breakthrough after tests in the US

SCIENTISTS have hailed a vaccine against the killer Ebola virus which could prevent all future outbreaks.

The current epidemic has infected 16,000 people in total and killed almost 6,000.

The British-made vaccine was tested on 20 healthy US volunteers.

Scientists said they all developed Ebola antibodies within four weeks. There have been no serious side effects so far but the volunteers' progress will be monitored for 48 weeks.

The vaccine, made by drugs giant GLAXOSMITHKLINE, carries genetic material from two strains of Ebola.

It can't infect people with the disease but teaches the body to recognise the killer virus and prepares the immune system to attack it. There is no cure yet for Ebola.

Dr Anthony Fauci, of the US National Institutes of Health, where the vaccine was tested, called the results "promising".

He added: "There are many challenges but we are one step closer to a solution. It's good news. If it didn't induce good immune response, we couldn't go on.

"If the outbreak is still happening six months from now and the vaccine at that point is shown to be effective, it could have a very positive impact on the epidemic."

If other trials of the vaccine in the UK, Switzerland and Mali produce similar results, GSK will vaccinate thousands of frontline health workers in West Africa early next year.

Sinead, who featured on the track, defended the song which aims to raise funds to tackle the Ebola crisis.

"The assumption that anyone performing on the record has not privately given money is exactly that, an assumption. And who gives a f**k what Damon f**king Albarn thinks?"

The Voice of Ireland coach blasted Geldof and said he needs to "leave it alone" and stop ruining the festive hit.

Band Aid released the anti-Ebola charity single, Do They Know It's Christmas?, featuring contributions from Bono, Sinead O'Connor and One Direction.

Bressie, 34, said: "Back when Band Aid was released it was for serious famine, and Ebola is almost a Western thing now. It doesn't feel as authentic as it was when it started."

But he added he has no time for any of the stars, like Lily Allen, who have decided to publicly snub the single.

He added: "Just do it, it's making money, it's really not harming anybody."

BAND Aid creator Bob Geldof has urged people to delete and re-download the Band Aid 30 single.

The new track to raise money for the Ebola crisis in West Africa has been extremely successful - selling more than 300,000 copies in its first week.

But the Boomtown Rats frontman is worried the cheaper price of music means it won't make as much as the first Band Aid song did 30 years ago.

Geldof said: "In 1984 a single was £3.50 [€4.40], today it's 99p. That worries me.

"Even if you already have it, delete, download again.

"We need to sell 300% more than we did then to make up the cash figure."

The new single, which features Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Emeli Sande, is still a long way off the €10million raised in 1984.

I had my suspicions when I heard the Band Aid single had been released for a fourth time.

As I watched those old white rock stars St Bono and Sir Bob getting down with the kids to save an entire continent, the suspicions grew.

And when I saw Sir Bob rehashing his old TV swearing act to "shock" us, I was sure it was a parody.

How else to explain the ham-fisted tinkering with a song about a completely different disaster from 30 years ago and the dangerous inaccuracy of the pan-African message (it has 54 countries, only three now affected by Ebola).

Geldof's intent may be wellmeaning but his lyrics, which stereotype Africans as starving, helpless, with "no peace and joy" in their lives, seem as dated as a Benny Hill sketch.

Benny Ebola has been around for eight months. British taxpayers have given £230million to fight it, individuals have pledged £21million. Do we really need multimillionaire rock stars pretending it's just happened but, luckily, they're here to save the day? r eight ave given duals we really ars d but, he day? come that adiator ong called released ds are are."

So patronising has this become that a website called Radi-Aid (Radiator Aid) has been set up and a song called Africa For Norway has been released with the lyrics: "In Norway kids are freezing, it's time for us to care."

Yes, Sir Bob, Africa does know it's Christmas time.

But do you know it's time to put this song to bed?

Professor Green may not have been invited to take part in the Band Aid 30 single but he's not 100% sold on the new lyrics anyway.

The rapper, seen out with wife Millie Mackintosh in London earlier this week, says: "I think some of the lyrics were a bit questionable, weren't they? "I don't necessarily agree with all of the lyrics but I don't disagree with the cause." Fair.

The Prof's ruling, made as he promoted the new Spotify + Uber integration, came after Fuse ODG pulled out of Sir Bob Geldof's track, to raise funds for Ebola, saying the new words gave a negative image of Africa.

Fuse didn't like "Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear", and "There is no peace and joy in West Africa this Christmas". He said: "For four years I have gone to Ghana at Christmas for peace and joy. To sing these lyrics would simply be a lie."

Martin's Top 10 Christmas Saving Tips

New series

THE MARTIN LEWIS MONEY SHOW

Fri ITV 8pm

On a tight budget? ODreading the cost of Christmas? Us too! But don't despair - money saving expert Martin Lewis is coming to the rescue. He's kicking off his new nine-part series with Saira Khan on so-called Black Friday. "It's the day retailers slash their prices in the run-up to Christmas," explains Martin.

And he predicts when shops will be launching their sales.

"Last year, I was 90 per cent accurate," says Martin, "and I'm even more confident this year!"

Here are the money-saving guru's best ways to cut costs and still have a Happy Xmas...

Martin's Top 10 Chistmas Saving Tips

1 Don't pay for Christmas from December's income. Put aside what you can afford in the months before, then work out what is the best possible Xmas you can afford within your budget.

2 Delay Christmas! The most expensive time to buy is just before December 25, the cheapest is just after. Give your family an IOU on Christmas Day, then buy the present later in the sales. Just buy a couple of small gifts for the day itself.

3 Bag 5 per cent off your shopping. Cashback credit cards pay you each time you spend on them. Set up a direct debit to repay in full each month to avoid interest, and you're quids in. The cashback's usually paid on the anniversary of opening the account. The Amex Platinum Everyday (above, min income £20,000) pays a huge 5 per cent back, up to £100, on all spending in the first three months. After that, it's up to 1.25 per cent. So apply now and the big cashback may cover Xmas next year (fail to fully repay and it's 19.9 per cent APR).

4 If you don't know what to give, donate to charity in your friend's name - perhaps the Ebola fundraiser via www.dec.org.uk[http://www.dec.org.uk]. Or, buy a gift card that tells the recipient what you bought in their name. A £5 donation pays for 50 bowls of rice to feed 50 hungry children via www.goodgifts.org[http://www.goodgifts.org].

5 Give time, not money.Don't feel under pressure to always spend. Give a personal gift cheque, such as a promise to babysit, to wash a car (below), cook a meal, or give your partner a massage on demand. There are some lovely personal cheques available on the internet.

6 Ban unnecessary Christmas presents. People give to an ever-widening glut of extended family and colleagues. Make a pact with all but close family to ban presents. This will save you a lot of hassle and time, and stop someone who can't afford to buy you something back feeling awkward.

7 If you have small children, give them something to make them happy (right), not something that costs a lot. Last year, in an experiment, I gave five-year-olds some empty present boxes. They were still happily playing with them 40 minutes later.

8 Don't 'upshift' your turkey (left). At Christmas, people are tempted to buy something special. Yet labels such as 'Finest' or 'Taste The Difference' can be more about packaging than product.

9 The same applies to drinks. For the last TV series, I blind tested champagnes. Most preferred Lidl's own brand to Moet!

10If you're resorting to buying perfume or aftershave, do it now. More people buy scent on Christmas Eve than during the entire month of August. Boots and Superdrug currently have up to 50 per cent off selected fragrances. Do a comparison for the best price at www.fragrancescompared.co.uk[http://www.fragrancescompared.co.uk].

To be really radical, there are a growing number of smell-a-like perfumes. For example, Next's Just Pink (75ml) at £14 (left) smells similar to Ralph Lauren Romance (50ml) which is £40.

I'M thinking of getting a dance troupe together to dance away the effects of global warming and climate change.

Well, if Bob Geldof and his merry band aiders can sing away Ebola...

While there is no doubt that the former Boomtown Rat is well-meaning and the money raised is needed, releasing Christmas songs to fight a tropical disease is just wrong.

Band Aid might just as well be called the "White Man's Burden" for its premise is that the Africans just can't look after themselves.

I've been to Sierra Leone and Liberia and what they need is help developing their health services not charity Christmas singles which are the modern-day equivalent of pennies for the black babies.

Times have changed and many people in African countries are angry with being labelled perpetual charity cases, while the public here are fed up being asked for cash by those who avoid paying tax in their own countries.

Will, of Eyke, Suffolk is working at an isolation unit run by UK medics in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

Rocker needed 5-hour reconstructive op

DOCTORS treating Bono following his "cycling spill" said his injuries are far more serious than first thought.

The U2 singer had five hours of reconstructive surgery to repair fractures to his face, a shattered shoulder and a broken arm.

The accident on Sunday happened as Bono tried to avoid another cyclist in what was called a "high-energy bicycle accident" in New York's Central Park. The impact was so great it left a bone "tearing through his skin".

The Angel of Harlem singer was taken to the New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center's emergency department before going into theatre.

Dr Dean Lorich said the 54-year-old suffered a "facial fracture involving the orbit of his eye" and three separate fractures of his left shoulder blade. He added: "The elbow was washed out and debrided.

"A nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws."

Bono had flown to Manhattan a day after he had jetted to London to record his line of the Band Aid 30 single, to raise money to combat the spread of Ebola in West Africa.

The accident saw the singer's bad luck continue in November when earlier in the month he "cheated death" while on a private jet when the door was ripped off in mid air.

As the plane was at a low altitude the pilot landed the Learjet 60 D-CGEO safely.

He was travelling with four friends to the Bambi International Music awards.

Bono had flown on ahead of the other U2 members, after being invited to a diplomatic event with a German Government minister.

TV ends Band Aid man's chat for swearing

BAND Aid mastermind Sir Bob Geldof turned foul-mouthed on TV at the suggestion the single's 30 singers could pay more tax.

Sky News pulled the plug on the live interview when Geldof twice said "b*****ks" responding to questions.

The first came over critics' claims re-recording charity singles such as Do They Know It's Christmas Time? would be unnecessary if the artists "all paid their taxes in the right way".

His second outburst was in response to a journalist's suggestion the song was trite, will raise a comparative pittance, ignores Africans, as well as having a logo implying Ebola, the virus the single is raising money to fight, has struck the entire continent. Sky's Jayne Secker ended the chat when Geldof, 63, swore for the second time.

The track, which features stars including One Direction, Bono, Chris Martin and Ed Sheeran, made £1million in just five minutes after being launched on Sunday night's X Factor. Speaking about the soaring sales on Radio 4's Today programme, Geldof said: "It's gone manic. That's the digital age. We promoted the single on X Factor, Simon Cowell gave us five minutes of the show last night.

"Within four or five minutes of leaving the show we had a million quid. That's extraordinary. From what we're seeing now from iTunes it's gone bonkers. The pre-orders of the thing were ridiculous."

He urged people to buy as many copies as possible.

Geldof famously swore during the 1985 Live Aid fundraiser telling the host "f*** the address, let's get the numbers."

halina.watts@mirror.co.uk VOICE OF MIRROR: P8 THE INTERVIEW SKY NEWS PRESENTER JAYNE SECKER: There are detractors saying "there are an awful lot of people in that room, a lot of wealthy people. If they all paid their taxes in the right way, we wouldn't need these kind of fundraising singles". What would you say to them? SIR BOB GELDOF: I think they are talking b*******.

SECKER: Pretty colourful language. If you could not use any more we would appreciate it. I also wanted to put something else to you written by Ian Birrell, you may have heard of him. He is a journalist and a founder of the Africa Express project. He says: "This trite song will raise a comparative pittance, ignores Africans, and has a logo implying the virus struck the entire continent, patronising and perpetuating myths again. Band Aid should have learned its lessons and stayed silent". Perhaps less colourfully, what would be your response to that? GELDOF: A complete load of b*******.

SECKER: OK, I'm afraid we will have to apologise for that language again and there we will leave it. Sir Bob Geldof thank you very much for joining us today and talking about the single.

IT'S hard not to smile when mercurial Bob Geldof hasn't learned over 30 years that swearing isn't allowed on TV.

The ageing rocker's campaign to raise funds to beat Ebola will help save lives so his crude language can be forgiven again.

But Sir Bob should accept questions about tax deserve answers not outbursts.

It's also a scandal that developing countries such as exploited Sierra Leone lose three times more revenue to tax havens than they receive in aid.

Fresh fears as growth slows

PRIME Minister David Cameron has warned of a new global crash, amid signs UK growth is slowing.

He said the "red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy" the same way they did ahead of the credit crunch six years ago.

The PM's gloomy tone comes ahead of the Government's autumn statement on December 3, when the budget watchdog sets out growth forecasts.

Writing for the Guardian, he said: "The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a possible third recession, with high unemployment, falling growth and the real risk of falling prices. Emerging economies, the driver of growth early in the recovery, are slowing. Despite the progress in Bali [conference in 2013], global trade talks have stalled while Ebola, conflict in the Middle East and Russia's illegal actions in Ukraine all add dangerous instability and uncertainty."

Mr Cameron's downbeat forecast came as former Tory PM Sir John Major warned people are turning to "profoundly un-British" UKIP because the recovery has passed them by.

Led by Nigel Farage, the party is tipped to win Thursday's Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent.

Sir John told the BBC: "I think many people voting for them do so out of frustration at the on-going difficulties of the recession, the belief they are losing out and falling behind. We now have over 3% growth, unemployment has shrunk by a quarter." But for some, he said, "growth has not yet reached wages".

He insisted things will improve next year as he blasted UKIP, saying: "It seems profoundly un-British in every way. They're anti-everything, antipolitics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant… I do not know what they are for."

Mr Cameron is facing a "Black Thursday" despite pledging to "throw the kitchen sink" at the Rochester contest, which senior Tories have described as a "must-win".

But yesterday a Cabinet minister said the Tories know they will lose. . Bookies William Hill make UKIP 1/33 favourites to win, the Tories 10/1, Labour 100/1 and Lib Dems 250/1. james.lyons@mirror.co.uk

The England captain will join Scotland manager Gordon Strachan and Scottish midfielder Darren Fletcher in a message urging fans to give money to a fund set up by Unicef to help victims of the virus. The Prime Minister also announced that the Government will spend a further £1.34million on Ebola research.

He added that the UK had "secured real action from G20 leaders".

However, Oxfam described the G20's response as "hugely disappointing" and said the leaders "have not made new commitments to deal with the crisis".

And tycoon Geldof - a self-declared "private equity whore" - has sought to make big profits in Africa.

Beating deadly Ebola shouldn't depend on a charity Band-Aid.

For the record, I've made a donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee instead of listening to Bob and Bono's single.

The Prime Minister is pushing for the G20 group to act together to develop a licensed vaccine for the virus as soon as possible.

He wants the gathering to commit to donating more money to the affected West African countries to pay for more health workers and medical support.

Mr Cameron wrote earlier this month to the Australian PM Tony Abbott, who is hosting the summit, to get Ebola on the agenda and tackle the crisis "head on".

The UK has given the second largest aid package to the countries hit, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Who says you can't breathe new life into an old song? Some people do, unfortunately.

This weekend, history is being made and repeated in one go. 30 years on from the massive success of Band Aid, "Do They Know It's Christmas?" is being reincarnated for a fourth release - this time to help the victims of Ebola in West Africa.

Just as Bono, Sting and Phil Collins joined the biggest names in pop in a tiny Notting Hill studio for an intensive 24-hour recording session in 1984, tomorrow Roger Taylor, Chris Martin and Elbow join a host of other top musicians in the exact same studio to sing the same song.

Bono will be there flying the flag for the original line-up alongside the likes of One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Adele.

The first Band Aid line-up managed to raise over €10 million and now Bob Geldof and Midge Ure are hoping for similar success in raising cash for the Ebola crisis.

Amazingly, however, this tireless duo is actually facing criticism for #BANDAID30. Believe it or not, words like "patronising", and "tired" have been bandied about this week.

And, 30 years after Peter Blake (famed for the cover of The Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) designed the Band Aid single, this time round Tracy Emin has been drafted in to do the cover, which will be available to download first thing on Monday morning.

Emin is the artist who made headlines a few months ago when her Turner prizenominated work 'My Bed' was auctioned off. As the title suggests, the piece actually is Emin's bed: unkempt complete with stains, rubbish and dirty undies strewn around it, but it fetched millions of euro.

If Tracy Emin can make huge money for recycling old and used things, why can't Geldof and Ure do the same for an extremely worthy cause? Let's face it, you're not buying the single from #BANDAID30 for the song, you're doing it for the cause. Rock on, Bob.

Unicef Ireland's executive director Peter Power said: "This is the most complex emergency to which we have ever had to respond and it has required agility in the provision of products, supply chains and service delivery.

"Over 50 flights and more than 100 shipping containers laden with protective gear and medical equipment have been shipped to countries affected."

Coveney weighs other options

JUST three members of the Defence Forces will be sent by the Government to West Africa to combat the spread of deadly Ebola, it was confirmed yesterday.

Defence Minister Simon Coveney sought Cabinet approval to dispatch some troops to Sierra Leone to help halt the virus.

The three people have "vast collective experience" and will be deployed within days to the Embassy of Ireland in Freetown.

Mr Coveney said: "Irish Defence Forces personnel have a sterling record of service in support of humanitarian crises around the globe.

"Working in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the ECAT initiative, and possibly with the UK Armed Forces, these soldiers will bring a wealth of experience that enhances Ireland's support to the people of Sierra Leone."

The deployment was raised last month by Mr Coveney but was shot down by Health Minister Leo Varadkar and Junior Minister Sean Sherlock.

The two ministers felt it was too dangerous.

Mr Coveney said the three Defence Forces members will not be working "directly on the frontline" but will offer advice and support in emergency planning. He added consideration being given to deploying members of the Permanent Defence Forces as part of the UK treatment unit in Kerrytown, Sierra Leone.

Mr Coveney said: "The request from Irish Aid Agencies to send volunteers to assist their teams in West Africa is being considered."

Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said Ireland was committed to playing its part in fighting the disease.

He said: "With field experience in areas such as emergency planning and response, logistics and risk mitigation, those deployed will add a significant dimension."

The current outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most complexa Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976 with more cases than all others combined.

Ireland has contributed more than €17million to the affected countries, including €4 million for Ebola treatment facilities in Sierra Leone and Liberia, two of the worst affected.

A MAN suspected of carrying the Ebola virus was yesterday given the all-clear.

The patient remains in isolation at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.

He presented with fever and a headache after recently travelling from Sierra Leone to Belfast and was initially diagnosed with malaria.

His brother said: "He's still in the hospital and I've been able to talk to him."

A source added: "He selfreferred and explained why he was concerned about his symptoms. It turned out he had malaria but the test for Ebola had to be done too as a precaution."

A spokesperson for the Public Health Agency said: "We have confirmed that a person who has recently travelled in an area affected by Ebola has been assessed in accordance with national risk assessment protocol.

"As a precautionary measure, he has also been tested for the virus and this test is negative."

In the last fortnight, staff in hospitals across Northern Ireland have been taking part in mock exercises to prepare for an outbreak.

In the Assembly, Ulster Unionist health spokeswoman Jo-Anne Dobson warned fighting the virus must not come at the expense of other services.

She added: "While doing all we can to support possible Ebola patients, we must ensure that if suspected cases become more common, our hospitals should not be forced into a position of cutting key services to pay for them."

Music icons who have sold more than a billion records worldwide

SIR Bob Geldof yesterday announced the line-up for a new version of Do They Know It's Christmas? which is being released to help fight Ebola.

The Band Aid song, which first came out 30 years ago, will get a 2014 makeover with One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Ellie Goulding among the artists recruited.

They will descend on a London studio on Saturday to record the single, which will be available on download Monday.

And blunt-talking Sir Bob, 63, who aims to raise millions to fight Ebola, said: "It doesn't matter if you don't like this song, it doesn't matter if you hate the artists. What you have to do is buy this thing."

He has asked David Bowie, 67, to introduce the video and Tracey Emin, 51, will help design the record sleeve. Other artists he has signed include Bono, Bastille, Chris Martin, Elbow, Emeli Sande, Jessie Ware, Paloma Faith and Sam Smith.

Quincy Jones, 81, will reconvene the US artists, while there will also be remixes by Disclosure and Underworld. Sir Bob praised One Direction. He said: "One Direction have one day off and they are coming in to do this - that's cool."

The original 1984 song, with Bono, Boy George, George Michael, Sting and Simon le Bon, raised £8million for faminestricken Ethiopia.

A second version came out in 1989 and Sam Smith a third in 2004. Sir Bob decided to release a fourth version after he was approached by the United Nations, who told him they needed a 20% increase "across the board" in the effort to fight Ebola.

Sir Bob said: "This is not about nostalgia. I don't like doing this stuff, it's quite boring doing it and organising it, it's quite embarrassing calling people you don't know and other artists."

But he said the bravery of volunteer health workers persuaded him to agree. He said they "needed to be supported across the board, not just the people suffering from this filthy little virus".

Speaking alongside Midge Ure, 61, who co-wrote the track, Sir Bob blasted China for giving "f*** all" to help eradicate Ebola in West Africa.

But he was impressed with the stars' response to his plea for help.

He said: "We set about calling round to see if there was an appetite of this generation to do something. It turned out there was, much to our surprise."

COME on, BBC, admit on Armistice Day you made a mistake and add Joss Stone's Royal British Legion poppy appeal song to your radio playlists.

We're delighted other charity tracks, including Children in Need's God Only Knows and another version of Do They Know It's Christmas to raise funds to fight deadly Ebola, will be heard.

But war veterans should not be abandoned in No Man's Land in this year of all years by an easily reversible BBC decision to keep the Royal British Legion single off the airwaves.

How brilliant to hear Sir Bob Geldof is in talks to remake Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas to raise money for the Ebola crisis in Africa and coincide with the 30th anniversary of the single. We all know the original Band Aid song from 1984 and the remake from 2004. With One Direction confirmed as the first stars to be involved, I can't wait to see who else gets on board. I foresee a Christmas No1 again for Bob. M Gosney, Billingham, Teesside

A SPANISH nurse who survived Ebola is demanding £120,000 compensation after her beloved pet dog was put down for fear it would transmit the killer disease.

Lawyers for Teresa Romero say the decision by Madrid health chiefs to destroy Excalibur as she battled the virus was "taken against medical advice".

Teresa, 44, who contracted Ebola treating a patient in Spain, said the pet was like a child to her and husband Javier. She added: "Our dog was not given a chance."

IT hasn't been a great week for highly intelligent and thoughtful politicians.

Barack Obama got a bloody nose in the US mid-term elections as the Republican Party, having managed to contain its lunatic fringe, benefited enormously from hundreds of millions of dollars of support.

History, I'm convinced, will rate Obama very highly, partly for things he has done - but maybe more so for the things his hasn't.

He has restored the morale of America's diplomatic service which had been sidelined in the Bush years by the "Shock-and-Awe" brigade.

Rather than fecklessly flexing his nation's overwhelming military power by launching totally counter-productive neo-imperial wars, he has largely extracted the US from the bottomless pits of foreign engagements.

And he did so without the humiliation of the frantic retreat from Vietnam a generation earlier.

Of course, that long patient exercise has tended to make him look indecisive compared to those who recklessly bombed other countries.

He has been vilified for his reluctance to react murderously to various provocations, knowing that it simply doesn't work, apart altogether from any moral consideration.

But corporate America and its media mouthpieces don't do reluctance and Mr Obama gets a hard time from those who want to see "action".

Closer to home, Ed Miliband - another thoughtful and committed leader - has been getting a media pasting.

True, he doesn't have Obama's charisma or record but I can't escape the feeling that this is a man you can trust.

Goodness knows we don't need another politician who knows how to ride the polls rather than help lead us towards a more equal and compassionate society. Miliband, bookish and ill-suited to media stunts, doesn't tick all the boxes required by our celebrity-intoxicated culture - which makes it all the more amazing that he has made it at such a young age to being Her Majesty's Leader of the Opposition.

His critics - most of whom, it seems to me, lack his intelligence - don't doubt his ability or commitment.

They focus on his media-worthiness, as if that were a vital quality in running the country.

So I observe the "Let's do Miliband" with a cold eye. As an oldfashioned democrat, I despise the idea that the US Congress should be decided by corporate America or that the Prime Minister should be chosen by Rupert Murdoch and his like, however indirectly.

So I sympathise when I see decent politicians having a rough week.

Mind you, I haven't had the easiest seven days myself but threaded through them I have enjoyed some beautiful hours.

I have the Ebola outbreak to thank for this. It occurred to me to re-read Albert Camus' The Plague for the first time in nearly 50 years.

What a joy to steep myself again in one of the most lucid minds of the 20th century. I envy those who can read him easily in French.

It felt like a totally new experience. It was so wonderful that I ordered fresh copies of his other works, among them his prophetic 1946 essay, Neither Victims Nor Executioners. Let me quote from his conclusion: "All I ask is that, in the midst of a murderous world, we agree to reflect on murder and to make a choice.

After that, we can distinguish between those who accept the consequences of being murderers or the accomplices of murderers, and those who refuse to do so with all their force and being.

Since this terrible dividing line does actually exist, it will be a gain if it be clearly marked...

I have always held that, if he who bases his hopes on human nature is a fool, he who gives up in the face of circumstances is a coward.

Henceforth, the only honourable course will be to stake everything on a formidable gamble: that words are more powerful than munitions."

Camus' fierce challenge was difficult enough in 1946 - it must seem impossible to a twittering generation which does not have the time or attention span to reflect on murder as he asked, and to make a choice.

Just think for a moment, by paying tax we are complicit in murder even if we are totally opposed to it.

The Not In Our Name protests against Blair involving us in the illegal attack on Iraq did not succeed.

So what are we to do and how are we to inspire passionate youngsters to a different reaction than jihadism or counter-jihadism, both equally murderous? We need not just one but hundreds of Camus-type prophets insisting on calling murder by its proper name and working relentlessly for the triumph of that daily decency with which most would want to live.

Most of Miliband's critics seem to lack his intelligence

OUR nurses are in lockdown caring for a patient who may have contracted Ebola.

The women referred herself to the experts when she started suffering a high temperature following her travels.

She was immediately checked into the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and placed in isolation for tests.

Now our nurses are working their magic, ensuring she feels cared for and safe while looking after her medical needs.

It demonstrates yet again the dedication and strength of our medical staff, some of the worstpaid public workers in the country.

How much money would it take for anyone else to walk into the isolation unit at the RVH and treat this patient? How many of our politicians would step into the unknown? Our nurses deserve the best. They give their best, surely we can give them a good salary.

WOMAN TESTED FOR EBOLA

Patient in RVH after she returns from Africa

WOMAN CALLED DOCTOR WITH EBOLA SYMPTOMS

A PATIENT was being tested for Ebola in Belfast's Royal yesterday after travelling from Sierra Leone last week.

Investigators were trying to establish whether the woman travelled to Northern Ireland through Paris, Brussels or London.

A source said: "She is in isolation and being treated for symptoms which have included a fever, chills and severe headache. I understand she has also been sick."

The woman contacted a doctor when she developed a high temperature three days ago after returning from the African country where she was visiting friends.

The source added: "She started suffering quite a high temperature and chills on Friday and she sensibly sought help from the NHS as soon as she felt unwell.

"She self-referred because she was afraid she might have contracted Ebola while she was in West Africa. But we know she has tested positive for malaria and these symptoms are common to both illnesses.

"Right now she is being treated primarily for malaria and is receiving fluids and medication.

"She is in an isolation unit and has a dedicated team of nurses who are well-versed in isolation cases working with her under strict rules just in case she does have Ebola.

"Our hope of course is she is dealing only with malaria but we must wait and see. In the meantime her medical care will continue to be first class."

Details of the woman's travel itinerary are being studied so other passengers can be traced and warned to be watchful for symptoms if she tests positive.

A positive Ebola result at the Belfast lab would trigger an emergency plan where the patient would be transferred to England from the Royal Victoria Hospital in a specially-adapted isolation plane.

e From there she would be taken to London's Royal Free Hospital where a medical team are already on "amber alert". This would be accelerated to a red alert if she needed to be transferred.

Northern Ireland Health Minister Jim Wells told the Daily Mirror: "This person is being tested in the Royal Victoria Hospital and we are awaiting the results. The staff at the hospital are taking every necessary precaution."

Last night Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency said there was no increased risk to the wider community from the patient.

It confirmed a person who has recently travelled in an area affected by Ebola is being assessed in accordance with the agreed risk assessment.

A spokesman said: "The PHA is liaising with colleagues and has advised there is no increased risk to the wider community.

"Ebola virus disease can be a severe illness in humans. The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is two to 21 days.

"It is important to note the likelihood of contracting Ebola is extremely low unless the person had come into contact with blood or body fluids of a symptomatic person.

"Therefore we would like to stress the risk to the public is low. There is no change to the current situation in Northern Ireland in that the risk to the public here is very low.

"The patient being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital has tested positive for malaria and an Ebola test is being done as a precautionary measure."

A WOMAN being tested for Ebola in a Belfast hospital may have come into contact with airline passengers in London after changing flights, it has emerged.

She developed a high temperature back home in Northern Ireland last Friday after seeing friends in Sierra Leone.

Her flights were being studied last night so fellow passengers could be warned in case she tests positive.

A source said: "She sensibly sought help from the NHS as soon as she felt unwell. She is in isolation and being treated for a fever, chills and severe headache." Health bosses said the exams were a "precautionary measure".

The unnamed woman has tested positive for malaria at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. If doctors find she also has Ebola, it is thought she would be sent to London for treatment.

Nurse Will Pooley, 29, was cured of Ebola in August after becoming the first British sufferer. He contracted the disease while treating victims in Sierra Leone.

EBOLA may be rampant in Sierra Leone as families touch bodies before burial days later, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.

The WHO traced 365 early cases back to loved ones mourning at a funeral.

But the outbreak is slowing in Liberian capital Monrovia as the Red Cross has educated locals and speeded up the time between death and burial from three days to less than 24 hours.

The WHO said: "Monrovia was a capital, it was easier to be organised compared to west Sierra Leone."

NAKED holidaymakers had a shock when 19 migrants sparked an Ebola scare after their boat landed on a nudist beach in the Canaries.

Nudists on Maspalomas beach in Gran Canaria panicked when some migrants were thought to have Ebola symptoms.

Some claimed to be from Sierra Leone and Guinea, two of the countries worst hit by the outbreak.

Red Cross workers set up a cordon on the beach to keep the group away from the holidaymakers.

Health workers wearing protective masks and gloves took the temperatures of the migrants, who were later loaded on to a truck and taken to a holding centre.

Four were taken to hospital on Wednesday with health problems but officials confirmed none was suffering from Ebola.

THE head of the UN mission fighting Ebola in West Africa has said he still does not have enough resources to beat the disease.

Tony Banbury added he needs more help but hoped to achieve 70% bed space for new cases and 70% safe burials by December.

The confirmed death toll from Ebola is now 4,818.
