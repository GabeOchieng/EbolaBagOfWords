22 contacts of Spanish nurse infected with Ebola being monitored, says Madrid hospital

The Spanish nurse who became the first person to contract Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outside West Africa began to feel unwell a week before she was finally admitted into a Madrid hospital and diagnosed with the deadly virus, it has emerged.

The 44-year-old nurse, who was part of the medical team that treated two Spanish missionaries who died of the disease shortly after they were repatriated to Madrid, first complained of feeling ill on September 30.

She reportedly contacted health workers to tell them she was suffering from a low fever and fatigue explaining that she had assisted in the care of the missionaries at the specialist isolation unit of the Carlos III hospital.

But it wasn’t until she presented herself at the emergency department of her local hospital in the early hours of Monday with a high fever that she was finally admitted and given tests to see if she had contracted the virus.

On Monday night, Spain’s Ministry of Health confirmed that the woman, whose name has not been made public, had tested positive to the virus and become the first person to contract Ebola outside of West Africa.

Ebola, which is contracted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has killed more than 3,300 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

The delay in diagnosing the illness in the Spanish nurse has raised serious questions over the ability of Spain’s health service to contain the virus after the controversial repatriation of the two elderly missionaries.

Ana Mato, the Spanish Health Minister urged people to remain calm, insisting that “all possible measures” were in place to guarantee public safety.

The coordinator of emergency health services at the Spanish Ministry of Health conceded that it would have been better to have admitted the nurse into hospital earlier.

He said that although ‎she hadn't presented the symptoms used by clinicians to initially suspect a case of Ebola, her recent history of having been in contact with the stricken missionaries meant it would have been preferable to err on the side of caution.

"‎In this case it would have been better to have admitted her for observation on September 30 rather than wait for the more serious symptoms," said Fernando Simon.

He confirmed that the husband of the nurse has now been put in isolation and is under observation although he has yet to show signs of feeling unwell.

An investigation has been launched in an attempt to determine exactly how the nurse contracted the virus while working within strict guidelines set up at the specialist unit where the repatriated missionaries were treated.

She had access to Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, the missionary who died on September 25, five days after being repatriated from Sierra Leone, on only two occasions, Madrid’s health chief confirmed.

The first was to treat him during his illness and the second was after he died when she entered the room to collect materials for disposal.

The day after his death, the nurse went on holiday to a location that has not been made public by health authorities.

Spain’s health authorities are monitoring 22 people that may have been in close contact with the nurse, including medical colleagues and her husband.

Late Monday night the infected nurse was transferred to the isolation unit at Carlos III where the two missionaries with Ebola were treated. Her condition is described as “stable”.

Staff at the hospital have expressed concern that standards designed to keep the virus in check were not sufficient.

According to a report in El Mundo, the protective suits issued to the medical team treating the missionaries were sub-standard because they were not completely impermeable and did not include separate breathing apparatus.

Ebola outbreak: the five deadliest infectious diseases

The horrifying Ebola outbreak is capturing the world's attention – but other, less dramatic infections kill far more

The world’s attention is focused on Ebola. For the first time since the latest outbreak began, someone has become infected outside of Africa[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11145394/Spanish-nurse-first-to-contract-Ebola-in-Europe-had-virus-for-a-week-before-being-diagnosed.html], raising ( unwarranted[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100281820/the-curse-of-ebola/] ) fears of it spreading globally.

Three and a half thousand deaths, and three countries paralysed by fear of infection, is a big deal, of course. But Ebola, for all its visceral horror and spreading tragedy, is a drop in the ocean when it comes to infectious disease. In total, around 6,000 people have died of Ebola in history; for comparison, at least that many die of malaria every two days, and of respiratory infections every single day. Here are the five biggest killers:

HIV/Aids

In the Eighties and Nineties, there were fears that the HIV virus would become a global pandemic. Those fears never materialised, at least partly because of public health measures to slow the spread; later, cocktails of antiretroviral drugs became available which, in the West at least, have made it a manageable disease rather than a death sentence. But in poorer countries where modern healthcare is less easily available – especially sub-Saharan Africa – the virus is still deadly. Around 2.5 million people are estimated to die of the disease every year, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO)[http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/issues/entry/infectious-diseases], the large majority of them in Africa. That’s more than 700 times as many people as are known to have died in the Ebola outbreak so far.

Malaria

The good news is that there have been enormous strides made against malaria, a mosquito-borne (“vector”) virus. Simple measures, especially the use of insecticide-impregnated nets, have reduced deaths by 20 per cent in the last few decades. Prof Jane Hemingway, director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told me recently[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11081271] that "In a number of countries, we have won the battle already. It used to be in many more countries than it is today. We've pushed it back from the boundaries, we've pushed it back in Latin America; places such as Mexico, for instance, there's very little transmission going on. We've pushed it back from parts of Asia; Sri Lanka is almost malaria-free. Thailand is pretty much malaria-free, but used to have very high transmission." Nonetheless, somewhere between 1.3 million and 3 million still die of the disease annually, and scientists are in a constant battle to find new insecticides as mosquitoes develop resistance to the old ones.

Tuberculosis

In the West we tend to think of tuberculosis, TB, as part of history: we picture Romantic poets with “consumption” coughing blood into embroidered handkerchiefs. But the bacillus is rife in the developing world; the WHO estimates that 2 billion people, nearly a third of the global population, carries the bacterium, and that there are 13.7 million people with the active, infectious disease. Somewhere around 1.7 million people die every year from it.

Diarrhoea

Cholera, and other water-borne diseases, are real killers in parts of the world where clean water is hard to get hold of. The parasites find their way from person to person via “faecal-oral transfer”, which is exactly what it sounds like: when drinking water is infected by sewage. The cycle is very easily broken with modern water treatment, or even basic boiling, but too often that is unavailable and as a result diarrheal diseases kill around 1.8 million people a year.

Respiratory infections

According to the WHO, more than 4 million people die every year of “respiratory infections” - pneumonia, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus. The latter two are endemic in the Western world, but are easily managed with fluids and rest. But in the developing world, as with so many other diseases, they can be killers, especially among children and those weakened by malnutrition or other illnesses.

British-American contracted Ebola 'cleaning infected car'

Ashoka Mukpo, who has arrived in a Nebraska hospital for treatment, is believed to have caught the disease while cleaning the vehicle a victim had died in

The British cameraman who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia is thought to have become infected when he was splashed as he spray-cleaned a vehicle in which a victim had died, his father has said.

Ashoka Mukpo, 33, arrived by private plane for treatment at the Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha, the largest bio-containment hospital in the United States, where he was said to be suffering nausea and fever but had not yet reached the critical stage of the disease.

In a press conference, his British mother Diana Mukpo, an aristocrat who went to school with the Princess Royal and now runs a dressage centre in the US, and American father, Mitchell Levy, himself a leading doctor, told of their relief that their “strong-willed” son was receiving treatment.

Dr Levy said he had told Mr Mukpo he was “crazy” to go to Liberia.

A graduate of the London School of Economics, Mr Mukpo had been working for a NGO for two years in the West African nation before returning home to the US state of Rhode Island in May.

He went back last month, against his parents’ wishes, in order to volunteer at an Ebola clinic, only to succumb to the disease himself last week.

Shortly before he developed symptoms, but probably after he had been infected, he began working on a freelance basis as a cameraman for the American television network NBC.

Asked how he contracted the disease, Dr Levy said: “He is not certain but he was around the clinic, he was inside the clinic, so there were a lot of opportunities. He was splashed. He was disinfecting a car in which someone had died.”

Asked what their reaction had been when their son told them he was planning on returning to the Liberia, Dr Levy said: “Our son is very strong-willed and determined and has always lived by his integrity.

“He made a strong connection for the two years that he lived there and he felt compelled to go back.

“When he told me, I asked if he was crazy. He felt that he understood the risks and he was putting himself in harm’s way but that is how he wanted to live his life.

“I told him I thought he was crazy. I’m proud of him and at the same time I wish he would go somewhere safer, as a parent.”

Mrs Mukapo added: “I begged him from a mother’s perspective. I said: ‘Please don’t go,’ but he was determined.”

Mr Mukpo’s parents and British fiancé, Helen, arrived in Nebraska on Sunday and although he is in quarantine they are able to communicate with him via a video-link.

He spoke to them for a short while after his arrival but then said he was tired and asked to rest.

Asked how Mr Mukapo was feeling, his mother said: “He’s enormously relieved to be here. He’s still quite frightened but he is hanging in and he shares in the relief of his family that he is able to come back for good medical care here.”

Dr Levy added that his son regretted putting his family through such a worrying time. “His first reaction was ‘I’m sorry I put myself in this situation for you guys’.

“Of course he’s probably of two minds – he has some regrets but of course he is proud of what he has done.

The Nebraska Medical Centre also successfully treated American Dr Rick Sacra. He returned to hospital last week suffering a respiratory difficulties but tests determined he had not suffered a relapse of Ebola.

Meanwhile the US airline group Airlines for America has met with health and safety officials to discuss introducing additional screening to identify travellers who may have Ebola.

The talks follow the discovery that Liberian Thomas Duncan had evaded checks and was able to travel to Dallas before falling ill. He is being treated in hospital where he is said to be in a critical condition.

Ashoka Mukpo's British mother Diana says family is proud of him for trying to help Liberians

Update: Parents of US cameraman said they warned him of Ebola

A British-American television cameraman has contracted Ebola in Liberia and is being evacuated.

Ashoka Mukpo, 33, who has dual nationality, was diagnosed with the virus while working as a freelance for the US network NBC News.

His British mother Diana Mukpo, who was at school with the Princess Royal and now runs a dressage centre in the US, has been speaking to her son several times a day by phone and said he would be flown to the US on Sunday. His fiancée is flying from London to America.

Diana Mukpo, 61, told the Telegraph: “Ashoka is doing quite well. He has a fever and sore throat, the early symptoms. He hasn’t progressed to the other symptoms.

“Obviously, he is scared. He is very frightened but he is very relieved he’s being evacuated. His mood is much better.”

Mukpo graduated from Columbia University in New York, and the London School of Economics, in international conflict resolution.

He had done human rights work in Liberia for two years and returned recently as a cameraman and writer.

His mother said: “We were extremely worried but he felt a real connection to the Liberian people.

“In spite of what’s happened as a family, we are extremely proud of Ashoka and his care for humanity. He did know the risks but he did this because he cares for the people of Liberia.”

She said her son did not know how he contracted the virus.

“He took all the necessary precautions and he was very aware of the precautions to take,” she said. “He helped decontaminate a car and he was wearing protective [gear] but he thinks maybe some water splashed on him.”

Mukpo is currently being treated at a Médecins Sans Frontières centre in Monrovia. “We are speaking to him several times a day and he is getting the best care they can give,” his mother said.

She praised the US state department for their “compassion” in flying her son back to the US, adding: “I cannot say how much I appreciate how wonderful the government has been.”

Mukpo is the second Briton to be infected during the Ebola outbreak which has killed more than 3,400 people in west Africa.

William Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and was flown back to Britain. He was treated in a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London and was discharged last month.

Mukpo’s mother is a former pupil of Benenden School, the boarding school for girls in Kent, where she was three years behind the Princess Royal.

She was born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy barrister. At the age of 16 she married Chögyam Trungpa, who was 28 and went on to become a high-profile guru and controversial figure in Tibetan Buddhism in America.

The marriage, which took place in Scotland, was front page news in some British newspapers and she later became known as Lady Diana Judith Mukpo.

In the 1970s Diana Mokpu moved with Trungpa to Boulder, Colorado and set up a Buddhist centre where Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs studied, and where Trungpa would advocate the benefits of tantric sex. As a small child Ashoka was identified as a "tulku," the reincarnation of a leading Tibetan lama.

Ashoka’s father is Dr Mitchell Levy, the medical director of the intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital. He told CNN it was unclear how his son got the virus, but added: "He was helping inside clinics disinfecting, whether it was a chair or some vehicle that had potentially been exposed, he remembers getting some of it in his face."

The cameraman had been hired on Tuesday to work with the NBC News chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman. In a statement NBC said: “As part of a routine temperature check he discovered he was running a slight fever. He immediately quarantined himself and sought medical advice.”

He went to the Médecins Sans Frontières treatment centre and a positive result for Ebola came back 12 hours later. Dr Snydeman told NBC that she, Mukpo and the rest of their crew were checked at a border crossing and showed no elevated temperature on Wednesday.

She said: “As the day went on he was starting to feel tired and a little achy.

“In the field, we work long hours so thought maybe he just wasn’t taking care of himself.

“We sent him home to rest. He signed off, went home and called me later that evening with an elevated temperature.” The rest of the crew, including Dr Snyderman, are also being flown back to the US by NBC and will be quarantined for 21 days.

Ashoka Mokpu is due to arrive back in the US on Monday and will be treated at the Nebraska Medical Center, one of four bio-containment units in the US.

In an internet post on Sept 18 Mokpu wrote: "Man oh man I have seen some bad things in the last two weeks of my life. How unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be. How in some parts of the world basic levels of help and assistance that we take for granted completely don't exist for many people."

Meanwhile, in Washington DC a patient with potential symptoms of Ebola, who has recently been to Nigeria, was admitted Howard University Hospital and was said to be in a stable condition. A hospital spokesman said: “We have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient.”

In Dallas, Thomas Michael Duncan, 42, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on US soil, remained in a serious but stable condition in an isolation unit. He arrived in the country from Liberia on Sept 20.

At the apartment where he was living in Dallas, his girlfriend Louise Troh, 36, her 13-year-old son and two grown-up nephews, were placed under armed guard to prevent them going outside.

Five days after Mr Duncan was diagnosed, the bed sheets and towels on which he lay and which experts said could pose a danger remained in the apartment.

A hazardous materials crew was due to collect them on Friday.

An American freelance cameraman working for NBC News has been diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia and is being flow to the US for treatment

An American freelance television cameraman has contracted Ebola in Liberia, becoming the fourth US national to be diagnosed with the deadly disease.

Ashoka Mukpo, 33, was working for NBC News and is being flown back to the US for treatment.

He had been hired on Tuesday to work with NBC News chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman covering the outbreak which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.

A statement on the news network's website said; "The freelancer came down with symptoms on Wednesday, feeling tired and achy. As part of a routine temperature check he discovered he was running a slight fever. He immediately quarantined himself and sought medical advice."

He went to a Medecins Sans Frontieres treatment centre on Thursday and a positive result for Ebola came back 12 hours later.

Mr Mukpo, who has been working in Liberia for three years, is the fourth American to contract Ebola in Liberia during the current outbreak. The others were Christian missionaries.

NBC News President Deborah Turness said: "We are doing everything we can to get him the best care possible. He will be flown back to the United States for treatment at a medical centre that is equipped to handle Ebola patients. We are also taking all possible measures to protect our employees and the general public.

"The rest of the crew, including Dr Nancy, are being closely monitored and show no symptoms or warning signs.

"However, in an abundance of caution, we will fly them back on a private charter flight and then they will place themselves under quarantine in the United States for 21 days."

"We want to be respectful to our colleagues and the US public," Dr Snyderman said. "Because we know this is not a casually transmitted disease and because we don't have any symptoms, we present zero to minimal risk. Our returning to the US is a very, very minimal chance of getting anyone [else] sick."

Cameraman with Ebola to land in US as patient in Texas takes turn for the worse

A BRITISH–AMERICAN cameraman who contracted Ebola in Liberia will arrive in the United States for treatment today.

Ashoka Mukpo's British fiancée has flown from London to await his arrival at the Nebraska Medical Centre's biocontainment unit, along with his British mother, Diana Mukpo, and his American father, Dr Mitchell Levy. Mr Mukpo, 33, who has dual citizenship, was working for NBC News. He is the second British person to contract Ebola during the current outbreak in west Africa, which has so far claimed more than 3,400 lives.

William Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and was successfully treated at the Royal Free Hospital in north London last month.

Describing how he learnt of his son's illness in a text message, Dr Levy said: "My heart sunk. He said: 'Dad pick up your phone. Answer the phone. I think I'm in trouble'."

Dr Levy told the Providence Journal his son's fiancée, Helen, "feels for Ashoka. They love each other very deeply". He added: "They don't have a glass panel [in the biocontainment unit] so they set up cameras in the room. He'll know we're there. He'll see us on a monitor."

In Dallas, Texas, the first person diagnosed with Ebola on US soil was "fighting for his life" after his condition deteriorated.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who fell sick with the virus after arriving from Liberia, was in a "critical" condition at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

Dr Tom Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), said: "We understand his situation has taken a turn for the worse." Ten people in Dallas are considered at "higher risk" of catching Ebola after coming into contact with Mr Duncan, but none of them have shown symptoms.

The CDC has been scrambling to check more than 100 possible reported cases across the US since July, all of which have been false alarms.

Dr Rick Sacra, an American doctor who was successfully treated at the Nebraska Medical Centre last month after contracting Ebola in Liberia, was readmitted to hospital with a cough and conjunctivitis. Health officials said they did not suspect it was a recurrence of the virus.

Scientists studying how Ebola spreads calculated there is a 50 per cent chance it could be transported from West Africa to Britain by Oct 24.

Taking an expected reduction in passenger air travel to infected areas into account, that figure drops to 15 per cent.

Dr Richard Sacra re-admitted with a cough and conjunctivitis, although doctors do not suspect reoccurence of virus

A US doctor and missionary who was successfully treated for Ebola he contracted in Africa is back in the hospital with what appears to be a respiratory infection, but doctors do not suspect a recurrence of the virus.

UMass Memorial Medical Center said in a statement that Dr. Richard Sacra was hospitalised Saturday and is in stable condition. He has a cough and conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, hospital officials said.

Sacra will remain in isolation until doctors have confirmation from tests by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he is not infected with the virus, the hospital said. Doctors expect to know with certainty by late Monday.

"We are isolating Dr. Sacra to be cautious pending final confirmation of his illness," said Dr. Robert Finberg, who is heading Sacra's medical team. "We think it is highly unlikely that he has Ebola. We suspect he has an upper respiratory tract infection."

Sacra, of Holden, returned to Massachusetts on Sept. 25 after weeks of treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital.

He spent much of the last two decades in Liberia, working with a missionary group. He also works at Family Health Center of Worcester.

Bruce Johnson, president of the SIM USA missionary group, said in a news release that Sacra first visited a Boston-area hospital emergency room Saturday morning because of a persistent cough and low-grade fever and concern that he might be developing pneumonia. Johnson said Sacra was transferred to UMass Memorial for observation as a precaution under CDC guidelines.

Johnson said Dr. Phil Smith of The Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where Sacra was treated, told SIM that Sacra's recent viral illness lowered his immune system but his current symptoms aren't those of someone suffering from Ebola.

"Dr. Sacra did the right thing by going to the hospital," Smith said in a statement released by SIM. "He's been through a lot over the last month, and he wanted to be sure his respiratory illness didn't worsen. Being a doctor himself, he knows the importance of preventative care."

Thomas Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with the deadly disease on US soil, is now in a critical condition after returning from Lliberia

The first person to be diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus on United States soil is now in a critical condition, health officials said Saturday, having previously described him as seriously ill.

"Mr. Duncan is in critical condition," the Texas hospital treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who traveled from Liberia to Texas in late September, said in a brief statement.

The update came as US authorities said none of the individuals believed to have had exposure to Duncan, including nine deemed to be at high risk, had shown any signs of Ebola infection.

"We are confident that none of those with definite contact had any symptoms related to Ebola, none of them had fever," said Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The nine people deemed at high risk would be monitored closely, Frieden said.

"We will be looking very closely particularly at the nine individuals in the coming days, understanding that the peak period after exposure is about eight to nine days but can be as long as 21 days," he said.

Duncan was initially sent home when he first sought medical care, leaving a four-day span when he was sick and contagious while in contact with others, sparking concern over how many others may have been exposed.

Decontamination team moves into apartment used by Thomas Eric Duncan, the first case diagnosed in US, as White House officials try to quell panic

Nurses in America say they are unprepared to deal with Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] patients arriving from abroad as a growing sense of panic sweeps the US.

The warning comes after it emerged Thomas Eric Duncan, the country's first case, had told health workers he had recently been in Liberia yet was still sent home from a hospital in Texas with nothing more than painkillers and antibiotics.

However, health officials insist that American hospitals are ready for such patients and on Friday White House advisers tried to reassure the nation that an outbreak was extremely unlikely.

Lisa Monaco, Barack Obama's senior counter-terrorism adviser, said: "The United States is prepared to deal with this crisis, both at home and in the region.

"Every Ebola outbreak in the past 40 years has been stopped. We know how to do this and we will do it again."

Nurses across the country have been approaching hospital managers asking for training and advice on how best to protect themselves and their families from an outbreak that has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.

"The Texas case is a perfect example," Micker Samios, a triage nurse in the emergency department at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, the largest hospital in the nation's capital, told Reuters.

"In addition to not being prepared, there was a flaw in diagnostics as well as communication."

The issue of proper training has even been raised as part of contract negotiations.

A survey by the National Nurses United union across 31 states found 80 per cent of respondents said their hospital had no Ebola admissions policy and 30 per cent said they lacked proper protective equipment.

Meanwhile, a decontamination team crew moved into the apartment that had been used by Mr Duncan - America's first case -[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11137679/Fear-at-Americas-Ebola-ground-zero.html] before he was hospitalised.

Local officials had struggled to find a hotel or apartment for the family living there but was finally able to move them out when a volunteer offered a private residence.

"No one wants this family," said Sana Syed, a Dallas city spokeswoman.

The delay had been criticised for leaving four people detained in an apartment with towels and sheets used by the infected man.

Health officials are continuing to monitor 50 people with whom he had contact after arriving from Liberia.

Elsewhere, a French nurse who contracted the disease while working for Medicine Sans Frontieres in Liberia was able to leave hospital on Saturday after being treated for the disease.

And in the German city of Hamburg, officials said that an employee of the World Health Organisation who was being treated for Ebola in hospital had been released.

Fear at America's Ebola 'ground zero'

Ebola makes its first appearance in America in the Dallas suburb of Vickery Meadow

'Ground zero' for Ebola in America is a small first floor flat in a drab looking complex in the northern Dallas suburb of Vickery Meadow.

Behind the door of number 614 at the Ivy Apartments is where Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, recently arrived from Liberia, shivered and sweated through the night as Ebola took hold of him.

Days after he was diagnosed his girlfriend Louise Troh, 36, her 13-year-old son, and two of her grown-up nephews, are still there.

They are subject to a "control order" meaning if they stray too far from their door over the next three weeks they will face criminal prosecution.

Miss Troh, who is Liberian and works as a home care help, is taking everyone's temperatures, including her own, every hour to see if the feverish symptoms of Ebola emerge.

The sheets that Duncan slept in, and sweated on, are still on the bed. She has placed the towels she used to mop his sweat in a plastic bag, and has a tub of bleach to disinfect the apartment as best she can.

"I don't know what to do," she said in a phone call with CNN anchorman Anderson Cooper as she revealed her efforts to avoid the disease. Miss Troh declined to speak to other journalists who called.

Stanley Gaye, president of the Dallas Liberian Community Association, who has spoken to her, said: "They are doing well. All she asks is for prayers."

Duncan was diagnosed on Sunday but it took until Thursday afternoon for a delivery of food to arrive at the apartment. It was brought by the American Red Cross and the South Texas Food Bank.

The Red Cross worker who carried the boxes to the door told the Telegraph: "I just put them on the steps where I was told to. I didn't knock. It was changes of clothes, Gatorade, bananas, water."

Minutes later a man, believed to be one of Miss Troh's nephews, emerged and carried all the boxes inside without saying a word.

It also took until Thursday for contractors, four days after Duncan was diagnosed, for workers to be deployed with water jets and bleach to disinfect the car bark beneath Miss Troh's balcony.

It was here that Duncan was seen by neighbours vomiting on the ground as he was placed in an ambulance.

There was no cordon around the area and children returning from school passed close by. Outside an apartment beneath Miss Troh's a woman was busy brushing her doorstep. Next door, a young child in a football shirt peered out. One resident emerged from his apartment and headed for his car, saying: "I'm leaving. Haven't you heard what's happened?"

Some residents of the Ivy Apartments were still oblivious to the Ebola case in their midst.

The complex is one of dozens in Vickery Meadow that are home to immigrants from countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Eritrea and Nepal. There are en estimated 33 languages spoken in the area but many residents do not speak English.

The area of apartment blocks was once described by the Dallas Observer as an "anthill". It has also been called "Dallas's "Ellis Island".

One Eritrean resident said: "It's not a good area here. There are drugs. I am working triple shifts so I can get out."

Some asked why no-one in authority had been to speak to them about Ebola.

Miss Troh's apartment is just a few hundred yards from Sam Tasby Middle School where one of five children who had contact with Duncan attended.

Pupils at the school said they were talking about little else, and some parents pulled their children out.

"This is crazy scary," said one mother on a school Facebook page. Another asked: "Do any of these five children ride a school bus? Have they disinfected any buses these children may have ridden?

The Riddle of St Ives

by Ed Miliband

As I was going to St Ives

I met a man with seven wives.

I said: “Sir, may I chat to each?

I’ve got to write a conference speech.

I do love ordinary people’s stories!”

They ran away – must’ve been Tories.

To a Mouse

by Alex Salmond

Wee, sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie,

O, what a panic’s in thy breastie!

Thou need na start awa sae hasty,

Wi’ bickering brattle!

I wad be laith to rin an’ chase thee,

Wi’ murd’ring pattle!

Ah ken fine well the villains tae blame:

The Westminster bullies! They’re aw the same!

It’s they who’ve wrecked your nest! For shame!

It’s clear tae me

We must expose their ringleader’s name:

Nick Robinson, o’ the BBC!

There Was an Old Woman

by George Osborne

There was an old woman who lived in a shoe

She had so many children, she didn’t know what to do.

She gave them some broth without any bread

And whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.

I know what you’re thinking: “But that’s so unfair!

Single mums don’t deserve so much broth! Greedy mare!

And as for that shoe – I bet it’s Louboutin!

That’s taxpayers’ money! These scroungers want shootin’!”

Don’t worry, dear voters – I’ve heard what you’ve said.

We’ll force them to live in a sandal instead.

Jabberwocky

by David Cameron

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

The frumious Bandersnatch!”

He took his vorpal sword in hand;

Long time the manxome foe he sought—

So rested he by the Tumtum tree

And stood awhile in thought.

But then, alas! A nasty shock!

He dropped his vorpal knife.

For Strasbourg said the Jabberwock

Had the right to a family life.

Ozymandias

by Nigel Farage

I met a traveller from an antique land,

Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read—”

I stopped him. “Not so fast there, mate,” I said.

“Traveller? From an antique land? What tripe.

You’re a blatant illegal.

I know your type.

I bet you’ve got Ebola, or something scarier.

I’m sticking you on the first bus back to Bulgaria.

We’re surging in the polls, Westminster beware –

Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!”

Nanny knows best how to plot a revolution

Emma Thompson is calling for a revolution. Capitalist society is rotten, she says, and must be overthrown. “I’m afraid I have just got to the stage where I can’t stand it any more, what is being done in this world,” barked the Nanny McPhee star in a newspaper interview. And what was the source of the world’s woes? “All of our financial institutions, government and power structures!” she snapped.

“The structures don’t make it possible for you to change things. Look at Obama. People have all sorts of ideas about how to change things and then they get into a power structure and are hobbled.”

Elsewhere in the article, the interviewer asked where she sends her daughter, Gaia, to school. The answer: a private establishment in North London. No doubt cynics will suggest that Ms Thompson doesn’t mind the old power structures quite so much when they benefit her own children. But I prefer to think it is all part of a revolutionary masterplan. She has instructed her daughter to bring down society… from the inside. And the only way to achieve this is to give her as many material advantages as possible, to ease her path to the top.

It is a brilliant plan. The capitalists will never suspect a thing.

Rise and rise of the bonkers brigade

The Metropolitan Police have been investigating online abuse of Kate and Gerry McCann. Ever since their daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007, the couple have been the subject of repulsive conspiracy theories by the most extraordinary horde of seething oddities.

Well, I say extraordinary. In a sense it isn’t extraordinary at all. Because if the internet era has taught us anything, it’s that a remarkable number of people out there are completely bonkers. Before the internet, we had no idea how widespread this complete bonkersness was, because the completely bonkers had no outlet, beyond writing colourfully inked letters which newspaper editors could file quietly in the bin.

But these days, thanks to social media and online messageboards, the completely bonkers are empowered to inflict their completely bonkers views on a worldwide audience.

If I too were completely bonkers, I might be tempted to suspect that the internet is itself an establishment conspiracy, created to undermine the faith of sane and intelligent people in freedom of speech. In time, when that faith has been sufficiently undermined, the establishment will feel able to prohibit freedom of speech, confident that sane and intelligent people will have no objection.

Fortunately, I’m not completely bonkers. But if I read any more conspiracy theories about the McCanns, I might turn out that way.

Who’s the slyest of them all?

The journalist Rob Hutton has just published Would They Lie to You?, a satirical guide to spin. Here’s his tip for answering questions after a speech. “On the off-chance a member of the public has a tricky point, begin by saying you’ll take questions in groups of three, 'to get more in’. By the time you’ve answered the straightforward ones, no one will be able to remember exactly what the hard question was, so pick an easy question in the same area, and answer that.” Hutton doesn’t name the politician who always uses this devious technique, but I can: Ed Miliband. People mock the Labour leader’s appearance, but it can be an advantage. He looks so gawky, boyish and harmless, people don’t realise how sly he is.

Texas family that lived in an apartment where Liberian man Thomas Duncan fell ill with Ebola has been moved to a different home

A hazardous-materials crew on Friday decontaminated the Texas apartment where an Ebola patient was staying when he got sick, while public-health officials cut by half the number of people being monitored for any symptoms of the deadly disease.

Hours later, the family that was living in the apartment was moved to a private residence in a gated community that was offered by a volunteer.

The decontamination team was to collect bed sheets, towels and a mattress used by the infected man before he was hospitalized, as well as a suitcase and other personal items belonging to Thomas Eric Duncan, officials said.

The materials were sealed in industrial barrels that were to be stored until they can be hauled away for permanent disposal, probably by incineration at a landfill.

The first Ebola diagnosis in the U.S. has raised concerns about whether the disease that has killed 3,400 people in West Africa could spread in the U.S. Federal health officials say they are confident they can keep it in check.

Elsewhere, NBC News reported that an American freelance cameraman working for the network in Liberia has tested positive for the virus and will be flown back to the United States, along with the rest of the news crew.

Neighbors stood on their balconies and watched the family's grim departure from behind a black tarp hung to shield their front door from view.

The family was placed in a Dallas County deputy's patrol car and driven away, apparently leaving with nothing more than the clothes they wore.

The residence where they will stay had been offered only a short time earlier. Until then, a search for shelter had come up short. The city had been refused by hotels, apartments and other providers.

"No one wants this family," said Sana Syed, a Dallas city spokeswoman.

The family was confined to their home under armed guard while public-health officials monitor them - part of an intense effort to contain the deadly disease before it can get a foothold in the United States.

Louise Troh, originally from Liberia, shares the apartment with her 13-year-old son and two nephews.

When the decontamination is complete, even the crew's protective suits are to be burned, said Tamara Smith, office manager for the Cleaning Guys of Fort Worth.

Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County's top administrative official, said he went to the apartment with two epidemiologists to apologize for the delay in removing the soiled items, which happened five days after Duncan was admitted to the hospital.

"I want to see this family treated the way I would want to see my own family treated," Jenkins said.

The confinement order, which also bans visitors, was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request to stay home.

Also Friday, Texas health officials said they had narrowed the number of people they were monitoring from as many as 100 to about 50 who had some type of exposure to Duncan.

Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said all 50 are meeting with health workers and having their temperatures taken daily. So far, none shows symptoms of the virus. Ten are considered to be at higher risk and are being monitored more closely.

The virus that causes Ebola is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids - blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen - of an infected person who is showing symptoms.

Troh's 35-year-old daughter lives a few blocks away in a small apartment with her partner and four children. The two families often visited each other's homes.

Health officials have told Youngor Jallah to keep her family at home. But unlike at her mother's apartment, there are no armed guards preventing them from leaving.

She's now wracked with regret that she did not take greater precautions in her dealings with Duncan.

"I'm just doubting myself every minute," she said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press. "I'm trying to take my mind off it, but I can't do it."

She is not kissing or hugging her children, ages 2, 4 and 6, or her partner's 11-year-old son, or sharing dishes with them.

Duncan arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 and fell ill a few days later. After an initial visit to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, he was sent home, even though he told a nurse he had been in disease-ravaged West Africa.

He returned to the hospital two days later, on Sunday, and has been kept in isolation ever since. He's listed in serious but stable condition.

It is the stuff that nightmares are made of, and day by day it is getting worse. The Ebola epidemic, says Dr Margaret Chan, director–general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), is now "the greatest peacetime challenge" since the Second World War. Yet her own organisation's tardiness, partly caused by cuts, together with reductions in – and misuse of – funds elsewhere, are largely responsible for Ebola spiralling out of control.

Officially 7,178 people have caught the horrific disease in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal: 3,338 have died. The toll is greater than the combined total of 25 previous outbreaks of the haemorrhagic fever in the 38 years since its discovery near Congo's Ebola river. And that is certainly a gross underestimate – many more are sickening and dying unknown in remote villages.

It's just the beginning. At present the numbers of people infected are thought to be doubling in under 30 days – and the blue–chip US Center for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that, if Ebola goes on accelerating, 1.4 million West Africans could have contracted the disease by the new year.

Whole nations are close to collapse. Sierra Leone's economy is reported to have deflated by 30 per cent. Schools in affected countries are closed. Harvests rot in the fields. Hospitals are so overwhelmed that they are not merely turning away Ebola cases, but also people stricken with other deadly diseases such as malaria. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, has warned of impending economic disaster.

The one saving grace is that the infectious disease spreads with difficulty, through bodily fluids, which means it can be contained with strong enough measures even in Africa. This is why Western health systems are confident that they can prevent an epidemic at home. But this week Anthony Banbury, chief of the UN's Ebola mission, raised the possibility that the virus could mutate to spread by air, like flu.

So why was this epidemic not contained long ago, like previous ones? It didn't help that it hit countries with few medics: Liberia was left with only 30 doctors when its civil war ended in 2003, compared with 2,000 beforehand. It is also down to the poorly resourced countries to report outbreaks; this one was not identified until March, three months after the first victim is thought to have caught Ebola from a fruit bat. But previous, controlled episodes of the plague also occurred in poor African countries.

This time, however, the world was slow to react. Kent Brantly – the American doctor who survived the virus – says that pleas for international help "appeared to fall on deaf ears". The charity Médecins sans Frontierès (MSF) – on the ground from early on in the outbreak – recalls "screaming" at the WHO "to gear up and scale up", without success. The organisation finally declared an emergency in August; senior officials admit it was far too slow.

That may have reflected budget cuts. When the financial crisis struck, WHO – funded by world governments – had to cut nearly $1 billion from its planned two–year budget. Staff charged with responding to disease outbreaks were slashed by 35 per cent; funds for it by half. Emergency experts used to fighting Ebola in Africa were reduced from more than a dozen to three. Only one remained at headquarters to oversee all haemorrhagic diseases.

This week, the Commons International Development Committee condemned the Government for cutting aid to Liberia and Sierra Leone, saying this may have helped compromise their health systems. Channelling money through the EU was even worse, it found. Brussels had given $60 million for health in Liberia over the past two years, but the country's treasury had hung onto almost all of it, spending only $3.9 million on its real purpose. Britain seemed little concerned.

In all, the crisis has revealed huge deficiencies in how the world responds to epidemics. On Thursday governments met in London to work out how to improve their response radically; Britain has already promised an extra £125 million. But Médecins sans Frontierès say that while "everyone in their intentions is moving fast", progress in the field is "at the speed of a tortoise". It is increasingly agreed that the window for effective action is closing fast.

Even if we do enough, fast enough, to contain the outbreak, this is most unlikely to be the last plague to threaten the world, and the next may be more infectious and spread more widely and rapidly. It is time to accept that global threats can only be tackled globally and that – as someone said – we are all in it together.

US scrambles to increase production of experimental Ebola drug

Federal officials and charities are in talks with pharmaceutical companies to produce ZMapp serum, but scientists warn demand will far outstrip supply as epidemic spreads

The US government is scrambling to start production of the experimental Ebola drug that is viewed as the most promising medical treatment in the fight against the virus.

The ZMapp serum was used to treat two American missionaries who recovered from Ebola, but is not available for the Dallas man currently fighting the disease [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11137340/US-Ebola-patient-had-helped-victim-in-Liberia.html] as the limited supplies made for clinical trials ran out in August.

Federal officials and two of the world’s largest charities are in advanced talks with pharmaceutical companies to launch accelerated production from genetically-engineered tobacco plants and animal cells.

But even as officials struggle to play catch-up with the epidemic, it has also emerged that ZMapp's development was held up for years by funding delays from a Pentagon programme aimed at countering biological threats.

And scientists acknowledge that despite the new efforts, they may not be able to produce more than a few hundred treatment courses by early next spring. That will be far behind the international demand and will confront officials with life-and-death challenges of rationing and priorities.

“The biology just doesn’t allow you to do it tomorrow,” Alan Magill, a programme director at the Gates Foundation which is helping to organise ZMapp development, told The New York Times [https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F10%2F02%2Fworld%2Fus-to-increase-production-of-experimental-drug-but-may-not-meet-demand.html%3F_r%3D0] .

Three vaccines and up to 10 medications are in various stages of development, according to health officials, with ZMapp the most promising so far.

In tests, the serum was able to protect infected monkeys from Ebola, but its effectiveness for humans has still not been established. It has been taken by seven people, of whom two died.

The two American missionary aid workers who contracted the virus in West Africa recovered after being treated with the serum, but they were also the beneficiaries of excellent health care after being flown back to the US.

A cocktail of three different antibodies, ZMapp is being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, a small San Diego company, with funding from the United States and Canadian governments.

The doses with which the US aid workers were treated were manufactured from biologically-engineered tobacco leaves grown at a facility in Kentucky, but it only has extremely limited production capacity.

Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services are now in advanced talks with a Texas company that could produce the drug in millions of tobacco plants.

The New York Times also reported that the US government and two of the world’s biggest charities — the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – are in talks to arrange for production of ZMapp in animal cells. That is a more conventional production method in the biotechnology industry and could allow for greater overall production, but the initial stages of development will take longer. “We’re going with multiple manufacturers,” a federal official said,

BusinessWeek has reported on the delays in federal bureaucracy [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-09-24/ebola-drug-zmapps-development-delayed-by-pentagon-agency] that held up research of the drug for up to four years.

“That’s why we don’t have an Ebola countermeasure,” said Robert Kadlec, a consultant and public health physician who held high-level posts in biodefence in the Bush administration. “We failed to invest enough dollars to have it mature.”

Ebola could become airborne, warns UN chief

THE Ebola virus could become airborne if the epidemic is not brought under control quickly enough, the chief of the United Nations Ebola mission warned yesterday.

Anthony Banbury, the UN secretarygeneral's special representative, said aid workers were racing against time to bring the epidemic under control in case the virus mutated and became even harder to deal with.

"The longer it moves around in human hosts in the virulent melting pot that is west Africa, the more chances increase that it could mutate," he said. "It is a nightmare scenario [that it could become airborne], and unlikely, but it can't be ruled out."

He admitted that the international community had been "a bit late" to respond to the epidemic, but that it was "not too late".

Mr Banbury, who has worked with the UN since 1988, said that the epidemic was the worst disaster he had witnessed.

"In a career working in these kinds of situations, wars, natural disasters – I have never seen anything as serious or dangerous or high risk as this one," he said. I've heard other people saying this as well – seniorfigures who are not being alarmist."

But other health officials pointed out that no virus transmitted by bodily fluids – as Ebola is – had ever mutated to airborne transmission.

"There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology," said Prof David Heymann, chairman of Public Health England at a discussion programme on the virus in London on Wednesday night.

He mentioned HIV and Hepatitis B as example of viruses transmitted by bodily fluids that had "never converted to a respiratory virus".

Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, added that a sense of proportion should be kept when discussing Ebola.

"The chances of Ebola becoming airborne are extremely small. I am not aware of any viral infection changing its mode of transmission. It's important we retain a sense of proportion and not exaggerate the risks for it changing and becoming airborne," he said.

"There is already enough fear and panic surrounding this epidemic."

Last night, it was confirmed that up to 100 people may have been exposed to Thomas Duncan, America's first Ebola patient.

Mr Duncan, 42, a Liberian citizen who was visiting relations in Dallas, was seen vomiting in the street two days after he had been sent home from a hospital following a blunder by medical staff.

He had gone to the hospital on Sept 26 and told a nurse he had arrived from Liberia a week earlier, but the information was not passed on. Mr Duncan's girlfriend, who has been quarantined inside her Texas home with three other people, criticised the hospital and said the sheets and towels he used have still not been removed.

She was avoiding the bed and sleeping in the living room instead. She told CNN: "I don't know what to do."

In London yesterday, Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, held a conference gathering ministers, diplomats and health officials from around 20 countries to secure more funding in the fight against Ebola.

Britain has pledged £125million to help build an estimated 700 treatment beds, fund new community treatment centres, support existing public health services and support aid agencies in Sierra Leone. Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, had been due to attend but his plane broke down.

The US government is scrambling to start production of the experimental Ebola drug that is viewed as the most promising treatment in the fight against the virus. The ZMapp serum was used to treat two American missionaries who recovered from Ebola but is not available for Mr Duncan as the limited supplies ran out in August. ZMapp's development was repeatedly held up for years by funding delays from a Pentagon programme aimed at countering biological threats.

Suggesting Ebola will become airborne is 'irresponsible', say experts

UN's Anthony Banbury criticised as irresponsible and spreading panic for suggesting that Ebola could become airborne when no other virus has changed in this way

The UN's chief of Ebola mission Anthony Banbury said Ebola could become airborne in a 'nightmare scenario' but leading scientists have slammed his remarks saying this has never happened and suggesting it is 'irresponsible'.

Mr Banbury was speaking exclusively to the Telegraph as predictions were made that Ebola could have infected 1.4m people by January.

He said the longer the virus is in humans the greater the chance it could mutate. He said the virus being spread through the air was a 'nightmare scenario' but that it 'could not be ruled out'.

However leading British scientists have rounded on him saying his comments are a distraction and accused him of spreading panic.

Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, said: "To suggest that Ebola could become airborne is completely irresponsible.

"The way the virus is spreading is consistent with what we've seen in all previous 25 outbreaks, only transmitting through blood and bodily secretions. There is no precedent for a virus changing its mode of transmission so drastically.

"Other viruses such as HIV – which transmit in the same way, have passed through millions of humans, and are known to mutate more than Ebola – have not become airborne. Making such claims is an unwelcome distraction from the urgent need to scale up the international response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in West Africa."

Dr Ben Neuman, Lecturer in Virology at University of Reading, said: “Ebola is found in the bloodstream, which is part of what makes it so difficult to transmit compared to other viruses. To become airborne, Ebola would need to fundamentally change the way it grows. That is very unlikely in my opinion.

“Evolution can be unpredictable, but there is no good reason to expect that Ebola will become more dangerous with time. Severe diseases like Ebola often happen when a virus clashes with a brand new host for which it is poorly adapted. Recent experience with H1N1 swine flu shows that viruses are likely to mellow as they adapt to their new hosts.

“There is no evidence that Ebola can spread via the air in the real world. Ebola can only be transmitted through the air under carefully controlled lab conditions. One clue that emphasises how different Ebola is from flu is how slow the virus is spreading. Compared to this Ebola outbreak, the H1N1 swine flu had already spread to an estimated 10,000 times as many people in its first ten months.”

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, added that a sense of proportion should be kept when discussing Ebola.

“The chances of Ebola becoming airborne are extremely small. I am not aware of any viral infection changing its mode of transmission. It’s important we retain a sense of proportion and not exaggerate the risks for it changing and becoming airborne," he told the Telegraph. "There is already enough fear and panic surrounding this epidemic.

"Of more concern is that the virus could become endemic in Western Africa, so unlike big outbreaks like this we could have smaller numbers of cases but circulating continuously. This is where we need to focus our efforts and attention – on trying to stop this outbreak before it establishes itself in Western African countries.”

Mr Banbury, who has served in the UN since 1988, said that the epidemic was the worst disaster he had ever witnessed.

“We have never seen anything like it. In a career working in these kinds of situations, wars, natural disasters – I have never seen anything as serious or dangerous or high risk as this one. I’ve heard other people saying this as well, senior figures who are not being alarmist. Behind closed doors, they are saying they have never seen anything as bad,” he said.

He is leading a mission to Africa with the aim of getting the outbreak under control within 90 days.

He added: “There is a limited window of opportunity. We need to hit it and we need to hit it hard. We haven’t done that but we are doing it now.

"Certainly we are late but the expectation is that we are not too late. We are going to have a very big, fast effort … I have never seen the UN move at this speed or with such co-ordination. We are seeing the kind of response we need, but yes, it’s a bit late.”

The latest figures from the World Health Organisation show that as of last week there 7178 cases, with 3,338 deaths. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.

Five diseases far deadlier than Ebola found in the US

Ebola is far from the deadliest disease to ever reach US shores - we look at five others currently or recently observed in the US with higher fatality rates

More than 100 Americans in Dallas could have been exposed to the deadly strain of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] currently sweeping West Africa, after the first case on United States soil was diagnosed this week.

This strain of the virus, which has killed over 3,000 in west Africa, has a fatality rate of around 55 per cent.

That is not as high as some other strains of the virus, which have approached 90 per cent – in fact, part of the reason this strain has been able to spread further than others is that patients carry the virus for longer before they either recover or die – but it still leaves victims statistically more likely to die than not after catching it.

However, Ebola is far from the deadliest disease to ever reach US shores.

Amoebic meningoencephalitis

A rare but highly lethal disease which sees the nervous system infected by a type of amoeba which can be found in warm, stagnant freshwater including swimming pools and lakes.

Only five people have ever survived the disease, representing a 97 per cent fatality rate.

Infection can occur if contaminated water enters deep into the sinus cavities. There are few symptoms in the first few days of infection beyond a loss of sense of smell, but most of those infected die within 14 days of exposure.

Around 60 cases have been reported since 1975 in the US, though fewer than 300 worldwide in medical history.

The only good news? The amoeba is extremely sensitive to chlorine, so your local swimming pool is safe.

Rabies

Rabies is still present in all parts of the world except for Japan, parts of Western Europe and Australasia, and Antarctica, killing 55,000 annually.

Spread by bites or scratches from infected animals, the disease in nearly always fatal once symptoms develop, typically one to three months after infection.

The US had between one and eight cases each year over the last decade, many of which involved people infected abroad before returning home.

However, a range of animals found in the US can also spread the disease, including bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes and even groundhogs.

Anthrax

Anthrax used to kills hundreds of thousands around the world every year. However, the vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur has seen this vastly diminish. The disease – usually picked up by grazing animals from spores of bacteria in the soil – is now very rare in domestic animals and humans.

The most dangerous form, inhalational anthrax, was known as “woolsorters’ disease” due to the risk of inhaling spores suffered by those in the wool trade. Without treatment, only about 10 - 15% of patients with inhalation anthrax survive.

The last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976, when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan.

Despite this, fears remain that the highly weaponisable bacteria could be used in a terror attack, as occured in 2001 when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two Democratic US senators, killing five people and infecting 17 others.

Plague

We all remember this from school history lessons – the 14th-century Black Plague was just one of three global pandemics in history, which have collectively killed up to 200 million people.

But it is still around, even in developed countries - from 1990-2005, a total of 107 cases of plague were reported in the United States.

Mortality from pneumonic plague approaches 100 per cent when untreated, while some strains of bubonic plague can be as high as 70 per cent.

HIV/AIDS

New research this week has claimed the first ever case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic can be traced to Kinshasa in the DR Congo in the 1920s[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11138067] . Since then it has spread across the world infecting some 75 million people and killing 36 million of them.

It is hard to put an exact figure on mortality as treatments vary substantially around the world and are constantly developing, while many die years or even decades after infection from HIV-related diseases, but the below graph shows how life expectancy falls among patients before and since the development of antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

However, the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual puts the case fatality rate among those untreated in a developed country at 80 to 90 per cent in the first five years.

'I'll fight off Ebola with bottles of Vimto' - Liberian exorcist reveals secret weapon against deadly virus

Liberian self-styled bishop plans mass exorcism to drive out Ebola "demons", using Vimto as cheap replacement for communion wine

Like many of Liberia's "self-styled" bishops, Edward Adjei has long believed in the power of divine intervention. He claims in the past to have received direct revelations from God, and at his "Christ Incorporated" church, worshippers flock every Sunday for his "soul winning" sessions.

Now, though, he is embarked on what would amount to his biggest miracle of all - persuading Liberia's government to show faith in his bizarre plan to rid the country of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] . The deadly virus may have no cure known to medical science, but he says it can be seen off with the help of a three-day prayer session, an exorcism of the presidential palace - and several bottles of Vimto.

While health chiefs blame the outbreak of the virus on poor sanitation and overcrowded slums[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11136024/Ebola-outbreak-the-global-spread-of-the-virus-in-90-seconds.html], Mr Adjei points the finger at the burnt-out hulk of the old presidential palace, which stands on a hill in the capital, Monrovia.

After six years as the seat of power of the warlord Charles Taylor - accused of practising witchcraft during Liberia's brutal civil war - the building, which caught fire mysteriously during independence celebrations in 2006, is widely believed to be cursed.

Mr Adjei is one of a number of independent clergymen who now believe that the demons which lurk in it must be banished if Ebola is to be defeated.

"The presidential building is our country's gateway to Heaven, through which our leaders speak to God, but it has been desecrated," said Mr Adjei, who aired his plan in local newspapers in Monrovia last week.

"Now nobody speaks to God through the palace any more, so He has turned his back on our country. And when that happens, we lose protection against things like Ebola."

Mr Adjei, who claims to have had warning of the impending Ebola epidemic in a revelation last December, has now written a joint letter with other Liberian clergymen asking permission from the Liberian government to do an exorcism of the building.

He said it would require a three-day prayer session, which would also involve a ceremonial scattering of the blood of Christ around the building. It is here that his plan - to British minds at least - takes its most unexpected twist of all.

Rather than using communion wine as the blood of Christ, he uses Vimto, the British-made soft drink famous for its distinctive pink hue. "Communion wine is rather expensive, so we use Vimto instead," he said, brandishing a large bottle from a store in his vestry. "We use it for consecrations here in Liberia all the time, such as in houses and pieces of land where evil acts were committed during the civil war."

The perception that the Ebola outbreak has a spiritual element to it has been a headache for health chiefs throughout west Africa, who say that people who blame the virus on witchcraft are less likely to seek help if they get infected.

Indeed, Mr Adjei claims that any illness with no known cure is almost certain to involve Satan's hand in some way. He stresses, though, that also has faith in the more worldly methods to fight Ebola, which has now claimed nearly 3,000 lives across the region, nearly half of them in Liberia.

At the doors to his church in Monrovia's Painsville district, parishioners must wash their hands with chlorinated water, and he says he would send anyone suffering from the virus to seek medical help first and spiritual help second.

Nonetheless, his plan for the consecretion of the presidential palace has so far attracted little interest from the Liberian government. "I have written to them and tried to contact them, but I have had no response," he said.

Five blunders US made in treating country's first Ebola patient

A series of questions are being asked about the handling of America's first Ebola case

Health officials are under fire for their handling of America's first Ebola case. Here are five questions being asked.

Q: Why was Thomas Eric Duncan allowed to leave Liberia?

A: Duncan had been in close contact with a 19-year-old woman who died of Ebola on Sept 16. Four days later he boarded a plane for the US. Before leaving he was, like other passengers, required to fill out a form. One of the questions on the form concerned whether he had touched the body of anyone who had died in an Ebola-infected area. He answered "no" on the form. No other checks were done. The Liberian Ministry of Justice has now announced it wants to prosecute Duncan for lying on the firm, saying it expects people to do "do the honourable thing" when filling out the form.

Q: Why was Duncan sent home from a Texas hospital with antibiotics?

A: Only last week the Texas Presbyterian Health Hospital in Dallas had a run-though for staff of what they should do if an Ebola patient turned up in their area. But when it did happen they failed to recognise the signs. According to Duncan's girlfriend, he became ill and she took him to the hospital on Sept 25. Staff asked for his social security number and he told a nurse that he didn't have one because he was a Liberian citizen. According to his girlfriend staff were told twice that he was from Liberia. The fact that he had recently been in West Africa, where more than 3,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, should have raised a red flag. Instead, it was concluded that he had a common virus and he was sent home with antibiotics. Hospital officials have admitted that information was not properly shared between staff.

Q: Was the ambulance trip to hospital handled properly?

A: On Sept 28 the daughter of his girlfriend brought Duncan tea in bed and found him shivering and sick. An ambulance was called. When it arrived neighbours witnessed him vomiting on the ground outside the apartment as he was placed in the emergency vehicle. No extra precautions were taken for the ambulance ride despite the fact he was Liberian and showing possible symptoms of Ebola. The ambulance was used for another 48 hours before being taken out of service. After his eventual diagnosis the three ambulance workers were told to stay home until they get the all clear. Meanwhile, it took until Thursday for workmen to using high-pressure water jets and bleach to clean the area outside the apartment where he had been sick.

Q: Were the people closest to Duncan quarantined correctly?

A: Duncan's girlfriend Louise Troh and three relatives are quarantined in the apartment where he fell ill. They will have to remain there for 21 days. But health officials have so far failed to remove the bed sheets and towels Duncan sweated on while infected. His girlfriend told CNN by phone that she was simply avoiding the bed, sleeping in the living room instead. She has put the towels in a plastic bag. Health officials are visiting her only once a day, she said. She has cleaned the apartment herself using bleach and is monitoring her own temperature, and that of he others hourly. Officials are not doing it. Miss Troh and the other people in the apartment were initially merely asked to stay inside. A legal quarantine was not imposed until three days after Duncan was diagnosed, during which time they did go outside. Dallas judge Clay Jenkins said: "There were violations of the request to not leave their premises." Meanwhile, four Sheriff's deputies blundered by going into the apartment without protection. They had to be sent home, hand in their uniforms, and their patrol cars have been qurantined.

Q: Why are children still in school?

A: Health officials said five children who attend four local schools had direct contact with Duncan. They were only pulled out of school on Wednesday, three days after Duncan was diagnosed. They are now being kept at home for three weeks in case they develop symptoms. Some parents have been taking no chances and withdrawing their children from school, and are suggesting lessons be cancelled. One of the schools is only a few hundred yards from the apartment where Duncan lived. However, health and school officials were adamant there was no risk at the schools because the five children had not shown any symptoms of the disease. They have introduced extra nurses to the schools and had workers in protective clothing disinfecting classrooms each night.

Unite against the horror of Ebola

It is in the whole world's interests to control the spread of this disease

The spread of the Ebola virus reads like the script of a horror film. The first cases of the outbreak were spotted in Guinea in December last year. By June 2014, when Doctors Without Borders issued a plea for international assistance, it was spreading throughout west Africa. This week, a man was diagnosed with Ebola in a hospital in Texas – the first case outside west Africa. One UN official has offered a thankfully unlikely scenario of the virus becoming airborne.

The advance of Ebola reflects the inequality of human society. Here in the developed world we can put our faith in sophisticated institutions to stem the spread. In Africa that is not the case. Ebola has done so much damage there because much of African society is not equipped to cope. The condition of hospitals is appalling: many lack soap or running water, and doctors are hopelessly outnumbered by patients.

The West has responded. The US has sent a military team and the UK has pledged a further £20 million to provide vital medical supplies administered by skilled clinicians. But, according to the Commons international development committee, we could be reaping the consequences of overlooking the needs of the “least developed” countries in favour of those that are more “high profile”. The committee accuses the European Union of failing to act when millions of dollars of aid was not passed on from the Liberian Ministry of Finance to its Ministry of Health. Likewise, it calls the UK’s decision to terminate further funding to the Liberia and Sierra Leone health sectors “unwise”. Given the scale of this crisis, the West certainly cannot afford to take any action that smacks of miserliness or turning a blind eye to intolerable conditions. It is in all our interests to control this horror – a cause that ought to unite north and south, rich and poor.

IMF head warns global economy is in slowdown

THE global economy risks sinking into an era of "mediocre" growth that could derail the recovery and endanger efforts to reduce unemployment, according to Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.

Ms Lagarde warned that, six years after the financial crisis, countries were still dealing with high debts and mass unemployment, despite central bank efforts to boost growth with low interest rates. "Overall, the global economy is weaker than we had envisaged even six months ago," she said in a speech in Washington. "Only a modest pickup is foreseen for 2015, as the outlook for potential growth has been pared down."

She warned that a slowdown in emerging markets and troubles in Ukraine, the Middle East and the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa meant low global growth could persist "for a long time".

The risk of a prolonged slowdown in the eurozone, where unemployment is 25pc in Greece and Spain, was particularly high, she said.

A few reasons why the stock market has taken such a nasty tumble

Business Comment

We all know that the economy is going swimmingly, right? Then why is the FTSE 100 back down to just 6,446.39? On the one hand, UK GDP figures are excellent, with output surging ahead by an upwardly revised 0.9pc in the most recent quarter, employment rocketing and the price of oil falling. On the other, the stock market is tumbling.

There are plenty of reasons for this disconnect, though none is of much use to the investors who have lost so much in recent weeks. It is important to remember that the FTSE 100 is now largely a global index; some of its components don't even conduct any business at all in the UK. But the FTSE 250, which is more representative of UK Plc is also down, however, and in truth all European stock markets are tumbling, not just Britain's. Several eurozone economies are continuing to do appallingly, unlike the UK's, but the big disappointment has been the European Central Bank. Mario Draghi said that covered bond purchases would begin this month, but he refused to put a sum on the size of purchases he intends to push through. This spooked the markets, for good reason: unlike in the UK and US, where monetary policy has been far too loose for years, parts of the eurozone are suffering from a 1930s–style scarcity of liquidity.

That said, the markets are also falling because they fear Fed tightening. Unlike with the European Central Bank, this is mere special pleading – America's woes are not due to any lack of monetary induced–demand – but it helps to explain some of the jitteriness. The higher the risk–free interest rate, the lower equity prices: that is what all basic stock valuation models suggest.

There are other economic worries. Several key commodities that are used by industry, such as copper, have seen their prices fall. Many worry about a slowdown in China, a situation compounded over the past few days by nervousness over the pro–democracy protests in Hong Kong.

Several other geopolitical factors are dragging down equities. There are now serious questions about the make–up of the incoming European Commission, with intense partisanship breaking out in the European Parliament. British jets are bombing terrorist targets in Iraq; the return of Western involvement in the Middle East is always guaranteed to increase risk aversion.

Ebola is a humanitarian catastrophe, with the number of victims rising horribly. But it is also having a detrimental impact on trade and threatening business travel; the spectre of a pandemic is weighing on investors. It doesn't bear thinking about what would happen were the virus to spiral out of control.

It does also look as if the UK economy is slowing a little. The manufacturing sector is only just expanding, with the purchasing managers' index registering a reading of just 51.6, its lowest level since April last year. But the economy's overall slowdown should not be exaggerated: the construction PMI rose to 64.2 in September from 64.0, hitting one of its highest ever levels; and services are still growing.

All of these, and other factors, are dragging down the stock market. The only part of this which might be deemed surprising is the timing: at some point, the Federal Reserve, the world's most powerful central bank, is bound to start to tighten monetary policy in earnest. Everybody with any sense always knew that this would send the equity markets into a tailspin; it seems that some of this is happening a little earlier as expectations shift. As to Draghi, he cannot really do more: he is hemmed in by political reality and the utterly dysfunctional, economically absurd construct that is the euro.

If the geopolitical situation and the broader macro picture improve, the FTSE could easily bounce back again. But at some point, the bubble blown by years of ultra–expansionary monetary policy will burst properly. When that day comes, equity investors will need very good tin hats.

Louise Troh tells CNN from quarantine that health officials have not removed the sheets and towels used by infected Thomas Eric Duncan from the apartment where she is quarantined

The girlfriend of the first Ebola patient diagnosed on US soil has said she is praying to God that she does not to contract the disease.

Lousie Troh, 36, is in quarantine at the Dallas apartment she was sharing with Thomas Eric Duncan.

Her 13-year-old son and two nephews, aged 23 and 28, are in quarantine with her.

She told CNN's Anderson Cooper by telephone: "I'm just hanging in and depending on God to save our lives."

Miss Troh, a care worker, has been speaking to Duncan, 42, every day by phone.

She said: "He's trying. He slept well last night. We can't wait for everything to be over, we can't wait."

Miss Troh said she was checking her temperature, and that of the others, every hour.

The bed sheets and towels used by Duncan when he was sick are still in the apartment.

She said: "My daughter brought me some Clorox. We put Clorox on the mattress on the bed, and the towels are in a plastic bag all sealed up.

"But they said we shouldn't throw anything away and they would get back to me on what to do with them.

"The bed sheets, everything, is on the bed. I'm sleeping in the living room."

She said Duncan became sick three days after he arrived in the US from Liberia on Sept 20. He developed headaches and a fever.

His temperature was over 100 when she took him to hospital on Sept 25.

She said he was kept there for four hours but then sent home with antibiotics.

Three days later, after he deteriorated, her daughter called an ambulance.

Miss Troh told CNN: "I was working. My daughter came to bring him his tea and she called the ambulance. She said he was shaking, really shaking. I went to hospital right away and saw him through the glass. It was so scary."

In a video message broadcast by NBC News Duncan's mother Nowah told her son: "I know God will make a way for me to see you, and you to see me.

"I hope the people will help you with medicine and God will bless you, and God will bless the medicine for you."

Up to 100 people had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on US soil

Up to 100 people may have been exposed to America's first Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan.

The figure was a significant increase from the 18 people who were previously being monitored for signs of the deadly virus.

Four members of Duncan's family have been ordered to stay home and not to receive any visitors.

Duncan, 42, was seen vomiting in the street two days after he had been sent home from a hospital following a glaring blunder by medical staff.

He was seen in distress outside the Ivy Apartments in Dallas, less than a mile from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where doctors had wrongly concluded he had a common virus.

"His whole family was screaming," neighbour Mesud Osmanovic, 21, said. "He got outside and he was throwing up all over the place."

Duncan, a Liberian citizen who was visiting relatives in Dallas, had presented himself at the hospital on Sept 26. He told a nurse he had arrived from Liberia a week earlier, but the information was not passed on.

Liberia plans to prosecute Duncan, alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person.

Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas, Texas on September 19. On the form he answered no to every question.

His nephew Josephus Weeks eventually telephoned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, to raise the alarm.

"I called CDC to get some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he wasn't getting the appropriate care," he told NBC News[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-patient-thomas-eric-duncans-nephew-i-had-call-cdc-n216326] . "I feared other people might also get infected if he wasn't taken care of.

"And so I called them to ask them why is it a patient that might be suspected of this disease was not getting appropriate care? I'm not angry. It's more frustration and concern."

Duncan is now in a a "serious but stable" condition at the hospital. Mr Weeks said: "He's still in pain. He's doing all right. He's a fighter."

At the Ivy Apartments, a group of two-storey blocks, relatives of Duncan could be seen occasionally opening a curtain or stepping out on to a landing.

No cordon was in place around the building but private security guards kept people away, including many children living in the apartment complex.

The area has large Liberian, Somalian and Sudanese communities.

At a nearby school some parents said they were removing their sons and daughters from classes.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said the 100 people were being contacted.

She said: “Out of an abundance of caution we’re starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient’s home.

“The number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection.”

Ebola crisis: 'Britain has not abandoned Sierra Leone' – but cuts bilateral aid by a fifth

Reductions in the amount of money sent to help the government of Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone are not damaging efforts to combat the virus, said Justine Greening, as she insisted that Britain remained the country's biggest ally

Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has been forced to deny that cuts in Britain's bilateral aid programme have hampered the response to the Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] epidemic.

Britain's bilateral aid to Sierra Leone [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/] and Liberia – the money that is given directly to the government – has been reduced by £14.5 million for 2014-15, compared to the previous year. The International Development Committee on Thursday published its report into "Recovery and development" [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmintdev/247/247.pdf] in the two nations worst hit with Ebola, and said the study, began in March, showed "the dangers of ignoring the least developed countries in the world."

"The spread of Ebola has demonstrated the importance that governments of developing countries need to attach to health system strengthening," the report states. "The weak state of the health system in both countries has greatly reduced the effectiveness of the response to Ebola."

Five people are currently being infected with Ebola every hour in Sierra Leone, and over 600 people have died so far.

Liberia is the worst-hit nation, with almost two-thirds of the 3,338 deaths in West Africa.

But Ms Greening denied that there had been a cut in actual funding.

"The UK is the largest financial donor to Sierra Leone and over the last few years our aid programme has grown in size rather than reduce," she said.

Speaking at a conference in London on Thursday which was called to raise money to fight Ebola, she said that the total amount of money spent in Sierra Leone was increasing – even though the direct, bilateral funds from Britain were being cut. The money – £74 million for 2014-15 – was instead being given to NGOs and bodies such as the UN to spend in the country, she said.

Last year her department planned to spend £81m in the country, but only delivered £68m of funding.

"And I think you can see further support arriving to Sierra Leone in terms of this £125 million package today. So I think there is no question of support to Sierra Leone that is not only broad based and ongoing, but when crisis hits we are prepared to scale it up significantly."

When pressed on why Britain was switching from bilateral support to funding multilateral programmes, she said: "It's important for countries like Sierra Leone, like Nigeria and Liberia to have their health systems strengthened, we've seen that today, and we see how short sighted a view it would be to fail to help those countries develop their health systems."

A spokesman for DfID, the department for international development, defended the decision, and said that Britain's response to the crisis was "something to be proud of".

"I think the important point is that multilateral spend, in some cases, is most effective," she said. "Are we abandoning Sierra Leone? Certainly not. In fact it is the total opposite."

But Sir Malcolm Bruce, chair of the International Development Committee, said DfID had given no explanation for the reduction of its bilateral funding.

"The point we were making is that the bilateral programme has been cut," he told The Telegraph.

"As a Committee we recognise that some work must be done through agencies. But DfID have not yet explained the benefits of this. What was the case for cutting the programme of bilateral aid and diverting it to multilateral? We need to prioritise further funding for health programmes."

And Sir Malcolm added that he was concerned that the £125 million, pledged by Britain to help its former colony, must be used to create a lasting legacy of health care, rather than spent on flying experts in and then out.

"The amount is a lot more than would normally be spent in the country," he said. "And I'd like to think that it will be used not only to bring Ebola under control, but also to have a lasting impact on the health of the country."

Thomas Eric Duncan appears to have contracted the disease when he helped carry an infected pregnant woman to hospital in Liberia

Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in America, was allowed to get on a plane from Liberia despite having had close recent contact with a woman who had died from the disease.

Four days before he left Monrovia he helped a pregnant neighbour who was suffering from stomach pains, taking her to hospital in a taxi and carrying her.

The woman, Marthalene Williams, 19, had Ebola and died the following day at home after there was no room for her at the hospital.

Four other people who had come into contact with her, including her brother, also died.

Liberia said on Thursday that it plans to prosecute Mr Duncan, alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person.

Among other questions, the airline form asked whether Mr Duncan had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola.

"We expect people to do the honorable thing," said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the board of directors of the Liberia Airport Authority in Monrovia.

Angela Garway, 15, the woman's cousin, told the Associated Press: "My pa and four other people took her to the car. Duncan was in the front seat with the driver and the others were in the backseat with her."

Mr Duncan had been working at a shipping company in Monrovia for a year but left on Sept 4, the New York Times reported. He has a 19-year-old son in Texas and had made several trips there before.

On Sept 19 he flew to Brussels on Brussels Airlines, where he had a stop of seven hours.

He then got on United Airlines Flight 951 to Dulles International Airport, Washington DC, where he spent three hours before flying on to Dallas on United Airlines Flight 822.

Liberia's Information Minister Lewis Brown said: "The Liberian government is concerned and regrets that an individual travelling from Liberia was diagnosed with Ebola after arrival in the United States.

"Currently there are stringent screening measures in place at the Roberts International Airport which we believe are preventing the disease from spreading via air travel."

He added: "Consistent with the findings of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we are led to believe that he posed no risks to other passengers or the crew with whom he traveled.

"For months now, the Liberian government has been stressing that this disease is not simply a Liberian or west African problem. The entire international community has a stake in defeating Ebola."

Global economy risks becoming stuck in low growth trap

Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, warns that the global economy could sink into era of "mediocre" growth

The global economy risks sinking into a era of "mediocre" growth that could derail the recovery and endanger efforts to reduce unemployment, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.

Christine Lagarde warned that six years after the financial crisis, countries were still dealing with high debts and mass unemployment, despite central bank efforts to boost growth with low interest rates.

"Overall, the global economy is weaker than we had envisaged even six months ago," she said in a speech in Washington on Thursday. "Only a modest pickup is foreseen for 2015, as the outlook for potential growth has been pared down."

While Ms Lagarde said economic prospects differed across countries and regions, with the UK and US expected to lead the way on growth this year, she warned that a slowdown in emerging markets and troubles in Ukraine and the Middle East and the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa meant low global growth could persist "for a long time".

The risk of a prolonged slowdown in the eurozone, where unemployment is 25pc in Greece and Spain, was particularly high, she said.

"If people expect growth potential to be lower tomorrow, they will cut back on investment and consumption today. This dynamic could seriously impede the recovery, especially in advanced economies that are also grappling with high unemployment and low inflation. This is the case for the euro area."

Ms Lagarde also said higher interest rates in America and the UK could also rock the global economy. "There is a cloud hovering around asynchronous monetary policy normalisation in advanced economies and its potential spillovers to other countries around the world - and back - both through their impact on interest rates and exchange rate variations," she said.

The managing director urged governments to spend more on targeted projects and implement "growth-friendly" reforms. The IMF suggested this week that boosting public investment in infrastructure spending was one of the few opportunities left to revive growth[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11128937/IMF-infrastructure-spending-spree-last-chance-to-revive-growth.html] . Ms Lagarde said high quality infrastructure projects would provide "a powerful impetus for growth and jobs" alongside fiscal policies and labour market reforms.

"The world needs to aim higher and try harder, to do it together," she said. "Monetary policy is playing its part. Now it needs more support from the rest of the team - other policies."

The girlfriend of Thomas Eric Duncan, quarantined in an apartment with her daughter and two nephews, tells CNN the sheets and towels he used have still not been removed

The girlfriend of America's first Ebola patient has been quarantined in their home with three other people where the sheets and towels he used have still not been removed.

The woman, who gave her name as Louise, spoke to CNN journalist Anderson Cooper by phone from inside the apartment she shared with Thomas Eric Duncan.

She told Mr Cooper the sheets that Mr Duncan had slept on were still on the bed they had shared.

She was avoiding the bed and sleeping in the living room instead. She told CNN: "I don't know what to do."

The woman said her 13-year-old daughter and two nephews in their 20s were also quarantined in the apartment, Mr Cooper reported.

She had placed towels used by Mr Duncan in a plastic bag but they were still in the apartment. She had also used bleach to clean the apartment.

Louise, a caregiver, said she and the children were not exhibiting symptoms. They could be seen looking though curtains occasionally.

She was critical of the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where she had taken Mr Duncan on Sept 25 when he became ill, CNN reported.

According to her she told the hospital twice that Mr Duncan had recently come from Liberia, but he was still sent home with antibiotics.

He was sweating and shivering and her daughter gave him tea before an ambulance was eventually called three days later.

Mr Duncan's girlfriend said it was being left down to her to take her own temperature, and the temperature of the others under quarantine.

She said officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were vising just once a day.

Ebola 'could become airborne': United Nations warns of 'nightmare scenario' as virus spreads to the US

Exclusive: Anthony Banbury, chief of the UN's Ebola mission, says there is a chance the deadly virus could mutate to become infectious through the air

There is a ‘nightmare’ chance that the Ebola virus could become airborne if the epidemic is not brought under control fast enough, the chief of the UN’s Ebola mission has warned.

Anthony Banbury, the Secretary General’s Special Representative, said that aid workers are racing against time to bring the epidemic under control, in case the Ebola virus mutates and becomes even harder to deal with.

“The longer it moves around in human hosts in the virulent melting pot that is West Africa, the more chances increase that it could mutate,” he told the Telegraph. “It is a nightmare scenario [that it could become airborne], and unlikely, but it can’t be ruled out.”

He admitted that the international community had been “a bit late” to respond to the epidemic, but that it was “not too late” and that aid workers needed to “hit [Ebola] hard” to rein in the deadly disease.

Mr Banbury was speaking shortly before the first Ebola diagnosis was made in the US on Tuesday evening[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11134319/Five-children-in-Dallas-monitored-for-Ebola-as-second-potential-case-found.html] . The man, who contracted Ebola in Liberia before flying to Dallas, Texas, is the first case to be diagnosed outside Africa, where the disease has already killed more than 3,000 people.

The number of people infected with Ebola is doubling every 20 to 30 days, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has forecast that there could be as many as 1.4m cases of Ebola by January, in the worst case scenario. More than 3,300 people have been killed by the disease this year.

Mr Banbury, who has served in the UN since 1988, said that the epidemic was the worst disaster he had ever witnessed.

“We have never seen anything like it. In a career working in these kinds of situations, wars, natural disasters – I have never seen anything as serious or dangerous or high risk as this one. I’ve heard other people saying this as well, senior figures who are not being alarmist. Behind closed doors, they are saying they have never seen anything as bad,” he said.

However, he added that the UN now has the “political will” and most of the materials it needs to bring the epidemic under control. He flew to Ghana on Sunday, and is leading a mission which aims to rein in the spread of Ebola within the next 90 days.

“We have the political will. We are getting them [the resources]. They are not quite there but we are getting them. Now is the time to implement, implement, implement. It is all about speed now.

“There is a limited window of opportunity. We need to hit it and we need to hit it hard. We haven’t done that but we are doing it now.

"Certainly we are late but the expectation is that we are not too late. We are going to have a very big, fast effort…I have never seen the UN move at this speed or with such coordination. We are seeing the kind of response we need, but yes, it’s a bit late.”

Although experts agree that the risks from Ebola are severe they do not believe the virus could become airborne.

Professor David Heymann CBE, chairman of Public Health England and professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said no virus transmitted by bodily fluids - as Ebola is - had ever mutated to airborne transmission.

"There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology," he said at a discussion programme on the virus in London on Wednesday night. He mentioned HIV and Hepatitis B as example of viruses transmitted by bodily fluids that had "never converted to a respiratory virus".

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, added that a sense of proportion should be kept when discussing Ebola.

“The chances of Ebola becoming airborne are extremely small. I am not aware of any viral infection changing its mode of transmission. It’s important we retain a sense of proportion and not exaggerate the risks for it changing and becoming airborne," he told the Telegraph. "There is already enough fear and panic surrounding this epidemic.

"Of more concern is that the virus could become endemic in Western Africa, so unlike big outbreaks like this we could have smaller numbers of cases but circulating continuously. This is where we need to focus our efforts and attention – on trying to stop this outbreak before it establishes itself in Western African countries.”

The UN team will need to spend the first 30 days getting emergency infrastructure and training in place, ensuring that aid workers and medical supplies are ready to be deployed wherever there is a new Ebola outbreak. They aim to control the disease as far as possible within those communities.

“We intend to see a significant improvement in the 30 to 60-day window, so that by 90 days the curve is headed in the right direction. We are putting resource in place very fast, and we will continue to flow in. It is not all there at the moment,” Mr Banbury said. “That’s the theory and that’s the plan. If it spreads in an urban setting, then it’s a different story.”

“I would not say I am confident we will succeed [in the 90-day plan] given the absolutely merciless numbers of the spread and what needs to be done to get it under control. These are extremely, extremely ambitious targets, set by doctors. We are blowing down bureaucratic barriers to get things done…but I don’t know if it will be enough…I would not want to give the impression that we can wave a magic wand.”

It is a mistake to treat the Ebola epidemic as just a medical crisis, he added. Instead it is a logistical and economic crisis, whose impact is strongest in those countries hardest hit by Ebola – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – but which may be felt around the world.

“Farmers are being impacted. Markets are being impacted. We will probably see much higher food prices and other people, like restaurant workers, will lose out on wages,” he said

“The crisis is far beyond a medical one. It is very much an economic crisis, both macro and micro. It is going to affect food security and have a devastating impact on the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people who were able to earn a living as farmers and food workers but are not any longer. The economic shock around this is terrible.”

Other experts, however, believe the risk of the virus becoming airborne risks being overstated.

Professor David Heymann CBE, chairman of Public Health England and professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said no virus transmitted by bodily fluids - as Ebola is - had ever mutated to airborne transmission.

"There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology," he said at a discussion programme on the virus in London on Wednesday night. He mentioned HIV and Hepatitis B as example of viruses transmitted by bodily fluids that had "never converted to a respiratory virus".

As the UN launches a mission to prevent the worldwide spread of Ebola, The Telegraph charts the spread of the virus from the first reported deaths in Guinea in March

The UN launched a mission on Thursday to prevent the worldwide spread of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11135883/Ebola-could-become-airborne-United-Nations-warns-of-nightmare-scenario-as-virus-spreads-to-the-US.html] as the US hunted for people who came in contact with the first African diagnosed with the deadly virus outside the continent.

Anthony Banbury, the special representative for the UN Mission on Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] Emergency Response, was expected to set ambitious targets for action on the crisis as he began a tour of the three worst-hit nations in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.

Ebola, which has killed more than 3,000 people so far, is spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

It can only be transmitted when a patient is showing symptoms like fever, aches, bleeding, vomiting or diarrhoea.

The current Ebola outbreak spread from West Africa where the first cases were found in Guinea in March of this year.

Neighbouring Liberia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/]and Sierra Leone reported cases later that month and by June the death toll reached 350 - making it the worst Ebola epidemic ever recorded.

Cases in Nigeria and Senegal followed and now Thomas Eric Duncan has become the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US.

He said: "it's really important because the UK[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/] government has pledged - has made a really good pledge of 700 beds[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/11130724/Ebola-outbreak-threatens-decades-of-British-help-to-Sierra-Leone-officials-warn.html] (to Sierra Leone[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/] ) plus all the extras - and we need other countries to really step up and get involved.

"Other countries are (getting involved)...the only problem is they're all pledging lots and the UK government has pledged all of these bed, but it's just when they all materialise.

"If all of this stuff turns up in a month it's going to be too late."

Speaking at the international summit on Ebola in London, Mr Pooley added: "we've got lots of wonderful volunteers signing up at the moment but we can always have more. It takes a lot of people to staff so many units. That's still a slightly unknown factor - where these health workers are going to come from."

First Ebola victim in America was sent home with antibiotics

The patient, who contracted the disease in Liberia, presented himself at a hospital in Dallas, Texas but was given antibiotics and told to go home. Now, health officials have launched a desperate search for others he could have unwittingly infected

The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] in America was initially sent home with antibiotics after doctors failed to recognise the symptoms of the deadly disease.

A desperate search has now been launched to find other people in Dallas, Texas who the man could have infected.

The patient had arrived in Dallas on a flight from Liberia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11132230/First-case-of-Ebola-diagnosed-in-the-US.html] and later presented himself at the hospital because he was feeling ill.

He was told to go home and take the antibiotics, but two days later his condition had deteriorated so badly that an ambulance had to be called.

He is now critically ill and in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

The ambulance vehicle used to transport him has been quarantined.

Three paramedics who were sent to get him are being kept isolated at their homes and will be monitored for three weeks, the incubation period of Ebola, to see if they develop any symptoms.

Dr Edward Goodman, an epidemiologist at the hospital, said the patient was able to communicate and had been asking for food. He added: "There is no risk to any person in the hospital."

A specialist team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has arrived in Dallas.

But medical officials said the patient, who has not been named, would not be given the experimental treatment ZMapp because there is none of it left.

It was previously used on Dr Kent Brantly, an American aid worker who was diagnosed in Liberia and then flown back to the US and successfully treated.

The patient in Texas is the first case diagnosed outside Africa in the current outbreak there, which has killed more than 3,000 people.

Officials have not disclosed his nationality but a statement from the city of Dallas said he was visiting relatives in the US.

He arrived in Dallas from Liberia on Sept 20 but showed no symptoms at the time. He began feeling ill four days later and went to the hospital on Sept 26, when he was given the antibiotics.

Two days after that he was rushed in and tested for Ebola. The diagnosis was confirmed at 3.32pm local time on Tuesday.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told the Dallas Morning News: "This can happen to any large city that's truly international today. I am saddened that the randomness of life has landed this in Dallas, but it's a sign of how diverse and international we are as a city." Texas Governor Rick Perry was due in Dallas today to meet with health officials.

Investigators from the CDC will interview the patient to see who he has been in contact with and draw up a map of where and when the contacts took place.

Anyone he came into close contact with will be monitored for 21 days. If they become sick they will be immediately isolated.

Passengers on the flight from Liberia were not at risk because the man was not sick at that point, health officials said.

They have not released the name of the airline he flew with. American Airlines has said it was not one of their flights.

Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said: "People have been calling, trying to find out if anybody knows the family. We've been telling people to try to stay away from social gatherings."

Federal officials say other passengers on the flights with Thomas Eric Duncan are at no risk of infection because the man had no symptoms at the time of his trip.

Ebola: Idris Elba encouraged by taskforce at international summit

The first reported case of Ebola in the United States is spooking airline investors and raising the prospect that some frightened travelers might stay home despite repeated reassurances from public-health experts.

Details of the man's 28-hour trip from western Africa emerged Wednesday. He flew on two airlines, took three flights, and had lengthy airport layovers before reaching Texas on Sept. 20.

Still, federal officials say other passengers on the flights are at no risk of infection because the man had no symptoms at the time of his trip.

Thomas Eric Duncan left Monrovia, Liberia, on Sept. 19 aboard a Brussels Airlines jet to the Belgian capital, according to a Belgian official. After layover of nearly seven hours, he boarded United Airlines Flight 951 to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. After another layover of nearly three hours, he then flew Flight 822 from Dulles to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the airline confirmed.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Duncan sought medical care Sept. 24 in Dallas.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, told The Associated Press that even though Duncan took several flights to reach the U.S., his lack of symptoms at the time made it "extraordinarily unlikely" that he infected anyone else on the planes.

Still, the incident spooked airline investors. Shares of United and other leading U.S. airline companies dropped 2.8 percent or more. Shares of European carriers fell by similar margins.

"The fear is if this gets worse, it would affect people's travel behavior," said Joseph DeNardi, an analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Health officials "sound confident that they've got it under control. Hopefully they're right."

The CDC typically notifies an airline when it learns that an infectious person traveled on that carrier. The airline then turns over the flight manifest to CDC, and health officials notify other passengers while the airline deals with crew members.

In this case, the CDC told United but not the public what flights the man took. In an interview Wednesday with the AP, Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, suggested that doing so would divert public-health resources away from controlling an outbreak of the virus. He said the CDC was focused on finding and tracking anyone who came in contact with Duncan after he began showing symptoms.

Public health officials have assured fliers that airports in Africa, Europe and the U.S. are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including screening passengers for fever.

An outbreak of SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - crippled air travel in Asia in 2003. Michael Derchin, an analyst with CRT Capital Group, said it was too early to draw a comparison between one Ebola patient and the 2003 SARS outbreak. He noted that SARS is an airborne disease that health officials say is transmitted more easily than Ebola.

Five children in Dallas monitored for Ebola as second potential case found

Up to 18 people in Dallas being evaluated after coming into direct contact with America's first Ebola patient and five children among them are "priority number one"

Up to 18 people in America, including five children, may have been exposed to Ebola after coming into direct contact with the first patient to be diagnosed with the deadly disease on US soil.

Thomas Eric Duncan, who arrived in Dallas, Texas, from Liberia on Sept 20, was infectious for up to eight days and health officials are already examining a second potential case in someone close to him.

They said the children who encountered Mr Duncan and who went to four different schools in Dallas were “priority number one” and would be closely observed for any symptoms over the next three weeks, the incubation period for the disease.

Mr Duncan, who is from Monrovia, Liberia, and has also lived in Accra, Ghana, was visiting relations in Dallas including his sister, Mai Wureh.

She described how he had gone to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept 26 but was given a prescription for antibiotics and told to go home. According to Miss Wureh, he told the hospital he was visiting from Liberia, but it failed to suspect he was suffering from Ebola.

Eventually, on Sept 28, an ambulance was called and took him back to the hospital where he was diagnosed with the disease and placed in isolation. Mr Dunca, whoappears he contracted the disease while helping to carry a stricken pregnant woman to the hospital in the Liberian capital, is in a “serious” condition but doctors said he was “awake, talking and hungry”.

Meanwhile, the United Nations said on Wednesday that a staff member in Liberia had died from “probable Ebola”. A spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said it was the first death of a UN staffer in the outbreak that has so far killed more than 3,300 people in west Africa. The victim was Liberian.

In Texas, Zach Thompson, the director of Dallas county health and human services, said the children who had been in contact with the infected man were “priority number one”.

He said: “The precaution is to keep the children home. We will evaluate and they will be monitored. The fact that we have one confirmed case ... there may be another case that is a close associate with this particular patient. So, I want to be frank, this is real.”

The group being monitored includes two fire service paramedics and their intern who were sent to pick up the patient.

Tests on the paramedics have so far proved negative but they have been isolated for three weeks. An ambulance they used had remained in service for another 48 hours but has now been decontaminated and quarantined.

Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said: “It’s possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.”

He urged people not to panic, saying the disease would be “stopped in its tracks”. But after the diagnosis was announced, social media networks exploded, with up to 50,000 mentions of Ebola in an hour on Twitter.

Dallas has a Liberian community of about 10,000. Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said: “We’ve been telling people to try to stay away from social gatherings. We need to know who it is so that they can all go get tested.”

A Liberian official confirmed that Mr stopped in Brussels on his way to the US. But health officials said there was “zero” chance of him being infectious during the flight because he did not have symptoms at that point.

An investigation has been launched at the hospital to see why he was not admitted on his first visit.

Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, said: “If the ER physician had asked for a travel history that would have been an enormous red flag for anybody.”

Actor Idris Elba, whose parents are from Sierra Leone, says he has been encouraged by an international summit on the Ebola virus. Philip Hammond also comments

Actor Idris Elba said he was "encouraged" by an international summit on Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] held in London this week that shed light on how organisations are dealing with the outbreak.

The Wire and Luther actor said: "being a Sierra Leonean, born in London, what we've found in there is that the diaspora want to help, want to get involved in helping this Ebola crisis.

"My role is essentially to be the messenger...being a member of the media, there are tools that I can use that will be effective in trying to educate as quickly as possible on the ground in Sierra Leone[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/] .

"I was so encourage in there today...there is a Sierra Leone-led taskforce...we were all talking the same language."

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who was also at the meeting, said: "we've got more than 20 countries coming together here and we're hoping that the commitments and the pledges that are made today will allows us to make a step change in response, get ahead of the curve, so that we can contain and then beat this disease."

Ebola 'will soon become an economic disaster'

THE head of the World Bank has said the world has an economic duty, as well as a moral duty, to respond to Ebola before the disease spreads further.

Jim Yong Kim said that lessons were having to be learned again about the "terrible consequences" of responding too slowly to a pandemic.

He said global leaders had left it too late to come to the aid of the three countries most affected by Ebola – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – and that the epidemic could spread further afield.

His speech came after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in America. The unidentified patient, who was being kept in isolation in Dallas, Texas, is thought to have contracted the virus in Liberia before travelling to the US nearly two weeks ago.

The news spooked investors, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 238.19 points, or 1.4pc, to 16,804.71 last night.

The World Bank estimates that the disease could cost the three African countries $809m (£500m) by next year if it continues to spread. In Liberia, the hardest–hit country, it predicts that Ebola could reduce output by 11.7pc in 2015, costing the country $93m and reducing GDP growth from 6.8pc to –4.9pc.

"Inflation and food prices were initially contained but are now rising in response to shortages, panic buying and speculation," the World Bank said.

"Exchange rate volatility has increased in all three countries, particularly since June, fuelled by uncertainty and some capital flight."

The institution added that the "fear of contagion" was affecting labour movement, disrupting transportation and has forced the closure of sea ports and airports.

The World Bank has come up with a $230m finance package for the African countries affected so far. But it thinks a total of $1bn in aid could be needed.

The World Health Organisation first reported an Ebola outbreak in March this year and by August it had declared the epidemic an international public health emergency.

The often–fatal illness has infected around 6,500 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone so far, with more than 3,000 deaths. The disease, which is not contagious until symptoms appear, is spread via close contact with bodily fluids.

Health officials have predicted that deaths from other infectious diseases are likely to rise as the countries' health systems feel the strain.

Health problems such as obesity and diabetes can have an ongoing impact on a country's economy, but epidemics attract more attention from economists because of their short–term significance.

Market report

THE SELL–OFF in Royal Mail has gone far enough, one of the banks behind the controversial privatisation of the postal service has told investors, helping the shares to rally off a record low.

Floated at 330p a share last October, Royal Mail (RMG) hit a peak of 615p in January, having surged 37.9pc on its first day of trading. However, concern about growing competition in the UK parcels market has put the stock under pressure, and the postal group touched an all–time closing low of 392.2p on Tuesday.

Disappointing numbers from rivals UK Mail and TNT Express last week gave investors another reason to sell; but shareholders' worries are now priced–in, UBS analysts said yesterday, sending the shares up 7½p to 399.7p.

"RMG faces a number of challenges, including modernising its network, managing the decline in letter mail volumes, the threat from competition in both letter and parcel, as well as dealing with a highly fixed cost base," they said.

"We believe RMG faces particular issues with having a highly unionised, relatively well paid workforce at a time when its revenue visibility is low and when both the letter and parcel markets are undergoing significant change.

"Having said all this, we believe the poor share price performance and valuation largely reflect the fact these negatives are known by the market."

UBS, which was joint global co–ordinator on the float, caused a stir last year when analysts at the bank started their coverage of Royal Mail with "sell" advice. Yesterday, they upgraded that recommendation to "neutral", but cut their 12–month price target to 400p.

Royal Mail outperformed a weak FTSE 100, which started the final quarter of the year in much the same fashion as it finished the last. Disappointing economic data from the eurozone and a lacklustre reading from a gauge of US manufacturing pushed the market lower. Worries about the unrest in Hong Kong added to investor unease, and the FTSE 100 slid 65.2 points, or 1pc, to 6,557.52 – its third straight session of declines and its worst close since April.

Having lost 2.8pc over the course of last week, its heaviest such fall since June last year, London's benchmark index has slumped a further 1.4pc since trading opened on Monday.

European markets were also sharply lower yesterday, as were stocks on Wall Street, which were hit by the first diagnosis of ebola in the US.

Concern that the spread of the virus would stifle demand for travel knocked British Airways–owner International Airlines Group down 9.9p to 357.2p.

Intertek, up 26p at £26.31 adjusting for it trading without right to its latest dividend, was among just 11 gainers in London, still buoyed by Tuesday's news that Inchcape chief executive Andre Lacroix is to take the helm.

"He is a proven, operating CEO, with experience in emerging and growth economies so would appear to be a good appointment," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Brooke.

A day after unveiling another so–called positive profit warning, Royal Bank of Scotland put on 0.4p to 368.6p, adding to Tuesday's 6.8p gain. The rise came despite Ian Gordon, Investec's well–followed banking analyst, sounding a note of caution and reminding investors he expects a £200m attributable loss in 2015. "We advise against taking a short position at this stage – keep your powder dry – but on a 12–month view, we see no upside," he said.

In the FTSE 250, Afren, the oil and gas group, advanced 5.9p to 109.4, having reassured investors after the close on Tuesday that an ongoing investigation into unauthorised payments had so far found no evidence of other similar transactions.

Nigerian explorer South Atlantic Petroleum (SAPetro) on Monday disclosed a shareholding in Afren, which spurred bid chatter. Deutsche Bank said the investigation update "will inevitably raise fresh questions on Afren's vulnerability to a takeover, especially when one considers that SAPetro…has recently built a 3pc stake".

Countrywide was another mid–cap riser, gaining 16.6p to 468p on news it was speeding up capital returns to investors. The estate agency started a buyback programme for as much as £20m.

The supermarkets, almost a permanent fixture at the bottom end of the FTSE 100 leaderboard in recent weeks, were under pressure. Worries that J Sainsbury, which reported a 2.8pc drop in like–for–like sales for the 16 weeks to September 27, will cut its dividend pushed the grocer 17½p lower to 234p, its worst close since April 2003. Tesco lost 6p to 180.2p on confirmation it is under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. Wm Morrison was rattled by the Sainsbury's trading update and slid 4.37p to 159.9p, adjusting for the shares trading ex–dividend.

Events group UBM announced a £563m rights issue to help fund its £599m acquisition of American trade show company Advanstar, knocking the shares down 34½p to 548½p. Some analysts were disappointed that UBM was not selling its PR Newswire division to fund the acquisition. Steve Liechti, of Investec, also said it appeared that UBM had paid "a high price" for Advanstar.

Finally, Ladbrokes slipped 3.8p to 125.6p after Cenkos warned investors to brace for a 66pc dividend cut.

Michael Fallon confirms UK defence budget safe for now

The Defence Secretary says that Britain will continue to spend 2pc of GDP on defence and attacks Labour's 'terrible legacy'

Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, has said Britain cannot 'let its guard down' by cutting spending on the armed forces, but stopped short of guaranteeing it will be protected in the long-term.

In his speech to the Conservative party conference, Mr Fallon insisted that Britain would continue to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence, which is a key commitment by Nato members, until 2014-15.

However, he did not say whether the UK would continue to spend at the 2 per cent rate after next April, despite strong international pressure to maintain the spending.

Confirming that British Tornadoes had hit targets in Iraq for the second night in a row, Mr Fallon insisted that the Conservatives had put “defence on a sound footing” after “13 years of mismanagement” by Labour, which undermined Britain’s ability to defend itself.

“Despite the deficit we inherited, we are now spending 2% on defence and we will go on spending 2% for the rest of this spending review period,” Mr Fallon told activists.

Mr Fallon has had a busy summer since he took over as Defence Secretary from Philip Hammond in July, with Libya, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine and the Ebola outbreak in west Africa dominating his agenda.

“Now we face new threats to our security,” warned Mr Fallon. “The chilling barbarity of ISIL left unchecked would see a terrorist state on Europe’s doorstep. We’ve already seen Islamic extremism here at home: London commuters blown up, Glasgow airport attacked, Fusilier Lee Rigby murdered.”

Speaking shortly before the Prime Minister took to the stage for his speech, Mr Fallon attacked Labour, emphasising the Conservatives’ determination to tackle the “largest peacetime deficit”.

“Labour left a terrible legacy,” said Mr Fallon. “A £38 billion budget black hole, the Covenant broken, our Reserves neglected, accommodation unfit for our heroes.”

However, he also attacked the Conservatives’ own government partners, criticising the Liberal Democrats for failing to support the Tories on their defence policy.

“The only area of defence Liberal Democrats are interested in is downgrading our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent for a part-time deterrent sitting in a dockyard,” he warned. “In a dangerous world, that is truly dangerous thinking.”

Mr Fallon also announced that there would be a new “Reserve Decoration” for everyone who had served for ten years in the Territorial Army, regardless of their rank. He added there would be £3.3billion of new investment in naval bases, securing 7,500 jobs in Portsmouth, Devonport and on the Clyde.

German soldiers 'stranded' in Afghanistan as more planes breakdown

Germany's military continues to be plagued by malfunctions and failures as 150 soldiers are left stranded in Afghanistan by the latest aircraft fault

Technical problems with Germany’s military aircraft have left 150 troops stranded in Afghanistan and forced commanders to consider using Chancellor Angela Merkel’s jet to fly the soldiers home.

Der Spiegel online reported that the Bundeswehr soldiers had expected to be flown home from a tour of duty in Afghansitan, but had become stuck in the town of Masar-i-Sharif on Tuesday because their Airbus 310 transport plane’s emergency oxygen masks were defective.

The equipment breakdown was the fourth consecutive German military aircraft failure in recent weeks and comes as aid destined to help fight Ebola in west Africa was left stranded[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11130506/Military-failures-stall-German-response-to-Ebola-and-Isil.html] after another plane malfunction.

Der Spiegel quoted German military sources who said that commanders were considering using a military VIP jet “normally reserved for Chancellor Merkel” to bring the soldiers home.

The decision to ground the military Airbus 130 follows similar oxygen mask problems with civilian aircraft of the same type, which has restricted their flying altitude to a maximum of 7,500 metres.

The breakdown comes as a further embarrassment for German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, who has admitted that the military is facing severe equipment shortages which are hampering Germany’s efforts to meet its NATO commitments.

Germany’s attempts to airlift arms and a handful of military advisors to Kurds fighting Islamic State left a team of army instructors stranded in Bulgaria for several days after a transport plane broke down.

To transport the weapons Germany was forced to borrow a Dutch plane which also broke down.

A recent report by the German military revealed that only 42 of Germany’s 109 Eurofighters are available for immediate use because of fuselage defects. The navy faces similar problems with only 4 of its 22 Sea Lynx helicopters and 3 of its 21 Sea Kings currently operational.

Der Spiegel also reported that German troops stationed in Turkey on a NATO mission to defend the country against attack from Syria were close to the “limit of their capabilities” because at least a quarter of them had not been given sufficient leave.

In an interview published at the weekend, Mrs von der Leyen insisted that Germany could fulfil its role in current NATO operation but she admitted that it could not meet all its NATO commitments.

The equipment defects have led to calls for increased defence spending. But Ms Merkels’ Social Democrat coalition partners have said they object to more funding for the military.

Follow Wednesday's events at the Conservative party conference with our live blog »[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11129802/Conservative-Party-Conference-live.html]

17.20 We're going to wrap it there for today. Follow us again tomorrow - thanks for reading.

17.00 Adam Holloway, whom Ukip tried to recruit, tells the Guardian he won't be defecting. He says he is not at conference because he has "loads to do" in his constituency and the event is expensive.

16.30 Labour poll woe

The Conservatives and Labour are polling neck and neck nationally, new research funded by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has shown.

Yesterday, the peer said data in key marginal seats showed Labour well ahead and on course for a "comfortable working majority" in May.

But new data, collected over the weekend - when Tory MP Mark Reckless defected to Ukip and Brooks Newmark resigned as a minister - showed the Conservatives up five points to 32%, level with Labour, who were down one. It follows Ed Miliband's lacklustre conference.

Lord Ashcroft said: "Other surveys published in recent days have shown no consistent pattern; Labour leads with other pollsters have been up, down and unchanged. In the Ashcroft National Poll, both main parties remain within the margin of error of their long term average: 30% for the Tories, 34% for Labour."

Commenting on other findings, the peer added: "Swing voters, who say they do not know how they will vote or that they may switch from their current party, were more likely than average to say they preferred Cameron (69%). Only two thirds of Labour voters (65%) said they would rather see Miliband as PM.

16.00 Lib Dems oppose Osborne's benefits freeze

More clear blue water between the Coalition partners.

A senior Lib Dem source says: “The Liberal Democrats have consistently blocked Conservative attempts to freeze benefits for the working age poor, just as they have blocked our attempts to cut benefits for the wealthiest pensioners.

“Decisions on benefit uprating should be taken at fiscal events and in light of the fiscal circumstances.

“It speaks volumes about the priorities of the Conservative Party that they see benefit cuts for the working age poor as a crowd-pleasing punch line for a conference speech.”

15.45 Iain Duncan Smith is up. In the spirit of bipartisan he calls for applause for Steve Webb, the Lib Dem pensions minister.

Two big announcements from IDS:

- Universal Credit, the reform that sees multiple benefits rolled into one, will be accelerated after a rocky start. It will be rolled out nationally by 2016.

- A pilot will be held with pre-paid benefits cards so that claimants can only spend their dole on their families, not to "feed their destructive habits".

I have long believed that where parents have fallen into a damaging spiral – drug or alcohol addiction, even problem debt, or more – we need to find ways to safeguard them – and more importantly, their families, their children ensuring their basic needs are met.

That means benefits paid should go to support the wellbeing of their families, not to feed their destructive habits.

To that end, Conference, today I can announce that I am testing prepaid cards, onto which we will make benefit payments, so that the money they receive is spent on the needs of the family – finally helping break the cycle of poverty for families on the margins, change we can be proud of.

15.40 Chris Kelly is smoked out. He tells the Standard: "Following recent speculation, I want to be absolutely clear that I will not be defecting to UKIP".

15.30 A mole gets in touch. Steve Baker MP, member of the Treasury select committee was asked at a Taxpayers' Alliance fringe if he had to introduce a new tax, what it would be.

He said that the idea was completely abhorrent to him, but if you put a gun to his head, he would put a tax on tomato ketchup sachets, because in a civilised society everyone knows that ketchup should come in a bottle.

15.20 Esther McVey, the employment minister, is introduced to the stage by Elspeth Van Der Hole[https://twitter.com/ElspethVanDHole], a fashion photographer who overcame mental health problems to set up her own firm. Delegates then watch a film on welfare reform, set to the song 'Don't Stop Believing'.

We are hearing from plenty of young entrepreneurs from hard-up backgrounds who have made successes of themselves through hard work and government grants and skills programmes.

One senses the hand of the department special adviser, or someone well-versed in the perculiar jargon of welfare reform, in a lot of these speeches. "Collaboration between the public and private sector, such as the work programme... sector-based work programmes" etc etc.

15.15 Eric Pickles has told conference that 230,000 homes were granted planning permission last year.

If the numbers stack up it means housebuilding is now on track to match demand. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/hands-off-our-land/8763931/Hands-Off-Our-Land-the-300000-new-homes-already-in-the-bank.html]

He demands English Votes for English Laws.

In the mother of Parliaments, we can’t have Platinum Card wielding Scottish MPs who can vote for measures in English constituencies, but not in their own Scottish seats.

If I vote for changes to the NHS or schools or housing, I have to bear the consequences of my vote.

I have to look the electorate of Essex in the eye and justify my actions.

Not so the Scottish MPs, who have power without responsibility in England.

And as we all know - Power without Responsibility never ends well.

So the time has come for change – the time has come for English votes on English laws.

15.10 Francis Maude: I'm not trying to politicise the civil service

From the Cabinet Minister's speech to conference

I think we have the best civil servants in the world. We probably don't thank them enough. My own private office really are the best. But this isn’t yet the best Civil Service in the world. The whole is less than the sum of the parts. We need a culture that is totally focused on service – serving Ministers who have a democratic mandate and ensuring that their decisions are faithfully implemented; and service to the public who pay the taxes that pay their salaries. A culture where individual civil servants are trusted and given the freedom to do their job, but expect to be held to account for how they do it. The Civil Service is smaller today than at any time since WW2. It’s doing more, not less. We've shown that we can do more for less. And we've only just begun.

I'm sometimes accused of wanting to “politicise” the Civil Service. I don’t want that. It isn’t political to expect civil servants to implement the will of the elected government. It’s called democracy.

15.05 George Osborne freezes work age benefits and promises lower taxes

14.59 Milk minister

The internet of things - the concept that household objects will soon by all connected to the web - risks leaving ministers unable to answer that most basic of questions: the price of milk.

Ed Vaizey, the culture minister, told a fringe it could be a "big potential revolution.

"It is much more than ordering a pint of milk from your fridge, although that is important.

"The fridge analogy is important because in future when Tory MPs are asked the price of a pint of milk they can say: 'I have no idea because my fridge orders it.' That could cause all sorts of problems in the future."

14.50 Francis Maude has congratulated Nick Hurd, the former charities minister, for the great work he did.

He adds his congratulations to his successor, Rob Wilson, the incumbent charities minister.

Forgotten someone, Minister?[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11126797/Brooks-Newmark-scandal-Woman-whose-photo-was-hijacked-by-tabloid-says-MP-did-nothing-wrong.html]

14.15 Reaction to Osborne's speech

Chris Leslie, the Labour shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, says: "Having failed to balance the books in this ParliamentGeorge Osborne has made his choice. He is choosing to give the richest one per cent a £3 billion-a-year tax cut and opposing a mansion tax while cutting tax credits which make work pay for millions of striving families. The Tories have once again shown they are the party of a privileged few at the top.

The Institute of Directors says: "A continuing focus on fiscal restraint and deficit reduction will reassure businesses that the government recognises an old truth, that sound public finances constitute the bedrock on which all businesses are built.”

Crisis, the homelessness charity, says it has "grave concerns" about ending housing benefit for young people proposed by Mr Osborne. “For many young people, living with their parents is not an option. They may be escaping abuse; the family relationship may have broken down, or there may be no room for them in the family home."

The British Chamber of Commerce says there were two missing pieces: "We would have liked the Chancellor’s speech to address access to finance, as this is so important to raising business investment and long-term sustainable growth. Also a commitment to export support should be a government priority, as it is vital to re-balancing the economy."

The Trades Union Congress said: “The Chancellor’s new cuts would hurt working families with children most of all, pegging their tax credits and housing support behind rising prices and rents. This is yet more chipping away at the social safety net working families pay into, putting them in greater danger of destitution if they become sick or lose their job.

13.50 A Cabinet minister has criticised a journalist for using naked online photographs of women without their permission to tempt a Tory minister into indiscretion, reports Ben Riley-Smith.

Nicky Morgan, education secretary and minister for women and equalities, said it was "not right" images of individuals were used without consent as she discussed the tabloid sting that led to Brooks Newmark's resignation.

She added that Mr Newmark, who resigned as civil society minister after sending a graphic photograph of himself to a male journalist posing online as a female PR employee, was right to quit when the story was published by the Sunday Mirror.

Ms Morgan was asked during a fringe event whether it was acceptable for a journalist to use naked online photographs of women without their consent to entice Tory politicians.

"No, it's not right that photographs are taken without consent from anybody. I think that that leads to issues around online security," Ms Morgan said.

"If people put something [online] and they are told there is security around it they're entitled to have that.

"There's also the broader issue of this story and the fact that there was a paper that seemed to be out to target a particular group of men.

"But they will have to answer [for their actions], I'm afraid. I expect there are regulations affecting that."

She added that Mr Newmark was "right to resign", saying: "My thoughts are actually with his wife and his family."

"Obviously these things are very, very difficult. But I think that people will realise this is one person who has made a big mistake and has paid for it massively.

"Brooks really, really wanted to be a minister. He was beginning to do really great stuff with national citizens service. But people appreciate we are all flawed human beings and I think that, as I say, the paper will have to think about their conduct."

13.00 Those announcements from the speech in full:

The Conservatives will freeze working age benefits from April 2016 for two years.

CCHQ say this will save £3.2 billion a year by 2017/18. Disability, carer and pensioner benefits are excluded, as are several smaller benefits such as statutory maternity pay.

Osborne said: "Working age benefits in Britain will have to be frozen for two years. This is the choice Britain needs to take to protect our economic stability and to secure a better future. The fairest way to reduce welfare bills is to make sure that benefits are not rising faster than the wages of the taxpayers who are paying for them."

Tax abuse

In the Autumn Statement the Treasury will "end abuse by multinationals who divert profits offshore in order to avoid corporation tax," CCHQ says.

Hundreds of millions of pounds could be raised by stopping multinationals using "artificial arrangements" to route profits to tax havens. The drive will focus on arrangements such as the so-called "double Irish" used in the tech sector. This measure comes after the progress made at the G20 and the OECD by the international “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS) project.

“While we offer some of the lowest business taxes in the world, we expect those taxes to be paid - not avoided. Some technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here. If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people."

Pensions

This Government will abolish the 55 per cent tax on death that is charged when people pass on a pension pot. The measure will apply to all payments made from April 2015.

12.45 Osborne sets out the choice for the next election

"Choose fairness. Choose freedom. Choose David Cameron. Choose the Conservatives. Choose the future."

It's all a bit Trainspotting.

Reaction from Labour camp: Lord Wood, Ed Miliband's aide and close intellectual ally, tweets: "Osborne's speech today shows he really does believe the philosophy that Britain does well when the rich get richer & the poor get poorer."

12.40 Reducing the north-south divide will be a priority of the next government, Osborne says.

Osborne announces his pledge to abolish the "death tax" on pension pots, allowing people to leave more to their children when they die. It was our front page today.

12.30 Infrastructure: Osborne will push ahead with fracking, nuclear, high speed rail, a new runway, GM crops and houses

Osborne says people will always offer a "hundred reasons to stick in the past", and motorways were opposed in the 1920s.

"We must learn from the past, not be the past. Decide or decline. We must choose the future," he says.

12.20 BENEFITS FROZEN FOR TWO YEARS

Britain can't afford £100 billion of working age welfare payments a year, Osborne says. Benefits have risen ahead of earnings: not sustainable and not fair, he says. He announces benefits will be FROZEN for two years after the next election, saving £3 billion. Disabled and elderly excluded. It follows a reduction in the uprating of 1 per cent, that passed with relatively little complaint.

As briefed over the weekend, the benefits cap will be cut by £3k to £23k, and housing benefit removed for young people, with the money saved used for apprenticeships to "pull up young people". Osborne is carving out clear dividing lines with Labour.

Labour is decidedly "anti-business," Osborne says. "They are firm against firms. Their business is against business."

The Tories have increased the minimum wage, tacked zero-hour contracts and capped pay day loans. Labour were "too busy capping each other".

To tax avoiders, he says: "If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. & my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it."

12.10 Osborne savages Ed

"Miliband made a pitch for office that was so forgetable, he forgot it himself," he says.

But forgetting the deficit was not a "hapless mistake" of an accident prone politician but a "disqualification for the high office he seeks." The economy "means nothing to Labour and everything to the people of Britain," in jobs and living standards, he says.

Osborne rejects Labour's argument that there is no connection between the economy and living standards anymore.

Ed Miliband's promises to fund the NHS were "built on sand". Only a growing economy, and difficult decisions on spending, can allow NHS budget increases. "Don't let anyone cede the NHS to Labour. They would ruin our NHS," he says.

Everything Labour promises to do - raise living standards, fix the NHS, etc - is contingent on having a plan for the economy. It requires leadership to do that. Economy, leadership. Economy, leadership. In two words, Osborne sets out the pitch for the 2015 election.

"Economic security" is at the heart of the Tory case, he says: preventing another property bubble, clearing the "still far too high" budget deficit and running a surplus, regulating the City.

The latest figures show £25 billion of permanent cuts are required to clear the deficit, he says. The option of "taxing your way out the deficit no longer exist." Global movements of capital mean "the economics of high taxation are the politics of the past."

Osborne BUNGLES the key attack line. "The problem of Britain is not that it taxed too much but that it spends too much." He pauses, gulps. "Taxes too little," he corrects.

He says the argument over deficit reduction has been settled: department budgets have been cut, but standards remain.

In first two years of next Parliament, deficit reduction will continue at its current rate to cut £13 billion.

12.00 Osborne is making his speech.

He says the Tories must ask the public to "choose the future, not the past."

He announces that Britain can be "the most prosperous major country on earth." But only if it can answer the "big questions" about the economy: a clear challenge to Labour. After the crash, the Tory government ensured the economic sorted itself out and "got back in the fight." "Britain, we did this together," he says.

The deficit is falling, jobs growing and new businesses being created at record rate. "Our economic plan is working," he says.

Osborne uses the refrain "Together" - a clear response to Ed Miliband, who said the term framed his ideology of solidarity.

Britain faces a series of risks: a deficit; the Eurozone, where the debt crisis lingers; the Russia-Ukraine conflict; ebola; the Syrian crisis. They are threats to national security AND economic security.

Britain's own debt remains "dangerously high".

The internet can make new firms, but also decimate entire industries; the Tories will provide the answers to the "big questions."

11.50 Modern farming is “not about shire horses and steam”, but about “systems and satellites”, Elizabeth Truss said today.

The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural insisted that British farming was one of the biggest success stories of the government, with “cutting edge technology” at “every stage of the supply chain.”

Speaking at the Tories’ annual conference in Birmingham, Miss Truss insisted that food and farming was “one of the fastest growing areas for entrepreneurs, whether they were using “GPS in tractors or automated celery rigs or Sainsbury’s employing an army of coders.”

Miss Truss, who is seen as one of the rising stars of the Conservatives party, became the Environment Secretary in July. She replaced Owen Paterson was shuffled out of government to disappointment among the farming community, who believed that he understood and sympathised with the issues facing the countryside.

Miss Truss told the party conference that British farming exports had risen by £1billion in four years: “We are growing wheat more competitively than the Canadian prairies, we’re producing more varieties of cheese than the French, and we are even selling tea to China.

The Conservative MP for South West Norfolk also insisted that she would not rest “until the British apple is at the very top of the tree.”

She added that she wanted to ensure that British food continued its revival. “I want our children to grow up enjoying the taste of British apples as well as Cornish sardines, Norfolk turkey, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Wensleydale cheese, Herefordshire pears and, of course, black pudding,” she said.

Miss Truss has also recently said the Hunting Act had been a “mistake”. The Coalition promised a free vote on overturning the Hunting Act when parliamentary time allows.

However, she indicated in an interview with the Sunday Express that there would be no chance to repeal the Act prior to next year’s election, partly because there is little chance of success.

Asked whether the party is likely to delay the vote until after the election, when it would stand a greater chance of success if more Tory MPs are elected, she said “yes”.

11.45 Digby, Lord Jones, the cross bench peer and former head of the CBI who was appointed a trade and industry minister by Labour is addressing the Tories. Cameron looks pleased as punch. Is a defection immiment?

He backs English Voters for English Laws: Why should a Scottish MP vote for tax in Brum, he says. It is a "disgraceful, unacceptable farce".

Update: No defection. "I don't do party politics," he says. "Business is my constituency." But there is an assault on members of his former Government.

Without business, there would be no jobs, no tax and no public sector. "It really does worry me" that so many politicians and trade unions "just don't get it."

"They think money grows on trees," he says. Businessmen must not be the the "whipping boys of a populist ideology," he says. Which politician could he be talking about?

"Business must reach down, round and under," people who can't work, he says. "For those who won't, I'd stick an Exocet up their chuff."

He says National Insurance is his "pet hate" and the Chancellor is "quite right to call it a jobs tax." All parties must commit to abolishing it as soon as possible. This is significant: there are suggestions Labour is preparing to hike NI to pay for the NHS. He introduces Osborne as "The Man with the Plan.... and it worked".

Everyone doubted Osborne. "But you stuck to you guns and did what was right for our country." Osborne "deserves a personal pat on the back for that."

11.35 Sajid Javid, the culture secretary, turns on Ken Livingstone over which party is the best home for immigrants. He tells conference:

It’s only in the Conservative Party that a Rochdale-born son of an immigrant bus driver could become Secretary of State for Culture.

Now some people in Labour seem to resent where I’ve ended up.

On my appointment that great sage Ken Livingstone enjoyed telling people that when he looked at me he did not see a Pakistani.

Instead he saw a banker. Well Ken, I’m actually British but yes my heritage is Pakistani. And yes, I was a banker. I’m not ashamed of those facts. I’m proud of them.

Ken’s crass comment shows Labour’s confusion about why I am a Conservative, about why anyone from an ethnic minority or with a working class background does not automatically vote Labour.

Well, let me explain. I believe in opportunity. I believe that I – not the state – should decide what course my life takes.

And I believe that if you work hard, you should be rewarded.

No wonder it confuses the Labour Party. They would prefer us not to have any aspirations.

They would prefer to tell us what to do. They would prefer us to know our place.

Javid pledged to improve rural broadband. He gave further indication that non-payment of the TV licence could be decriminalised.

"Receiving public money is a privilege, not a right. So, I ask myself: 'Can it be right that someone goes to prison if they fail to pay their licence fee?' Which is why I am now reviewing this whole issue."

11.30 Matt Hancock, the Business Minister, has told the Conservative Party conference that seeing his family's business at risk of collapse for want of a single cheque is "burned across his soul".

In a personal speech aimed at outlining his motivation for entering Tory politics, Mr Hancock told activists that the experience of the IT firm he grew up with drove his "passion" to stop other families going through the same thing.

Mr Hancock said he would come home from school and pick his way through a house strewn with cables and equipment from the business.

He said: "I'm standing here today because of those formative, personal experiences. Like with all small businesses, there were times that were hard.

"There's one week I'll never forget. We'd worked hard and the orders were coming in but the economy was in recession and one of our key clients was struggling.

"Unless a crucial cheque arrived, the company would go under, our 30 or so employees would have lost their jobs and their livelihoods. So too would both my mum and stepfather."

Mr Hancock said there was a clear divide ahead of the election between the pro-business Tories and the "truly anti-business" Labour Party.

11.20 John Redwood has vowed to punish businesses who speak out in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union, reports Ben Riley-Smith.

Mr Redwood, one the most senior Tory Eurosceptics, said companies who did not stay silent on the country's EU membership would pay a "very dear economic and financial price".

Chief executives who decide to take a corporate position on the issue could lose their jobs while those campaigning against membership would ensure there were financial consequences, Mr Redwood warned.

The former shadow trade and industry secretary demanded firms "keep out" of the debate and "beware" not to "meddle in politics".

Mr Redwood told a fringe event about Britain's place in the EU that "the only answer for all concerned is for big business to keep out and not express a corporate view".

He added: "If they don't understand that now they will find those of us organising the 'get out' campaign will then make life difficult for them by making sure that their customers, their employees and their shareholders who disagree with them - and there will be a lot who disagree with them - will be expressing their views very forcefully and will be destablising their corporate governance.

"This is absolutely crucial that these people get this. That it will be deeply disruptive to their businesses, and maybe even to their own tenure of their jobs, if a chief executive with a handful of shares thinks he can put the voice of a multi-national corporation behind a highly intense political argument in one country in which they operate.

"It would be extremely foolish and we must make sure they have to pay a very dear economic and financial price were they to try that ill-judged thing."

11.00 White Dee is at a fringe event discussing how to get people into work and off benefits. She might vote Ukip, Georgia Graham says.

Nigel Farage is right to never talk about benefits, Deirdre Kelly, the satar of the Channel 4 show Benefits Street said,

Mr Farage was being "smart" not taking about welfare because the other parties were "digging a big hole" for themselves. That will allow the Ukip leader to "swoop in and clean up."

She told the Policy Exchange fringe meeting at the Novotel in Birmingham: "I like to speak for myself but Mr Farage doesn't seem to be doing a bad job. He's had a few extra members joining."

Asked if see would vote Ukip, she added: "I very well could."

When it was pointed out Mr Farage did not offer an alternative coherent policy on welfare she added: "He's been clever then isn't he?

"He's leaving it to everyone else to dig a big whole for themselves and then he'll swoop in and take over."

Miss Kelly said her daughter, 17, will not sign on, and has been doing work experience with the Football Association.

Miss Kelly added: "She is not a type of person who doesn't want to do anything so I think I am sort of blessed in that way."

10.30 Concern is mounting that Chris Grayling’s long awaited reform of the 2000 Human Rights Act, which is set to be unveiled tomorrow, might not be all it is cracked up to be, writes Christopher Hope

The Justice secretary is due to address the party’s conference in Birmingham on Tuesday, when he will set out plans to bring in a new British Bill of Rights.

Mr Grayling has long said he wanted the British Supreme Court to “reign supreme” over human rights cases – and not for them to be referred to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

In the small print this would mean revoking a clause in the current HRA that courts in Britain must “have regard to” decisions taken by the European Court.

However The Telegraph understands that rather than dropping the “have regard to” wording the new plans recommend replacing them with new words: “may take into account”.

Critics are now saying that this will not make little difference to the current status quo and that the long-awaited Tory reform to the HRA - now mooted for over a year - will be the dog that never barked.

Mr Grayling will have to prove that they are wrong in his speech tomorrow morning.

10.00 Gordon Henderson, the Conservative MP, has ruled out joining Ukip but said he was apporached by a recruiter.

Speculation is again rife that I am about to defect to UKIP. Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless have left the Conservative Party and the national media are desperate to find out who will be next. I appear to be their favourite! I am sorry but they will be disappointed.

It is true that I was approached by a leading member of UKIP to “do a Douglas Carswell” and defect from the Conservative Party, but I turned down that offer. I have no intention of joining UKIP and I would like to explain why.

I have been a member of the Conservative Party for almost 50 years. The reason I am a member is because the principles of the Conservative Party reflect my own philosophy. And here we must differentiate between principles and policies.

Policies change with the wind, or the election of a new leader. Principles are constant.

I have often opposed Conservative Party policies, which is why I have rebelled on over 40 occasions during my short time as an MP, but I would never oppose the core principles on which the Conservative Party was built.

It is worth remembering that the Conservative Party belongs to its members, not the Leader of the Party, its MPs or any other individual. And the Conservative Party has principles and without those principles it would be nothing.

Henderson isn't saying this morning who the recruiter was. But on Saturday we revealed how Ukip's man in the Commons, barrister Matthew Richardson, is approaching MPs as they drink beer on the terrace and trying to lure them over.

09.45 The fringe event for Women2Win, the Conservative organisation that encourages women to run for Parliament, was packed to capacity last night.

A string of big hitter - Nicky Morgan, Liz Truss, Grant Shapps - turned up. Shapps said he had not boasted as much as he could have done about progress in increasing the number of women candidates to 35 per cent (which lags some way behind Labour, which has used all-women shortlists to drive up numbers). One figure noticeable by absence was Brooks Newmark, who helped run the group. One senior Tory there mused that his "vanity" had got the better of him when he was caught in a tabloid honeytrap, adding that he won't be coming to conference.

The star turn was Theresa May, who made this plea for women to "perservere" in Parliament. She said.

"The key reason for having greater diversity of people on the front benches of the House of Commons is if you have people with different experience, different backgrounds and different skill sets you get better decisions. Because all that experience is pooled and you get much better decisions at the end of the day."

Was that a general observation, or a barb directed at her colleagues? You decide.

09.40 Conservative MPs who defect to the UK Independence Party should be treated "with great respect", according to a former Tory Coalition Cabinet minister.

Owen Paterson, who was sacked as Environment, Food and Rural Affairs secretary earlier this year, also said the party had to make it clear to MPs tempted to defect that "protest will not get you what you want".

Asked on Sky News how many more Tory MPs might defect after Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless he said: "I have no idea."

He said: "They are misguided sadly. I think we should be respectful of their decisions - they have set a new constitutional precedent of standing down unlike Shaun Woodward and Quentin Davies who just pushed off to the Labour party.

"They are setting themselves up to be voted back which one has to respect and I think we should treat all those who are currently not supporting us with great respect.

"But we also have to confront the fact that frankly they are wrong."

Mr Paterson is known in Westminster as one of the standardbearers of the Tory right. Days after he quit in the summer he was photographed at a countryside event speaking with Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader.

09.35 The smoking area of the Hyatt hotel in Birmingham is a useful place to take the temperature of the Tory faithful, Georgia Graham learnt last night

It happens to double up as the welcome area for arriving ministers heading to the bar or back to their rooms.

Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, slipped in unnoticed while Michael Fallon elicited a light clap and a few whoops.

But it was the arrival just before midnight of Theresa May that really got them going. She entered the hotel to cheers and a round of applause nodding bashfully to her many fans.

09.25 David Cameron will spearhead the campaign to beat Mark Reckless in Rochester and Strood.

Sources said that the Prime Minister regrets not throwing Mr Reckless out of the Conservatives years ago.

Mr Cameron has told friends he will make it his "personal mission" to ensure the Tories win the by-election triggered by Mr Reckless's defection.

The Prime Minister is said to be determined to "nail" the traitor MP.

"He isn't a conservative," a senior Conservative source tells us. "He is anti-immigrant, anti all sorts of things, and a w-----. His constituency are furious that they worked like hell to put his fat arse on the Commons benches and feel angry and betrayed that this is what he has done."

Note the contrast between Operation Get Reckless and Clacton. The Tories have all but given up hope of holding the seat; one strategist says they expect to lose the seat by six thousand votes.

Why the difference? According to academics who studied Ukip, Clacton is the most likely of any to vote for Farage thanks to its old, poor, white, badly educated, coastal population. While prosperous Rochester, just one hour from London, is low on the list. In his defection speech, Reckless recognised he had a "big battle," saying the seat is "not Clacton."

"I am proud to represent many ambitious professionals, aspirational families and young commuters. And by the way, if any of you are watching now, I hope you will be voting for me.

"In Rochester we have a castle and a cathedral. We’ve a lovely high street full of independent shops. There are French patisseries and Italian delicatessens. We are less than an hour from London and just two hours from France. Matthew Parris would love it".

09.20 The Chancellor's up around mid-day, when he wil announce the abolition of the 'death tax' on pensions.

What's the rabbit in the hat?

Our money is on a proposal, floated a few months ago by Policy Exchange, to restrict child benefit to four children, with the benefits cut for each child after the first. Watch this space.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10972219/Plans-to-restrict-child-benefit-could-appear-in-Tory-manifesto.html]

09.15 Rumours are intensifying that Chris Kelly could become the latest Conservative to defect to UKip.

Mr Kelly, the MP for Dudley South who is courting Nadine Dorries' daughter, in August became the latest member of the 2010 intake of Conservative MPs to announce that he is standing down at the next election.

A number of MPs believe that Nigel Farage is preparing to overshadow the end of the Conservative conference by unveiling another defector.

Mark Reckless quit the Tory party for Ukip on Saturday.

One MP said: "There are rumblings about Chris. He has certainly been one of Ukip's targets."

09.00 David Cameron tells The Sun: I'm posh - get over it.

"You can't change who you are. I can't change the school I went to, upbringing I had or the parents I have - and nor would I want to. I am the first of my family not to be a stockbroker in about six generations. I am sorry, what am I meant to do? Rewrite history?" He said Ed Miliband's conference speech, attacking the wealthy Tories, was "personal abuse" and "not very grown up".

08.20 Mark Pritchard, a Conservative MP has said he will complain to the new press regulator over the "entrapment" of Brooks Newmark.

Mark Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, said on Twitter he would be referring the story to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which recently replaced the Press Complaints Commission.

He told his 3,200 Twitter followers: "Test case for IPSO Will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by Mirror."

Speaking to the BBC, he said: "It is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated. This is the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth."

Tthe Sunday Mirror said the story was in the public interest.

Alison Phillips, Mirror weekend editor, told the Guardian: "This investigation was brought to the Sunday Mirror by a freelance reporter. The investigation, which had a clear public interest, was carried out following information from a reliable source."

Significantly, Pritchard was one of the MPs approached on Twitter by the fake account Sophie Wittam

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid repeatedly declined to say whether he believed Mr Newmark had fallen victim to a piece of "legitimate" journalism.

"Each case is different and I think you can't just give a yes or no answer," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I don't know the details of every case and so I would hesitate to say that."

08.15 George Osborne - reluctantly and after much prodding - indicates he could contemplate Brexit

"If we didn't think it was in Britain's interest to be in the EU we wouldn't argue for it," he says - but again insisting that he wants to get a successful renegotiation and remain in.

He says Tory MPs will be free to campaign for Exit in the 2017 referendum. "Ultimately it will be a free vote. It's a referendum", he says.

Osborne makes clear the "core argument of the election" will be the economy: there is no welfare state or NHS without economic growth, he tells BBC Radio 4.

Ed Miliband's view that the link between economic growth and personal incomes has been broken is a "dangerous myth" and a "fallacy", Osborne says. Miliband has repeatedly argued that a growing economy is only producing gains for those at the top. But Osborne says that when the economy tanks, job losses affect all workers.

Mr Osborne is also expected to turn his fire on Labour in his conference speech today, telling activists: "The idea that you can raise living standards, or fund the brilliant NHS we want, or provide for our national security without a plan to fix the economy is nonsense.

"It's the economy that builds houses. It's the economy that creates jobs. It's the economy that pays for hospitals. It's the economy that puts food on the table. That's why it's the economy that settles elections.

"And the Conservatives are the only people in British politics with a plan to fix the economy."

Welfare spending is still too high and the country "cannot afford" high working age welfare bills, he said.

Asked about Ukip, he told Sky News: "I completely understand people's frustration on issues like immigration and welfare."

08.00 David Cameron tells a fringe meeting: Labour are a shower

We saw last week what we are up against, and I have to say, after that Labour leader's speech, after that Labour conference, if we, the Conservative Party, cannot defeat that complete shower of an opposition we don't deserve to be in politics.

07.40 John Hayes, the PM's pointman with Parliament, says he is "fed up" with "hair-shirted nonsense" on pay.

Bid to cut cost of politics is 'hair-shirted nonsense' says Cameron aide John Hayes[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11127101]

“My shirt is Egyptian cotton - it’s not hair! It’s a pity it’s not on expenses really, but it’s not.

“I take the view that all this rubbish about politicians being over-paid and so on, we’ve got to challenge it. It doesn’t matter whether it is Parish, or District, or county, or Parliament.”

Who's been pushing this rubbish? None other than one D Cameron, who has repeatedly called to cut the cost of politics and rejected pay rises for MPs.

07.20 Top stories from the Telegraph today

George Osborne scraps the 'death tax'[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11127126]

George Osborne will announce plans to abolish a “death tax” on pension pots to allow hundreds of thousands of elderly people to leave more money to their loved ones after they die.

Next April, a month before the election, the Chancellor will scrap the “punitive” 55 per cent rate on drawdown pension funds due when the holder dies.

More than 400,000 people have drawdown pensions, which are invested in the stock market. When they retire, they draw an annual income.

Drawdown pensions are seen as more attractive than annuities, which lock people into a fixed annual income.

The measures, to be announced at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, are designed to encourage more elderly people to take advantage of the pension reforms announced in the Budget. In what will be seen as a pitch to the “grey vote” before the election next May, Mr Osborne will pledge that those who have “worked and saved all their lives will be able to pass on their hard-earned pensions to their families tax free”.

Brooks Newmark scandal: Woman whose photo was hijacked by tabloid says MP 'did nothing wrong'[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11126797]

A mother-of-two whose “sunbathing selfie” was hijacked by a tabloid newspaper to help snare Brooks Newmark in a sex scandal has insisted the MP had nothing to be ashamed of.

Charlene Tyler, 26, told The Telegraph she was upset that a photograph of her in a bikini was used as part of a fake Twitter account in the name of “Sophie Wittams”.

Miss Tyler said it was “quite wrong” The Sunday Mirror[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brooks-newmark-am-complete-fool-4337653] had copied her photograph without her consent.

I could campaign to leave the EU, warns David Cameron[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11127157]

Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC, Mr Cameron said: “If I thought that it wasn’t in Britain’s interest to be in the European Union I wouldn’t argue for us to be in it.

“I do this job because I love my country, I care passionately about its future and I want it to be a strong, proud, self-governing independent nation.”

In an address to party activists in Birmingham, Mr Cameron also suggested that he wanted Britain to have more control over the “freedom of movement” rules that currently allow all EU citizens to live and work in the UK.

He conceded that it was no longer “realistic” to squeeze immigration only from outside the EU.

Immigration reform would be “at the heart” of Britain’s plans for EU renegotiation, Mr Cameron said.

You lied to us and now we're coming for you, Cameron tells defectors[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11127216]

David Cameron has launched a highly personal attack on the Tory MPs who have defected to Ukip, warning them “we are coming for you”.

In an impassioned address to party activists, the Prime Minister said that Mark Reckless, the MP who at the weekend quit the Conservatives for Ukip, had lied to his former party “over and over and over again” about his loyalty.

Mr Cameron vowed to “throw everything we can” at the forthcoming by-election in Mr Reckless’s seat of Rochester and Strood.

Mr Reckless was jeered on Sunday by Tory supporters as he attempted to do a tour of the constituency alongside Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader.

His defection was designed to inflict maximum damage on the Conservatives on the eve of the party conference in Birmingham.

It came a month after Douglas Carswell quit the Conservatives for Ukip, forcing a by-election in Clacton. And Conservative backbenchers yesterday said that there could be as many as six further defections to Ukip in the coming months.

Mr Cameron warned any backbenchers planning to follow Mr Reckless and Mr Carswell that he will do everything in his power to ensure that they do not get back into Parliament.

“I would say one other thing to those people – you have got elected with the help of Conservatives, who stuffed envelopes, who walked streets, who knocked on doors, who worked their guts out to get you to be a member of parliament, you have let those people down,” Mr Cameron said. “We are coming for you in by-elections and we are going to throw everything we can at you.”

At the meeting of activists, Andrew Mackness, the chairman of Rochester and Strood Conservatives, told Mr Cameron that the forthcoming by-election was an “opportunity for Rochester and Stood to rid ourselves of an independent MP and have a true Conservative MP”.

Mr Cameron replied: “I will be with you in Rochester campaigning with you. I am absolutely determined that we will take this seat.” And, in a withering personal attack on Mr Reckless, Mr Cameron said: “This guy lied to you over and over and over again. That is not the new politics, that is the old politics, we should throw him out at the by-election.”

Labour will win 'comfortable' majority at general election, says Lord Ashcroft[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11126612]

Labour are on course to win a “comfortable” majority, according to polling carried out by Lord Ashcroft, with the Conservatives facing a “very uphill struggle”. The Tory peer sounded the alarm in the opening hours of the annual party conference in Birmingham, warning activists that his polling from marginal seats showed that the Conservatives were going to lose 24 critical seats.

The Tories only need to lose 22 seats to be behind Labour and also face a serious challenge from the UK Independence Party.

Fears of more victims as first case of Ebola reaches the US

A PATIENT in the United States was diagnosed with Ebola last night — the first case outside Africa.

Experts said they were trying to contact people who had been in contact with the unnamed patient in Texas over a period of several days when he could have been infectious.

The man, who was not a health care worker, arrived in Texas on a plane from Liberia on Sept 20 to visit members of his family. According to one report, he may have contracted the disease from an infected fruit bat.

He showed no symptoms when he arrived and only started to become sick four days later. Two days after that, he sought medical care.

On Sept 28 he was placed in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and Ebola was diagnosed.

Dr Thomas Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the diagnosis.

He said it was the first case diagnosed outside Africa during the current outbreak which has killed more than 3,000 people.

US medical officials are working to identify all those who had close contact with the man while he was infectious.

They will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop feverish symptoms. If they do, they will be isolated.

Dr Frieden said: "This is the first patient diagnosed outside Africa, to our knowledge, with this strain of Ebola. The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation, this case, of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this country.

"It is certainly possible someone who had contact, a family member or someone else, may contract Ebola. But there is no doubt in my mind we will stop it here."

He added: "Ultimately, we are all connected by the air we breathe and we are invested in making sure this disease is controlled in Africa.

"Ebola is a scary disease and we are really hoping for the recovery of this individual. But we are stopping it in its tracks in this country."

When asked if the patient was an American citizen, Dr Frieden said only: "He was visiting family members who live in this country."

The doctor said that people who were on the plane with the patient were not at risk because he was not feverish at that point.

A handful of US medical workers who contracted Ebola during the West African outbreak have previously been treated in the US after being flown home in isolated conditions.

Ebola causes a range of symptoms including fever, muscle aches, vomiting and bleeding.

It can be spread by close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms, or by touching the corpse of a person who died from the disease.

Third grounded plane leaves egg on German faces

THE German military has been embarrassed after a third aircraft breakdown in as many weeks left medical supplies for the fight against Ebola in western Africa stranded in the Canary Islands.

One of two military transporters carrying aid to Senegal was grounded on Gran Canaria. The second aircraft was able to continue to Dakar.

The debacle is a further embarrassment for Germany after a series of aircraft failures left in disarray its planned £54million shipments of arms to Kurds in Iraq fighting against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil).

In the first incident, a military transport plane carrying weapons instructors to northern Iraq suffered a malfunction, stranding them in Bulgaria for five days.

Separately, Germany had borrowed a Dutch aircraft to fly weapons to Iraq because its own air force didn't have one available – only for the Dutch plane to break down as well.

Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister, admitted last weekend that the country's military is facing such severe equipment shortages that it cannot meet its Nato commitments.

"With our airborne systems, we are currently below the target figures announced a year ago, defining what we would want to make available to Nato within 180 days in the case of an emergency," she told Bild newspaper.

An armed forces report last week disclosed that only 42 of Germany's 109 Eurofighters are available for immediate use, alongside 38 of its 89 Tornado aircraft. Even if those under routine repair were pressed into service, only 74 of the Eurofighters would be available, with the others facing more serious issues.

In the German navy, four of its 22 Sea Lynx helicopters are operational, and three of its 21 Sea Kings.

Only 280 of the army's 406 Marten tanks are operational, alongside 70 of its 180 Boxer armoured personnel carriers. Angela Merkel has resisted calls to increase military spending.

Military failures stall German response to Ebola and Isil

Broken planes and reduced spending has left Germany's plans to help in the fight against Ebola and the Islamic State in trouble

The German military has been left red-faced after the third high-profile aircraft breakdown in as many weeks left medical supplies for the fight against Ebola in Africa stranded in the Canary Islands.

The debacle is the latest embarrassment for Germany after a series of aircraft failures left its €70m shipment of arms to Kurds fighting against Islamic State in Iraq in disarray last week.

It comes just days after the German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, admitted the country’s military is facing equipment shortages so severe it cannot meet its Nato commitments.

Ms von der Leyen, seen by many in Germany as Angela Merkel’s heir apparent, has led calls for the country’s armed forces to take up a greater international role, and championed its involvement in the fight against Islamic State and Ebola.

But the mission to arm the Kurds got off to a disastrous start when a military transport plane carrying a team of instructors to northern Iraq suffered a malfunction, stranding the instructors in Bulgaria for several days.

Germany had to borrow a Dutch aircraft to fly the weapons to Iraq because its own air force didn’t have one available - only for the situation to descend into farce as the Dutch plane broke down as well.

Recent revelations about equipment shortages have left many in Germany questioning whether the military is capable of a higher profile role.

An armed forces report submitted to the defence committee of the Bundestag revealed that only 42 of Germany’s 109 Eurofighters are available for immediate use, alongside 38 of its 89 Tornado aircraft.

Even if those under routine repair were pressed into service, only 74 of the Eurofighters would be available, with the others facing more serious maintenance issues.

In the German navy, the situation is as severe, with only 4 of its 22 Sea Lynx helicopters operational, and 3 of its 21 Sea Kings.

Only 280 of the army’s 406 Marten tanks are operational, alongside 70 of its 180 Boxer armoured personnel carriers.

Ms von der Leyen insisted Germany can fulfil its role in ongoing Nato operations, but she conceded at the weekend that it cannot meet all its commitments to the alliance.

“With our airborne systems, we are currently below the target figures announced a year ago, defining what we would want to make available to Nato within 180 days in the case of an emergency,” she told Bild newspaper.

The equipment shortages have led to calls for increased German defence spending, but Mrs Merkel’s government remains reluctant.

Under a Nato agreement, members are supposed to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but Germany spends just 1.3 per cent, and further cuts are planned.

Ebola outbreak threatens 'decades' of British help to Sierra Leone, officials warn

The positive legacy of Britan's intervention in the Sierra Leone civil war could be lost if the deadly Ebola virus is not contained, UK officials say

Ebola is threatening to undo more than a decade of British-led efforts to rebuild Sierra Leone after its bloody civil war, diplomats warned on Tuesday.

Officials said unless urgent action is taken to stop the spread of virus in the next three months, the gains of around a billion pounds spent by Britain on aid programmes to Sierra Leone could be squandered.

In 2000, the civil war that had claimed the lives up to 300,000 people Sierra Leone was ended by a British intervention, when Tony Blair despatched a 1,000-strong troop force to stop rebels from the brutal Revolutionary United Front over-running the capital, Freetown.

Having ousted the RUF's thugs - whose trademark was hacking their victims' limbs off - Britain then trained a new army and police force and has since spent around £60m a year on development aid.

The Ebola outbreak, which has claimed 3,091 lives across west Africa, 605 of them in Sierra Leone, now threatens to destroy that work unless it is brought into check, one diplomat said. The official was speaking ahead of a major international conference on Ebola due to be hosted by the Foreign Office in London.

"The outbreak has the potential to undo decades of progress on development in both Sierra Leone and the wider region," he warned.

British aid workers and specialist army medical engineers are currently spearheading a £100m British aid package to Sierra Leone specifically to tackle Ebola. The aim is to build a series of Ebola treatment clinics with around 700 specialist treatment beds in total, on top of another 300 provided by the Sierra Leone government.

However, even that is not expected to be enough, and so the British program will also train up nurses and staff for more "basic" treatment centres for another 8,800 patients.

While the care in the more basic centres will be more rudimentary, officials said it is better that Ebola suffers get some care rather than none, and should be kept isolated in treatment centres rather than infecting other people in their communities.

The programme means that Britain is effectively the lead agency in dealing with the outbreak in Sierra Leone, a former colony. Around 400 NHS volunteers are also being trained to go to the country to help man the clinics.

British officials have also been analysing data which suggests that Ebola in Sierra Leone currently has an infection factor of 1.7 - meaning that every ten people infected will in turn pass it to another 17 people. Officials said they need to bring that ratio down to beneath the figure of 1.0, at which the point the number of new cases will start to diminish.

"Only by isolating 70 per cent of infected patients will we get ahead of the curve," said one.

While officials said that so far there had been no serious public order problems in Sierra Leone as a result of the outbreak, they fear that could change if the outbreak is not brought under control. A key risk to the aid programme is if the country's health system breaks down, meaning that routine immunisation programs for other diseases such as measles end up being compromised.

After years of war, Liberia's hopes of a new generation unscarred by trauma are under threat as children see their whole families taken by the virus

DISPATCH

LIKE MANY other children's homes in Liberia, the Hawa Massaquoi child care centre believes in the power of faith when comforting the troubled young souls in its care.

Outside, a hand-stencilled welcome sign quotes passages from the Bible, while inside, recently orphaned children are told that God is not unmerciful, but simply moves in mysterious ways.

For no one does that ring more true than the centre's latest arrivals, who have come straight from an Ebola treatment clinic in the nearby capital, Monrovia.

The 10 children, who all tested positive for the virus, managed to fight it off despite its 50 per cent-plus mortality rate. But it claimed the lives of nearly all their parents, and, in many cases, their siblings, uncles and aunts, and grandparents too.

"I tell them to put their faith in God, and that all is not lost," said Famata Dunoh, who runs the Unicef-supported centre with the help of four other women. "I tell them: 'Only God knows the reason why you survived Ebola and your parents did not'."

The centre, a spartan, single-storey building painted bright yellow, originally housed children orphaned or separated from their parents during Liberia's two successive civil wars, which raged between 1989 and 2003.

The conflicts killed anything up to 500,000 people, with children serving as combatants in the infamous "Small Boys Units" run by warlord Charles Taylor, now serving 50 years in a British jail for war crimes. Those warera children are now adults, and as peace has prevailed over the past decade, hopes have risen that a new generation will grow up unscarred by collective trauma.

But Ebola, which has already killed nearly 1,000 people in Liberia, now threatens that hope. For as Ms Dunoh watches the children playing from the home's veranda, she tells a string of harrowing individual stories that brought the youngsters into her care.

Nessie, 12, was taken to an Ebola clinic with her father and brother after her mother died from the virus. During their time in the clinic, her father did his best to comfort his daughter, but then collapsed and died in the lavatories one day, leaving Nessie to find his body. Her brother has suffered mental health problems as a result, and his whereabouts are unknown.

Another 12-year-old, Nancy Kpoto, has lost both parents and a grandfather, while another girl lost her stepmother, father, sister, brother and niece. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the children have blanked out the experience of the clinic, and remain generally taciturn.

But every now and again certain telltale details emerge. One girl, Ms Dunoh says, used to try to put tape and other coverings over her face, imitating the protective masks worn by nurses in the Ebola ward. Another boy, six, used to deny that his parents had died, saying they were still being treated in the hospital and would come to pick him up.

The truth emerged one day when he turned down a bowl of fufu, the west African porridge that was the last meal his mother ever ate. "We give him a bowl and he pushed it away and suddenly started crying," said Ms Dunoh. "He told us that it reminded him of his mother, and he did not want to eat it."

The scenes at the home highlight the growing concerns among aid agencies about the impact of Ebola on children in Liberia, the worstaffected of all the west African nations hit by the outbreak, which the World Health Organisation said this weekend had now claimed 3,000 lives.

While aid agencies point out that the worst-hit age group has been adults aged 20-45, those who are most likely to be travelling to and from infected areas, children suffer almost as much if they lose both parents.

They may also find it hard to rejoin their communities. Although anyone who fights off the virus is effectively immune, neighbours and extended family may put that down to witchcraft rather than good fortune, wondering how a child could survive an illness that claimed its parents.

Survivors also encounter lingering suspicions that they are still infectious, such as Hawa Karfa, who is in the children's home with her two offspring because the landlord of their rented home has refused to have them back. "He said I shouldn't come back because he thinks I still have Ebola, although our local pastor told him we weren't dangerous to anybody," she said. "Now we have no home to go to."

The aim of the centre is to eventually find permanent family homes for all its children. But with the sheer terror that the virus inspires, Unicef is trying to recruit more standin "grandmothers" like Ms Dunoh in the meantime.

"During previous virus outbreaks like HIV, extended families were able to help a lot when parents died, but because of the stigma and fear that there is with Ebola, people are often terrified of children who have been in an Ebola unit," said Sarah Crowe, a Unicef spokesman. "It has broken down that normal sense of human compassion, and people like Famata are really champions who show what can be done."

This weekend, one of Ms Dunoh's charges was preparing to leave the centre. Her mother, whom she thought had died, had in fact survived - a mix-up of a kind all too frequent in the current chaos.

For the remaining children, she continues to do her best to plug the gaps in their lives.

"I tell them that if I look the age of their mother, then to treat me as their mother," she said, smiling. "And if I look the age of their grandmother, then to treat me as their grandmother."

Ed was too scared to talk about the £100bn deficit

Ah! Ed Miliband "forgot" to talk about the UK's still gargantuan budget deficit at last week's Labour party conference. That explains it - he forgot! Phew! For a moment, I was worried.

There was I thinking the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition doesn't care about putting the UK's public finances back on the straight and narrow. I was concerned he was deliberately ignoring our budgetary predicament, kicking the acute fiscal problems we face even further into the long grass.

I even suspected that Miliband minor - who by electoral happenstance, namely the rise of Ukip, a split in the right and the collapse of Liberal Democrat support, could win the May 2015 general election on just a third of the vote - had failed to learn the lessons of the Gordon Brown era.

I'd got it into my head the man who could be Prime Minister in just seven months' time, was planning to be just as irresponsible in office as his former boss, the laughably named "Iron Chancellor", plunging our national accounts ever further into the red behind a façade of obfuscation, bluster and spin.

A ridiculous thought, I know. Silly me!

We've been asked to believe that Ed Miliband "forgot" to mention the budget deficit in front of his party faithful gathered in Manchester last week. I'm sorry but I just don't buy it. Sure, he stood up and spoke without notes for just over an hour. Any self-respecting member of a local amateur dramatics society can do that. Pretty much anyone who cares deeply about a significant subject - the future of your country, for instance, and why you're the person to run it - should be able to talk without notes for an hour. And, even without a script, you don't "forget" to include the most important part of your speech.

What you might do, if you're a cynical image-manager, someone who has spent your entire life at the apex of politics and thinks "ordinary people" are gullible fools, is deliberately leave a tricky passage out of your speech, given concerns about the reaction in the conference hall, then release the contentious omitted words later so they're still reported in the press.

"In the last four years, since we lost the last election, we've learnt hard, important lessons," Miliband was supposed to have told his party conference, according to the draft of the original speech sent to journalists after the event.

"These lessons start with government having to live within its means."

How would that have gone down in front of an audience full of trade unionists and public sector workers? Not well, to say the least. Given his dire personal ratings, the Labour party rank-and-file aren't too impressed with Miliband. Had he said that governments should live within their means, he might even have been heckled.

Most hard-core Labour party members, after all, certainly the conference go-ers, are hopelessly soggy Keynesians.

Fully signed-up to endless government spending, whatever the state of the public finances, they're the kind of activists who, back in the day, cheered wildly when spendaholic Gordon Brown, advised by Ed Miliband, shouted "we're putting the money back in as it's the right thing to do" and other such inane excuses for proper economic analysis.

Denis Healey was heckled remorselessly in 1976 when, as Chancellor, he told the Labour party conference the UK was in for "painful cuts". Labour Leader Neil Kinnock was similarly savaged from the conference floor in 1985, as he attacked the loony-left Militant Tendency splinter group within his party.

Both these speeches saw leading politicians advocating passionately, taking risks, telling self-interested people what they didn't want to hear. Both, in other words, displayed leadership - and, in doing so, changed the political weather. Healey's words, shot from the hip, helped Labour start the long journey away from absurd neo-Marxist nostrums towards relative modernity. And Kinnock's Bournemouth barn-stormer was, thankfully, the beginning of the end for Militant.

Miliband, in contrast, isn't a leader.

"There won't be money to spend after the election," he failed to tell his party conference. "So Labour's plan is based on a tough new approach," he almost said. "Eliminating the deficit as soon as possible in the next Parliament," was a pledge he didn't quite make to fellow delegates, not least as many of them would have booed. "Getting the national debt falling and no proposals for additional borrowing," were also words that weren't heard from the conference lectern, lest they cause offence, but confined instead to the sterile safety of the post-speech press release.

The UK's public finances are in a shocking state.

Between April and August, the underlying fiscal deficit was almost £2.6bn greater than the same period in 2013-14.

That's right, even though the economy is growing quite fast, we're on course to borrow more during this fiscal year than last.

Back in March, the independent Office of Budget Responsibility forecast real GDP growth of 2.7pc this year. A stoked-up housing market and rising consumer debt, as well as encouraging signs of higher private sector investment, generated a 3.2pc expansion of national income during the second quarter, with unemployment falling more than the OBR (and the Bank of England) expected.

Ordinarily, faster growth means more tax revenues and less benefit spending, strengthening the national accounts - as lately seen in the United States. The UK's public finances, though, are getting worse - in part because lower wages mean less income tax.

As a result, Britain is on course to chalk up another £100bn+ annual deficit in 2014/15, the sixth in a row. Even now, with interest rates at rock-bottom, and the market for sovereign debt effectively rigged by virtually money-printing, the British government is spending far more on debtinterest than on defence and almost the same as on education. The stock of debt we must service (the sum of the annual deficits) is meanwhile ever growing. And interest rates can only go up.

A real political leader would outline such ghastly realities to his party, preparing the ground for what will be some very tough years ahead. David Cameron should keep that in mind, as his party faithful gather in Birmingham today. For his leadership on the fiscal front has also been far from stellar. The UK's national debt, now over £1,400bn, has more than doubled since the Tories took office in 2010.

For all the talk of austerity, Chancellor George Osborne has borrowed more in five years than Brown did in ten.

The global economy hasn't yet properly recovered from the disastrous 2008 credit crunch. The World Trade Organization has just predicted total international commerce will grow by just 3.1pc this year, less than the 4.7pc previously expected and well below the 20-year average of 5.2pc.

Across the world, geo-political risks abound - from the ebola crisis to Russia-Ukraine and, increasingly, the Middle East. Stalling global growth, of course, undermines national public finances - particularly those of a trading nation like Britain.

The UK is heading for a budget deficit approaching a whopping 6pc of GDP - roughly where it was when Denis Healey was forced to go "cap in hand" to the International Monetary Fund in the mid-1970s. Voters know in their hearts that the UK has yet to really tackle its budgetary woes. The vast majority aren't stupid - which is why Miliband wanted his deficit words out there, even if he lacked the guts to put them to fellow Labour delegates.

The Tory leadership, in contrast, has a willing party but lacks the courage to act. Is it any wonder the public is losing faith in mainstream politicians? Follow Liam Halligan on Twitter @liamhalligan

Children whose families have been killed by outbreak of Ebola in West Africa have found themselves shunned through fear of the deadly disease

The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Friday that the number of deaths linked to an Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outbreak in West Africa has passed three-thousand.

The new tolls showed that there were more than 150 deaths in Liberia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] alone in just two days.

According to the WHO even the heavy toll in this outbreak – the largest ever – may be an underestimate.

Cases are going unrecorded because people are afraid to go to hospitals, or, worse, are turned away from them because they are overflowing[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11120144/Ebola-outbreak-On-the-frontline-of-the-fight-against-the-epidemic-in-Liberia.html].

Health workers are struggling to contain the outbreak in busy capital Monrovia, with its population of slightly under two million inhabitants.

One of the legacies of death toll is children whose families have been killed by Ebola often find they are longer welcome in their communities due to fear of the disease.

Unreported World: Surviving Ebola

Channel 4, 7.30PM

The new series returns with an upsetting look at the Ebola outbreak that is devastating Sierra Leone. "Ebola is the family destroyer," shouts a local nurse giving out leaflets in the street. It's a fact that becomes all too clear as reporter Shaunagh Connaire and crew spend two weeks in field hospitals and quarantine units, surrounded by the casualties of the virus, who are often heartbreaking young.

An NHS doctor says she is proud to be in the front–line fight against this devastating disease

Yesterday, it was announced that 400 staff working in the NHS have answered an appeal to travel to Sierra Leone to fight Ebola. I am one of them.

This outbreak, which started last December, has already claimed more than 2,600 lives. On Tuesday the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that the number of cases could reach hundreds of thousands by January. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US claim that, at worst, Ebola could become endemic in Africa, with 1.4 million cases by the start of 2015.

The urgency of the situation is why health professionals across the world are coming together to support communities in West Africa that are in desperate need of their knowledge and expertise. Britain is just a part of the international response to Ebola, but as a country we can be so proud of those who have stepped forward.

The UK appeal is being coordinated by Save the Children, the Departments for Health and International Development, and the charity UK–Med, which hosts the UK International Emergency Medical Response Register through which NHS workers are applying to volunteer. British Armed Forces are already in the country constructing an Ebola treatment unit. Those who have come forward are of all ages and skills: some will have been deployed abroad before; for many it will be the first time.

I am 34 and an emergency medical clinician. I work part–time at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and as a clinical lecturer in emergency response at the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester. I've been involved with humanitarian work for the past six years. I love the challenge it presents and the privilege of engaging with different communities.

When you decide to work in a disaster area it is hard on your loved ones. My mother and father are retired, and it is difficult for them, even if they understand my passion for such work. That said, if my personal situation changed and I was married or had children, things might be different.

We will be deployed over the coming months after extensive training in the UK and then in Sierra Leone when we arrive. Each volunteer will get a full personal protection suit: zipped up hood, goggles or face shield, mask, double gloves, an apron and covering for our boots. It will be very hot, and very demanding in the field.

Of course we will be apprehensive, and it is always a shock when you are first confronted with the devastation. The spread of the virus has been catastrophic and this week WHO revised its estimated mortality rate for Ebola from 50 per cent to 70 per cent – adding further to the fear that already grips communities where outbreaks occur.

We will be subjected to sights unlike anything we've encountered back home. Last year, I worked for two weeks in the Philippines as part of the relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan. Prior to that, I spent seven months in Sri Lanka working with Médecins Sans Frontières. I have learnt from those deployments how to develop a level of resilience to help manage things.

When I was in Sri Lanka I wrote a lot of emails to myself about my experiences. Writing, I found, is wonderfully cathartic. I haven't read them back but I might have a look before I go to West Africa to remind myself of the challenges I may be facing.

The other way of coping is to talk to those who have experienced the situation. One of the biggest challenges volunteers encounter is returning home and trying to explain to family and friends what they have seen and done. It will be vital to ensure there is effective debriefing for returning team members.

In West Africa we will be on the front line, but wellrehearsed in how to reduce the risk of transmission with strict clinical protocols in place. It is all about understanding the Ebola virus, the community infrastructure and the culture and context in which we are working and collaborating with local and international teams already on the ground.

There is a real passion among NHS staff to make a contribution. Those that aren't able to deploy abroad are covering shifts at home.

I take heart from the selflessness of William Pooley, the British nurse who recovered from Ebola, and who this week flew to the US to give blood to help save another doctor's life. Both of them contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone. It is hoped the antibodies in Mr Pooley's blood will help the American victim fight off the virus.

It is that kind of spirit that is uniting the international community in an effort to halt the spread of this terrible disease in West Africa. As volunteers, we will be doing everything we can to help.

The number of infections in western Africa's Ebola outbreak has reached almost 6,000, making it by far the worst in the history of the disease. Now experts estimate infections could quadruple to 21,000 by the end of October and reach a staggering 1.4m by January

This week marks six months since the World Health Organisation (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea.

The epidemic has now grown into the largest Ebola outbreak in history, with some 6,000 people currently sick with the virus across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal.

The virus has caused some 2,800 deaths, according to WHO, and health services and charities in the most affected countries are struggling to cope.

Scientists tracking the disease are increasingly convinced that the current epidemic has been growing exponentially for at least 16 weeks, with the number of new cases doubling every 20-30 days.

Nearly 1,000 new cases were reported in the week ending September 14 alone.

Scientists predicted in a WHO study this week that more than 20,000 people will be infected with Ebola by early November.

The WHO study echoed a “worst-case scenario” report from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. It estimated that cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rocket to 1.4 million by January - in a worst-case scenario based on data obtained before the world ramped up its response.

World leaders were due to attend a meeting in New York on Ebola convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday.

The meeting - part of the United Nations General Assembly - will hear from US President Barack Obama and world leaders are expected to pledge help for efforts to try to contain the spread of the virus.

Mr Obama, who is sending 3,000 troops to west Africa to help health workers battle the contagion, urged other countries on Wednesday to get behind a broader international effort.

"As we speak, America is deploying our doctors and scientists - supported by our military - to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments," Mr Obama told the 193-member assembly.

"But we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilise economies and move rapidly across borders."

Médecins Sans Frontières's Stefan Liljegren tells of the impossible choices and inhuman decisions he is forced to make everyday as the try to tackle the Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa

According to new figures released Monday, the UN health agency says more than 5,800 people are sick with Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11118025/I-have-never-seen-this-number-of-bodies-before-Life-at-an-Ebola-clinic-in-Liberia.html] in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. It is blamed for more than 2,800 deaths.

Liberia has been hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak sweeping West Africa.

Stefan Liljegren Field Coordinator at Médecins Sans Frontières in Liberia said: "This is by far the most difficult challenge that I have ever faced."

"Every day I have been faced with impossible choices and impossible decisions that are inhuman to make.

"Turning people, very very sick people, away at the get every day because we are full.

"It is indescribable to stand infront of someone and tell them that, when they are pleading and begging to come in."

The challenges facing the MSF clinic are in turn a snapshot of the wider outbreak now engulfing West Africa. On Tuesday, a World Health Organisation study warned that the number of Ebola cases could reach hundreds of thousands by January unless the aid operation was drastically increased.

Obama asks world to unite behind his mission to blitz Isil

BARACK Obama issued a rallying call for the world to unite behind the military campaign to destroy Islamic State's "network of death" yesterday as he seized the mantle of a wartime president from the podium of the United Nations.

Speaking to world leaders after a second night of US-led airstrikes against Isil positions in Syria and Iraq, the the Nobel Peace Prize winner outlined in dire terms the "generational" struggle to combat the "the cancer of violent extremism".

The US president later chaired an unusual session of the UN security council on foreign jihadists where the 15 member states unanimously adopted a resolution requiring all countries to pass laws to prosecute citizens who join terror groups or send them funds.

Mr Obama declared that the world stood at a crossroads between war and peace and spoke of the "pervasive unease" across the planet in the face of challenges ranging from the Ebola epidemic to Russian aggression in Ukraine. The president who came to office promising to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan laid out a wide-ranging plan for US leadership of a "broad coalition" in the Middle East to defeat Isil, a group that understood only "the language of force".

He directed much of his speech at the Islamic world as he urged political and religious leaders and individual Muslims to take on the extremists everywhere from the battlefield to social media.

"No God condones this terror," he said.

"No grievance justifies these actions.

There can be no reasoning - no negotiation - with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death." The president again signalled that the air strikes launched on Monday against Isil positions were the start of a long campaign to crush the terrorists. "Those who have joined Isil should leave the battlefield while they can," he warned. There would be no US troops occupying foreign lands, he pledged, but America would deploy its military might in the air and equip anti-Isil forces on the ground.

Mr Obama invoked the "notinmyname" Twitter campaign by young British Muslims, declaring that the group was "hiding behind a false Islam", as an example of how the Islamic community could also reject the ideology of extremism.

"It is time for the world - especially Muslim communities - to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of al-Qaeda and Isil," he said. "There should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they are Jewish, Christian or Muslim.

"This ideology will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed, confronted, and refuted in the light of day," he said.

He also delivered a thinly veiled message about terrorist funding to the same Gulf states, most notably Qatar, that were part of the US-led airstrikes on Syria barely a day earlier. "It's time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down," he declared.

Funding from Qataris has played a key role in financing Isil, seen by many Sunni Muslims as a force fighting the predominantly Shia government in Iraq and the Syrian regime, which is backed by Iran's Shia rulers.

Even as he spoke of the impending war to defeat Isil, he also insisted that only a political settlement could end a civil war that has claimed more than 200,000 lives. "There is no other way for this madness to end - whether one year from now or 10," he said.

Mr Obama struck a very different tone from his address to the UN general assembly a year ago, which he made just weeks after he abandoned his threat to attack the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons. "When it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them - there is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country," he said. "So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilisations." But while it was a strongly pro-American address, laying out the role of the US in leading the battle, he said the war had to be won by Muslims in the Middle East.

"Ultimately, the task of rejecting sectarianism and extremism is a generational task - a task for the people of the Middle East themselves," he said. "No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds."

Up to 30 patients are turned away from Liberia treatment centre every day

LIKE every other volunteer who serves with Medecins Sans Frontieres, Stefan Liljegren joined up to help the sick and destitute.

In 15 years with the agency, he has been everywhere from Afghanistan and Kosovo through to South Sudan and East Timor, the hard and often dangerous work compensated for by the knowledge that he is saving lives.

As field coordinator of MSF's new 160-bed Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, one of his tasks is to decide which of the sick people who arrive outside the clinic's gates should get treatment. Such is the scale of the outbreak that for every 20 to 30 new patients the clinic admits each day, the same number are often turned away — despite the likelihood that they will go home and infect their relations.

"This is by far the most difficult challenge that I have ever faced," the 44-yearold Swede said. "Every day I have been faced with impossible choices, and decisions that are inhuman to make. Having to tell someone that they can't come in when they are screaming and begging to do so is an indescribable feeling, especially when you know they may go back to families who might well then get sick themselves."

Outside the clinic an hour earlier, a grisly scene demonstrated Mr Liljegren's point. Resting face down in the mud, an arm crooked over his face, was the body of Dauda Konneh, 42. He had been lying there dead since daybreak.

"He was vomiting a lot and had symptoms like Ebola, so we put him in a pickup truck and took him here for treatment," said one young man outside. "When we got here last night, he was still alive, but the clinic would not accept him. He died at dawn today."

Having dead or dying patients outside the clinic overnight is "a regular occurrence," he says. Once night falls, the hospital does not admit anyone: handling Ebola patients would be too dangerous in the dark.

The task of removing Mr Konneh's body falls to Stephen Rowden, a volunteer from Danbury, Essex. "When I started it was maybe a body every two days, now it is daily and sometimes up to five a day," said Mr Rowden, 55. "I have never seen this amount of bodies before."

The clinic, one of three operating in Monrovia, has seen 350 deaths in the past month alone. Since all infected bodies have to be burned, the casualties have exceeded the capacity of Monrovia's crematorium. MSF has had to import an incinerator from Europe — normally used for livestock. For an aid agency that prides itself on triumphing in even the most dif-ficult circumstances, it is a depressing reminder of how far there is to go.

The challenges facing the MSF clinic are a snapshot of the wider outbreak engulfing West Africa. On Tuesday, a World Health Organisation study warned that the number of Ebola cases, currently topping 5,000, could reach hundreds of thousands by January unless the aid operation was drastically increased.

Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Liberia, where 40 per cent of the deaths have taken place, and where the government health service has been paralysed by Ebola infections among its own staff. In coming weeks, a 3,000-strong US military mission will arrive in Monrovia to build 17 more Ebola treatment clinics.

Inside the MSF clinic, those patients fortunate enough to get through the gates are admitted to rows of large white treatment tents. One patient, Foofee Sheriff, 54, tells how he became infected after attending the funeral of his brother. "We did not touch my brother's body during the burial, we used plastic bags on our hands to make sure that didn't happen."

There is no telling how many more desperate people may soon be pleading at the gates. "It gets worse by the day," Mr Liljegren said. "How much worse it will it get? I have no idea."

ÞPolice in Guinea last night arrested 27 suspects over the murders of an eightmember Ebola education team attacked by angry locals in an area at the epicentre of the outbreak.

The victims, said to include health offi-cials and journalists, were attacked during a visit in the town of Womey last week. Eight bodies were recovered from the septic tank of a primary school two days later, according to the government.

Ebola could become a 'permanent human feature', WHO warns

Projections for the spread of the deadly virus show that 1.4 million people across west Africa could be carrying the infection by 2015

The number of Ebola cases in west Africa could surpass 1.4 million by January and the disease could become endemic, scientists warned in two separate reports published on Tuesday.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that, unless “drastic improvements in control measures” were made, the number of cases - currently 5,800 – could nearly quadruple to 21,000 by the end of next month.

Christopher Dye, the head of strategy at the WHO and a co-author of the study, said: “We’ve rather modestly only extended the projections to Nov 2, but if you go to...Jan 2, you’re into hundreds of thousands.”

He said it was feared that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people this year in the deadliest outbreak in history, could become a “permanent feature of the human population”.

The epidemic might simply “rumble on as it has for the last few months for the next few years”, he added.

The research by the UN-funded agency also found that the death rate for the current outbreak may be higher than previously calculated – closer to 70 per cent instead of 55 per cent. So far Ebola has killed more than 2,800 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The WHO study echoed a “worst-case scenario” report from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. It warned that, without significant increases in international efforts to stem the spread of the virus, it could infect hundreds of thousands in the next three months, leaving 1.4 million sick by January.

The WHO also reported that the number of health workers killed by the disease had increased.

The agency said that as of Sept 22, a total of 348 health care workers were known to have developed Ebola and 186 of them had died. Half of the cases were in Liberia and 67 in Guinea, which along with Sierra Leone have been worst hit by the outbreak.

In Nigeria, 11 health workers have contracted the disease and five have died. In total, Nigeria has had eight Ebola deaths and 20 cases.

The warnings came as the first humanitarian representitives from Britain arrived in Sierra Leone to begin a £100 million aid mission.

More than 160 staff from the NHS have volunteered to join British teams travelling to the infection zone to try to help. They will be based at a new 62-bed treatment centre in the country.

Phillip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said: “This outbreak has wide-ranging humanitarian and security consequences for the region, and the world.

“Defeating this disease will need a global coalition, as well as innovative approaches to reducing the spread of the virus in communities.”

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said: “Britain’s plan will triple bed provision in the country, but we cannot do this alone. Sierra Leone needs urgent offers of support from foreign medical teams and international donors.”

Prof Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a member of the team that discovered Ebola in 1976, said the current outbreak was very different from the 24 others that had preceded it.

“It’s the first time that entire nations are involved and affected; it’s the first time that capital cities are involved with huge urban populations,” he said. “The result is that we have something that I think is a humanitarian crisis. It’s no longer a disease outbreak.”

Prof Piot described the coming together of decades of civil war, corrupt dictatorships, dysfunctional health systems and a slow initial response to the epidemic as a “perfect storm”.

President Barack Obama addresses the UN following US air strikes against Isil targets in Syria

• Battle against Isil: live coverage[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11117813/Battle-against-Islamic-State-live.html]

• US air strikes: Q&A [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11116542/QandA-US-air-strikes-in-Syria.html]

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: we come together at a crossroads between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope.

Around the globe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of World War that existed at the founding of this institution has been lifted; the prospect of war between major powers reduced. The ranks of member states has more than tripled, and more people live under governments they elected. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been freed from the prison of poverty, with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis of our lives.

Today, whether you live in downtown New York or in my grandmother’s village more than two hundred miles from Nairobi, you can hold in your hand more information than the world’s greatest libraries. Together, we have learned how to cure disease, and harness the power of the wind and sun. The very existence of this institution is a unique achievement – the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully, and solve their problems together. I often tell young people in the United States that this is the best time in human history to be born, for you are more likely than ever before to be literate, to be healthy, and to be free to pursue your dreams.

And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world – a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers, and made it difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we gather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public health systems in West Africa, and threatens to move rapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe recalls the days when large nations trampled small ones in pursuit of territorial ambition. The brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the heart of darkness.

Each of these problems demands urgent attention. But they are also symptoms of a broader problem – the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world. We have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries. Too often, we have failed to enforce international norms when it’s inconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism, and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe.

Fellow delegates, we come together as United Nations with a choice to make. We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our collective responsibility to confront global problems, or be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. For America, the choice is clear. We choose hope over fear. We see the future not as something out of our control, but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort. We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs; we choose to work for the world as it should be, as our children deserve it to be.

There is much that must be done to meet the tests of this moment. But today I’d like to focus on two defining questions at the root of many of our challenges– whether the nations here today will be able to renew the purpose of the UN’s founding; and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism.

First, all of us – big nations and small – must meet our responsibility to observe and enforce international norms.

We are here because others realized that we gain more from cooperation than conquest. One hundred years ago, a World War claimed the lives of many millions, proving that with the terrible power of modern weaponry, the cause of empire leads to the graveyard. It would take another World War to roll back the forces of fascism and racial supremacy, and form this United Nations to ensure that no nation can subjugate its neighbors and claim their territory.

Russia’s actions in Ukraine challenge this post-war order. Here are the facts. After the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and calls for reform, their corrupt President fled. Against the will of the government in Kiev, Crimea was annexed. Russia poured arms into Eastern Ukraine, fueling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed thousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from areas that these proxies controlled, they refused to allow access to the crash for days. When Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory, Russia gave up the pretense of merely supporting the separatists, and moved troops across the border.

This is a vision of the world in which might makes right – a world in which one nation’s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed. America stands for something different. We believe that right makes might – that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones; that people should be able to choose their own future.

These are simple truths, but they must be defended. America and our allies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. We will reinforce our NATO allies, and uphold our commitment to collective defense. We will impose a cost on Russia for aggression, and counter falsehoods with the truth. We call upon others to join us on the right side of history – for while small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and peoples to make their own decisions.

Moreover, a different path is available – the path of diplomacy and peace and the ideals this institution is designed to uphold. The recent cease-fire agreement in Ukraine offers an opening to achieve that objective. If Russia takes that path – a path that for stretches of the post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the Russian people – then we will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia’s role in addressing common challenges. That’s what the United States and Russia have been able to do in past years – from reducing our nuclear stockpiles to meet our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to cooperating to remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons. And that’s the kind of cooperation we are prepared to pursue again—if Russia changes course.

This speaks to a central question of our global age: whether we will solve our problems together, in a spirit of mutual interests and mutual respect, or whether we descend into destructive rivalries of the past. When nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress. And I stand before you today committed to investing American strength in working with nations to address the problems we face in the 21st century.

As we speak, America is deploying our doctors and scientists – supported by our military – to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders. It’s easy to see this as a distant problem – until it isn’t. That is why we will continue mobilizing other countries to join us in making concrete commitments to fight this outbreak, and enhance global health security for the long-term.

America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them. This can only happen if Iran takes this historic opportunity. My message to Iran’s leaders and people is simple: do not let this opportunity pass. We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful.

America is and will continue to be a Pacific power, promoting peace, stability, and the free flow of commerce among nations. But we will insist that all nations abide by the rules of the road, and resolve their territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with international law. That’s how the Asia-Pacific has grown. And that’s the only way to protect this progress going forward.

America is committed to a development agenda that eradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part – to help people feed themselves; power their economies; and care for their sick. If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity

America is pursuing ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions, and we have increased our investments in clean energy. We will do our part, and help developing nations to do theirs. But we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power. That’s how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren.

On issue after issue, we cannot rely on a rule-book written for a different century. If we lift our eyes beyond our borders – if we think globally and act cooperatively – we can shape the course of this century as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age. But as we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail such progress: and that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world.

Of course, terrorism is not new. Speaking before this Assembly, President Kennedy put it well: “Terror is not a new weapon,” he said. “Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail, either by persuasion or example.” In the 20th century, terror was used by all manner of groups who failed to come to power through public support. But in this century, we have faced a more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have perverted one of the world’s great religions. With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels – killing as many innocent civilians as possible; and employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities.

I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Rather, we have waged a focused campaign against al Qaeda and its associated forces – taking out their leaders, and denying them the safe-havens they rely upon. At the same time, we have reaffirmed that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. Islam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them – there is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country.

So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything, and therefore peddle only fanaticism and hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that humanity’s future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along fault lines of tribe or sect; race or religion.

This is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics, and the trends that fuel their recruitment. Moreover, this campaign against extremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. For while we have methodically degraded core al Qaeda and supported a transition to a sovereign Afghan government, extremist ideology has shifted to other places – particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, where a quarter of young people have no job; food and water could grow scarce; corruption is rampant; and sectarian conflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.

As an international community, we must meet this challenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist group known as ISIL must be degraded, and ultimately destroyed.

This group has terrorized all who they come across in Iraq and Syria. Mothers, sisters and daughters have been subjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children have been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped in mass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to death. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent human beings have been beheaded, with videos of the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the world.

No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning – no negotiation – with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.

In this effort, we do not act alone. Nor do we intend to send U.S. troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back ISIL. We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. Already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build – not those who destroy.

Second, it is time for the world – especially Muslim communities – to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of al Qaeda and ISIL.

It is the task of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern, multicultural world. No children – anywhere – should be educated to hate other people. There should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they are Jewish, Christian or Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source: the corruption of young minds by violent ideology.

That means cutting off the funding that fuels this hate. It’s time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down.

That means contesting the space that terrorists occupy – including the Internet and social media. Their propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad to fight their wars, and turned students into suicide bombers. We must offer an alternative vision.

That means bringing people of different faiths together. All religions have been attacked by extremists from within at some point, and all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the value at the heart of all religion: do unto thy neighbor as you would have done unto you.

The ideology of ISIL or al Qaeda or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed, confronted, and refuted in the light of day. Look at the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies – Sheikh bin Bayyah described its purpose: “We must declare war on war, so the outcome will be peace upon peace.” Look at the young British Muslims, who responded to terrorist propaganda by starting the “notinmyname” campaign, declaring – “ISIS is hiding behind a false Islam.” Look at the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together in the Central African Republic to reject violence – listen to the Imam who said, “Politics try to divide the religious in our country, but religion shouldn’t be a cause of hate, war, or strife.”

Later today, the Security Council will adopt a resolution that underscores the responsibility of states to counter violent extremism. But resolutions must be followed by tangible commitments, so we’re accountable when we fall short. Next year, we should all be prepared to announce the concrete steps that we have taken to counter extremist ideologies – by getting intolerance out of schools, stopping radicalization before it spreads, and promoting institutions and programs that build new bridges of understanding.

Third, we must address the cycle of conflict – especially sectarian conflict – that creates the conditions that terrorists prey upon.

There is nothing new about wars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of vicious sectarian conflict. Today, it is violence within Muslim communities that has become the source of so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle East. And it is time that political, civic and religious leaders reject sectarian strife. Let’s be clear: this is a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in Syria has already killed nearly 200,000 people and displaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to plunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists who inevitably export this violence.

Yet, we also see signs that this tide could be reversed – a new, inclusive government in Baghdad; a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed by his neighbors; Lebanese factions rejecting those who try to provoke war. These steps must be followed by a broader truce. Nowhere is this more necessary than Syria. Together with our partners, America is training and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a counterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality of the Assad regime. But the only lasting solution to Syria’s civil war is political – an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity or creed.

Cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass. But there is no other way for this madness to end – whether one year from now or ten. Indeed, it’s time for a broader negotiation in which major powers address their differences directly, honestly, and peacefully across the table from one another, rather than through gun-wielding proxies. I can promise you America will remain engaged in the region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort.

My fourth and final point is a simple one: the countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people – especially the youth.

Here I’d like to speak directly to young people across the Muslim world. You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder. Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it.

You have demonstrated that when young people have the tools to succeed –good schools; education in math and science; an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship – then societies will flourish. So America will partner with those who promote that vision.

Where women are full participants in a country’s politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed. That’s why we support the participation of women in parliaments and in peace processes; in schools and the economy.

If young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a state, or the lure of an extremist underground – no counter-terrorism strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish – where people can express their views, and organize peacefully for a better life – then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.

Such positive change need not come at the expense of tradition and faith. We see this in Iraq, where a young man started a library for his peers. “We link Iraq’s heritage to their hearts,” he said, and “give them a reason to stay.” We see it in Tunisia, where secular and Islamist parties worked together through a political process to produce a new constitution. We see it in Senegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong, democratic government. We see it in Malaysia, where vibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony into the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in Indonesia, where what began as a violent transition has evolved into a genuine democracy.

Ultimately, the task of rejecting sectarianism and extremism is a generational task – a task for the people of the Middle East themselves. No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds. But America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe-havens, nor act as an occupying power. Instead, we will take action against threats to our security – and our allies – while building an architecture of counter-terrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift up those who counter extremist ideology, and seek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand our programs to support entrepreneurship, civil society, education and youth – because, ultimately, these investments are the best antidote to violence.

Leadership will also be necessary to address the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears, America will never give up the pursuit of peace. The situation in Iraq, Syria and Libya should cure anyone of the illusion that this conflict is the main source of problems in the region; for far too long, it has been used in part as a way to distract people from problems at home. And the violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace. But let’s be clear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from this effort – not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, or the lives of so many Palestinian children are taken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we will stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, the region, and the world will be more just with two states living side by side, in peace and security.

This is what America is prepared to do – taking action against immediate threats, while pursuing a world in which the need for such action is diminished. The United States will never shy away from defending our interests, but nor will we shrink from the promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights – the notion that peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of a better life.

I realize that America’s critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals; that America has plenty of problems within our own borders. This is true. In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions. And like every country, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity with the traditions that we hold dear.

But we welcome the scrutiny of the world – because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems and make our union more perfect. America is not the same as it was 100 years ago, 50 years ago, or even a decade ago. Because we fight for our ideals, and are willing to criticize ourselves when we fall short. Because we hold our leaders accountable, and insist on a free press and independent judiciary. Because we address our differences in the open space of democracy – with respect for the rule of law; with a place for people of every race and religion; and with an unyielding belief in the ability of individual men and women to change their communities and countries for the better.

After nearly six years as President, I believe that this promise can help light the world. Because I’ve seen a longing for positive change – for peace and freedom and opportunity – in the eyes of young people I’ve met around the globe. They remind me that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what God you pray to, or who you love, there is something fundamental that we all share. Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the UN and America’s role in it, once asked, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places,” she said, “close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works.”

The people of the world look to us, here, to be as decent, as dignified, and as courageous as they are in their daily lives. And at this crossroads, I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come. Join us in this common mission, for today’s children and tomorrow’s.

Ebola survivor to give blood plasma

The British nurse Will Pooley, who contracted Ebola while working in Africa, has agreed to donate blood plasma to treat victims, officials have said, as fears were raised that the epidemic might never end.

Blood plasma contains antibodies that fight disease and has been injected into Ebola victims before. Experts said the experimental treatment is their number one hope of a drug to treat the disease.

It comes as 164 NHS workers have volunteered to travel to West Africa to help fight the epidemic, which the World Health Organisation says could affect 20,000 people by November. The volunteers came forward after the Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, and other medical leaders appealed last week for NHS staff to help.

The outbreak is already the biggest recorded. Experts said the virus is adapting to humans and the greatest fear is that the epidemic never dies out and low levels of cases continue. In this scenario the disease could spread outside Africa, they said.

The World Health Organisation has revised the mortality rate from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. There have been almost 3,000 deaths since the outbreak began nine months ago.

Up to 150 new cases of Ebola have been discovered in Sierra Leone as the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history continues to ravage west Africa.

The county's controversial "lockdown", in which most of its six million population were confined to their homes for 72 hours from Friday, isolated the infected and uncovered 70 bodies previously unaccounted for. As many as 30,000 volunteers went from door to door over the weekend to educate residents on preventing the spread of the epidemic.

NHS leaders have written to staff to ask them to volunteer to treat Ebola victims in Africa

Medical leaders have appealed for NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics to volunteer to treat Ebola victims in Sierra Leone.

A letter signed by the four most senior NHS medical officers directly asks for volunteers to staff a new hospital.

British military experts working alongside charities are setting up a 12-bed unit to treat infected healthcare workers and an additional 50 bed unit for ordinary citizens infected with the deadly virus.

The letter signed by chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, Prof Paul Cosford, medical director at Public Health England and Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer said: "Roles that may be required include medical practitioners, nursing staff, paramedics, pharmacists, psychologists, health information managers,logisticians and outreach managers. Examples of the roles required can be found on the UK-Med website.

"Initial help is requested from those with previous experience but we anticipate that as the situation develops, those with generic skills will be welcomed.

"Please do consider volunteering."

It set out requirements and how to organise leave with their respective organisations at home.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest ever recorded with at least 5335 cases recorded and 2622 deaths.

Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.

Ebola concerns 'harming safari bookings'

A safari company is reporting a large decrease in business due to holidaymakers’ concern about Ebola – despite the negligible impact of the virus in safari areas

The Netherlands-based firm Safari Bookings said more than 500 tour operators were questioned about the effect of the outbreak on bookings, and more than half claimed their bookings were down[http://www.safaribookings.com/blog/180#survey-results] by between 20 to 70 per cent.

It said the impact of the Ebola crisis[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] was more noticeable on business in East Africa than in southern Africa – although bookings would also have been affected by worries about security, particularly in Kenya, following a series of terrorist attacks in the region.

“It is a heavy blow for the industry and the numerous wildlife reserves that rely on its revenue,” a company spokesman said.

The Ebola outbreak has been concentrated in parts of Western Africa – well away from the safari strongholds of Eastern and southern Africa.

In a recent safari web chat[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/11104617/Live-webchat-Holidays-in-Africa.html] Brian Jackman, the veteran of almost 100 safaris and a long-standing Telegraph Travel writer, said: “Don’t be put off by Ebola. If somebody sneezes in Senegal you don’t catch a cold in Nairobi. So put aside your worries. Just get on the plane and enjoy the safari holiday of a lifetime.”

Peter Felix of Africa Travel concurred, advising a reader that it was “worth bearing in mind the fact that London is closer to the centre of the Ebola outbreak than Cape Town.”

Chris McIntyre of Expert Africa, said he did not believe overall bookings had been impacted significantly by concerns over Ebola. He did say, however, that his company had a few enquiries from worried would-be holidaymakers.

“Often it’s those without the best geographical knowledge of what’s where,” he said. “I have heard had one reliable anecdote about a Brazilian tour group cancelling a tour to Namibia due to their concerns.”

“There’s a lot of irrationality regarding Ebola, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s factoring into long-term bookings.”

So far, no confirmed cases of the disease from the recent outbreak have been confirmed in countries known for safaris.

However, back in 2012, Uganda suffered from hundreds of cancellations[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/9446413/Ebola-outbreak-sees-tourists-cancel-holidays-to-Uganda.html] following an outbreak in the west of the country.

The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to three African nations – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – except for people involved in the response to the Ebola outbreak. It also stresses that the risk of infection to the general public remained “very low”.

Health officials battling the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone discovered 92 bodies and at least 56 cases in house–to–house calls made during a nationwide lockdown that was due to end last night.

Most of the country's six million people were confined to their homes for a third straight day yesterday, with only essential workers such as health professionals and security forces exempt.

The outbreak has killed more than 2,600 people in the country and neighbouring Liberia and Guinea this year.

The World Health Organisation has warned that Liberia faces a sharp rise in new cases over the next few weeks.

In Madrid, officials said a plane was being dispatched to fly a Roman Catholic missionary infected with Ebola home to Spain from Sierra Leone.

God help us: a day on duty with Liberia's doctors fighting Ebola

Liberia's exhausted doctors are struggling to cope with the number of Ebola cases, which has far outstripped the capacity of the country's war-ravaged health service

Nearly half the patients admitted to Liberia's JFK Ebola clinic in Monrovia die. A grim statistic by normal clinic standards, it is considerably better than the 70-90 per cent rates reported at the start of the outbreak, thanks to more people coming forward in the early stages of symptoms.

While treatment is simply a matter of keeping patients fed and hydrated in the hope that they fight the virus off, clinics like this are overwhelmed by demand. In this 35-bed facility, doctors are currently treating 69 people. Half of them are on the floor.

"There isn't even adequate corridor space for us to walk between them. But if we turn them back into the community, they will infect other people," says Dr J Soka Moses, the hospital's clinical director.

Of the 2,200 Ebola deaths across West Africa so far, 40 per cent have been in Liberia. Aid agencies warn that up to 20,000 West Africans could have the virus by the end of the year.

On Tuesday, Washington announced it would be sending 3,000 US troops to Liberia in coming weeks to boost the medical effort.

The Ebola prayer that goes unanswered

Doctors and nurses face the constant risk of infection in a desperate attempt to halt the disease's spread across Liberia

In time-honoured hospital tradition, the mid-morning ward round at Liberia's JFK Ebola clinic begins with doctors and nurses gathered in a neat semi-circle. The purpose of the huddle, however, is not to compare medical notes but to sing a loud chorus of prayer - firstly for their patients, and then for themselves.

"Treating Ebola patients is very risky as we can become infected ourselves," said Thelma Kane, 36, the ward hygienist, standing alongside her colleagues in protective uniform of boiler suit, masks, and gloves. "So before we go into the ward, we sing a prayer to ask the Lord to follow us in our work."

Right now, though, the prayers of JFK's medical choir seem to go unanswered. Not only do nearly half their patients die, they are also completely overwhelmed by the number of cases, which has far outstripped the capacity of Liberia's war-ravaged health service.

"We cannot cope, the demand is huge," said Dr J Soka Moses, 34, the hospital's clinical director, who opened the facility just a month ago in what used to be a cholera treatment centre. He points through a gauze-covered window to the clinic's "high risk" treatment area, where feverish, vomiting patients can be seen occupying not just the beds, but most of the floor space in between.

"This place was constructed for 35 beds, but right now I have 69 patients, so half of them are on the floor," he said. "There isn't even adequate corridor space for us to walk between them. But if we turn them back into the community, they will infect other people."

Nonetheless, on busy days, that still happens - just as it does at the handful of other Ebola treatment clinics across Liberia, which has had 40 per cent of the 2,200 Ebola deaths across West Africa so far. At the Medicins Sans Frontier clinic, on the other side of the capital, Monrovia, staff were last week turning away between 20 and 30 people a day. Doing so seldom goes down well, as Dr Moses has seen for himself. Last weekend, relatives of a man who died while waiting for treatment outside JFK hurled rocks at staff when they came out to spray disinfectant on his corpse.

It is scenes like this, on top of aid agency warnings that up to 20,000 West Africans could have the virus by the end of the year, that prompted last Tuesday's announcement by Washington that 3,000 US troops will be heading to Liberia in coming weeks to boost the medical effort. It is the biggest US ground operation in Africa since the ill-fated "Black Hawk Down" mission to Somalia in 1993, when US troops sent to deal with a famine ended up tangling with local warlords. And while Liberia's own notorious strongmen are now long gone - ex-president Charles Taylor is serving a 50-year war crimes sentence in a British jail - some fear similar trouble should US troops become a lightning rod for public anger over the lack of help so far.

Last week, in neighbouring Guinea, that frustration turned deadly for the first time, when eight Ebola health education workers were murdered by a club-wielding mob in a remote village. Feelings had been running high in the area after rumours that other medical workers had contaminated people with the virus.

The risk for medical workers, however, is not just from angry mobs. Last Wednesday, a French volunteer working at MSF's clinic in Monrovia tested positive for Ebola, the first time any international staff member in the agency has caught the virus. It is proof that that even the most stringent precautions can never eliminate the risk. And it is that exact scenario that goes through the minds of Dr Moses and his team as they don their protective gear, which consists of multiple layers of boiler suits, aprons and overtrousers, with four separate pairs of gloves alone.

Simply robing up takes around 20 minutes. But the Russian doll-style layering makes it safer when undressing again, when a doctor is most likely to be accidentally contaminated by touching clothes smeared with bodily fluids from the ward.

"So far none our staff have been infected, although we have occasionally had patients develop neurological symptoms and become combative, requiring sedation," said Dr Moses, whose fondness for medical terminology does not perhaps convey quite how frightening such incidents must be. "It is very dangerous, it is scary," he conceded. "But if I don't do it, who else will?"

While Dr Moses' work has had a certain personal cost - as a "high risk" worker, he is not allowed to cuddle his two children when he comes home - he is proud of his ward's track record so far. Its 43 per cent mortality sounds grim by normal clinic standards, but is considerably better than the 70-90 per cent rates reported at the start of the outbreak. While treatment is simply a matter of keeping patients fed and hydrated in the hope that they fight the virus off, survival rates have improved because more people are coming forward in the early stages of symptoms.

Nonetheless, by the time Dr Moses' mid-morning rounds are over, another five patients and their families are waiting in the pouring monsoon rain outside the clinic's green metal gates. Among them is 15-year-old Faje Kan, who lies convulsing on the muddy ground, mucus streaming down her face. Her elder brother, Kiwai, holds her head and shoulders upright, wearing two carrier bags as makeshift plastic gloves.

"She was very sick overnight so we brought her here this morning," he says. "We got her two hours ago but we could not get in because the place was packed." Another man, Lee Sac, whose pregnant wife is lying semi-conscious, complains angrily that "The Liberian health system has failed us."

When Dr Moses comes out to try to help, an ugly mood turns uglier. "I know you are angry but we are doing the best we possibly can," he says through his mask, as the crowd gather round. "I have created five extra beds, please be patient."

The five sick people, including a silent ten-year-old boy, are then carried in, the hospital medics spraying them first with disinfectant. But for one woman outside, Dr Moses' appearance brings only bad news. A shriek of grief goes up as she learns that her husband, Vani Wana, brought into the clinic two days before, has died. And no amount of bereavement training can help Dr Moses for what he has to say next. Which is to remind Mrs Wana, gently but firmly, that she too must now consider herself at risk of being infected.

"I am sorry for your loss," he says. "Get tested now, then go to your house and keep away from other people. If you start feeling sick, come back here."

Why our love of zombie films just won't die

After over 80 years, there's still plenty of life in the zombie genre, as celebrated in a new book

What is it with the undead? While other monsters come and go, the zombie never seems to go out of style, exploding into the Hollywood mainstream every few years but otherwise lumbering on in B-movies, constantly mutating to reflect our latest fears and anxieties.

As a child my son was obsessed with Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, an animated film in which the annoying dog and his friends investigate zombie pirates. A decade on, he puts in long hours shooting zombies on his PlayStation (it’s guilt-free murder, he says – they’re dead already). On TV he loves the BBC3 teen zombie series In the Flesh, where prejudice against the partially deceased becomes a clunky metaphor for intolerance in general, or the hugely popular US series The Walking Dead.

So what is their enduring appeal? In his entertaining new book Zombies on Film[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zombies-Film-Definitive-Undead-Cinema/dp/0789327392], Ozzy Inguanzo traces the history of the zombie from its film debut in the 1932 melodrama White Zombie[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023694/] . Set in Haiti, it was inspired by William Seabrook[http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=William+Buehler+Seabrook&search-alias=books-uk&text=William+Buehler+Seabrook&sort=relevancerank] ’s 1929 travelogue The Magic Island, which featured lurid descriptions of supposed voodoo practices. The film was a huge hit, and over the years the formula has proved to be a flexible one: we’ve had Nazi zombies, biker zombies, blaxploitation zombies, dancing zombies (in Michael Jackson’s groundbreaking 1983 Thriller video), Japanese schoolgirl zombies.

The permutations are endless, because in the end zombies are just like us. Only dead.

They can be funny, too, as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost proved in 2004’s Shaun of the Dead, or Jessie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson in 2009’s equally funny Zombieland. And even loving, in the unlikely 2013 human/zombie rom-com, Warm Bodies.

The big advantage the undead have over their competitor monsters is that they’re cheap: no expensive costumes, prosthetics or computer effects are needed, and no star names – just a lot of extras in non-speaking roles, making them attractive to innovative directors with little money to spend but a lot of imagination.

It was George A Romero who saved the zombie from B-movie hell with his 1968 film Night of the Living Dead, in which for the first time the recently deceased return with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, as well as some subtle social commentary.

In 1981 Sam Raimi breathed new life into the undead – and the whole horror genre ­– with his low-budget indie splatter-fest The Evil Dead[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead] (1981), while in 2002 Danny Boyle made them a potent way of examining our fears about infection in the wake of Aids, Ebola and ever more potent flu strains in 28 Days Later. (I Am Legend and World War Z continued this theme, with bigger budgets and far less subtlety.)

In computer games, zombies have been a staple since 1994, when the Japanese developer Capcom invented the ‘survival horror’ genre with the hugely popular Resident Evil, which spawned an equally successful film franchise. Paul SW Anderson is due to start shooting the sixth, and possibly final, chapter this month.

It seems our appetite for zombies – and theirs for us – will never decay. As the poster for Night of the Living Dead proclaimed, ‘They won’t stay dead!’

Zombies on Film[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zombies-Film-Definitive-Undead-Cinema/dp/0789327392] , £25, is published by Rizzoli

SCOTLAND: VICTORY FOR UNIONISTS ...

Alex Salmond's hopes for an independent Scotland were at an end by Friday morning, as a record turnout delivered a clear victory for the No campaign, with 55.4 per cent opposing independence. That afternoon Salmond announced he would resign as Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader, saying: "For Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die."

... AND WOMEN GOLFERS

Change was afoot elsewhere in Scotland, as the Royal and Ancient golf club voted to admit women members, breaking with 260 years of tradition. Previously women had been allowed to play on the Old Course at St Andews but were barred from the clubhouse. The principal of St Andrews University, Louise Richardson, had been among those denied entry, even though new principals are normally automatically asked to join.

US TO THE RESCUE IN EBOLA CRISIS

President Barack Obama pledged that America would take the lead in the fight against Ebola, which has already claimed the lives of more than 2,400 people. Maj Gen Darryl Williams, commander of the US Army Africa, arrived in Liberia to supervise the arrival of additional supplies and health care workers, in an effort called Operation United Assistance.

1. FINE MAY DRAW A LINE

GlaxoSmithKline investors will be hoping a line can be drawn under bribery scandals after a ruling in China last week brought an end to the investigation running for more than a year now. The company's shares have been under a cloud since allegations emerged on July 11 last year that bribes had been paid to doctors and hospitals in China to buy GSK drugs. Last week, China fined GSK a record Rmb300bn (£297m) and handed executive Mark Reilly, the former head of GSK's China operations, a suspended prison sentence. The shares responded by rising 1pc to £14.52 on Friday.

2. PAINFUL BUT MANAGEABLE

The fine is manageable. The Chinese business represents about 3pc of GSK's forecast full-year revenue of £23.7bn and the fine itself is about 5pc of the forecast full-year pre-tax profits of £5.9bn for the year ended December 2014. More importantly, the shares should be able to stage a recovery now that the uncertainty has been removed. GSK's shares are still about 13pc below the price they were before the allegations came to light last year. The shares have under-performed the wider FTSE 100 and the pharmaceutical sector during the past 14 months.

3. US AND UK NOW IN FOCUS

The bigger problem would be if the bribery was found to be widespread and authorities in the UK and US get involved, which could result in more fines and GSK being barred from supplying governments. There are some mitigating factors for GSK. The US and the UK have double jeopardy rules, so GSK cannot be fined for the same offence twice. Western governments also desperately need the new drugs that GSK is developing - particularly for Ebola - and a heavy fine could seriously delay their release. Fines would also ultimately lead to job losses.

4. SHARES LOOK CHEAP

At £14.49, GSK shares are looking cheap as they have underperformed the FTSE 100 index by more than 20pc and the wider pharmaceutical sector by more than 30pc during the past 14 months. Market consensus is for full-year earnings per share of 94.8p, rising to 100p, meaning the shares are trading on 15.3 times forecast earnings, falling to 14 times next year. That looks cheap when compared to the wider FTSE 350 pharma sector trading on 22 times. GSK isn't out of the woods yet but the Chinese penalty goes a long way to clearing the air. Buy.

Share price Mar June Apr May July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Close £14.49 2013 2014 1700 1600 1500 1300 1400 1800p February 5 Annual results with full-year revenue flat at £26.5bn and pre-tax profits up 1pc to £6.65bn April 22 Agrees sale of cancer-drug business to Novartis for $16bn (£10bn) July 23 Profit warning as pre-tax profits fall 23pc to £986m year-on-year in second quarter GLAXOSMITHKLINE: BUY

FRIDAY 26 SEPTEMBER

Strictly Come Dancing

BBC ONE, 9.00PM

After the reassuringly good launch show three weekends ago (when a celebrity line up that looked shabby on paper turned out to be more promising in the flesh), it is at last time to discover what the intervening 21 days of training with their professional partners has done for our wannabe dancing stars. Speaking of wannabes, arch rival The X Factor is looking like a sulky teenager by bringing its bootcamp edition forward to the same time slot, just for the sake of sticking up two fingers. But enough of such silliness. The big question is which of Strictly's 15 hopefuls will strike us as having the legs, grace, charm and untapped terpsichorean talent to win the glitterball this year, and who will look doomed to crash, burn and take a quickstep out of the competition.

Judging by their displays of creaky dad dancing in the launch show, Gregg Wallace and Tim Wonnacott have got to be the likeliest for an early bath, while tennis mum Judy Murray and Mrs Brown's missus Jennifer Gibney look like they could be competing for who can deliver most foot faults. As ever, there will be no public vote or elimination this weekend, to allow the celebrities to find their feet dancing in public, although the judges' votes will count towards next week's elimination. Expect pop princesses Pixie Lott and Frankie Bridge, singer Simon Webbe and former Scottish rugby international Thom Evans to be the least concerned about that at this stage. Continues tomorrow.

Three–day lockdown begins in Sierra Leone to halt spread of Ebola

HEALTH chiefs in Sierra Leone ordered the entire population to stay indoors yesterday as they began a three–day "lockdown" to try to bring the country's Ebola outbreak into check.

Fearful that many of those infected are choosing to hide in their homes rather than report for treatment, 30,000 volunteer health workers began a door–to–door education campaign aimed at visiting every home.

The controversial programme, backed by security forces, confines the country's six million residents to their homes until midnight tomorrow. Although the volunteers are not instructed to enter people's homes, they are expected to call the emergency services if they suspect anyone is harbouring an Ebola sufferer.

Aid agencies have clashed over the effectiveness of the scheme, with Médecins Sans Frontières saying it risks antagonising the public, who are already angry at the health authorities' slow response to the outbreak.

But UNICEF, the UN children's agency, which is funding most of the £1million operation, said it would reinforce messages about how to avoid getting Ebola. "We have been sending life saving messages through radio, TV and print, but it's not enough," said Roeland Monasch, Unicef's local representative. "We need to take information to where people are."

Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, who launched the campaign in a televised address to the nation, said: "These are extraordinary times and extraordinary times require extraordinary measures."

There is mounting public pressure to tackle the Ebola epidemic, which has now killed more than 2,600 across west Africa — 550 of them in Sierra Leone.

In neighbouring Liberia yesterday, US military aircraft brought the first members of a team that will supervise the 3,000–strong military force pledged by President Barack Obama this week to help build 17 extra Ebola clinics across Liberia, the worst–hit nation so far.

Germany and France yesterday agreed a joint airlift to send aid supplies to affected countries, while Britain is funding the construction of a treatment clinic in Sierra Leone.

Distrust of medical staff, who have sometimes been accused of spreading the virus themselves, remains a major problem throughout the region.

On Tuesday, eight health education workers were found dead in a village in Guinea.

Despite the warnings that the programme could backfire, the first day of Sierra Leone's lockdown appeared to go relatively smoothly, with the bustling capital, Freetown, becoming a ghost town overnight.

Houses visited by the health workers were given a sticker to display, as well as detergents and information leaflets.

"Everyone seems to be complying and this is very good," said Francis Munu, a Freetown police chief.

Steven Gaojia, who is coordinating the shutdown, said that 258 extra beds had been set up in makeshift treatment centres across Freetown in anticipation of the discovery of dead bodies and new cases in people's homes.

"So far the most frequently asked questions to our team have been about stigmatisation and untested drugs," added Francis Coker, a health volunteer. "It shows that people are aching for a cure."

Belting out Rule Britannia with gusto, Londoners at BBC's Proms in the Park made their feelings on Scottish Independence clear

Rule Britannia was not sung at the BBC Proms in the Park in Glasgow on Saturday night. Nothing new or politically significant about that (it hasn't been performed there since 2008.) Down in Hyde Park, however, it was belted out with such gusto, and at such volume, they could probably hear it in Sauchiehall Street anyway.

Were those of us attending the London Proms[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/proms/] trying to send a message to our Scottish cousins? With just five days to go until they vote on whether to give our 300-year relationship another chance or separate forever[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/], it certainly felt like that. The general mood was captured by a placard pleading, "Don't Leave Us This Way!" No need to specify who was about to walk out on whom.

The rumoured nationalist protests didn't happen, but Thursday's referendum hung in the air like the pewter clouds that frowned over London. BBC presenters may have been told to avoid politics[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11090894/BBC-tells-Proms-stars-not-to-mention-the-Scottish-referendum.html] and stick to the music, but no such ban operated on members of the audience. Total strangers talked of nothing else. A Scotsman from Essex said he thought the No campaign could still come through, "but think of what a bad loser Salmond's gonna be. He's a spiteful wee sod."

In the VIP hospitality bar, feelings seemed to be hardening as well-oiled patriots bristled at the thought of rejection. One marketing man spoke for many: "If the Scots vote to go it alone, we're not giving them another bloody penny," he barked, That's It!"

Clearly, if the Yes campaign did prevail, this was not going to be an amicable divorce. Alex Salmond was about as popular as Ebola.

And then something happened. On the big screen beaming pictures live from the Royal Albert Hall, we saw conductor Sakari Oramo take off his tails to reveal a Union Jack waistcoat. Help! Was this not a clear instance of institutional bias? Fear not, the maestro spun around to reveal what looked remarkably like a Saltire on the back. Talk about a balanced view. (It was, in fact, the distinctly similar flag of his Finnish homeland.)

The patriotic singalong part began. Were flags waved with a little more fervour than usual, because we knew that this might be the last Last Night of the Proms before the Union Jack lost the Jocks and became just a Jack? Undoubtedly. I got so emotional that Himself called me Nigella Farage.

Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, and on Saturday night songs that are commonly disdained as crude and jingoistic were suffused with genuine feeling. No one could sing "Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set" without thinking, with sorrow, of the opposite: shrinking bounds and impending loss.

This was not some lament by ten thousand Little Englanders yearning for a land of hope and glory; it was a real and present grief, a final rallying cry, for an island nation which could soon dissolve and be no more.

How many of those belting out Rule Britannia, as if their lives depended on it, knew that the words were written by a Scot? In the early 18th century, James Thomson hoped the song would embody a spirit of Britishness. Of course, it can be silly and excessive, even eccentric, but as the last night for Great Britain loomed, we sang it defiantly. It wasn't defying an enemy and vowing to defend our national border; on the contrary, it was saying there is no border, and asking a friend to please stay.

They must have heard us, but whether they listen to us is, of course, up to them. And them alone.

Eight killed as villagers attack Ebola aid team

EIGHT bodies, including those of three journalists, have been found after an attack on a team trying to educate villagers on the risks of the Ebola virus in a remote area of south–eastern Guinea.

"The eight bodies were found in the village latrine. Three had their throats slit," a government spokesman said.

Mohamed Said Fofana, Guinea's prime minister, earlier said six people were arrested following the incident, which took place on Tuesday in Wome, a village close to the town of Nzerekore, where Ebola was first identified in March.

The virus has killed some 2,630 people and infected at least 5,357 people, according to the World Health Organization, mostly in Guinea, neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Authorities in the region are faced with widespread fears, misinformation and stigma among residents of the affected countries, complicating efforts to contain the highly contagious disease.

I can rise from my ordeals and pain, says Hollande

THE beleaguered French president, François Hollande, has spoken of his "ordeals and pain" following the publication of his former girlfriend's kiss–and–tell memoirs, but vowed to see out his term in office despite sinking approval ratings.

In a rare press conference aimed at restoring the nation's flagging faith in his presidency, Mr Hollande yesterday defended his record and insisted his government was up to the challenge of lifting France out of economic crisis, reducing unemployment and cutting the deficit.

It was only towards the end of the two–hour televised session that he was forced to respond to a question about the bestselling book by his spurned former girlfriend, the journalist Valérie Trierweiler.

The book portrays him as a cold–hearted, power–obsessed hypocrite who pretends to dislike the rich but in reality despises the poor and derides them as "toothless", an enormously damaging accusation for a socialist.

Most reporters observed the long–standing French taboo on prying into the private lives of politicians, instead posing questions about the economy and foreign policy. However, a freelance journalist eventually asked him if the book had discredited his presidency.

Mr Hollande gave the briefest of replies: "I have already expressed myself on this subject and I have already said what I felt about my ordeals and pain. I will give you no further response."

He then moved swiftly back on to foreign affairs, sending a clear signal to the press corps that he wanted no more questions about Ms Trierweiler's book. It was a tactic that Mr Hollande employed effectively at his last press conference in January, when he refused to answer the few journalists who dared to ask him about revelations of his liaison with a younger actress, Julie Gayet, which led him to end his relationship with Ms Trierweiler.

By contrast, the president was expansive yesterday on a wide range of topics, including Iraq, the Ebola crisis, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Ukraine and the threat to security in Europe.

With his approval ratings at a record low of 13 per cent amid rising unemployment and economic stagnation, Mr Hollande acknowledged that "France is asking questions about its future in a climate of deep distrust." However, he urged voters to suspend judgment on his presidency until the end of his five–year term in 2017.

Conceding that the results of his policies were "slow in coming", he claimed: "Today we have all the conditions to succeed." Asked about rumours of rivalry with his more popular, pro–business prime minister, Manuel Valls, whom he was forced to appoint in an attempt to restore confidence in his government, he said he had "chosen him for his loyalty".

"I am not a candidate, I am president," Mr Hollande declared. "I will be president right to the end."

He added that he would exercise his democratic mandate "fully, completely" and that he did not need to take opinion polls into account.

Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to announce on Sunday his candidacy for the leadership of the opposition UMP party.

There was a real grief at the prospective loss of Scotland, a final rallying cry for an island nation that could be no more, among the Proms audience in Hyde Park

Scottish independence: referendum results - live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11106839/Scottish-independence-referendum-results-live.html]

I don’t think I’ve ever knowingly waved a flag in my life. Perhaps a Welsh dragon when I was a mixed infant in white ankle socks and Charles had his investiture as Prince of Wales. I’ve draped some flags as bunting at a school fête, but that was just decoration. Like most Britons, I get embarrassed by noisy displays of patriotism. So, at Saturday night’s Proms in the Park, I was surprised, to say the least, to find myself waving a mini Union flag like a loony in time to Land of Hope and Glory. So enthusiastically that Himself protested: “Ye gods, woman, you’ve turned into Nigella Farage!”

He was wrong. What I felt that evening – what the vast Proms audience in Hyde Park felt, I reckon – was the very opposite of being a Little Englander. It was a strange, shape-shifting melancholy summed up by a placard in the crowd that pleaded: “Don’t leave us this way!”

No need to specify who was leaving whom. It was a still night in London with not a whisper of wind, but thousands of small flags were blown to and fro on gusts of patriotic feeling. Very rarely are we asked to think about something as big and amorphous as love of country. Something that will change textbooks and loyalties, even the very name of our nation. Here was such a moment. Could this really be the very last Last Night of the Proms before the Union Jack lost the Jocks and became just a Jack?

Incredibly, it could. By Friday morning, we will know if Scotland is with us. Are we still the greatest small island on Earth, a precious stone set in a silver sea, or just another European land mass; different countries with separate agendas? On Tuesday night, Alex Salmond airily told David Dimbleby that an independent Scotland would not be “a foreign country”. What else will it be, you great lummox?

At London’s Proms in the Park, Salmond was slightly less popular than Ebola. A Scotsman from Essex told me he hoped that the No campaign could still come through, “but think what a bad loser Alex Salmond’s gonna be. He’s a spiteful wee sod”.

Certainly, Lewis Carroll’s “slithy tove” could have been coined with the sleekly complacent Scottish First Minister in mind. Slithy Salmond assured Dimbleby that an independent Scotland would be “the best of pals” with the people it had just left, to be known as “rest of the UK (rUK)”.

Hang on a minute. R u OK with being called rUK, dear reader? Do you want to be mates with Scots who think they can dump us and still keep our pound, our Queen, our TV and radio and probably our granny’s false teeth? Me neither.

“People beyond doubt want to see that shared currency arrangement,” Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon told Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 on Wednesday. It became clear that Sturgeon’s definition of “people” is Scots who agree with her.

Salmond, Sturgeon and their ilk dinnae give a flying Scotsman what other “people” want. People like the seven in 10 non-Scots who said that we would like Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. A 300-year-old bond that, outrageously – and, say some international lawyers, illegally – could be severed without our consent. London is the third biggest “Scottish” city, with almost half a million resident Scots. They didn’t get a vote, while overseas students at Scottish universities did. Surely someone’s human rights were being violated?

At the hospitality bar at Proms in the Park, well-oiled Britons from all regions bristled at the prospect of rejection. “If the Scots vote to go it alone, we’re not giving them another bloody penny,” barked one man, “that’s it!”

Salmond and his unmerry men have underestimated the backlash they will face, no matter whether Yes or No wins. Wales is aggrieved about the Barnett formula, which gives Scots more money per capita than any other area of the UK. The English have had it up to here with self-righteous Jocks jabbering about the paradise of social justice they have created – paid for by their evil oppressors in the Home Counties.

One thing has changed for good: the rest of Britain will no longer stand for being excluded from decisions about our future. We must demand a referendum on whether an independent Scotland can keep the pound – our pound, which uses our Bank of England as guarantor. Good luck to Scotland if it wants to be Salmond’s Socialist Republic of Sozzled Softies, but it’s not having our capitalist safety net to rescue its banks and pay its debts. Nor, if they remain within the Union, are Scots getting special devolved privileges and extra cash denied to everyone else in the country.

So what was I doing waving my Union Jack on Saturday night and belting out Rule Britannia with 10,000 others? We were all, I think, trying to send a message to our cousins in the Far North. Lyrics usually disdained as crude and jingoistic were suffused with genuine feeling. No one could sing “wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set” without thinking of the opposite: impending loss.

This was not some lament by Little Englanders; it was a real grief, a final rallying cry for an island nation, “Mother of the Free”, that could be no more. As the last night for Great Britain loomed, we sang defiantly – not defying an enemy and vowing to defend our border. We were defying Salmond – asking an old friend to stay with us.

It’s strange, you know, but until that moment, I didn’t know how much I loved my country. I hope that Scotland heard us.

The Strain, episode one, review: 'authentically eerie'

Guillermo del Toro's new vampire horror was a pitch-perfect blend of gore, black humour and tension, says Rebecca Hawkes

In The Strain, the new vampire series from Pacific Rim director Guillermo del Toro, death came to New York via a passenger plane: a particularly unsettling plot device for contemporary audiences. In an early scene, we saw the landed plane sitting on the runway, ice cold, with no visible movement within. Inside, in one of the most authentically eerie images to hit TV screens for some time, everyone on board appeared to be a corpse.

From the outset, it was clear that the horror on offer was going to be the visceral kind, with vampirism taking the form of a plague, spread by white, thread-like worms. The unlikely hero wasn’t a cop, or even an everyday Joe, but a workaholic epidemiologist, Ephraim Goodweather, played by Corey Stoll (in an unfortunately distracting wig).

Given the recent Ebola outbreak, global epidemics feel like a plausible threat right now, so at times the horror in The Strain, which made its UK TV debut with a double episode, felt uncomfortably close to home.

Luckily the show had a streak of tongue-in-cheek humour running through it which stopped things getting too dark. In one scene an unlucky pathologist, conducting autopsies to the strains of Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline, was confronted by a troop of risen, half-dissected corpses. It was a pitch-perfect blend of gore, black humour and genuine tension.

The script neatly sustained the pace across the two episodes. But, among all high-polish expected from a big-budget US show, there were glimpses of the Spanish horror films for which del Toro first became famous, particularly Cronos and The Devil’s Backbone.

Bearded Holocaust survivor Abraham Setrakian, played by the sublimely talented Brit David Bradley ( Game of Thrones[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/], Broadchurch[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10011343/Broadchurch-final-episode-review.html] ), ran a New York pawn shop. Amid the yellowing, abandoned junk, he unveiled a still- beating heart, imprisoned in a jar, and fed it with drops of blood. It was a strange, oddly tender scene: a reminder that, at his best, del Toro has the gift of making horror beautiful, as well as stomach-turning.

One could be forgiven for thinking that vampires are on their way out: from True Blood to The Vampire Diaries, it feels like a genre that’s been done to death. But the vampires in The Strain are markedly different: more animal-like, feral, and frightening. Rather than killing with a seductive kiss, they employ an Alien-style extra mouth.

Earlier this year, before the show aired, del Toro claimed he wanted to make vampires frightening again. Judging by the first two episodes, he’s succeeded.

Ebola Briton's blood mission to help friend in America

Nurse who survived virus hopes his antibodies will save US aid worker who has been infected

THE British nurse who survived Ebola has flown to America in the hope of saving the life of a close friend who has been struck down by the virus.

William Pooley, 29, will give blood for an emergency transfusion to help the friend, understood to be a doctor who worked with him at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

Mr Pooley was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London only two weeks ago after fighting off the illness. Doctors at the isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, believe Mr Pooley can help his friend as his blood carries antibodies for the virus, and they are the same blood type.

The ill aid worker, who is the fourth American to contract Ebola, arrived at the hospital eight days ago from Sierra Leone.

The Foreign Office helped Mr Pooley obtain a new passport after his previous one was burned along with his other belongings on his return from Africa, where he contracted the virus. His mother, Jackie, 66, from Eyke, Suffolk, said: "We are very proud of him."

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "Following a request from his family, the FCO Consular Team and the UK Passport Office worked together to get a replacement passport to Will Pooley within 24 hours.

"This enabled him to fly out to the US immediately and potentially assist with the treatment of an Ebola victim." More than 2,500 people have died from Ebola in recent months and almost 4,700 people have been infected, making it the largest outbreak in history.

As part of their treatment, patients are given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and antibiotics to bolster their immune systems. The blood of survivors contains natural antibodies that can protect against Ebola. When transferred to another patient, doctors say, the sufferer appears to benefit from the boost to their immune system.

The aid worker arrived at the hospital eight days ago on a specially equipped plane from Sierra Leone.

Meanwhile, an NHS worker yesterday became the first person to be injected with a potential vaccine for the Ebola virus. Ruth Atkins, an NHS communications manager from Marcham, Oxfordshire, was injected with the experimental drug as part of a trial carried out at the University of Oxford.

She is the first of 60 healthy volunteers to take part in the trial of the vaccine, which targets the "Zaire species" of the virus.

Developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline, it uses a benign Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response.

The World Bank said yesterday that the outbreak could drain billions of dollars from economies in West Africa by the end of next year if it is not contained.

The global development lender predicted that slow containment of the virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone could lead to broader regional contagion, particularly through tourism and trade.

Under the worst–case scenario, Guinea's economic growth could be reduced by 2.3 percentage points next year, Sierra Leone's by 8.9 percentage points and Liberia's would be hardest hit, with a reduction of 11.7 percentage points.

Ruth Atkins becomes the first volunteer to be injected with a potentially life-saving new vaccine that scientists hope will tackle Ebola

A British woman has been the first person in the world to receive a potential new vaccine for the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] virus.

Ruth Atkins volunteered to get the trial underway, which will see 60 people take part in an experiment conducted by the University of Oxford.

She said: "I heard it all on the radio. It made me think this is really sad what's going on out in West Africa and I thought what can I do? I can't go out there and work or anything, so when they were saying about the vaccine I thought well I can help - my little bit of helping would be to participate in the vaccine trial."

Professor Adrian Hill, who is leading the trial, said: "this is a remarkable vaccine trial. Just about a month ago we had no idea that this vaccine existed or was going to be available for clinical testing.

"We've done over 100 vaccine trials in this centre in Oxford and typically if we got started in 6 months we'd do very well. But this time it's all happened in 4 weeks."

Co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and British drug company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the vaccine targets the "Zaire species" of Ebola which is one of the strains circulating in West Africa[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/] .

The experiment is being conducted to determine whether the vaccine is safe and to discover what immune response is produced.

America to deploy 3,000 troops in West Africa to tackle spread of Ebola

AMERICA announced yesterday that it would send 3,000 troops to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which President Barack Obama called "a potential threat to global security".

Following criticism by aid agencies that the international response has been "lethally inadequate", Washington said it would dispatch the soldiers to Liberia, the worst affected of the countries hit by Ebola. The mission, led by a US general, is the biggest American deployment to Africa since the ill–fated humanitarian mission to Somalia in 1993.

It will help provide logistical support to a country whose health service has effectively been destroyed by the outbreak, with hundreds of doctors and health workers infected.

One of the mission's priorities will be building 17 100–bed health care facilities; another will be training 500 new health workers a week to help deal with infected patients.

Mr Obama said: "If the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us."

The President called on private philanthropists, aid organisations and other countries to join the cause and "deliver on what they pledge quickly".

The United Nations has warned that up to 20,000 people across West Africa could be infected by Ebola by the end of the year, with some aid agencies predicting the figure could be twice that.

Aid agencies have warned that the scale of the outbreak in Liberia is threatening the stability of the country, which was formed by freed American slaves in the 19th century and wrecked by civil war between 1989 and 2003.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, the main agency operating specialist Ebola treatment clinics in Liberia, said that up to 30 patients per day are being turned away due to lack of beds at its new facility in the capital, Monrovia, raising the risk of them infecting other people.

Many Liberian hospitals have closed because of the number of health workers infected, leaving the country's four million people with no emergency medical help. Anger among Liberians at the lack of response has led to health workers being attacked by mobs. In a report released yesterday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that $987.8million (£600million) was needed to contain the outbreak, which has claimed 2,461 lives. The report added that $23.8 million (£14.1billion) was needed simply to buy body bags and pay the burial teams who collect victims' bodies, which remain highly infectious after death. "This health crisis we're facing is unparalleled in modern times," said Bruce Aylward, assistant director general of the WHO.

The Ultratravel 2014 Silent Auction is raising funds for youth-led development agency Restless Development. Find out about the luxury holidays on offer, and how to bid for them

When I was invited to speak at the Ultratravel 100 awards in London, I was thrilled. Not only was the event a wonderful celebration of travel, but it also gave me a chance to talk about an exciting international development agency that this year will benefit from the awards’ annual silent auction, in which we hope you will bid.

Restless Development, [http://restlessdevelopment.org/] one of the most incredible global development agencies to emerge in recent times, is unlike any other organisation because it is led entirely by young people on the ground. It specialises in training young people in all sorts of fields so they can first help themselves, and then use their skills to transform their communities. The work they do changes not just a few lives, but that of hundreds of thousands of children and young people around the world.

Whether leading post-conflict development in my home country of Sierra Leone, tackling HIV in Zambia or training thousands of unemployed young people in Uganda so they can find work, Restless Development creates opportunities for young people so they can create change. In the past 28 years these young people have developed into a network of 17,000 young adults, who have reached out and helped more than seven million children and youths in Africa and Asia. Growing up in Sierra Leone, I have seen the good that they do first-hand. When I was a child, the country was being devastated by conflict. For 10 years my family had to run and take shelter wherever we could.

When, finally, in 2002, one of the most vicious wars that Africa has ever seen came to an end, I was 16. Only then could I at last believe that things might be a bit more “normal”: that I wouldn’t have to sleep under my bed every night, or at bus stops, as I did during the times we had to keep moving for fear of being killed.

While many charities failed to listen to young people, Restless Development did, working with us and empowering us to lead the peace process and the development of our own country. Together we have created extraordinary change. Today, though, we are up against yet another challenge. The country is dealing with something we’ve never had to face before: the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Restless Development is being called on to support the communities that have been affected, and lead the response to try and stem this terrible disease. At the moment our work is not only life-changing but life-saving.

You can help to raise funds for our work by bidding for a holiday. So please bid generously. Thanks and good luck.”

John Sankoh speaks at the awards

• Leading phone companies to warn of higher phone bills post independence

19.00 We will wrap it there for today - thanks for following us.

18.50 The Guardian [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/12/guardian-view-scottish-independence] joins the FT and the Scotsman against independence.

In Britain, in Europe and even in the world as a whole, we are indeed better together not better apart. Nationalism is not the answer to social injustice. For that fundamental reason, we urge Scots to vote no to independence next week. But voting no cannot be a vote against change, and there is now at last the real hope that it can be a vote for reform and decentralisation in Britain. The Scots have laid down a challenge to everyone in these islands, and even to Europe too. Better together, yes. But we must all, together, be part of a better future.

18.30 An historic mistake... a new Great Depression...

Deutsche Bank, the global investment bank, has issued the starkest warning yet about the risks of separation.

Everyone has the right to self determination and to exercise his or her democratic rights. But there are times when fundamental political decisions have negative consequences far beyond what voters and politicians could have imagined. We feel that we are the threshold of one such moment. A "Yes" vote for Scottish independence on Thursday would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill's decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US. These decisions – well-intentioned as they were – contributed to years of depression and suffering and could have been avoided had alternative decisions been taken.

Chief economist David Folkerts-Landau warns of euro-zone style recessions, tax hikes and interest rates increases; loss of foreign investment; mass asset flight; austerity; and loss of the defence and security provided by the Atlantic Aliance.

He concludes: "Most importantly, the world as it is evolving in the 21st century is a highly uncertain place with unstable geopolitics and a stressed economic and financial outlook. Why anyone would want to exit a successful economic and political union with a G-5 country - a union which another part of Europe so desperately seeks to emulate - to go it alone for the benefit of... what, exactly, is incomprehensible to this author."

Is Scotland listening?

17.47: Vince Cable, the Business Secretary has called on businesses to speak out against Scottish Independence

He told LBC radio he had spoken with a series of big British businesses to encourage them to make any concerns public.

17.42: Chinese government has expressed its hope for "stability" in the UK economy

Matthew Holehouse, Political Correspondent, has this report from the joint press conference between George Osborne and Finance minister Zhu Guangyao.

Mr Zhu said the referendum was a "domestic affair" for the UK, However in an apparent boost for the No campaign in the independence referendum asked by reporters after a press conference in London, he said stability was crucial for economic growth.

Asked about his government's view on independence, he said: "This is a domestic affair of the UK.

"For foreign investors we look forward to a stable investment environment, a sound investment environment.

"It is the very basis to attracting foreign investment.

"Based on our own experience, we are deeply aware that a country's stability is crucial for a country's economic growth.

"That's why I am always of the view that stability and development are closely related."

In June, Chinese premier Li Keqiang expressed his desire to see a "strong, prosperous and united United Kingdom".

Stood alongside David Cameron after talks in Westminster, he said: "I believe that the United Kingdom can stay at the forefront in leading the world's growth and development and also continue to play an important and even bigger role for regional stability and global peace."

But he added: "We certainly respect the choice you make."

17.30: 'Moronic' David Cameron should have offered devomax question in referendum, says Nigel Farage

Christopher Hope, Senior Political Correspondent is in Glasgow with Mr Farage as we speak. He reports:

David Cameron was "moronic" not to allow Scots to vote for more powers rather than just full independence in next week's referendum, Nigel Farage has said.

The UK Independence Party leader made the remarks at Glasgow airport shortly after he landed on a delayed flight from Luton, ahead of a pro-Union rally in Glasgow tonight.

Speaking to The Telegraph at the airport, he said he was "pleased to be here" despite fears the presence of such a proudly English politician could help the Yes campaign.

He said: "It was absolutely moromic not to give the devomax option. Between Cameron and Miliband they have now risked the Union.

"I think economic pragmatism will now come into play and the lack of a lender of last resort means there is no bluff from the Bank of England and there is no bluff from the banks."

Mr Farage declined offers to wear a tartan flat cap or take a bottle of Irn Bru from a well-wisher.

But he said he wanted to inject some passion into the pro-Union campaign.

16.55: Big name politicians are all over the news but it backroom generals across the campaigns are working 24/7 to swing the neck and neck campaign

Ben Riley-Smith, Political Correspondent, profiles the four men busy behind the scenes of the yes and no campaigns [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11092707/Scottish-independence-Meet-four-back-room-generals-fighting-to-swing-the-vote.html] .

16.50: Better Together have released a letter signed by 200 Scottish NHS professionals saying the Scottish NHS will be better protected within the Union

It reads: “We love our NHS and believe that working for it, as we all do or have done, is both a privilege and an act of service to our fellow citizens. We are living through tough financial times and can ill afford the additional cuts that would surely come should Scotland choose the risk of independence ahead of the broad shoulders of the UK.”

16.30: The Chancellor has also responded to Alex Salmond's accusations the Treasury broke ministerial rules by briefing about RBS

Mr Osborne said: "We talk to companies all the time. We talked to business all the time... The Cabinet Secretary has dismissed this suggestion there is there is anything wrong about this. People should focus on the fact that Alex Salmond does not want to talk about the big economic questions. He does not want to talk about the big economic risks.

He added that international investors and Britain's biggest businesses expressing their concerns "will focus attention on the economic risks of seperation".

16.24: George Osborne has said he pulling out of the G20 over because of concerns over the "permanent consequences" of a possible yes vote

Matthew Holehouse, Political Correspondent is at the speech in London, he reports:

The Chancellor said it was "important given the econmic risks of one particular outcome of that referendum" he remain in the UK for the result.

He said: "The Governor of the bank of England has confirmed that there are contingency arrangements in place at the Bank.

"From my own perspective, I have taken the decision that I won't go to the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Australia next week. It's important given the economic risks of one particular outcome of that referendum that I am here in the UK and the Governor of the BOE has independently come to the same conclusion."

Asked if it was panic on No side and an indication of how bad the market reaction Mr Osborne added: " It's a very big decision with permanent consequences. I've taken a personal decision is sensible for me to be in here in the UK.

He added: "It is sensible given we have got this referendum. They don't come round every month. It's a very big moment for our country."

16.04 Alex Salmond is challenging Sir Jeremy Heywood's view the Treasury did not break any code over RBS story

The first minister has issued the following statement:

The head of the UK civil service has confirmed that the Treasury did indeed release sensitive information regarding RBS to the media in advance of any formal announcement.

That is an extraordinary development which merits an urgent and thorough investigation, given that it appears to be a clear and serious breach of both financial market rules and pre-referendum guidelines. We need to know which minister or official authorised the release of this information, the timing of that release and to which outlets.

This is further evidence of the lengths to which the Westminster establishment are going to in an effort to spread scare stories about business activity in Scotland following a Yes vote next week.

That includes the reports that the Prime Minister met with supermarket bosses in Downing Street yesterday to try and persuade them to comment on their price structure in Scotland – again, an extraordinary revelation given the strict controls on retailers’ pricing.

Westminster’s scare tactics are being exposed one by one – the people of Scotland are seeing straight through them, and will not be cowed or bullied, as they continue to move towards a Yes vote in huge numbers.

15.34: Big businesses have been warned to expect a "day of reckoning" if Scots vote for independence

Jim Sillars, who shared a campaign platform with the First Minister two days ago, accused large companies who have spoken out against separation this week of attempting to “subvert” the referendum through “lies and distortions”.

Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor, has more here. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11091801/Big-business-warned-of-day-of-reckoning-if-Scots-vote-Yes.html]

14.54: Chair of pub chain of J D Whetherspoon says no reason why drinks prices should go up in an independent Scotland

Tim Martin says that possible price rises highlighted by leading British retailers such as John Lewis and Asda are "greatly exaggerated". Instead he says that businesses should stop talking "nonsense" as most will just work within new regulations.

He added: “I think there’s been a massive amount of nonsense talked, especially by businessmen, about Scottish independence,” he said.

“There’s no reason why Scotland shouldn’t thrive as an independent economy if that’s what the Scots want.

“New Zealand has the same population, Switzerland does very well and Singapore with half the population is an economic miracle. There’s no reason a small country can’t thrive.”

14.36: George Osborne will not be going to the meeting of G20 finance ministers next week because he needs to be in the UK for referendum results

Treasury sources confirm that he will not attend that meeting in Australia. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, is going but returns in time to be back at the Bank of England to deal with any possible fall out prompted by a yes vote.

It is understood it is simply logistically impossible for Mr Osborne to get the meeting in time if he leaves after all the results are declared on Friday.

14.32: Dame Vera Lynn, the Forces Sweetheart, has made some touching comments on why the Union is better together

The 97-year-old backed calls [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11090879/Dame-Vera-Lynn-urges-UK-to-stay-together.html] for the Last Night of the Proms to celebrate the United Kingdom’s “musical heritage”, and that the best way of Britain continuing to share a culture life is to “stay together”.

Dame Vera, who is beloved for her efforts to raise troops’ spirits during the Second World War, is best known for her songs We’ll Meet Again, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square and The White Cliffs of Dover.

She told the Telegraph: “The best way of sharing our cultural lives is to stay together. “We learn so much about each other, I see no reason why we should not continue to do so.

“As you know Rule Britannia was written by a Scot! This concert is a wonderful opportunity to share our musical heritage.”

14.10: There has been some backlash against the Yes campaign's planned "short walk to freedom" march to the polls

Ben Riley-Smith reports, Scottish Political Reporter has this from Edinburgh:

Pro-independence campaigners are facing a backlash over "grossly distasteful" posters organising "short walk to freedom" marches on polling day.

Adverts urging Nationalists to "be Bravehearts" on September 18 and quoting Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln have recently appeared in south Edinburgh.

The tagline echoes Mr Mandela's famous "long walk to freedom" after spending years incarcerated in prison before South Africa's first democratic elections after apartheid.

The adverts appear to be produced by a local branch of the official Yes Scotland campaign, but a spokesman from the nationwide HQ said he was not aware of the events.

Kezia Dugdale, Labour MSP for Lothians, where the posters appeared, told The Telegraph that posters were "offensive" and organisers should "rethink" the plans.

"The poster compares Scotland's democratic debate with Mandela's march for freedom. Now I find that distasteful and offensive, but other people might find that intimidating," Ms Dugdale said.

"I just think it's an appalling comparison and it does a huge disservice to everybody who fought against apartheid.

"To suggest that there are parallels between what happened in South Africa with what's happening in Edinburgh today is just grossly distasteful."

13.51: Yes have welcomed "hugely encouraging" poll, despite it giving a very slight lead to the no camp

"This is a hugely encouraging poll for Yes - the highest in a regular ICM referendum poll so far. It shows that the barrage of intimidation from the No campaign isn’t working - David Cameron’s co-ordination from Downing Street of big business to talk down Scotland has been met with a giant raspberry, particularly among Labour voters."

Yes, he added, were now "in touching distance" of success next Thursday and there is "everything to play for".

"The referendum is on a knife edge, and this will spur on everybody who wants and is working hard for a Yes to redouble their efforts."

13.25: What would a Union Jack look like without Scotland? Would we lose the blue and of the diagonal white?

The Telegraph's Claire Duffin reports:

The public should be consulted on a new design for the Union flag in the event of Scotland gaining independence, the chief executive of the Flag Institute has said.

Charles Ashburner said he believed a new flag should be created to represent the United Kingdom if there was a ‘yes’ vote on Thursday.

The Institute surveyed its members and found that 64.5 per cent believed the flag should change if Scotland becomes independent, while 71.5 per cent said a new flag should acknowledge Wales, which is not currently represented because it was part of the English kingdom when the Union Flag was designed.

The institute also invited its members and members of the public to submit new designs.

They include a Union Flag in which the blue of Scotland is removed and replaced with black, and the white bands changed to yellow in honour of the yellow flag of St David, the patron saint of Wales.

Another design sees the Scottish flag removed – again leaving a black background – and a Royal Coat of Arms added to the centre.

13.20: Our senior political correspondent Christopher Hope has bumped into Ed Miliband on Princes Street, Edinburgh

Christopher Hope asked him the Labour leader what he felt about his Labour MPs being called slaves and N-word by a Yes campaigner in Glasgow yesterday.

He replied: "I think that obviously passions run high in this campaign. I think what is most important is that it is conducted in a civilised way.

"I think it is very, very important that it is. I think people across the United Kingdom care about this outcome.

"It is obviously a recognition that this is a decision for the people of Scotland, but there is also a deep feeling that the United Kingdom is so much stronger as a country with Scotland in it.

"That is why you saw so many Labour MPs up, people from across the Labour movement, across the United Kingdom, here yesterday campaigning."

12.45: New Guardian/ICM poll has put no ahead by 2 points

Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor, reports: Scotland is almost exactly divided down the middle on Scottish independence, according to another opinion poll published today giving the Unionist campaign a two-point lead.

The ICM survey for the Guardian found support for separation was 49 per cent and opposition 51 per cent when undecided voters were excluded, reinforcing other polls that have suggested the battle for the UK is on a knife edge.

However, it found nearly one in five voters are yet to make up their minds, meaning that the final days of the marathon two-year campaign will decide the result. It also found that more that four out of ten Scots who voted Labour at the 2010 general election are now backing separation.

It followed a You Gov poll showing 52 per cent opposition to independence compared to 48 per cent support when undecided voters are excluded. Unlike the ICM survey, it found only four per cent of people did not know how they were cast their ballots.

The new survey was based on telephone interviews conducted between Tuesday and Thursday, the first such survey ICM has conducted during the campaign. Previous polls suggesting that the race for Scotland could go to a photo-finish, have been based on internet-based surveys.

It takes into account the impact of the three UK party leaders dropping everything and coming to Scotland on Wednesday and some of the warnings about separation from major employers.

The poll found 42 per cent opposition to independence, 40 per cent support and 17 per cent who are yet to make up their minds.

The 25-to-34 age group in particular backs separation, by a margin of 57 per cent to 43 per cent. However, pensioners aged 65 and over are staunch unionists and back a No vote by 61 per cent to 39 per cent.

12.23: If you missed it, this video of Labour MPs being called slaves, traitors and a “parcel of rogues” it is worth a look

12.01: Phonebills could rise if Scotland become independent Britian's leading phone companies are expected to warn

BT, EE, O2, TalkTalk and Vodafone are in talks about a joint statement which would refer to to "the inevitability of cost increases" for operators as well as uncertainty over future regulation and currency.

The letter is thought to be being co-ordinated by the CBI who's president Sir Mike Rake is also the Chairman of BT Group, with a source telling Sky that John Cridland, the CBI director-general, was involved in the talks.

A telecoms exective told Sky: "It doesn't take a genius to work out that that would translate into price rises.

"You are talking about a market of 5m people rather than 62m, a new regulator and even possibly a price freeze. How could prices not go up?"

It comes after John Lewis, Waitrose and Asda warned that Scots would also have to pay more for their goods and shopping baskets.

12.00 The Yes campaign are organising marches to the polling station next Thursday

Posters advertising the three marches to take place through the day in Craigmillar and Niddre are calling it a "short walk to freedom" and quotes Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln.

Twitter: Ben Riley-Smith - Nationalists are organising "short walk to freedom" marches on polling day. Mandela + Lincoln quoted. Wow. #indyref [https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23indyref]: Ben Riley-Smith - Nationalists are organising "short walk to freedom" marches on polling day. Mandela + Lincoln quoted. Wow. http://t.co/ayq4HAtQs6 [http://t.co/ayq4HAtQs6]: Ben Riley-Smith - Nationalists are organising "short walk to freedom" marches on polling day. Mandela + Lincoln quoted. Wow.

It reads "let's all be Bravehearts" and locals are encouraged to add their names to the "marching list" and children and adults will have their face painted.

11.54 Sports star speaks out

We have heard from plenty of politicians but some celebs - sport stars, musicians, actors, writers, people from across the board have avoided coming out publically with their views. Partly because it is so sensitive and partly, some have said, because they fear a backlash from those who disagree with their views.

David Sole, a former Scottish rugby captain came out for the Nos, he told Sky News:

"It irritates me somewhat. I think the yes campaign almost feel they have exclusive rights on the Saltire which I think is completely unjustified. I’ve played for Scotland, I’ve played for my country, I’ve split blood for my country, and I’m very passionate about that.

"The other thing, the references to Team Scotland - we’re all part of Scotland. We’re a very strong and proud country and nation. I fundamentally believe, with greater powers devolved to the Scottish parliament, we can be even greater.

Former Scotland captain Gavin Hastings said:

“We don't feel we are any less Team Scotland by saying no thanks.

"A lot of us here today have played not only for Scotland but also the British and Irish Lions and that's been a massive part of our rugby life.

“We are just showing solidarity and support for the Better Together campaign.

"I'm as Scottish as anybody, I have represented my country over 10 seasons out there and I will not accept that I am any less Scottish because I'm not."

11.41 David Cameron has defended his approaches to businesses asking them to go public about their concerns over Scottish independence

Matthew Holehouse, Political Correspondent, was at the regular Westminster lobby briefing. He has this report.

Asked whether the PM thinks businesses should "explain" to the Scottish people the consequences of independence, and whether thePM had asked businesses to speak up, the PMOS said he was "puzzled" by reports that David Cameron had asked business leaders to speak up for the Union.

"I don't think it's any particularly secret that the PM - he gave a speech on it earlier in the year - in terms of voices from across the United Kingdom setting out their views and encouraging those who have views in that regard to make them.

"It's important that the debate that is in front of the people of Scotland ahead of them making their choice is as well informed as possible. Some of the coverage has perhaps been a touch puzzling.

"He speaks to business leaders all the time. Business leaders set out their own views.

"He's spoken to a wide range of businesses. I wouldnt particularly single any out. What actually is really going on here is you have a really important choice next week. Is it a surprise that in the debate stakeholders and others set out their views? I don't think that's a particular surprise."

11.31: Peter Kellner, the president of polling company YouGov, has called this week for the No campaign

He says that Scotland's "Yes bandwagon" has stalled and tat Alex Salmond has "lost this week's skirmishes"

Following today's YouGov poll which shows a shift back towards the No camp he writes:

Shortly before he stepped down as Prime Minister, Tony Blair warned David Cameron to beware Gordon Brown’s “great clunking fist”. Cameron survived it, but Alex Salmond’s bid for Scottish independence may not. Since Brown entered the debate, the Yes bandwagon, which had been rolling so dramatically, has stalled. His warnings that independence would be bad for jobs and family finances have struck home.

He drills down into the poll. Following warnings from business it seems Scots, especially women, are

10.26: It is "Farage Friday" in Scotland

The Ukip leader said he was heading up after the "grey men" of Westminster have left. I wonder what colour he will be sporting?

Ben Riley-Smith, Scottish Political Reporter, has this:

It is Farage Friday up north of the border today. The Ukip leader will make his long-awaited (and pretty controversial) return to Scotland this evening, attending a rally for the Union in Glasgow.

For the uninitiated, Farage's Scottish jaunts have past form. Last year, a meeting with Holyrood hacks got hijacked by radical pro-independence supporters, resulting in Farage being verbally assaulted, barricaded in an Edinburgh pub and eventually rescued by police van. A return trip for the EU elections this May drew a similar crowd, though a team of heavies ensured no repeat of the chaos.

Better Together, the pro-UK campaign, is pretty incensed by Farage's trip (first revealed by The Telegraph.) They have made clear he is not part of the official campaign. Leading Scottish politicians have also urged him to stay south in recent weeks.

(Hugo Rifkind, the Times columnist, had some novel suggestions to ensure just that on Twitter yesterday: "fake kidnap", "chair against the bathroom door", "tell someone he has Ebola".)

The rationale for keeping Farage at arms length is clear. The key battle in this campaign - as both sides will tell you - is wavering Labour votes to the left of centre. Winning over Scots with a party still seen by many (rightly or wrongly) as Home Counties English with a right-wing agenda is a tough ask.

But think about it for a moment and Farage does have a case for his relevance in Scotland. More than one in 10 Scots backed the party in May, propelling David Coburn to become the party's first Scottish MEP by taking a seat seriously eyed up by the SNP. (They had been readying the 'Ukip's electoral defeat proves England and Scotland are fundamentally different' line.)

Scotland is more Europhobic than Alex Salmond likes to suggest, with past polls suggesting a majority of voters want tighter immigration controls and a vote on EU membership. Plus many of those being targeted by the Nationalists - working class voters disillusioned by the status quo and furious with Westminster - are exactly the sort of people being picked up by Ukip down south.

But all that is by the by. Farage is up, protests are expected and an eager bunch of journalists will be ready to share every scuffle and heckle to the world. Watch this space.

09.35: The Queen has a “responsibility” to speak out on Scotland as the “very future” of the United Kingdom is “under threat” Nigel Farage has said

“My understanding of the constitution is that if the Kingdom itself is under threat, in many ways you can argue she has a responsibility or say something.

"I completely understand her wanting to keep out of politics and she has done it absolutely brilliantly over 60 years, she is globally admired figure.

"I doubt the royal family has ever been more popular over centuries than it is currently is.

“But there are times if the United Kingdom, of which she is the monarch, is threatened itself well it might be right to say something

“That doesn’t mean she has to but if we got to, let’s say we go to this Sunday and let’s say it was still 50/50 in the polls, I personally think she should say something, yes.

“I think if the very future of the United Kingdom is threatened she should say something and there is precedent for this, she did it in 1977.

“She did it in Westminster hall in her Silver Jubilee speech and when the first calls, the first modern calls for separation were being heard, she said very clearly that I am the Queen of the entire United Kingdom.”

08.58: George Galloway says that the division in the UK is not between Scottish people and English people

The real division is not between English and Scots any more than it is between “protestant and catholic people or black and white people” instead, he says, it is between those with wealth and power and those without. He says independence and Alex Salmond will not change this status quo.

He says he is on the campaign trail because the Nos needed “a bit of steel, and a bit of fire”

08.21: Peter Hain, former Labour cabinet minister and a noted anti-apartheid campaigner has told Alex Salmond he is no Nelson Mandela and he must stop presenting himself as the emancipator of Scotland

He writes in The Telegraph: "For anyone like me who waged the long and bitter fight against apartheid, hearing Alex Salmond rank it alongside his campaign for Scottish independence defies belief. Apartheid was one of the worst racial tyrannies the world has ever seen – it suppressed, imprisoned, tortured or killed opponents, and it stripped blacks of any shred of dignity, denying their common humanity.

Scotland is part of a UK democracy where human rights are deeply entrenched. It has almost complete self-government – and has been promised still more. I quite understand why Salmond contrives to present his campaign as a battle against the perfidious English, he as the “Braveheart” liberating his people from London’s dastardly despotism. Doubtless one of his spin doctors will soon invoke him as a Nelson Mandela-like freedom warrior.

08.19: Retailers are preparing a letter suggesting that if there is a yes vote it could have a knock on effect on prices for Scottish shoppers, it has been reported.

Organised Sir Ian Cheshire the chief executive of Kingfisher, it will reportedly be signed by Marc Boland, Marks and Spencer’s chief executive, Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfiel.

The Yes campaign have hit back and say that Tesco and Morrisons have reportedly refused to sign the letter as it is a matter of pure speculation. They point to other small countries that have managed food price inflation better than the UK has done.

08.01: I wondered earlier why we haven't had a Quebec style outpouring of grief at the idea of the end of the Union - Fraser Nelson argues in The Telegraph that the British reserve may prove the undoing of the UK

Fraser Nelson begins:

If there were to be a political remake of Braveheart, the result would be something like the scenes outside Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall yesterday lunchtime. Two tribes had chosen to clash there, carrying their respective weapons of Yes and No placards. When Ed Miliband turned up, his team retreated behind him for the benefit of the cameras. This left him addressing a crowd of nationalists, standing just a few inches away, who looked as if they might be about to eat him. Mr Miliband also looked as if they were about to eat him. Upon this thin red line the fate of the United Kingdom now hangs.

07.40: Nigel Farage has just warned that Scottish independence will force the rest of the UK to explain to the world how it lost “a large chunk of its territory”

Speaking ahead of his rally in Glasgow later today he argued that Alex Salmond's vision for independence was false as it would involve joining the EU and hand sovereignty straight back to Brussels.

He said: “I think we would be diminished globally as a nation. I think the message that goes out that you have lost a large chunk of your territory and a three hundred year old Union, one that has achieved astonishing successes for democracy and freedom worldwide – that’s not a good message.”

The Ukip leader added: “People say that Scotland is not as Eurosceptic as England. Well I’ll tell you something, it is not that far behind.”

Despite being barricaded inside a pub by angry Scots on his last trip, Mr Farage has promised not to be "incendiary" during his visit.

"I am not going to be incendiary at all but I am going because firstly Ukip does have a voice in Scottish politics but I am going to make a point that this referendum is being called the Independent referendum , Mr Salmond says it is about independence, Better Together says is about Independence.

“But if you look at it, it is not – if you actually look at it what Mr Salmond is saying is leave Westminster and then sign ourselves up to the EU state and whether you think being in the EU is a good thing or a bad thing what is absolutely certain that their courts are supreme, their laws are supreme and you cannot be an independence country and a member of the European Union.

“I would hate to think that there are, particularly Labour voters, that have switched to the yes side because they view the Westminster class with such contempt – something indeed share – but I would hate to think that they are voting believing Scotland would be independent of governing when it won’t.”

07.25: It is the last Friday before the vote and we wake up to details of another poll showing the No camp back in the lead

A boost for the frazzled Westminster leaders, the poll also shows a stark drop in the number of undecided voters. Those yet to decide are down to just 4 per cent from 6 per cent at the weekend - and 8 per cent at the start of the month.

Unsurprisingly, with so many postal votes already cast, people are finally having to bite the bullet and decide. Commentators have long talked about the "shy noes", those embarrassed to express their support for the Union amongst the loud shouts for yes. Perhaps they are being forced from the shadows as this campaign comes down to the wire.

It also reveals that even more women – traditionally the group Alex Salmond has really struggled to woo – turning away from the ‘yes’ campaign.

Interesting this poll was carried out throughout the beginning of this week - from Tuesday to Thursday - so many would have been aware of the previous YouGov poll pointing to a late nationalist surge, and the first to put the yes camp in the lead.

This graph by Fivethirtyeight [http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/scotland-independence-referendum/] - a website devoted to rigorous analysis of politics, polling and public affairs through statistical means - is useful. It shows just how overexcited one outlying poll can make us. The furore which followed the poll published in The Sunday Times this weekend put into helpful context.

Meanwhile Alex Salmond has been slapped down by Britain's most senior civil service rejecting his claims that the treasury delivery all leaked market sensible information to damage the yes campaign

Sir Jeremey Heywood said the ministerial code had not been broken and the treasury was simply responding to journalists’ enquiries at a time when the market was closed.

The row broke yesterday after Alex Salmond demanded an inquiry into after Treasury apparently told the BBC details of RBS’ contingency plans to move its head office to the UK in case of a ‘yes’ vote.

In Spain yesterday, we saw a massive outpouring of Catalan separatists onto the streets of Barcelona demanding in a Scottish-style referendum. Some ever grasped the blue saltire amongst the Catalan red and yellow.

In Britain a spontaneous outpouring of national emotion - such as the million strong march in Canada when Quebec threatened separatism in a similar referendum in 1997 - is markedly missing.

Philip Collins in The Times could have an explanation - he argues there is a "reason the case for the Union has been made in prose rather than poetry" - because there is not poetic case for the United Kingdom.

Great Britain he says is a state - it is Scotland which is a nation.

In The Telegraph comedian Rory Bremner disagrees. The Scot has agonised over the choice but finally plumped for no.

I get it. I feel Scottish. When Cameron and Osborne come north, two thoughts come to mind: 1) They’ve come to collect the rent, and 2) I remember being in the crowd in 1990, when Will Carling, Brian Moore and Margaret Thatcher (cunningly disguised as lock forward Wade Dooley) arrived at Murrayfield with an immense sense of entitlement and, thanks to Tony Stanger’s dramatic try, were sent homeward, tae think again.

I get all that, and I never tire of reminding English friends that whatever has happened in the last quarter of a century, 1990 was the only game that mattered. When Cameron, Osborne and (God help us) Farage implore us not to leave the Union, I’m reminded of comedienne Kit Hollerbach’s response when asked by a loud-mouthed bloke if she was a lesbian: “Are you the alternative?”

And yet, and yet. They’re not the alternative. If Scots say, we didn’t vote for this Coalition government – guess what? The rest of the UK didn’t either. And the rest of the UK, from Newcastle and Liverpool to Swansea and Belfast, will get a chance to vote them out next year – in the case of England and Northern Ireland, without the benefit of an additional, devolved Parliament of their own, with increased powers and added Devo Max (full fat fiscal powers without the bitter taste).

Scottish independence: it’s a scandal that half of us are excluded from the vote
By Jeremy Paxman

Scotland is not alone in finding Westminster unrepresentative, says Jeremy Paxman – it’s just that citizens in other parts of the UK don’t have a say

On Thursday, the English will discover what the Scots really think of them. Like the final row in a troubled marriage, it could be the event that serves to separate those we were once told God had joined together.

The decision is not for those of us who live south of Berwick-upon-Tweed, because the electorate has been selected in a way that could make a Chicago party boss gaze down at his toecaps with embarrassment. Let us leave aside the exclusion of a role in the fate of their country for Scots who represented it in the recent Commonwealth Games but don’t happen to be living there right now (and the granting of that right to any Kylie, Hank or Svetlana who has an address north of the border). Let us ignore, too, the extension of the franchise to 16-year-olds.

No, the real scandal – in which almost the whole English Establishment has been complicit – has been the exclusion of half of the Union from a decision on its future. The fate of this supposed relationship of equals is to be determined solely by those who find themselves living on one side of a border that we have been told for generations no longer really matters.

Indeed, the very composition of the electorate validates the Scots nationalists’ claim that, despite the subsidy their country gets from the government in London, they remain somehow an oppressed minority. The apparently high levels of voter engagement testify to disgust at the rotten borough system that exists in parts of the Scottish industrial heartland, and a recognition of the unattractiveness of Westminster.

Well, here’s a revelation for you, Hamish. There are plenty of Union citizens in Birmingham, Builth Wells and Bury St Edmunds who think the Westminster parliament is remote and unrepresentative. Some of them believe that it is not just unattractive but also absurd. They’re just not being offered a chance to say so.

The Scots are lucky in having a history, culture and legal system of their own, which engender far more passionate loyalties than exist in most other parts of the UK. The English – who do not have such traditions – recognise the draw of this alternative identity. Hence the last-minute, panic-stricken visits of English notables such as Cameron, Clegg and Miliband, offering further devolution. Hence, too, the menaces of the bankers and supermarket magnates. We shall doubtless soon see a claim that independence makes an outbreak of the Ebola virus more likely.

As Defoe remarked 300 years ago, the English are a mongrel race. I love Scotland and rejoice that a quarter of the blood in my veins is Scottish. Perhaps that should entitle me to get together with three other quarter-Scots and between us hope to add up to one Alex Salmond?

But this is not really a matter or race. I dare say that at some shady point in his family history, even Mr Salmond has been blessed with an injection of English genes.

No, we are repeatedly told, this decision is a matter of politics pure and simple – not that those words are often run together.

The Union was a political fix for a problem at a particular time. Scotland was near-bankrupt after attempting to create its own empire in the jungles of Latin America. When the Darien Scheme turned out a tragicomic catastrophe, the political class in Edinburgh looked south of the border and saw the opportunity to join the English in building their empire and enrich their country in the process.

As generals, engineers, administrators, traders, missionaries and doctors, the Scots proved brilliant imperialists.

But the British Empire is no more. Is it any wonder that the fate of the Union is in question? Those who argue that it should last for ever have as much political insight as Ozymandias. So the worst possible outcome in this vote will be a very narrow majority to stay in the Union, for then the issue could hang around like a bad smell for years to come.

The English response to the threat of being abandoned has ranged from the bombastic to the cringing. Groups of the self-important write open letters in wheedling tones, under the numptyish impression that the Chosen of Galashiels or Glasgow give a damn what they feel. These appeals make Uriah Heep sound like the Terminator. Frankly, it’s embarrassing.

Thus it was that, in the dying days of the referendum campaign, the pro‑Union camp deployed their Big Gun. This turned out to be Gordon Brown, whom many Down South had rather imagined would be leading the procession on to the last train north from King’s Cross after independence, accompanied by the irritating bagpiper who busks outside Selfridges on Oxford Street.

In the event of a Yes vote, the English should wave them a wistful goodbye. “Britain” was a political solution to a political problem and separation would not mean the end of England. In fact, it is hard to imagine many of the dire predictions of the demise of the Union turning out to be as baleful as predicted. Life expectancy would rise.

As for the rest – the supposedly permanent Tory government, the predicted complacency despite the loss of international prestige – native ingenuity will see us through. Of course, the English should be under no illusions. But if the people of Scotland really do decide they’ve had enough of the Union, good luck to them. It is rather astonishing that the nationalists haven’t bothered to work out what will be inside their countrymen’s wallets – but they are a great mercantile people, and it is not beyond the wit of the nation to address the currency question with a 21st-century groat or something.

Yet there is an uncomfortable suspicion that the nationalists are relying upon the usual wetness of the English Establishment to settle the question, hoping they will just say: “Oh well, if you want to keep the pound, go ahead – and here’s a place or two making policy at the Bank of England.” It is all too plausible.

The trend in the modern world is towards an erosion of national borders. If it turns out the Scots really do want to create a new one, then let’s have a proper frontier, with passport controls and barbed wire and Alsatian dogs and watchtowers on the banks of the Tweed. The ticket collectors on Scottish trains have their own rather fetching tartan already. They could extend it to the border guards assigned to keep their land free from Southern corruption.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, fired 10 government officials for disobeying an order to return to the Ebola–stricken country after foreign trips.

The officials fired "showed insensitivity to our national tragedy and disregard for authority," a presidential statement said.

Liberia is the worst–hit of four countries in West Africa that have recorded cases of the virus. More than 1,200 people have died in the nation and the outbreak threatens to disrupt the farming industry with the economy tipping into recession. Mrs Johnson Sirleaf has appealed to America for help controlling the disease.

Dining in the sky: does fear make food taste better?

A hovering restaurant, winched 100ft above London's Canary Wharf, opens this week. Our intrepid writer - who suffers from vertigo - braved the first flight of the day

London boasts some of the finest restaurants in the world, many of them with spectacular views over the capital. So, it is baffling why anyone would actively chose to spend £50 on breakfast at the most recent venue to open: London In the Sky. Unless you were a pepper pot short of the full cruet set.

But I am surrounded by 20 fellow customers, most of whom seem to be looking forward to our “flight”.

I say “flight”, but in fact it is more like a slow winch to a certain death.

That’s because London in the Sky is a table suspended from a crane, 100 foot in the air.

Attached to the table - by rather insubstantial-looking poles - are chairs that look as if they have been ripped off a fairground roller coaster.

The middle of the table is cut out, and replaced with a platform on which stands an oven, three waiters and the chef, Anna Hansen. They are all strapped into harnesses.

In all, there are seven tonnes of steel, human bodies, and cutlery, which are due to dangle from a single wire, high above a park in Docklands. There is a flimsy transparent plastic sheet above to stop any rain, but otherwise it is completely open to the elements.

The floating restaurant, developed in Belgium nearly 10 years ago, has appeared in Britain quite a few times, but only as part of corporate events. This is the first time it has been open to members of the public, who will have to fork out £250 for an hour-long dinner, where some well-known chefs will be cooking, including Atul Kochhar and Alyn Williams. Apparently, nearly all bookings are full.

Restaurants that feel the need to boast about their health and safety records are usually dodgy kebab shops and about as welcome as a dose of Ebola. But a man from London in the Sky shows me a sheet of instructions informing me that no loose footwear is allowed, neither are pregnant women. And then comes the killer line: “Each Dinner in the Sky event is covered by £10 million public liability and third party insurance.”

I am seriously starting to question what I am about to do. That’s because I suffer from vertigo -- not cripplingly so, but enough to make me feel deeply anxious when I stand near the edge of any roof, cliff or ladder.

“I’ve not been up in this yet. I am slightly apprehensive,” says Hansen, the founder of Modern Pantry restaurant in Clerkenwell. This does not comfort me, as I, along with all the other guests, are strapped into our seats with double safety belts. She adds: “I don’t really like heights. So, I am not sure why I agreed to do this. It was a moment of madness.”

Then, the crane slowly starts to winch us up, and the above the roof of the nearby Docklands warehouses is revealed the O2 Arena and various impressive-looking ships docked near Greenwich. But I am unable to enjoy the view as I spend most of my energy making sure I do not look down. I can sense, out of the corner of my eye, the ground steadily receding beneath my feet but I am studiously looking ahead at Hansen and Dale Agar, who runs London in the Sky and is acting as a waiter.

“After five minutes, you won’t notice that you up in the sky. You will just enjoy yourself,” he says, trying to soothe me. It is a lie.

My entire body is frozen into a corpse-like stiffness and I dare not loosen my vice-like grip on the table. This makes eating difficult.

My toasted oats, nuts and seeds, green apple, roast apricot and The Collective Straight Up Yoghurt -- posh granola -- is, I think, delicious. But my taste buds appear to have shut down.

“I was wondering if fear might make food taste better,” says Dr Marcus Posner, a young eye doctor, and one of my fellow guests sitting at the table. I inform him that I don’t think it does. He agrees

He won a seat on the “flight” in a competition and says he is up for trying any new experience. He seems unfazed. But he has been skydiving.

“This is different from sky diving,” he says. “Dangling is a bit more unnerving.”

We all have very small foot rests under our chairs, but this does nothing to alleviate my profound unease. I can feel the wind whipping up my ankles. I just want to get down.

Halfway through the meal, the entire open-sided contraption swings around, so that we can see another view. This causes even more discomfort as we all gently sway, like an abandoned puppet. To add to the insult, the view is actually very dull - the back of various tall, ugly skyscrapers.

The crane, unfortunately, is situated on the east side of the Docklands, which means you only get a slither of a view across to the city between a gap between the HSBC and Citi buildings.

The food continues to impress, I think. Some tea-smoked salmon with yuzu hollandaise at least took my mind off where I was, for a bit. Though it turns out that eating a meal while strapped into a fairground chair is rather uncomfortable, as I find it impossible to lean forward.

After half an hour, the moment comes that I have been waiting for: we descend. Each metre, as we sink down, is a blessed relief.

Eventually we touch down and I am released from my torture chair. It is only then that I realise that I have spent the last half hour so screwed up with tension that I have failed to digest anything. As a result, I have stomach ache.

Agar is keen to find out how I found it. I tell him.

He looks a little crestfallen. But I am not sure my opinion will have any impact on the success of his venture, which is running until September 21, with nine “flights” a day.

I hope his future diners enjoy themselves more than I did.

Scotland decides: 6 days left – Nigel Farage flies in to save the Union

It is Farage Friday up north of the border today. The Ukip leader will make his long-awaited (and pretty controversial) return to Scotland this evening, attending a rally for the Union in Glasgow.

For the uninitiated, Farage's Scottish jaunts have past form. Last year, a meeting with Holyrood hacks got hijacked by radical pro-independence supporters, resulting in Farage being verbally assaulted, barricaded in an Edinburgh pub and eventually rescued by police van. A return trip for the EU elections this May drew a similar crowd, though a team of heavies ensured no repeat of the chaos.

Better Together, the pro-UK campaign, is pretty incensed by Farage's trip (first revealed by The Telegraph[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/10945216/Nigel-Farage-to-stage-anti-independence-rally-days-before-Scottish-referendum.html].) They have made clear he is not part of the official campaign. Leading Scottish politicians have also urged him to stay south in recent weeks.

(Hugo Rifkind, the Times columnist, had some novel suggestions to ensure just that on Twitter yesterday: "fake kidnap", "chair against the bathroom door", "tell someone he has Ebola".)

The rationale for keeping Farage at arms length is clear. The key battle in this campaign – as both sides will tell you – is wavering Labour votes to the left of centre. Winning over Scots with a party still seen by many (rightly or wrongly) as Home Counties English with a right-wing agenda is a tough ask.

But think about it for a moment and Farage does have a case for his relevance in Scotland. More than one in 10 Scots backed the party in May, propelling David Coburn to become the party's first Scottish MEP by taking a seat seriously eyed up by the SNP. (They had been readying the 'Ukip's electoral defeat proves England and Scotland are fundamentally different' line.)

Scotland is more Europhobicthan Alex Salmond likes to suggest, with past polls suggesting a majority of voters want tighter immigration controls and a vote on EU membership. Plus many of those being targeted by the Nationalists – working class voters disillusioned by the status quo and furious with Westminster – are exactly the sort of people being picked up by Ukip down south.

But all that is by the by. Farage is up, protests are expected and an eager bunch of journalists will be ready to share every scuffle and heckle to the world. Watch this space.

Millions more at risk in Ebola outbreak, British study finds

Research by the University of Oxford reveals how 15 more countries across Africa could be hit by the Ebola virus

The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history could spread to a further 15 countries in West and Central Africa, putting up to 70 million people at risk of infection, a ground-breaking study has found.

Research by the University of Oxford compared historic outbreaks to the virus’ possible transmission in bats and chimpanzees to predict how the disease could spread through its vast animal reservoir.

It is the first time scientists have attempted to explain how the virus, which is contracted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has travelled westward across Africa.

The resulting map shows how the populations of the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Ghana and a dozen more countries could be hit by the outbreak, which has already killed nearly 2,300 people in 2014.

Several species of bat are suspected of carrying the virus through the jungles of West and Central Africa without showing symptoms, passing the disease onto other animals which are eaten by some communities as “bush meat”.

Researchers said transmission to the human population was not “inevitable”, but that environmental factors in many more countries than previously considered made it possible for further Ebola outbreak outbreaks.

According to the Oxford study, Cote D’Ivoire, Gabon, Angola, Tanzania, Togo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar and Malawi could also join those countries already affected.

More than 1,000 people have so far died in Liberia, where the country’s Defence Minister Brownie Samukai has said the disease threatens the country's very existence.

"Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of our State," he said yesterday.

Further deaths have been reported in Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Guinea and one case has recently been confirmed Senegal.

The Oxford study’s author Nick Golding, a researcher at the University’s Department of Zoology, said: "Our map shows the likely ‘reservoir’ of Ebola virus in animal populations, and this is larger than has been previously appreciated.

"This does not mean that transmission to humans is inevitable in these areas; only that all the environmental and epidemiological conditions suitable for an outbreak occur there.

British Ebola survivor to return to Sierra Leone

William Pooley, the first Briton known to have been 'cured' of Ebola, plans to return to Sierra Leone where he caught the disease to help others

The first Briton to be infected with the deadly Ebola virus has revealed he is going back to Sierra Leone to try and help with the struggle to control the disease.

William Pooley, a British nurse, survived Ebola after he was evacuated to Britain from Sierra Leone in an RAF fighter jet and successfully treated with the experimental drug ZMapp.

Despite initially assuring his parents he would not return, the 29-year-old has revealed he plans to go back to Sierra Leone, where hundreds of people have died from Ebola. He has called on David Cameron to do more to ensure an international effort is being made to get the epidemic in Africa under control.

“It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while,” Mr Pooley told the Guardian[http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/09/william-pooley-ebola-sierra-leone-outbreak-epidemic] .

“The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick. If they get sick they are just going to end up in a ward in Kenema with less chance than I had."

Mr Pooley was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London after spending more than a week in a specially designed isolation tent and has been at home with his family in Suffolk.

His family were at first pleased as his passport had to be incinerated when he was diagnosed. His mother said she does not want him to return but would be “very proud” of him if he did, considering he already knows what a difficult situation he would be working in.

In London Mr Pooley was treated in a £25,000 tent, which managed contamination by controlling the air pressure, colour coding areas and using heat-sealed containers to remove body waste.

In Sierra Leone conditions will be very different.

Mr Pooley added: “Those wards A and B when I first started were pretty grim. Corpses, blood, the place was really dirty - people just dying in quite unpleasant ways. When I first started there were not enough materials, there was no running water, no sheets or towels to clean a patient with.

“They might be incontinent, they are often confused, so you can imagine, with diarrhoea and vomiting, patients get in horrible condition."

While he was in Sierra Leone Mr Pooley helped save dozen of lives by making sure a hospital in Kenema, at the centre of the outbreak, remained open. He volunteered to treat patients when local nurses were too afraid of cobtracting the disease.

More than 1,500 people have died from Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria with around 57 per cent of those infected dying. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned there could be 20,000 more victims unless the disease is brought under control.

Mr Pooley said he was told he had the illness after developing a sore throat, headache and aches all over his body. He said the hardest thing was having to tell his parents, just before he was evacuated, that he had Ebola and only had a 50 per cent chance of surviving.

Thousands of new cases of Ebola are expected in the coming weeks as the disease spreads "exponentially" through Liberia, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned yesterday.

More than 2,000 people have been killed in West Africa by Ebola this year, including 79 health workers. The UN's health agency said the response to the crisis was "not having an adequate impact". It said a shortage of hospital beds meant people were travelling around searching for treatment, infecting others. "The number of new cases is increasing exponentially," WHO said.

With the prospect of the country falling apart in just under 10 days, the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy provides a welcome opportunity to smile

We had known about the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy for all of 30 seconds when the naysayers appeared online, whingeing and whining about the wall-to-wall coverage of a stranger’s womb. The gist of their gripes was along the lines of: “WOMAN OF CHILD-BEARING AGE IS PREGNANT SHOCKER!” I suspect that when the Queen Mother passed away it was boiled down to “SCANDAL AS ELDERLY WOMAN DIES!” and that when Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles got hitched, it was reduced to “SENSATION AS MIDDLE-AGED DIVORCEE REMARRIES!”

Anyway, the naysayers didn’t like that their Twitter timelines were suddenly filled with excitable tweets about potential names, genders and oh-my-god-I-hope-it’s-a-girl-and-they-call-her-Diana, so they added to the volume of #royalbabytweets by saying so. To the naysayers, news is only proper news when it is about murder, war or politics – like, durr! – and anyone who is interested in anything else is vacuous and not worthy of an invitation to eat organic quinoa at their Hackney townhouse.

But of course it is news that a woman who might one day be Queen is pregnant again. Did the naysayers really think that the 24-hour news channels would mention it briefly and then go back to talking about Alex Salmond? Speaking of him, I love the cynical naysayer theory that the Duke and Duchess might have been marched into a bedroom by the Queen and told to lie back and think of England, not forgetting Scotland, too. I don’t want to put you off your breakfast, but I can’t imagine Alex Salmond being a useful part of any young couple’s baby-making plans. Plus, I’m trying to imagine the conversation between Kate, William and little Diana in five years’ time. “Mummy and Daddy, that beastly George says that you love him more than me and that I was a mistake.” “Quite the opposite, darling. You were planned meticulously, so that the announcement of your existence would boost support for the unionists. Without you, baby, we would be ruling over a less-than-united kingdom!”

I am not a staunch monarchist by any stretch of the imagination; I don’t collect souvenir plates that mark royal births, deaths and marriages and I’ve never been able to get over seeing those pictures of the Duchess of York having her toes sucked (I was 12, OK? It was an impressionable age). But on days like yesterday, I think the Royals sum up all that is great – and bonkers – about Britain.

Yes, it is mad to invest any interest at all in the reproductive system of a woman you will probably never meet, but it’s a madness that grips people of all ages, ethnicities, religions and nationalities. The otherness of the Royals is one of the few things nowadays that has the power to bring us together: witness the boost to the nation’s collective mood when everyone got a day off in 2011 for the Royal Wedding; remember the lusciously long weekend to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee a year later; don’t pretend you didn’t feel even a smidgeon of excitement when they wheeled the easel out of Buckingham Palace to announce the birth of Prince George last summer.

Republicans think that the Royals are a ludicrously expensive affront to democracy, but I think they are worth every one of the 56 pennies that I am charged in tax for them each year. Right now, people around the world are going mad for “Princess Kate”; they will come and they will pile in to the endless tourist shops near Buckingham Palace and they will spend their dollars and their yuan on postcards and key rings and other tat bearing the image of the newest member of the Royal family. America’s television networks will bus in their most glamorous news anchors to stand outside the Lindo Wing, and Kay Burley will outdo them all by setting up camp months in advance, just in case. The economy will get a boost, but the republicans and the naysayers will be cross because they want to be able to sit miserably in front of their televisions watching the proper news, without being disturbed by anything as trivial as good news.

Well all I can say is thank the Lord and little baby Jesus that Catherine has got another bun in the oven. After a summer of Ebola and gruesome Isil beheadings and terrible tensions in the Ukraine, and with the prospect of the country falling apart in just under 10 days, it’s a relief to finally have something to smile about. Royal baby number two may not save the Union – it might be a tall order for a ball of cells probably no bigger than a raspberry – but it has given us a much-needed reason to be cheerful. Plus, by my calculations, it will be born around the time of the general election campaign, and boy-oh-boy will we need a distraction from that. So thank you, Catherine, for your pregnancy. It’s reminded me that news doesn’t always have to be bad.

Off to the loo with Joan Rivers

Only a woman like Joan Rivers could have a funeral that actually looked like fun. It had the New York City Gay Men’s Choir singing Hey Big Spender while Hugh Jackman belted out Quiet Please, There’s a Lady on Stage. Bagpipers played New York, New York, and Howard Stern delivered the eulogy.

Two years ago, Rivers joked that she wanted “Meryl Streep crying in five different accents” and a “wind machine so that even in the casket my hair is blowing just like Beyoncé’s”. How could a person be so funny even in death? Isn’t it brilliant that she is still making us laugh from beyond the grave?

Rivers was known for her caustic wit, but when I met her I saw a very different side to her. It was 2008 and I had been sent on an assignment to cover a charity walk on the Great Wall of China. Old Joanie turned up in a pair of red stilettos, a pink trench coat and a face full of make-up, while everyone else looked drab in their walking gear. “I thought I was going to walk the great mall of China,” she joked. Or at least I think she was joking.

We had to take a long coach journey to the allotted part of the wall, and made an inevitable loo stop at what can only be described as a latrine behind a broken door. “Oh my gawwwwwd,” said Joan. “This is worse than women’s prison. This is worse than Tenko!”

I helped her to the loo and held the door for her, and then I got back on the coach and waited for everyone to return to their seats. Eventually Joan tottered on board clutching a bunch of flowers she had picked from the side of the road.

She staggered down the aisle until she found me, and thrust them in my face. “These are for you, sweetheart, for helping me back there.” It was an unexpectedly sweet side that I will never forget.

---------------------

So what if Italy’s MPs are pretty?

Ciao bella! The new prime minister of Italy has been accused of being as bad as Berlusconi, apparently appointing female ministers on the basis of their looks rather than their talent.

Rosy Bindi, a grand dame of Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party, announced loftily that “I believe some of the ministers were chosen because they are young and also good-looking.”

Bindi, who was once told by Berlusconi that she was “prettier than she is intelligent”, should know better than to belittle her female colleagues.

Yes, 33-year-old Maria Elena Boschi is undeniably beautiful, but she has also pushed through a complex proposal to reform the senate. Federica Mogherini is dishy for a foreign minister, but one suspects she’s more than a match for Philip Hammond, given that she’s just been made the EU’s new foreign policy chief.

“In politics, some people are afraid of a strong woman who is also good-looking,” said Alessandra Moretti, another MP from the party who has come in for criticism because she doesn’t look like an old boot.

Frankly, I’m jealous of the Italians for having an easy-on-the-eye cabinet. I’d like to see more gorgeous broads in the Commons, but they’re probably too brainy to put themselves through the wringer there.

When Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger were campaigning for seats at the last election, they were initially belittled and undermined because they happened to be beautiful. Meanwhile, the handsome Zac Goldsmith and Chuka Umunna were allowed to get on with their political crusades unbothered by accusations that they might be as thick as two short planks.

The Italian PM, by the way, is not exactly uneasy on the eye. But why have a go at him, when there’s a couple of bright, beautiful young women to crush underfoot?

Thousands more Ebola cases in coming weeks, UN warns

A shortage of beds and insufficient containment measures in Liberia could see an "exponential" rise in Ebola cases, the World Health Organisation says

Thousands of new cases of Ebola are expected in the coming weeks as the disease spreads "exponentially" through Liberia, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

More than 2,000 people have been killed in West Africa by Ebola since the outbreak began this year, including 79 health workers.

The UN's health agency has now warned the response to the crisis is "not having an adequate impact" and efforts to contain the virus must be stepped up "three-to-four fold".

It added that a shortage of beds for infected patients in Liberia's Montserrado county and the use of public transport by Ebola sufferers turned away from hospital would likely cause a surge in transmission rates.

“Transmission of the Ebola virus in Liberia is already intense and the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,” WHO said in a statement.

“In Monrovia, taxis filled with entire families, of whom some members are thought to be infected with the Ebola virus, crisscross the city, searching for a treatment bed. There are none.

"As WHO staff in Liberia confirm, no free beds for Ebola treatment exist anywhere in the country.

"When patients are turned away they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes, where they inevitably infect others."

The virus is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids, or through contact with areas where contaminated bodily fluids have recently been left.

International response to the epidemic has been intensified in recent weeks, with more aid being pledged to affected countries and the imposition of stricter travel restrictions.

The British military has pledged to build a 50-bed centre in Sierra Leone and the US announced the construction of a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia at a cost of $22 million.

Liberia has been the worst affected with 1,000 deaths from the virus so far, while hundreds have also died in Guinea and Sierra Leone. The outbreak has a mortality rate of 55 per cent.

The British military will build and staff an emergency medical centre in Sierra Leone to treat victims of the deadly Ebola virus outbreak

British troops will be sent to Sierra Leone to build an emergency treatment centre for victims of the deadly Ebola virus, the Government has said.

A survey team of military engineers will be sent within days, as doctors and aid workers try to halt an epidemic which has killed at least 2,100 people across West Africa.

Armed Forces’ engineers and medics will build and staff the 62-bed centre near the capital, Freetown, until it is handed over to an aid agency. The first stage of the centre will be ready within two months.

Mark Francois, Minister for Armed Forces, said: “The people of West Africa need our help and we will not stand idly by.

“The UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic and our military will continue the great work so far.

“This operation will involve a unique set of challenges but I believe that we have the ability to provide support to the World Health Organisation, in helping to bring the outbreak under control.”

Defence sources said it was not yet known how many Armed Forces personnel would be needed, but they would be from all three services. The centre will have a 50-bed facility for treating victims and another 12-bed unit to provide specialist care for health workers.

West Africa is being ravaged by the worst ever outbreak of the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] haemorrhagic fever, which in some cases is killing up to 90 per cent of those infected. The region’s rudimentary health system has been unable to cope with the flood of victims and many medical staff have also fallen ill.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11079870/Condition-of-third-US-health-worker-with-Ebola-improving.html]

Justin Forsyth, Save the Children chief executive, said the aid agency was working with the British Government to set the centre up, then take it over with international experts and local staff.

He said: “Without urgent action to assist medics, many more children and their families will suffer and die from this most appalling and tragic disease.”

African Union chiefs held an emergency meeting Monday to hammer out a continent-wide strategy to deal with the epidemic.

In the scramble to halt the virus’s spread, countries have banned flights, closed borders and imposed quarantines on whole regions.
