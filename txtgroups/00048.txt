Behind the hellish Ebola epidemic ravaging West Africa lies an agent that fittingly embodies the mad contradictions of a nightmare. It is alive yet dead, simple yet complex, mindless yet prophetic, seemingly able to anticipate our every move.

For scientists who study the evolution and behavior of viruses, the Ebola pathogen is performing true to its vast, ancient and staggeringly diverse kind. By all evidence, researchers say, viruses have been parasitizing living cells since the first cells arose on earth nearly four billion years ago.

Some researchers go so far as to suggest that viruses predate their hosts. That they essentially invented cells as a reliable and renewable resource they could then exploit for the sake of making new viral particles.

It was the primordial viral “collective,” said Luis P. Villarreal, former director of the Center for Virus Research at the University of California, Irvine, “that originated the capacity for life to be self-sustaining.”

“Viruses are not just these threatening or annoying parasitic agents,” he added. “They’re the creative front of biology, where things get figured out, and they always have been.”

Researchers are deeply impressed by the depth and breadth of the viral universe, or virome. Viruses have managed to infiltrate the cells of every life form known to science. They infect animals, plants, bacteria, slime mold, even larger viruses. They replicate in their host cells so prodigiously and stream out into their surroundings so continuously that if you collected all the viral flotsam afloat in the world’s oceans, the combined tonnage would outweigh that of all the blue whales.

Not that viruses want to float freely. As so-called obligate parasites entirely dependent on host cells to replicate their tiny genomes and fabricate their protein packages newborn viruses, or virions, must find their way to fresh hosts or they will quickly fall apart, especially when exposed to sun, air or salt.

“Drying out is a death knell for viral particles,” said Lynn W. Enquist, a virologist at Princeton.

How long shed virions can persist if kept moist and unbuffeted — for example, in soil or in body excretions like blood or vomit — is not always clear but may be up to a week or two. That is why the sheets and clothing of Ebola patients must be treated as hazardous waste and surfaces hosed down with bleach.

Viruses are masters at making their way from host to host and cell to cell, using every possible channel. Whenever biologists discover a new way that body cells communicate with one another, sure enough, there’s a virus already tapping into exactly that circuit in its search for new meat.

Reporting recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Karla Kirkegaard, a professor of microbiology and genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] at Stanford University School of Medicine, and her colleagues described[http://www.pnas.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/111/36/13081.abstract] a kind of “unconventional secretion” pathway based on so-called autophagy, or self-eating, in which cells digest small parts of themselves and release the pieces into their surroundings as signaling molecules targeted at other cells — telling them, for example, that it’s time for a new round of tissue growth.

The researchers determined that the poliovirus can exploit the autophagy conduit to cunning effect. Whereas it was long believed that new polio[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/poliomyelitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] particles could exit their natal cell only by bursting it open and then seeking new cells to infect, the researchers found that the virions could piggyback to freedom along the autophagy pathway.

In that way, the virus could expand its infectious empire without destroying perfectly good viral factories en route. The researchers suspect that other so-called naked or nonenveloped viruses (like the cold virus and the enteroviruses[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/enterovirus-68-what-you-need-to-know/] that have lately plagued children in this country and Asia) could likewise spread through unconventional secretion pathways.

For their part, viruses like Ebola have figured out how to slip in and out of cells without kicking up a fuss by cloaking themselves in a layer of greasy lipids[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/fat/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] stolen from the host cell membrane, rather as you might foist a pill down a pet’s throat by smearing it in butter.

According to Eric O. Freed, the head of the virus-cell interaction section at the National Cancer Institute, several recent technological breakthroughs have revolutionized the study of viruses.

Advances in electron microscopy and super-resolved fluorescence microscopy — the subject of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/science/nobel-prize-chemistry.html] — allow scientists to track the movement of viral particles in and between cells, and to explore the fine atomic structure of a virus embraced by an antibody, or a virus clasped onto the protein lock of a cell.

Through ultrafast gene sequencing and targeted gene silencing techniques, researchers have identified genes critical to viral infection and drug resistance. “We’ve discovered viruses we didn’t even know existed,” Dr. Freed said. And that could prove important to detecting the emergence of a new lethal strain.

Gene sequencing has also allowed researchers to trace the deep background of viruses, which, at an average of a few billionths of an inch across, are far too minuscule to fossilize. In fact, viruses were first identified in the 19th century by size, as infectious agents able to pass through filters that trapped all bacteria.

Through genomic analysis, researchers have identified ancient viral codes embedded in the DNA of virtually every phyletic lineage. The unmistakable mark of a viral code? Instructions for making the capsid, the virus’s protective protein shell, which surrounds its genetic core and lends the viral particle its infectious power.

“It turns out there are not many ways to make the pieces that will snap together into an effective package,” said Dr. Enquist, of Princeton. “It’s an event that may have occurred only once or twice” in evolutionary history.

Viruses are also notable for what they lack. They have no ribosomes, the cellular components that fabricate the proteins that do all the work of keeping cells alive.

Instead, viruses carry instructions for co-opting the ribosomes of their host, and repurposing them to the job of churning out capsid and other viral proteins. Other host components are enlisted to help copy the instructions for building new viruses, in the form of DNA or RNA, and to install those concise nucleic texts in the newly constructed capsids.

“Viruses are almost miraculously devious,” Dr. Freed said. “They’re just bundles of protein and nucleic acid, and they’re able to get into cells and run the show.”

“On the one hand, they’re quite simple,” Dr. Enquist said. “On the other hand, they may be the most highly evolved form of genetic information on the planet.”

Viruses also work tirelessly to evade the immune system that seeks to destroy them. One of the deadliest features of the Ebola virus is its capacity to cripple the body’s first line of defense against a new pathogen, by blocking the release of interferon.

“That gives the virus a big advantage to grow and spread,” said Christopher F. Basler, a professor of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

At the same time, said Aftab Ansari of Emory University School of Medicine, the virus disables the body’s coagulation system, leading to uncontrolled bleeding. By the time the body can rally its second line of defense, the adaptive immune system, it is often too late.

Yet the real lethality of Ebola, Dr. Ansari said, stems from a case of mistaken location, a zoonotic jump from wild animal to human being. The normal host for Ebola virus is the fruit bat, in which the virus replicates at a moderate pace without killing or noticeably sickening the bat.

“A perfect parasite is able to replicate and not kill its host,” Dr. Ansari said. “The Ebola virus is the perfect parasite for a bat.”

Correction: October 30, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about viruses misidentified the position held by a scientist, Luis P. Villarreal, at the Center for Virus Research at the University of California, Irvine. He is a professor at the center and its founding director, but not its current director. And a picture credit with the article, using information from a publicist, misstated part of the name of the organization that publishes The Journal of Virology. It is the American Society for Microbiology — not “of” Microbiology.

Advances in microscopy have allowed scientists like Sriram Subramaniam and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute to look at the workings of tiny viruses. In this case, microscopy was used to illustrate the complex process in which human cells infected with HIV-1, green and blue, are linked to uninfected cells. | Illustration by Donald Bliss/N.I.H, from The Journal of Virology/American Society for Microbiology

Ask Well: Can You Get Ebola From a Toilet Seat?

Question:

Can I get Ebola from a toilet seat?

Answer:

In general, the disease risk of toilet seats is overrated, but you probably can get Ebola from a toilet seat.

The risk is not so much the seat itself as the whole bathroom. But not just any bathroom. The risk would come from a bathroom that an Ebola victim in an infectious phase has recently used.

The field hospitals run by Doctors Without Borders in Africa are laid out so that patients who definitely have Ebola never share toilet facilities with staff members or with patients who are only “possible” cases.

Ebola victims often lose control of their bowels and excrete copious amounts of diarrhea. They also vomit heavily. Those liquids are highly infectious. Touching them and then touching one’s eye or mouth or inside the nose could transmit the disease. Urine also carries some risk, but viral loads in urine are not nearly as high as those in vomit and feces.

For workers in Ebola field hospitals, one of the riskiest acts is touching their boots or shoe covers. The Doctors Without Bordersdisrobing protocol[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/cdc-issues-new-guidelines-for-ebola-care.html?_r=0] calls from them to slosh their feet in a bath of chlorinated water and then remove their boots with a bootjack, so as to never touch them with their hands.

In modern buildings, toilets that flush loudly and powerfully are a risk in themselves. The flushing create a mist of droplets that splash onto the face and hands or may contaminate stall surfaces.

The N.R.A.’s Instant Classic Attack Ads

We’ve written a lot lately on the Republicans’ expert use of fear — whether about Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/opinion/ebola-policies-made-in-panic-cause-more-damage.html] or Guantánamo prisoners[http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/pat-robertss-latest-campaign-tactic-guantnamo-fear-mongering] or general chaos — to drive voters to the right. But the grand master of this technique is the National Rifle Association, which thrives on putting guns in nervous hands. It has been active this year with several instant classics.

On the cover of the new election issue[http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/a9f484ab#/a9f484ab/5] of the N.R.A.’s magazine is an Islamic State fighter (waving an automatic rifle, of course) over the headline: “Chaos at our Door? A Dangerous World is Closing In.” Inside the issue, as Media Matters for America noted[http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/27/nras-election-message-vote-your-guns-because-is/201329], Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.’s chief executive, explained the relevance of this far-away group to Second Amendment issues.“It’s just a matter of time before the U.S. faces some kind of terrorist attack,” he wrote, and when that happens, Americans will want their guns at their sides because “the government can’t — or won’t — protect you.”

Building the hysteria, he concludes: “We will not be left defenseless. We will not give up our freedoms. We will not surrender our safety to the lies of leaders who promise everything and deliver nothing. On Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 4, we will defend our right to defend ourselves because we have no other choice. We will vote our guns! We will vote our freedom! And we will prevail!”

To ensure those vital freedoms, the group is running misleading ads around the country attacking Democrats and, inevitably, Michael Bloomberg. One ad running in Louisiana shows a young mother putting her baby to bed as an intruder violently kicks in the front door.

“It happens like that,” the female narrator says. “The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights. Vote like your safety depends on it. Defend your freedom. Defeat Mary Landrieu.” A similar ad is running against Senator Mark Udall of Colorado.

The N.R.A. is going after Senator Landrieu because she supported the failed 2013 bill that would have extended background checks to buyers at gun shows. That law might have kept guns out of the hands of some home intruders, or terrorists, but would not have restricted a law-abiding homeowner’s right to own a firearm. Rightly or wrongly, the Supreme Court has said it is a constitutional right.

The N.R.A. also justifies its Landrieu attack ad by pointing to her vote to confirm Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. The idea that this vote constitutes “taking away your gun rights” is really too absurd to refute, especially given the many Republicans[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/01/national-rifle-association/scary-nra-ad-claims-mary-landrieu-voted-take-away-/] who voted for Ms. Sotomayor but are not under attack by the gun lobby.

The group is also running false ads[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/10/28/nra-falsely-suggests-democratic-candidate-met-with-bloomberg/] claiming that various Democrats dared to meet with Mr. Bloomberg. But its worst commercial[http://youtu.be/lthXmy3RaC0] features a rape victim describing her assault and accusing Mr. Bloomberg of wanting to take away her right to defend herself. “Mr. Bloomberg,” she says, “you do not have the right to tell me how to defend myself.”

The former mayor is not trying to take away anyone’s legal handgun, and neither is any Democrat. But those details don’t matter. All that counts is making people very afraid, and then exploiting that fear.

How Unscientific Ebola Steps in U.S. Could Help Spread Virus Elsewhere
By ANDREW C. REVKIN

The New England Journal of Medicine has published “Ebola and Quarantine[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1413139],” an invaluable commentary by seven physicians* who warn how overreactions by American elected officials aiming to calm fears of Ebola here could make it more likely that the virus will spread in Africa and possibly other developing regions of the world. I found the piece through a link in a wise editorial in The Times on “the dangers of quarantines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/opinion/ebola-policies-made-in-panic-cause-more-damage.html?ref=opinion].”

Here’s an excerpt from the journal essay, which starts with a mention of the strict quarantine policies set initially by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/nurse-who-spoke-out-about-quarantine-felt-a-calling-for-health-care-friends-say.html], Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html] of New York and others:

The governors of a number of states, including New York and New Jersey, recently imposed 21-day quarantines on health care workers returning to the United States from regions of the world where they may have cared for patients with Ebola virus disease. We understand their motivation for this policy — to protect the citizens of their states from contracting this often-fatal illness. This approach, however, is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal. The governors’ action is like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer: it gets the job done but overall is more destructive than beneficial.

Health care professionals treating patients with this illness have learned that transmission arises from contact with bodily fluids of a person who is symptomatic — that is, has a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. We have very strong reason to believe that transmission occurs when the viral load in bodily fluids is high, on the order of millions of virions per microliter. This recognition has led to the dictum that an asymptomatic person is not contagious; field experience in West Africa has shown that conclusion to be valid. Therefore, an asymptomatic health care worker returning from treating patients with Ebola, even if he or she were infected, would not be contagious. Furthermore, we now know that fever precedes the contagious stage, allowing workers who are unknowingly infected to identify themselves before they become a threat to their community. This understanding is based on more than clinical observation: the sensitive blood polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for Ebola is often negative on the day when fever or other symptoms begin and only becomes reliably positive 2 to 3 days after symptom onset. This point is supported by the fact that of the nurses caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died from Ebola virus disease in Texas in October, only those who cared for him at the end of his life, when the number of virions he was shedding was likely to be very high, became infected. Notably, Duncan’s family members who were living in the same household for days as he was at the start of his illness did not become infected.

A cynic would say that all these “facts” are derived from observation and that it pays to be 100% safe and to isolate anyone with a remote chance of carrying the virus. What harm can that approach do besides inconveniencing a few health care workers? We strongly disagree. Hundreds of years of experience show that to stop an epidemic of this type requires controlling it at its source. Médecins sans Frontières, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and many other organizations say we need tens of thousands of additional volunteers to control the epidemic. We are far short of that goal, so the need for workers on the ground is great. These responsible, skilled health care workers who are risking their lives to help others are also helping by stemming the epidemic at its source. If we add barriers making it harder for volunteers to return to their community, we are hurting ourselves….

We should be guided by the science and not the tremendous fear that this virus evokes.

We should be honoring, not quarantining, health care workers who put their lives at risk not only to save people suffering from Ebola virus disease in West Africa but also to help achieve source control, bringing the world closer to stopping the spread of this killer epidemic. [ Read the full commentary here[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1413139] .]

For more on how a slowdown in the flow of courageous health-care workers to affected African countries could create truly calamitous outcomes, read “Ebola: Failures of Imagination[http://psandman.com/col/Ebola-3.htm],” by the risk communication analysts Jody Lanard and Peter M. Sandman. (I found their piece through Maryn McKenna’s Superbug blog[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/ebola-endemic/].) Here’s the opening section:

The alleged U.S. over-reaction to the first three domestic Ebola cases in the United States – what Maryn McKenna calls Ebolanoia[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/ebolanoia/] – is matched only by the world’s true under-reaction to the risks posed by Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. We are not referring to the current humanitarian catastrophe there, although the world has long been under-reacting to that.

We will speculate about reasons for this under-reaction in a minute. At first we thought it was mostly a risk communication problem we call “fear of fear[http://psandman.com/col/fear.htm],” but now we think it is much more complicated.

Some of the world’s top Ebola experts say they are worrying night and day about the possibility of endemic Ebola, a situation in which Ebola will continue to spread, and then presumably wax and wane repeatedly, in West Africa.

They – and we – find it difficult to understand why Ebola has not yet extended into Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, and Guinea-Bissau. (After we drafted this on October 23, a case was confirmed in Mali.)

Fewer experts refer publicly to what we think must frighten them even more (and certainly frightens us even more): the prospect of Ebola sparks landing and catching unnoticed in slums like Dharavi in Mumbai or Orangi Town in Karachi – or perhaps Makoko in Lagos. (Imagine how different recent history might have been if the late Ebola-infected Minnesota resident Patrick Sawyer had started vomiting in Makoko instead of at Lagos International Airport on July 20.) [ Read the rest [http://psandman.com/col/Ebola-3.htm].]

[Insert, Oct. 31, 3:25 p.m. | David Ropeik has written a thoughtful critique of aspects[https://medium.com/@dropeik.com/a-critique-of-the-ebola-essay-by-peter-sandman-and-jody-lanard-8107f721e066] of the Sandman/Lanard piece.]

Please also read “Panic and precaution: Ebola and the outbreak narrative[https://theconversation.com/panic-and-precaution-ebola-and-the-outbreak-narrative-32786],” a new article by Priscilla Wald, a professor of English and women’s studies at Duke University, posted on The Conversation, the innovative online portal for commentary from academia (I have a piece coming soon). Here’s an excerpt:

The current Ebola epidemic offers another lesson: the reverse of panic is not calm, but complacency. If Ebola fuels panic now, we should remember that in the early days of the epidemic the World Health Organization and others could have done more to halt the spread of Ebola. Past outbreaks suggested a more containable threat than it has proved to be in West Africa, where the ravages of poverty quickly turned the outbreak into an epidemic. A faster response may have enabled a containment of the virus before it jumped continents.

Where is the balance? How should we think about outbreaks? There is a difference between urgency and crisis, informed caution and panic. And between short-term and long-term solutions. Faced with a pandemic, the government and medical responses are appropriate. But why aren’t we doing more to keep outbreaks from becoming pandemics?

The outbreak narrative is a crisis narrative, and crises demand short-term solutions. Yet, there is no greater vector for turning an outbreak into an epidemic, and an epidemic into a pandemic than poverty. Malnourished and without adequate shelter and access to health care, people living in poverty are more susceptible to illness. We need to address poverty, not stigmatize the impoverished.

Directing resources to the problem of global poverty is a humanitarian concern. It is also a long-term commitment. The World Bank estimates that a severe epidemic of influenza could cost nearly three trillion dollars[http://www.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/en/topic/pandemics/overview], significantly more than it would cost to address the structural issues of global poverty that would contribute to a catastrophic pandemic. So why aren’t we doing so?

We need to start by telling the story of the threat differently. We need to replace the focus on survival with the question of how we should live in a global world.

Around the time New Yorkers started fretting over the city’s first diagnosis of Ebola last Thursday, Sal Pain began drawing up plans for four decontamination chambers, customized for a cramped Harlem hallway.

The narrow dimensions of the hallway — it was only four feet wide — outside the fifth-floor apartment Dr. Craig Spencer, the Ebola patient[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html], shares with his fiancée[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patients-fiance-shares-his-altruism-.html] was among the more difficult situations confronted by hazardous-materials workers in their efforts to contain the virus. The standard decontamination station, a bulging, inflatable unit, would not do.

So Mr. Pain, the chief safety officer for Bio-Recovery Corporation, which has cleaned Dr. Spencer’s apartment and the Gutter, a bowling alley Dr. Spencer had visited in Brooklyn, improvised. He lined the hallway walls with six millimeters of plastic on Friday morning, and then made a frame out of PVC pipe. About 12 hours later, after sterilizing everything from four bicycles to a cuticle cutter, the 10-member crew stood in the hallway and washed themselves with chemical and water showers.

As public officials sought to quell fear among New Yorkers, Mr. Pain and his team worked in the trenches, trying to make those reassurances real.

Despite the low chances that Dr. Spencer had contaminated the bowling alley[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/23/nyregion/new-york-city-ebola-patient-timeline-map.html] he visited on Wednesday, the night before he registered a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a hazardous-materials crew worked from about 10 p.m. on Friday to 5 a.m. on Saturday to stanch any doubt.

Wearing $1,500 protective suits, the crew of around 10 workers wiped down video game consoles and toilet seats, pool cues and billiard balls. They reached inside the finger holes in the bowling balls with a wire brush and a rag dipped in chemical cleaners. Other products were sterilized with intense heat, or an antimicrobial hospital-grade sanitizer that smelled like lemons. Mr. Pain’s chemical of choice, though, was a product developed by a federal government laboratory whose name he said he was not at liberty to reveal.

The bowling alley’s smooth floors and concrete walls simplified the cleaning, Mr. Pain said, but Dr. Spencer’s apartment was more cluttered. He also did not expect the apartment to be as big as it was, over 1,000 square feet.

By midnight on Friday, Mr. Pain said, the workers had combed every surface of Dr. Spencer’s home. Certain high-contact items were removed: bedding, soap from the shower, personal hygiene products and food. (The Ebola virus, Mr. Pain said, lives longer in cold environments like that of a refrigerator.)

Most of their possessions survived, but only after enduring a chemical assault. The floor was cleaned in part with a 10 percent bleach solution, the method that Mr. Pain said was recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mr. Pain was prohibited from saying whether workers encountered any bodily fluids in the home. “It definitely needed cleanup,” he said.

Workers sanitized couches, four bicycles and “all other sorts of people stuff,” Mr. Pain recalled. No item was too small; even a safety pin in Dr. Spencer’s medicine cabinet was doused.

“I don’t care if it’s used for popping a pimple,” Mr. Pain said, “there could be plasma on it.”

He continued, “It’s for us to be comfortable, and for the doctor when he gets home to be comfortable.” Dr. Spencer’s fiancée, Morgan Dixon, returned to the apartment on Saturday evening.

In his line of work, Mr. Pain said, public officials are as often a hindrance as they are a source of support. Bio-Recovery, which is based on Long Island, had firsthand experience with such bureaucratic barriers in Dallas a few weeks ago, when public officials offering them a contract refused to pay for the most secure protective equipment, he said.

New York City officials, on the other hand, drew on weeks of extensive preparation, Mr. Pain said. Even before Dr. Spencer’s Ebola test came back positive, Bio-Recovery was working on drafting a contract with the city. Mr. Pain stayed on the phone with high-level officials until 3 a.m. on Friday.

“They gave us carte blanche to get it done,” Mr. Pain said.

Debra Sharpe, a Birmingham, Ala., biosafety expert who has run a company that trained workers to handle biological agents, said only a small number of companies across the country were equipped to perform such cleanups. But, she added, cleaning locations like the bowling alley, that are unlikely to be contaminated, only spreads anxiety.

“If you say that you cannot transmit Ebola if you’re not showing symptoms, then you don’t need to go clean the bowling alley,” she said. “I think you’re giving the public a mixed signal.”

Mr. Pain said his crew, which also helped New York City during the anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] scare in 2001, was working under an intense level of scrutiny. News cameras surrounded them as they walked out of Dr. Spencer’s apartment with what he estimated was about 1,000 pounds of material, most of it the crew’s equipment. Even hedge fund investors have started calling his office, hoping to capitalize on the sudden clamor for the company’s services.

“Most of the time, it’s just another day at the office,” Mr. Pain said. “But this one actually got me.”

WASHINGTON — The federal government on Monday tried to take charge of an increasingly acrimonious national debate over how to treat people in contact with Ebola patients by announcing guidelines that stopped short of tough measures in New York and New Jersey and were carefully devised, officials said, not to harm the effort to recruit badly needed medical workers to West Africa.

But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York and Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey denounced the guidelines as unsafe for the people of their states, and the Pentagon appeared to be charting an entirely different course as well. Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, ordered a 21-day “controlled monitoring period” that could isolate hundreds of troops on their American bases, away from their families, when they return from the Ebola zone in West Africa.

The new policy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], worked out by President Obama, top C.D.C. officials and others during a two-hour meeting at the White House on Sunday, requires people who have been in contact with Ebola patients to submit to an in-person checkup and a phone call from a local public health authority.

But unlike in New York and New Jersey, people would not be automatically confined to their homes, a requirement that public health experts had sharply criticized as too onerous.

On Monday evening Mr. Christie accused the C.D.C. of “being behind on this” and said demands from the public to protect citizens had prompted the tougher action in his state.

“What people of this country want is for us to protect, first and foremost, the public safety and public health of our citizens,” Mr. Christie said[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/27/christie-on-ebola-i-didnt-reverse-my-decision/]. But he agreed to release a nurse who had been quarantined in a tent at a hospital so she could travel to Maine, where she lives.

Mr. Cuomo was already criticizing the new guidelines ahead of their formal announcement. “I work with the federal government, but I disagree with the C.D.C.,” the governor told reporters on Monday afternoon. “My No. 1 job is to protect the people of the state of New York, and do what I think is prudent to protect the people of the state of New York.”

Later in the day in New York, a 5-year-old boy who recently traveled from the West African nation of Guinea tested negative for Ebola after he was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with symptoms consistent with the disease.

And in Baltimore, a potential Ebola patient was placed in isolation at the University of Maryland Medical Center, the hospital said in a statement Monday night. No other details were released.

The long-awaited federal guidelines were an effort to bring uniformity to a messy patchwork of responses by states, including Florida, Illinois and, most recently, Georgia, which have all announced tougher policies. But the C.D.C. do not have the power to police internal public health matters, so it is up to the states to carry out the policy, and it is far from clear that they will fall in line.

The race between the states and the federal government to set health policy came just days before the midterm elections next Tuesday, and already was punctuated by a political test of wills. Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo have maintained that their tougher quarantine policies are necessary to protect the public, even as they have scaled them back some. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal announced that some travelers who had displayed no symptoms but reported “direct exposure” to Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined and held at “a designated facility.”

David Fidler, a law professor and quarantine expert at Indiana University, said: “The problem we are facing is that it’s a patchwork within a patchwork. Now we’ve got the political parade of follies going on. It’s the worst of all possible outcomes.”

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., said his agency was talking with states, but he did not say which ones.

“We found that health departments generally do follow C.D.C. guidelines,” he said. “If they wish them to be more stringent, that is within their authority.”

It was unclear what role Ron Klain, President Obama’s designee in charge of managing the response to Ebola between federal and state authorities, played in the standoff between the White House and the governors. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Klain was running “intensive coordination among a range of federal agencies to respond to this very difficult challenge.”

Nonprofit groups like Doctors Without Borders praised the C.D.C.’s more gradual approach, saying it would not harm their efforts to recruit medical workers to West Africa, where the disease is raging. Officials estimate that only half of 1,000 urgently needed foreign medical workers have deployed to West Africa and had said that more stringent measures for those returning to the United States would seriously impede that effort.

“We cannot bend the curve of this epidemic without these people,” said Gayle Smith, senior director at the National Security Council. “When you’ve got people saying, ‘I’m willing to go into the line of fire of this epidemic,’ we need to be certain that we are treating them properly when they come out.”

The C.D.C. guidelines place returning travelers in graduated categories of risk, but only those of highest risk — a health worker who had been pricked by a needle while treating an Ebola patient, for example — would be confined to their homes and barred from public transportation like the subway.

The vast majority would fall into a middle category under which they would be required to have a face-to-face check-in with a local health care authority once a day and additionally to call daily with their temperature, but not be limited in movement unless they started showing symptoms.

Federal officials say that the numbers of such travelers are small and that they arrive in only a handful of American states. Approximately 100 people a day arrive in the United States from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the three countries hit hardest by Ebola, most of them American citizens or permanent residents. About 70 percent of them arrive in six states: New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia.

As the policy feud unfolded in Washington, scores of American health care workers began work in Monrovia, Liberia. Under a billowing white canvas structure near the airport, Rear Adm. Scott F. Giberson, acting United States deputy surgeon general, welcomed a 65-member United States Public Health Service team. The group, which included doctors, nurses, pharmacists and hygienists, will operate an Ebola unit built by the American military, the first specifically intended to treat international and Liberian health workers.

As for states adopting different policies for returning health care workers: “I hope that the science shines through,” Admiral Giberson said.

Many health workers in the United States said the treatment of the quarantined nurse, Kaci Hickox, was a cautionary tale for volunteers who are considering going to West Africa.

“I was thinking of going, but it was hard enough for me to get four to six weeks to go,” said Elizabeth Downs, a nurse and educator at Emory University. “Now that I know it’s going to be nine weeks, there’s no way I can go.”

Sheila Davis, the chief nursing officer with Partners in Health, a nonprofit group involved in staffing treatment centers in West Africa, said that “people are freaked out” about the mandatory quarantine orders. Ms. Davis, who is scheduled to go back to West Africa for the second time since the outbreak started in the next few weeks, said her effort to recruit medical volunteers, an already uphill climb, had now gotten even tougher.

“This is just a huge deterrent,” Ms. Davis said.

Dr. Tim Evans, senior director for health, nutrition and population at the World Bank Group, said that there was a need for 700 to 1,000 foreign health workers in the three affected countries to staff the new Ebola treatment units, but that the current supply was only about half that. He characterized the current numbers of incoming workers as a “trickle.”

If health care workers could not be reassured “of safety and security, and of being able to return home and integrate reasonably, then we will continue to have a trickle rather than the requisite flow,” he said in a phone interview from Liberia.

Reporting was contributed by Sheri Fink from Monrovia, Liberia; Kristin Hussey from Groton, Conn.; Alan Blinder from Atlanta; and Marc Santora and Liz Robbins from New York.

Fight against Ebola meets reality; Health workers treating cases in West Africa learn how to ration care

Garmai Sayon endured more than anyone should have to bear. First, her husband died at the Ebola treatment center here, falling ill after rushing to help a stranger who had collapsed in their village. Five days later, their child — a 1-year-old boy whose two older siblings had been lost earlier to illness and accident — died in her arms while she was delirious from the disease.

Doctors and nurses tended to the young woman as she had fevers, suffered pain all over her body and lay listless, confused. ‘‘I just gave my heart to God,’’ Ms. Sayon recalled.

As her symptoms began to abate, her arm grew hot and swelled to twice its size, prompting fears of sepsis, an often deadly complication of infection. It most likely stemmed from where her intravenous line had been inserted but not changed as often as desirable because of risks, both to her and to the medical workers. Ms. Sayon had survived Ebola, but it was not yet certain that she would survive the treatment.

What level of care is possible for a disease with no cure being treated in wooden huts in the middle of a forest? How do medical workers prioritize which patients and tasks to focus on when they cannot do everything they were trained to do? Will their decisions determine who lives and who dies? And how would they even know?

‘‘You always want to do more, but it has to be balanced with what’s possible, with what makes sense for the context you’re working in,’’ said Dr. Pranav Shetty, the medical director at the center operated here by International Medical Corps.

Because of the limited time they can spend in the sick wards in their stifling protective suits, the risks of certain procedures and even the amount of medicines available, health workers here and elsewhere in West Africa ration care, operating under constraints they often find frustrating. The mainstays of fighting the Ebola epidemic — isolation and basic treatment — have resulted in more dead than survivors among those infected, just like with Ms. Sayon’s family.

Nurses and doctors here improvise, taking small steps in hopes of improving the odds. They tie ropes to the rafters to hang IVs, then use blood-pressure cuffs to squeeze the bags of fluids into patients faster. Doctors prescribe a regimen of antibiotics and antimalarial medications to treat every patient for possible other illnesses coexisting with Ebola, because they do not have access to tests for them. ‘‘It’s surprising how much you can do without,’’ said Dr. Steve Whiteley, an emergency medicine doctor from California, one of six physicians currently on rotation here.

But, he said, that is not nearly enough. So far, the clinic’s record appears similar to that of other treatment facilities in the countries hit hard by Ebola. From mid-September, when the clinic opened, to Monday morning, 36 patients who tested positive for the disease died; 21 recovered; and others remained in treatment. Its fatality rate of 63 percent could change, as such measures tend to fluctuate.

In the treatment wards, some of medicine’s most basic tools are hard to use. With their heads wrapped in protective coverings, the doctors and nurses do not use a stethoscope to listen for heart or breath sounds. Manual blood-pressure measurements present similar problems. Their hands sheathed in three pairs of gloves, the medical workers often struggle to find a vein by touch in order to draw blood. They do not keep detailed patient charts in the steamy wards — it is damp and difficult to see through fogged goggles — or remove notes because they would have to be disinfected.

The single lab test performed on patients here, a high-tech analysis that detects the virus, proved troublesome in the clinic’s first two weeks. A blood sample from Ms. Sayon, 23, for example, was drawn Sept. 28, the day after her arrival, but was lost after being handed over for shipment to a lab in the capital, Monrovia, more than four hours away. That experience was not uncommon, workers at the center said. Ms. Sayon was retested five days later, after a mobile Ebola detection laboratory of the United States Navy opened near the treatment center, cutting to hours from days the time required for a diagnosis.

‘‘Is she the one who lost her baby and husband?’’ Dr. Steven Hatch, a volunteer from Worcester, Mass., asked during rounds one day at a whiteboard outside the wards, where staff members gathered after being sprayed down with a bleach solution and removing their protective suits. They wrote brief notes from memory about their patients.

The medical team later discussed the possibility of bringing scanners to copy and send notes from inside the wards, or using walkie-talkies to relay information to those outside. ‘‘It’s too hard to keep track of all the patients in your head,’’ Dr. Whiteley said.

He and others often rely on their instincts and experience. When Ms. Sayon’s second blood test for Ebola came back, the results were negative, but the doctors were wary of releasing her. She was bent over in a chair, shaking. Her eyes and cheeks were sunken. Keeping her in the ward for suspected cases risked infecting her with the virus, but the physicians reasoned she already had significant exposure from her family, and virus detection can sometimes lag symptoms by up to three days. (They also suspected there might have been a mix-up because of labeling problems that day with blood samples that the new center quickly worked to fix.)

‘‘Solomon would be on his knees after a week here,’’ Dr. Hatch said. ‘‘Every day there’s a new dilemma we haven’t considered.’’

Perhaps the most potent tool the doctors and nurses have available for patients who cannot keep down liquids are IV fluids, to combat dehydration that can set off a deadly cascade: low blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances and organ failure. IV lines, though, pose certain risks. They require a needle, which can endanger health workers, and the insertion site should be changed frequently, which can harm Ebola patients vulnerable to bleeding. Also, the bag of fluids and the tubing are being removed when no nurses or doctors are present to prevent injury if a patient dislodges the apparatus. Like many others at the center, Ms. Sayon had begun receiving IV fluids soon after her arrival.

‘‘It would just be nice to have a better gauge of who needs it and how much,’’ said Dr. Whiteley, who practices at Kaiser Vallejo in Northern California. ‘‘I’d like to have more to go on than an educated guess.’’

One way to determine patients’ requirements would be to track their weights, but staff members had little time to do that, and some patients were too sick to step onto a scale, anyway. So doctors here used a cruder measure: They asked the patients whether they were drinking and urinating.

The most precise method, though, would require more drawing of blood and lab work. Miniature bedside lab units can provide data that would allow doctors to tailor daily treatments to each patient by adjusting levels of potassium or sodium, for example. That sort of tweaking is believed to have played a significant role in successfully treating health care workers with Ebola in the United States and Europe.

But Dr. Whiteley sounded discouraged about the outcome of what he describes as compassionate, but bare-bones, care. ‘‘Our mortality is horrible,’’ he said. ‘‘We all need to do more than we are doing if we think we are providing medical care consistent with modernity.’’

Amber Joy Vinson, Dallas Nurse Treated for Ebola, Released From Hospital

ATLANTA — A Dallas nurse whose Ebola diagnosis and airline trips elevated public concerns that the virus could spread in the United States was discharged from a hospital here on Tuesday.

The nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, spent less than two weeks in a specialized ward at Emory University Hospital before doctors said she was free of the virus, which has infected more than 10,000 people, mostly in West Africa, in an outbreak this year. Ms. Vinson is one of four people to test positive for Ebola in the United States, although hospitals have treated others who got the virus while abroad.

“I am so grateful to be well, and first and foremost, I want to thank God,” Ms. Vinson said at a news conference on Tuesday at Emory, which since August has successfully treated three other patients with Ebola.

She did not discuss the circumstances of her infection, nor her activities in the days before her diagnosis.

Ms. Vinson was among the employees of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who were involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in late September. He died on Oct. 8. In addition to Ms. Vinson, another nurse at Presbyterian, Nina Pham, was infected; she was released last week[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/us/nina-pham-free-of-ebola-virus.html] from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md.

Ms. Vinson was transferred to Emory on Oct. 15, within hours of her diagnosis. Emory in August was the first American hospital to treat Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/two-us-ebola-patients-are-released-by-atlanta-hospital.html] patients[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/two-us-ebola-patients-are-released-by-atlanta-hospital.html], who had contracted the disease in West Africa. She was housed within the hospital’s serious communicable disease unit, where her contact with nonmedical personnel was limited.

“Now that Ebola virus transmission has occurred in the United States, we all recognize that there is a lot of anxiety in the community, and that is understandable,” said Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, the infectious diseases specialist who has overseen the care of Ebola patients at Emory. “But the American health care system has been able to successfully treat patients with Ebola virus disease. We have the resources, we have the expertise, and we have the knowledge.”

Emory doctors have applied a regimen of “supportive care” for the hospital’s Ebola patients, emphasizing the maintenance of vital signs, like breathing and blood pressure. Ms. Vinson also received plasma donations from Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the first two patients treated for Ebola at Emory.

On Tuesday, as Emory marked its fourth successful treatment in less than three months, Dr. Ribner said he believed the hospital’s experience had reshaped thinking about Ebola protocols.

“The general dogma in our industry in July was that if patients got so ill that they required dialysis or ventilator support, there was no purpose in doing those interventions because they would invariably die,” he said. “I think we have shown our colleagues in the U.S. and elsewhere that that is certainly not the case, and therefore, I think we have changed the algorithm for how aggressive we are going to be willing to be in caring for patients with Ebola virus disease.”

Although Ms. Pham was found to have Ebola first, it was Ms. Vinson’s case and her trips on commercial airliners that broadened the concern about the disease in a country that was already on edge.

In the days before reporting symptoms of the disease, Ms. Vinson traveled from Dallas to Cleveland and back aboard two Frontier Airlines flights. Although public health authorities said passengers on those flights were at limited risk for Ebola, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention placed hundreds under monitoring, and Texas officials asked some travelers who had been seated near Ms. Vinson to remain at home. Still others opted for self-quarantines of 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola.

In Ohio, officials closed some schools, and dozens of residents were placed under monitoring for symptoms.

Ms. Vinson’s travel became the subject of a fierce public debate, which included, in some instances, condemnation for behavior some regarded as reckless. But Ms. Vinson’s family said that health officials had approved her plan to fly, a revelation that led to a public apology from the authorities.

“Amber Vinson did nothing wrong,” Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive, said this month. “To the extent that it would help her family in healing, on behalf of the joint team — one team, one fight — and the decision makers who made that decision, I apologize for us.”

The authorities then imposed limits on the activities of health care workers involved in treating patients diagnosed with Ebola, including restrictions on commercial air travel.

Dr. Ribner said he did not know “specific details” about how Ms. Vinson contracted the virus. Ms. Vinson elected not to take questions.

The mood at Emory on Tuesday was celebratory. Before Ms. Vinson departed, her medical team applauded her and offered a round of hugs. As one doctor leaned in toward Ms. Vinson, he simply said, “Take care, girl.”

Joint Chiefs Chairman Urges 21-Day Quarantine for Troops Working in Ebola Zone

WASHINGTON — Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Tuesday that all members of the armed services working in Ebola-stricken West African countries undergo mandatory 21-day quarantines upon their return to the United States.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Mr. Hagel was expected to announce shortly that he would follow the recommendation.

The recommendation follows a directive from Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, who has ordered a 21-day “controlled monitoring”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/ebola-us.html] period for Army personnel returning from the Ebola zone in West Africa. Army officials are not using the word “quarantine,” but they said that returning soldiers would be isolated in separate buildings on American bases and would not be allowed to see their families for 21 days.

General Dempsey’s recommendation came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/new-rules-coming-for-health-care-workers-returning-from-west-africa.html] to states on how to treat civilian health workers when they return to the United States from West Africa. Officials recommended against automatic quarantines but said that health workers should be actively monitored for symptoms of Ebola.

President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] on Tuesday called the new guidelines “sensible, based in science” and said they would help keep Americans safe while not discouraging volunteers from traveling to West Africa to battle the disease at its source.

“This disease can be contained,” Mr. Obama said in a brief statement at the White House before leaving for a campaign rally in Milwaukee for Mary Burke, a candidate for governor in Wisconsin. “It will be defeated. Progress is possible, but we are going to have to stay vigilant.”

Of the aid workers who are in Africa, Mr. Obama said: “They are doing God’s work.”

Also on Tuesday, a Dallas nurse whose Ebola diagnosis and airline trips elevated public concerns that the virus could spread in the United States was discharged from a hospital in Atlanta.

The nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, spent less than two weeks in a specialized ward at Emory University Hospital before doctors said she was free of the virus, which has infected more than 10,000 people, mostly in West Africa, in an outbreak this year.

Ms. Vinson is one of four people to test positive for Ebola in the United States, although hospitals have treated others who got the virus while abroad.

“I am so grateful to be well, and first and foremost, I want to thank God,” Ms. Vinson said at a news conference on Tuesday at Emory, which since August has successfully treated three other patients with Ebola.

In recent weeks the Obama administration has struggled to present a unified approach to dealing with those who return to the United States from the Ebola hot spots. That issue was complicated over the weekend when the governors of New York and .0New Jersey called for quarantines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/new-york-ebola-case-craig-spencer.html] that federal officials say are not medically necessary.

On Tuesday, White House officials tried to explain why the military guidelines outlined by General Odierno are different from those for civilian health workers. Soldiers in West Africa, who are not directly providing health care to patients in those countries, have far less contact with Ebola patients than do civilian nurses and doctors in those countries who will not face quarantines under the C.D.C. guidelines.

Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said it would be more efficient for the Army to simply isolate all of its returning soldiers rather than trying to assess which ones present greater risks for contracting Ebola.

“The men and women who are being deployed to West Africa are coming from military installations around the world,” Mr. Earnest said. “And so for the sake of efficiency, there’s an obvious benefit to restricting the movements of these individuals so that their health can be monitored consistent with scientific guidelines.”

Defense officials said that the large number of American military personnel deploying to West Africa — which could eventually reach 3,900 troops — coupled with anxiety among family members and the relative ease of isolating returning service members on bases were all factors that led to the decision to go further than the White House and the C.D.C. had recommended.

In his remarks, Mr. Obama defended the C.D.C. guidelines for civilians, saying they protect Americans at home while not unduly burdening health workers in Africa. He called the situation with members of the military different, in part because they are not going to Africa voluntarily.

“We don’t expect them to have similar rules, and by definition, they’re working under more circumscribed circumstances,” Mr. Obama said.

Unease Lingers in Bronx Despite Boy's Negative Test for a Virus

Fliers about Ebola, given out by city health workers, were crumpled and left on the floor in the hallways of the tan, brick building at East 172nd Street in the Bronx, a reminder of the scare Monday when a 5-year-old boy on the fourth floor became ill.

After a day of rising panic in the neighborhood, his test for the disease came back negative on Monday evening.

Still, on Tuesday afternoon, Jahnay Tucker, 14, carefully wrapped a striped scarf around her face before climbing the stairs with her father to their sixth-floor apartment. She kept her hands at her side, making sure not to touch anything. Last week, she recalled, she had passed the boy and his mother in the building.

''I was scared; I thought he really had it,'' said Jahnay, who is in ninth grade. ''I'm still worried. They should double-check.''

Her father, Richard Tucker, 45, said they had been ready to move out Monday night from their home of four years if the boy had tested positive for Ebola. Mr. Tucker, a truck driver, said he not only feared contracting the virus, but also being quarantined because he has bills to pay and cannot afford to miss work. ''It hit so close to home,'' he said.

The Tuckers' building in the Soundview neighborhood emerged briefly as the city's latest hot spot in the battle against Ebola on Monday after the boy was admitted to Bellevue Hospital Center. As police officers stood watch, city health workers passed out informational fliers. Some of the building's residents stood outside for hours, telling friends that they were simply too scared to go back inside.

A day later, much of that fear and panic had dissipated, but not all. Many people said that their initial relief that Ebola was not in their midst was tempered by a lingering unease that it could still come. There was even suspicion that perhaps it already had, with some questioning whether the test results for the boy were accurate or if city and hospital officials were really telling the truth about them.

''How do you know? He's still in the hospital,'' said Alexandria Studwood, 28, who waited down the street to pick up her sons from an elementary school. ''I'm buying my kids masks and they're going to wear them to school. I'm dead serious.''

Bronx borough leaders and city health officials plan to address some of the community's concerns about Ebola at a town-hall-style meeting on Wednesday evening at the Bronx Museum of the Arts on the Grand Concourse. ''We have seen far too much hysteria surrounding the issue of the Ebola virus,'' said Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president.

Claudette Lindsay, 50, a home health aide who lives across from the boy's building, said she worried that growing fears about Ebola could fuel attacks against West Africans in the Bronx. She recalled that in the 1980s, when she lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn, some of her Haitian-born neighbors became targets after AIDS and then H.I.V. became associated with that country.

''I don't want what happened in the '80s to happen to the African community,'' she said. ''It's a disease that anyone can get, but people are stereotyping that Africans carry the Ebola virus and it's not true.''

The boy's building is on a busy residential street near several schools, and is known for having a large number of West African residents, neighbors said. As word of the possible Ebola case spread Monday, police officers, health workers and journalists descended on the block. Panicked mothers broke into tears, while children screamed ''Ebola'' at one another. One mother was heard telling her son, ''You will not be going back to school for a very long time.''

''This is kind of crazy,'' said David Cruz, 36, at the time. ''I'm always seeing it in the news, but you never expect it to be here. It could spread like wildfire around here.''

Sekou Toure, 46, a Liberian immigrant who knows the boy's family, said they had recently returned from visiting relatives in Guinea for several weeks. He said that the boy's father worked as a driver, and his mother as a hairdresser, and that the family regularly attended services at a mosque in the Bronx.

Manny Martinez, the superintendent of a building down the block, said he saw two ambulances and several Fire Department vehicles pull up to the boy's building around 9:30 p.m. Sunday. By 10:30 p.m., he said, two people in protective suits had emerged with the boy, who was almost entirely covered up, with only his eyes exposed.

''He looked like a mummy,'' Mr. Martinez said. ''They're regular people. I feel sorry for that little kid. I hope he gets better.''

As of Tuesday evening, the boy remained hospitalized, a city official said. His family did not answer a knock on their door.

On the street, neighborhood life had resumed as people walked by the building without another glance and mothers gathered outside the nearby schools to pick up their children. But some nerves remained frayed.

''It's still scary because you don't know how many other kids around here may have it,'' said Shaila Sosa, 27, a mother of seven children. ''You're thinking it's a little minor cold and it could be something worse.''

Clockwise from top, Richard Tucker, and his daughter Jahnay, 14, were set to leave their Bronx home if a neighbor had tested positive for Ebola. Fliers littered the building's halls on Tuesday. Claudette Lindsay worries that fear of the disease could fuel violence. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY KIRSTEN LUCE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Connecticut Tries to Find Middle Path on Ebola

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, seeking to avoid the public criticism over stringent and still-shifting Ebola quarantine policies that has buffeted his counterparts in New York and New Jersey, affirmed a case-by-case approach to quarantines this week that he positioned as a middle path between federal guidelines and more onerous state policies.

But such reassurances have not quelled public opposition, with some people concerned that an ad hoc system exposes travelers to abusive treatment.

Connecticut's policy, which has been in effect since Mr. Malloy issued an order on Oct. 7 authorizing the state health commissioner to quarantine travelers, has already been invoked to confine nine people to their homes, though one of those orders was rescinded on Monday.

All travelers arriving in Connecticut from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone are required to undergo 21 days of mandatory active monitoring by local health officials, who contact them daily to get their temperature and determine whether they are feeling symptoms of the virus. They may be subject to a mandatory quarantine after state health officials, who identify such travelers with the help of federal authorities, gather details of their travel histories and potential exposure to the virus.

''With the news of a recent traveler with Ebola in neighboring New York, it is critical that we look at each case on an individual basis,'' Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, said in a statement on Monday evening. The governor, who is up for re-election next week, added that the State Department of Public Health ''will continue to err on the side of caution in each and every circumstance.''

But civil liberties groups argue that caution has pushed the state beyond its stipulated guidelines.

Ryan Boyko, a doctoral candidate in epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health who has been isolated in his apartment since Oct. 18, is among those speaking out against the policy. Shortly after returning from Liberia, Mr. Boyko had gone to the hospital after developing diarrhea and a slight fever, setting off a media frenzy over what some worried would become the first Ebola diagnosis in the Northeast.

Ebola tests came back negative, but he was handed a quarantine order. Mr. Boyko, 30, said he had not been interviewed directly by public health officials before the order was issued and did not believe he had come into contact with symptomatic Ebola patients in Liberia, where he was working on a disease-tracking system.

A New Haven Police Department cruiser now sits outside his apartment 24 hours a day, Mr. Boyko said. ''It feels like I'm being treated like a criminal,'' he said, adding: ''I'm trying to do the right thing the whole time, both by going to Liberia and monitoring my symptoms and reporting them. And then I'm treated like I'm not trustworthy or I have to be locked away.''

Another Yale student who traveled to Liberia is also under quarantine in Connecticut, as well as a family of six who recently returned from West Africa. State officials say that all eight people are asymptomatic.

Like Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo in New York and Chris Christie in New Jersey, Mr. Malloy has described the policy as ''more stringent'' than the requirements issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But officials in Connecticut have emphasized that their policy averts a blanket quarantine policy that applies to all health care workers returning from West Africa.

In conversations with Connecticut officials, the Obama administration has not expressed the same reservations about the state's policy as it has with New York's stricter order, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Still, legal experts say the policy could expose people to needless confinement.Others worried that West African citizens will be singled out. ''It's going to promote a stigma on the community,'' said Joseph Morris Kalapele, president of the Liberian Community Association of Connecticut. ''It's not as accepting as Connecticut should be.''

New York’s Ebola Rules to Let Travelers Pick Site for Isolation

Offering the first detailed account of how New York State’s quarantine order for travelers returning from West Africa will be put into effect, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s administration has issued guidelines that go beyond federal recommendations but seek to allow people to choose where to spend their enforced isolation.

The state protocols show an effort by the administration to portray the quarantine, which has been criticized as excessive by some experts and doctors’ organizations, in a humane manner.

The protocols are meant to ensure “a respectful and supportive approach” to arriving travelers, who are supposed to be “treated with the utmost respect and concern,” according to a document prepared by the State Health Department that outlines the screening procedures.

Although Mr. Cuomo warned of the possibility of quarantine “at a government-regulated facility” when he and Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey first announced the policy last week, the state protocols make clear that is not the state’s desired option for travelers arriving in New York. “Preference should be given to quarantining the passenger in his or her residence,” the Health Department document says.

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said on Tuesday that no one had flown into Kennedy International Airport from the affected region since the order was put in place.

Public health experts say that the restrictions are unnecessary since Ebola patients are not known to be contagious before they show symptoms, and that the limits will discourage doctors and nurses from going to Africa to contain the disease.

The New England Journal of Medicine[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_england_journal_of_medicine/index.html?inline=nyt-org], in an editorial published on its website[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1413139?query=featured_ebola&%20], said the approach taken by New Jersey, New York and several other states “is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal.”

President Obama, speaking at the White House on Tuesday, echoed that sentiment. “I want to make sure that every policy we put in place is supportive of their efforts,” he said. While not commenting specifically on the quarantine orders of several states, he said it was important that decisions be made based on science, not fear.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] issued guidelines on Monday, calling for travelers returning to the United States who have been exposed to Ebola patients to isolate themselves voluntarily.

The new guidelines expanded on previous protocols and called for some restricted movement, saying returning medical workers should not, for instance, fly on commercial airlines during the 21-day monitoring period. The federal guidelines, however, do not go as far as the mandatory quarantines, imposed under the force of law, in place in New York, New Jersey and several other states.

The New Jersey Health Department did not respond to requests for information about the state’s order or about any guidance it was providing to workers at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kaci Hickox, a nurse who was quarantined for three days in a Newark hospital and criticized her treatment[http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece] in an essay on a newspaper’s website, was resting in Maine on Tuesday, her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, said. He shared a photo of her resting under a blanket, saying, “Finally a bit of well-deserved rest after such a long ordeal.”

Maine health officials said they would make “every possible effort to implement an agreed-upon in-home quarantine” of 21 days for workers returning from West Africa.

On Tuesday night, Ms. Hickox’s lawyers said that they had agreed only to a two-day in-home quarantine and that if state officials moved to prevent her from going out, they would challenge those restrictions in court. Ms. Hickox has agreed to monitoring and health checks, but feels that the additional requirements by the state are not appropriate, her lawyer Steven Hyman said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo told reporters that he was comfortable being criticized for acting too cautiously, and said that asking people to remain at home for 21 days was not overly burdensome. “It’s not like we’re asking people to do hard labor,” he said.

Mr. Cuomo said the C.D.C. viewed New York’s policy as “too cautious,” but pointed out that the United States Army had adopted a similar approach. “I think the C.D.C. should talk to the Army and work it out with them first,” he said.

The New York protocols require a quarantine for people living or staying in the state if they met the definition of “direct contact” while in an Ebola-ravaged country. Examples of “direct contact” include touching the body or bodily fluids of a patient, or a person with symptoms of Ebola, even while in protective clothing; coming within three feet of an Ebola patient without protection; living in the same home as an Ebola patient; and being without protection in the same enclosed space as a patient for a “prolonged period of time,” as determined case by case.

Local health officials are responsible for visiting quarantined travelers twice a day, checking their health and taking their temperatures. Relatives may stay in the home; visitors must be approved by the local health department. Mr. Cuomo has said the state would compensate quarantined people for lost income.

For a traveler meeting the quarantine criteria and who is planning to stay in a hotel, the state would determine if that location was appropriate and, if not, find an alternative. For those with connecting flights, New York will inform the state where they are headed. Depending on circumstances, they may be allowed on the flight or taken by alternative transportation.

• Two years on.

Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], after a lethal run through the Caribbean, made landfall in southern New Jersey on this day in 2012, sweeping through the Northeast[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/stronger-family-bonds-two-years-after-hurricane-sandy.html] and leaving 117 dead in the United States before heading into Canada.

Many memorial events[http://pix11.com/2014/10/29/life-after-hurricane-sandy-memorial-events-for-2nd-anniversary/] are planned.

• Bipartisan compromise.

In “Rival Survival,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, are left on a remote island for a week and must work together.

The show was filmed in the Marshall Islands during the Senate’s August recess (10 p.m. Eastern, Discovery).

• Lots and lots of deadlines.

The Hartford Courant, recognized by some[http://connecticuthistory.org/the-oldest-newspaper-in-continuous-publication/] as the nation’s oldest continuously published paper, published[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/for-the-hartford-courant-250-years-in-print.html] its first edition 250 years ago today. It started as a weekly newspaper, and its daily edition began in 1837.

BACK STORY

The economy has been expanding for five years since the end of the Great Recession[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/30/business/economy/30econ.html]. So incumbents should be sitting pretty heading into Election Day, right?

It hasn’t worked out that way.

On this day in 2009, the Commerce Department announced that, after 18 months of contraction, the economy had finally turned around.

But the recovery has been unusually slow. Despite G.D.P. growth, household income has fallen[http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/commentaries/Real-Incomes-Five-Years-After-the-Great-Recession.php], millions of people have dropped out of the labor market, and public sector jobs are still lagging[http://www.epi.org/blog/watch-jobs-day-years-official-recession/].

It has felt so grim that as recently as March, more than half of the respondents in an NBC-Wall Street Journal survey said they believed that the U.S. was still in recession[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-fieldhouse/five-years-after-the-grea_b_5530597.html].

And voter confidence in the economy tends to lag behind the actual numbers. So pundits are not counting on the economy to generate good will for incumbents.

One Democratic pollster described voters’ position as this[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/business/economy/monthly-jobs-report-september.html]: “What you’re telling me is the water in my basement has dropped a third, but what I’m telling you, I’ve got water in the basement.”

Ask Well: Is the Ebola Epidemic Ending in Africa?
By DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.

Q: Is the Ebola epidemic ending in Africa?

A: No one knows exactly what is going on in West Africa. Several medical groups, like Doctors Without Borders, are reporting that they suddenly have far more beds than patients[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/world/africa/in-liberia-a-good-or-very-bad-sign-empty-beds-.html]. In some cases, there are empty beds at centers where, just a few weeks ago, people were dying on the streets outside because there was no room.

The trend is especially noted in Liberia, the hardest-hit country. Laboratories are getting fewer samples to test. Ambulance crews are picking up fewer bodies. The World Health Organization confirmed that new cases were dropping.

But health authorities are warning that it is too early to celebrate.

It is important to remember that this happened once before, on a smaller scale. In March, after alarming reports from Guinea that a rural outbreak had reached the capital, the W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent experts in to help. The epidemic spread to Sierra Leone, and then to Liberia. But cases grew only slowly, and by May, most of the experts were withdrawn. At the time, there was more worry about MERS in Saudi Arabia[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/health/saudi-arabia-mers-toll-revised.html].

In early August, the chief scientist for Britain’s foreign aid agency said the “end of the epidemic was in sight.” He was wrong. About 800 people were known to be dead then. Cases had actually begun to explode in July, and now about 5,000 are dead.

There are some theories as to why the numbers seem to be going down. The leading one is that more West Africans now believe that Ebola exists, are afraid of it, and are touching each other less.

In that way, it is like lung cancer, only on a speeded-up time scale. It took 30 years for Americans to fully accept that smoking caused lung cancer. Once they believed, fewer started smoking. Deaths from lung cancer are now much lower than they used to be because many Americans in their 50’s and 60’s didn’t start as teenagers, or quit. But you wouldn’t say that the lung cancer epidemic is over.

Because poor West Africans often have many people sleeping in one room, Ebola spreads in households. Because the incubation period is up to 21 days, it often kills the family slowly, one by one. But for each other family that keeps the virus from entering its household, that can mean five or six fewer deaths.

Other theories are that tens of thousands of home-care kits have been handed out. They contain gloves, bleach, a bucket, plastic bags and a bleach sprayer. Using them around the sick, and especially during burials, may have helped.

Alternatively, hospitals may be empty because more people are dying at home. In Liberia, it has been reported that families are refusing to bring in their relatives because, if they die, they will be cremated.

Another report is that taxi and minibus drivers are refusing to take passengers who are bleeding or vomiting to hospitals. That forces them to die at home – which is cruel, but could slow the spread of disease to other passengers.

It is also important to remember that epidemics typically come in waves. The reasons for some are obvious, like the weather: flu cases rise in winter, polio cases rise in summer. Pox diseases like smallpox, measles and chickenpox used to surge every few years after a new set of young children was born. For other diseases, the reasons are not clear. Ebola may simply be having a moment between waves.

How to Protect Yourself From Ebola, in Song

Public service announcements can be useful, particularly if their messages are presented by celebrities. But a catchy song, performed by a starry cast, can be even better. That, at any rate, is the reasoning behind “Africa Stop Ebola,” a new song packed with information about what people can do to help stop the spread of the Ebola virus, for which some of Africa’s top musicians – among them the reggae singer Tiken Jah Fakoly[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/world/singer-gives-voice-to-ivory-coast-anger-at-leader.html], the duo Amadou & Mariam[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amadou-mariam-mn0000013647/biography] and the rapper Didier Awadi – have banded together.

The song, which was written by Kandia Kora and Sekou Kouyaté, both of whom are among the performers, is based on ideas and lyrics sketched out by Carlos Chirinos[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty_bios/view/Carlos_Chirinos], a professor at New York University who specializes in music, radio and social change. It runs about five and a half minutes, and is packed with warnings (not to touch the bodies of the sick or the dead, to avoid shaking hands) and encouragements (trust doctors, wash your hands).

“We are trying to build the public’s confidence in the public health sector,” Mr. Chirinos said in a telephone interview from London. “This is where the stature of the artists is so important. They are all recognized and respected in their countries, and we felt that people would listen to them. We are combating myths about Ebola not being real, or that it is something that can be cured by a church, or a traditional healer. There have been cases where health teams have turned up at a village and were turned away, or were stoned – some people have been killed. So we’re trying to send a message, that the only way to stop Ebola is to trust in the health services. And also, that there is hope – that the crisis can be overcome.”

The first performer to sign up for the project was Mr. Fakoly, who helped round up the other performers, and made sure that they remained on message. (Some of the rappers, in particular, Mr. Chirinos, said, wanted to riff on the subject and move farther afield). It was partly in deference to Mr. Fakoly that Mr. Kora and Mr. Kouyaté wrote the song in a reggae style, although another reason, Mr. Chirinos said, was that “reggae is truly pan-African,” and they wanted music that would have an appeal throughout the continent.

Language was another consideration. Mr. Kora, Mr. Fakoly, Amadou & Mariam, Mr. Awadi and the Malian rapper Mokobé all sing their verses in French. But African languages are heard as well. Salif Keita and Mory Kanté sing in Malinké, and Mr. Kanté also sings in Susu, as does Konko Malela. Sia Tolno sings in Kissi; Barbara Kanam sings in Lingala; and Oumou Sangaré sings in Bambara.

The song, which was recorded in studios in Paris and Mali, with final production in London, has been distributed to radio stations throughout Africa.

City Room
N.Y. / Region
New York Today: Learning From Hurricane Sandy
By ANNIE CORREAL

Good morning on this cloudy Wednesday.

Two years ago today, Rachel Murphy was about to go into labor with her son.

And Hurricane Sandy was swirling toward the city[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/us/hurricane-sandy-churns-up-east-coast.html?pagewanted=all].

By the time her son, Sparrow, was born, the storm surge had submerged her Red Hook apartment.

“We lost everything,” she said.

But Sparrow Essed will celebrate his second birthday on Friday.

We asked our readers to reflect on the lessons of Hurricane Sandy[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/lessons-learned-from-hurricane-sandy/] two years later. Seventy-seven responded.

Ms. Murphy’s insights ranged from the practical (“Water rises fast”) to the philosophical.

“I continue to discover things we don’t own anymore, and I add them to the list I started almost two years ago,” she wrote.

“It’s not an exercise in grief, or a wish list. It’s a sort of corny reminder to myself that we can live without everything I assume we need.”

Many of those who wrote to us said the same thing.

They also spoke of how the storm had fortified their family bonds[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/stronger-family-bonds-two-years-after-hurricane-sandy.html].

And the frustration of navigating government agencies to rebuild.

A lot has happened in the last two years, and one can forget how Hurricane Sandy completely transformed the lives of thousands of New Yorkers.

You may share what you learned from the storm in the comments or through Twitter with #nytoday.

Here’s what else you need to know.

WEATHER

AND FINALLY …

Last month, at nine subway stations around the city, musicians performed one song in unison.

The subway stops had Wi-Fi, so the musicians watched the conductor Lev Zhurbin online as they played, creating what they believe is the first Wi-Fi orchestra.

Mr. Zhurbin, known as Ljova[http://www.ljova.com/], composed an original piece for the occasion, which he called “Signal Strength.”

The performance — featuring an accordion, a beatboxer, a saw, a theremin, and more — became a video.

“We shot the video very early on a Sunday morning in September,” Mr. Zurbin said. “Nobody was arrested.”

Cuomo’s Latest Book Struggles in Second Week

Sales of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s memoir fell by more than 43 percent to 535 copies in its second week on shelves.

Mr. Cuomo’s latest book, “All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life,” sold 945 copies in the week after its Oct. 15 release, according to BookScan, a subscription service that tracks sales at over 80 percent of book vendors in the United States but does not include e-books, which can increase sales by about 15 percent.

At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Cuomo joked that health care workers returning from treating Ebola patients in West Africa could pass the time in a 21-day quarantine by reading his book. “Twenty-one days, in your home, with your friends and your family, and you’ll be compensated,” he said. “Read a book, read my book.”

The 528-page memoir, which chronicles Mr. Cuomo’s rise in politics in New York, has received tepid reviews. The book, for which Mr. Cuomo received an advance of more than $700,000, comes as he seeks re-election, and it has suffered amid fiercely negative consumer reviews on Amazon that appear politically motivated.

New books often see a sharp decline in the second week, after the blitz of publicity wears off. Sales of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s memoir “Hard Choices” declined by 43.5 percent to 48,000 copies in the second week on shelves after its June 10 release.

Good evening.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Open to influence.

One of our best-read stories today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html] outlines how the lobbyists who have long tried to influence legislators have found a new target: attorneys general.

“They have broad law enforcement powers,” says Eric Lipton, our investigative reporter, “and have shown a willingness to use them.”

That has opened the door to a vicious cycle: The more aggressive attorneys general become in taking on corporate wrongdoers, the more lobbyists are deployed to fend them off.

“And with so many A.G.s running for higher office — be it the United States Senate or governor — they are very much in need of money,” Mr. Lipton says.

“They are increasingly turning in a big way to these corporate players that want to build relationships with them, in hopes that they will not become a target of an investigation.”

The millions moving from these companies to attorneys general, Mr. Lipton notes, “creates delicate issues for everyone involved.”

• All they want is fear.

Some of the attacks that have occurred since the Islamic State’s call for “lone wolf” assaults on Westerners seem to bear the hallmarks of mental disturbance.

The Long Island police say a man beheaded his mother[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/29/police-probe-possible-link-between-womans-murder-train-fatality-in-farmingdale/] and then jumped in front of a train on Wednesday night. In Connecticut, a woman reported [http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Waterbury-Police-Investigate-Report-That-Man-Sexually-Abused-Pit-Bull-280314832.html]finding a man trying to sexually assault her dog, yelling about having Ebola and being with ISIS.

The authorities did not say there was any connection between these events and the Islamic State.

But it’s all the same to the Islamic State, says our reporter Rukmini Callimachi.

“The aim is to sow terror,” she says. “To strike fear in the hearts of Americans and Europeans and to make them feel they are not safe as a result of actions their governments have taken.”

So whether the victim is a soldier, a colleague or a relative is immaterial, Ms. Callimachi says, the militant group finds its purpose being served.

“And if you’re attacking a dog — poor dog,” she says.

• Wearing the zeitgeist.

Forget the academics and pundits purporting to parse the cultural mood. Want to know what’s truly going on? Check out what people are putting on for Halloween.

One Manhattan store, Screaming Mimi’s, has been outfitting customers as zombie cheerleaders, meth-head angels, Little Red Riding Hood — after she’d been eaten by the wolf.

The trend, says Legs Andrew, a buyer there, “is people doing normal costumes that they plan to mess up with makeup and effects.”

“We’ve also seen a lot of ‘Maleficent’ and a lot of space,” she says.

And Ebola is big. Local surgical supply houses have been fielding calls from partygoers attempting to track down isolation-ward coveralls and hazmat suits.

Orange jumpsuits will be ubiquitous, though not necessarily owing to “Orange Is the New Black.”

Prison garb, it turns out, is a Halloween mainstay for stores like Ricky’s, the Manhattan costume superstore.

“Frat boys,” said Richard Parrott, the chain’s proprietor.

MARKETS

Wall Street stocks slid down. The S.&P. 500 lost 0.1 percent.

TONIGHT

• Down to one game.

“A Game 7 in the World Series is a gift for everyone,” the San Francisco Giants’ Hunter Pence says[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/29/sports/baseball/ap-bbo-world-series-game-7s.html].

But the odds are on the Kansas City Royals’ side. Starting with the 1982 Series, home teams are 9-0 in Game 7’s. (8 p.m. Eastern, Fox and ESPN Radio[http://espn.go.com/espnradio/show?showId=mlbonespnradio])

• A bard’s final days.

The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, born 100 years ago this week, visited New York in 1953 and died at the age of 39 in Greenwich Village after a bout of hard drinking.

His trip is portrayed in the film “A Poet in New York[http://www.bbcamerica.com/poet-in-new-york/].” (8 p.m. Eastern, BBC America)

• Drop-ins.

“Dream School[http://www.sundance.tv/series/dream-school]” tries to give high-school dropouts a second chance with inspiration from celebrity “faculty members.”

Tonight’s teacher is Dean Winters of “Oz,” “30 Rock” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” (10 p.m. Eastern, Sundance)

• If you’re staying up …

On “The Colbert Report”: Jill Lepore, the author of “The Secret History of Wonder Woman[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/books/the-secret-history-of-wonder-woman-by-jill-lepore.html].” (11:31 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central)

“The Tonight Show”: Jake Gyllenhaal, who stars in the new film “Nightcrawler”; Paul Reubens, coming after the recent release of a remastered Blu-ray set of “Pee-wee’s Playhouse”; and the indie duo She & Him performs. (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC)

“Late Show With David Letterman”: Jim Carrey, who stars in “Dumb and Dumber To”; the actor David Tennant of the Fox series “Gracepoint.” (11:35 p.m. Eastern, CBS)

TOMORROW

• Russian commemoration.

The country holds its annual day of remembrance for the victims of Joseph Stalin’s purges.

Memorial, a human rights organization, estimates that an average of 1,000 people a day were executed during the Great Terror, in 1937 and 1938.

World; Africa
In Liberia, a Good or Very Bad Sign: Empty Hospital Beds

SUAKOKO, Liberia — For days this month, the ambulances from the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] treatment unit here went out in search of patients, only to return with just one or two suspected cases. And many times, those people ended up testing negative for the disease.

“Where are the patients?” an aid worker wondered aloud as colleagues puzzled over the empty beds at the International Medical Corps treatment unit here in Bong County, Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], which opened in mid-September.

Around the country, treatment centers, laboratory workers who test for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and international and national health officials trying to track the epidemic have noticed an unexpected pattern: There are far fewer people being treated for Ebola than anticipated.

As of Sunday, fewer than half of the 649 treatment beds across the country were occupied, a surprising change in a nation where patients had long been turned away[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/world/africa/liberia-ebola-victims-treatment-center-cdc.html] from Ebola units for lack of space.

Now, new admissions to treatment centers are dropping or flatlining, the number of samples being submitted to Ebola laboratories has fallen significantly, and the percentage of people testing positive for the disease has dropped as well.

“The numbers are decreasing, but we don’t know why,” said Malin Lager, a spokeswoman at a Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/] treatment center just outside Monrovia, the capital. Its vast campus of white tents, which has a capacity for 253 patients, had only 90 on Sunday.

“It’s too early to celebrate,” Ms. Lager said.

Liberia has long been a focal point of the Ebola epidemic, the nation with the most cases and deaths from the disease, prompting a global call to action. Hundreds of new beds have been added in recent weeks, but now many are going unfilled even before any of the 18 treatment centers being built by the American military have opened, leaving many officials here confounded.

Some are debating whether the World Health Organization’s dire warnings about the epidemic — that there could be as many as 10,000 new cases each week[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-who-west-africa.html?_r=0] in West Africa by December, about 10 times the rate it recently reported[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137091/1/roadmapsitrep22Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1] — might be grossly inflated.

“The projections were based on nothing happening” to curb the outbreak, said the United States ambassador to Liberia, Deborah R. Malac, during a visit to the International Medical Corps treatment center this month. “More things are happening every day.”

For now, most officials are continuing to plan for the worst so as not to interfere with the mounting international response, which is seen as critical to preventing a resurgence. Even a single unsafe burial, in which mourners touch a highly infectious corpse, can result in dozens of new cases.

The empty beds in Liberia come in the context of an intense public health campaign to educate the nation about the dangers of the disease and ways of combating it — from posters and billboards to messages broadcast when residents make phone calls.

“Lonestar Cell cares about your health. Ebola is real,” one company’s recording says.

Some consider the latest developments an indication that the efforts to combat the virus, including the opening of new treatment units, are beginning to succeed.

“We can see it subsiding bit by bit,” the Rev. Omalley M. Segbee told his congregation at Sunday services at Grace Baptist Church in the town of Gbarnga. “This means you are on our side, oh Lord.”

But because Liberians celebrated early once before — believing the virus had been eradicated in the spring, only to see it rage back with greater force in the summer — there is a near universal hesitance to call the outbreak under control. Liberia’s neighbors, Sierra Leone and Guinea, have been experiencing a troubling surge of cases in recent weeks.

There is also the likelihood that many people dying of Ebola in Liberia are hidden from the authorities, as has been true throughout the epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/dont-touch-the-walls-ebola-fears-infect-hospital.html].

Many parts of the country are not well monitored, many contacts of Ebola patients are not traced, and officials have long acknowledged that the statistics on the numbers of Ebola cases across West Africa are rough estimates, at best.

Treatment beds and laboratories in Liberia are also concentrated in the capital. Large swaths of the country are hours away from these centers on bad roads, in areas that lack cellphone services, which is why the new treatment centers being built far from other Ebola facilities are considered so important.

Many of the monitoring experts, too, are based in the capital. Months into the crisis, officials still remind themselves of the need to get out into the wider country to test their assumptions about the epidemic. But even in the capital, many Ebola patients are suspected to have died at home, leaving big gaps in data on the scope of the disease.

Anna Halford, a field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said the charity had a broad network of community members who promoted Ebola awareness in and around the capital.

“Not a single one of the supervisors believes there is a significant drop in cases,” she said.

Families may keep sick relatives at home for many reasons, including rumors of mistreatment inside Ebola units and fears of quarantine and stigma, Ms. Halford said. Beyond that, “It is a disease that comes in waves because of the variability of the incubation period and because of the mobility of people.”

And then there are the known hot spots, where the virus continues to spread through families.

Last weekend, eight people from one community were admitted to the International Medical Corps treatment center. In another cluster, the mother and sister of a woman who died on her way here[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/africa/heart-rending-test-in-ebola-zone-a-baby.html] later became patients; the mother died last week.

In the capital, teams in protective gear are supposed to pick up the dead and ensure they are cremated. But some families continue to conduct private burials, distrustful of the government’s handling of bodies.

Matthew Siakor said he wore two pairs of gloves and a raincoat when he helped bury his mother, whose body had been spirited out of Monrovia by his younger brother. He said the choice to do so came after another family member died.

“After they took the body away and they did the testing, there were no results back to the family whether the body that was carried was an Ebola body,” he said, adding that he and his brother were voluntarily quarantining themselves now. “It is difficult for people to lose their loved ones, and they take them away and they can’t get the body.”

Community resistance to public outreach efforts also persists in some pockets.

“People ran away,” the Rev. G. Victor Padmore, a member of an Ebola task force here, reported after visiting a community where there had been a case. Days later, in another district, he visited a family that had recently lost a 3-year-old child.

“They don’t want to accept the child died of Ebola,” he said. “I made them understand.”

Some rural health workers say the outreach efforts have made residents more willing to report cases and seek treatment.

“It’s not as it was in August or September,” said Kollie Singbeh, an Ebola case investigator for Margibi County.

But Elvis Ogweno, a Kenyan nurse who heads the International Medical Corps ambulance team, said that several Ebola-affected communities he had visited still reacted with fear.

“They just took off to the forest,” he said. “You keep on shouting, ‘Is someone there? Is someone there?’ ”

He sometimes drives five hours to reach communities, returning again and again until the resistance dissipates, often once someone is very ill. “After three days you go back and the patient is critical,” he said. “Now they want to come immediately.”

He warned the doctors here not to trust the perceived drop in cases. “I told them Ebola, from my five to six weeks of experience here, you find for three days there are no patients, and then it erupts again.”

In part, that is because of the difficulty some of the sick have in finding help. “Some patients say, ‘Since two days ago I’ve been looking for assistance,’ ” he said.

Last week, to better understand whether gaps in detecting and tracing cases might explain why treatment numbers are low, the W.H.O. sent experts to the country’s far-flung districts.

Employees of the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also went out into communities to try to get a better understanding of the situation. Their conclusions are expected in the coming days.

As Dr. Samson Arzoaquoi, who heads the Ebola task force in Bong County, bumped along a dirt road over the weekend, he said the area had been quieter.

“This time is not yet a time for us to rejoice,” he warned a crowd gathered to begin an Ebola outreach program. “If we begin to laugh and celebrate, what will happen? We will go right back where we are coming from.”

Correction: October 30, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about aid workers and health officials in Liberia who have found that far fewer people are being treated for Ebola than anticipated misstated, in some editions, the given name of a clergyman and member of an Ebola task force. He is the Rev. G. Victor Padmore, not John. And the article and a picture caption misspelled the name of a town in Liberia in some editions. It is Gbarnga, not Gbanga.

HARTFORD — The father of a Connecticut third grader filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday, saying his daughter has been unfairly barred from school amid fears she may have been exposed to the Ebola virus while in Africa.

The daughter, Ikeoluwa Opayemi, and her family, who live in Milford, visited Nigeria for a wedding from Oct. 2 to 13, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Federal District Court in New Haven.

When the girl tried to return to the Meadowside Elementary School, she was told by the school district’s health director that she would have to stay home until Nov. 3 “due to concern from certain parents and teachers that she could transmit Ebola to other children,” according to the lawsuit.

Calls to the health director and the district’s school superintendent were not immediately returned.

Andrew Doba, a spokesman for Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, said the decision did not come from the state’s health commissioner, who has the power to quarantine anyone she feels may pose an Ebola risk. “This was a decision by the town’s public health official,” Mr. Doba said.

The family did not travel to any of the three West African nations associated with the current Ebola outbreak — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

For six years, Mayra Martinez had been going to the same beautician in Queens, and considered her a friend. On Saturday, while getting her hair done, Ms. Martinez, 45, mentioned she had just gotten a new job.

“Where?” the beautician asked.

“Bellevue,” Ms. Martinez said.

“She just froze and asked, ‘Are you anywhere near him?’  ” Ms. Martinez recalled. Then the beautician asked her to please find someone else to do her hair.

By “him,” the beautician meant Dr. Craig Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/neighbors-say-patient-is-fast-to-lend-a-helping-hand-.html], who is New York’s first Ebola patient. As Bellevue Hospital Center goes into its seventh day of treating Dr. Spencer, who had worked with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, some of its employees are feeling stigmatized — a harsh consequence of being the first hospital in the city to deal with an outbreak that has killed about 5,000 people in West Africa, and which is known to kill about half the people who become infected.

Bellevue’s medical director, Dr. Nate Link, said more than a dozen employees — not limited to those taking care of Dr. Spencer — had reported being discriminated against, including not being welcome at a business or social event. One employee lost a teaching position, he said.

Some nurses who moonlight at other jobs have been told they are not needed there, according to the New York State Nurses Association, a union. One nurse said her child was not allowed to go to day care. “These are obviously related to irrational fears in the community,” Dr. Link said.

On the subway to work early Tuesday, Ms. Martinez said she overheard two passengers say they were horrified by Ebola and joke that it would soon turn people into zombies. Ms. Martinez, dressed in tan scrubs with her identification badge hung around her neck, tucked the badge inside her coat, “so they don’t retaliate against me.”

Medical workers who have treated Ebola patients at other hospitals in Atlanta, Dallas and Omaha have also reported being stigmatized. The problem is severe enough that Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/with-ebolas-arrival-de-blasio-stands-tall-as-christie-and-cuomo-falter.html] acknowledged it during a news conference at Bellevue on Sunday.

“Again, the medical personnel fighting this fight, particularly our nurses, deserve our respect,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We heard reports in the last few days of nurses being mistreated in our city – when it became clear that they worked at Bellevue – being treated differently. We heard reports of people being unwilling to serve them food or treating their children differently. That is absolutely unacceptable.”

But sometimes the snubbing is taking place inside their own workplace. Nurses treating Dr. Spencer were in tears at a meeting this week as they complained about being shunned by other staff members in the elevators, one health care worker who was there said.

Workers in the isolation unit seem attuned to how their co-workers are viewing them. Some people who work in that unit are trying not to mingle with those who do not, several employees said. Even though the hospital administration has not explicitly ordered Ebola workers to stay away from others, employees said, the word has gone out through informal channels that it is better to lower the risk, and the anxiety quotient, of exposing other employees. Some nurses asked for arrangements to be made for them to sleep over at the hospital out of fears of passing the virus to their relatives and friends.

Even without the stigma, the work is both physically and psychologically taxing, and the dangers of burnout are high. Nurses have been going to group therapy at the hospital looking for support, and nurses from other public hospitals have been brought in for reinforcement. Critical care patients are being steadily transferred to Bellevue’s sister hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, to free intensive care staff to treat Dr. Spencer, officials said.

One Bellevue health care worker said that nurses who had not completed their Ebola training were asked on Friday to relieve the nurse taking care of Dr. Spencer’s fiancée, Morgan Dixon[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patients-fiance-shares-his-altruism-.html]. At first they refused, the worker said, then one “gowned up” and was relieved to find the work consisted of making sure Ms. Dixon’s temperature was taken and entered into a log. The worker and other Bellevue employees quoted spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss hospital matters.

Ms. Dixon, who has shown no symptoms, has since been discharged to home quarantine in the Hamilton Heights apartment she shares with Dr. Spencer.

Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, said on Tuesday that everyone who worked with Dr. Spencer and Ms. Dixon had been fully trained.

And Dr. Link, the medical director, said he thought morale was good. “I have not heard of a single example within the hospital where somebody discriminated against somebody else,” he said. “We’re all on the same team.”

Dr. Link said Bellevue employees caring for Dr. Spencer were free to go home after their shifts, to take mass transit, and to hug and kiss their loved ones.

“There is zero risk of staff leaving this hospital and infecting people out in the community,” he said.

The employees are taking their temperature every day, because fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is one of the first signs of infection; Dr. Link called this “an extra blanket of assurance.” They are being tracked by the city’s health department. Bellevue has consulted on protocol with Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and Nebraska Medical Center, which had no cases of health care worker infection, he noted.

At another news conference on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo struggled to explain why health care workers exposed to Dr. Spencer at Bellevue were not being put in home quarantine, like those exposed to infected patients in West Africa.

The answer was that, essentially, medical care in the United States is much more advanced than in Africa, and therefore the risk is lower. “West Africa doesn’t have the sophistication of the system that we have, and if they did, the problem wouldn’t have gotten to this level even in West Africa,” Mr. Cuomo said.

But the anxiety persists.

A 46-year-old woman who has worked at Bellevue for 11 years said that the day the news broke that Dr. Spencer was being hospitalized there, her teenage son told her, “Oh you work at Bellevue, stay away from me.” She told him to do some Internet research on the disease.

Ted Vlasses, 60, who runs a food truck near the hospital, said he had been extra vigilant not to handle money with his bare hands, and not to touch his face.

At a deli popular with Bellevue workers, Café Deli-Cious, hand-sanitizer-gel pumps have been posted prominently near the door and on a shelf. A manager said Bellevue staff members had urged him to add them.

“People are scared,” said Dr. Evan Rieder, a dermatologist, despite frequent emails from management offering town-hall-style meetings and other forms of reassurance. “You hear people talk about it in the elevator.”

William Capers, 45, who pushes patients through the hospital in wheelchairs, said he was worried that despite official reassurances, Ebola could be airborne.

Mr. Capers has stayed well clear of the seventh floor, which houses the isolation unit. “I’m not going over there if I don’t have to,” he said. “I don’t know the truth behind it.”

National Concerns Drain Color From Politics in Louisiana

NEW ROADS, La. — A politician at a street fair is usually an inconvenience, an ordeal to be endured as he thrusts a flier at your chest and a smile at your face. But the silver-haired candidate pushing his 1-year-old in a stroller through the funnel-cake stands and craft booths at the harvest festival here did not have to try so hard. The glad-handers rushed up to him.

“I’d vote for you! I voted for you plenty of times!” shouted Mark Wells, 58, a retired state employee.

Edwin W. Edwards, 87, a four-term former governor and eight-year former federal inmate, is back on the trail, this time as a long-shot Democratic contender for a House seat and salvation for magazine feature writers[http://nymag.com/news/features/edwin-edwards-2014-7/] in a dreary election year.

For all his color, though, Mr. Edwards, the populist rogue who embodied Louisiana politics from the 1960s to the 1990s, charming one half of the state and mortifying the other, might as well be a ghost.

The main political event this year, the Senate race, could not be further removed from the Edwards era. No one here at the harvest festival was particularly excited about Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a three-term Democrat, or Representative Bill Cassidy, the Republican challenger who will most likely face Ms. Landrieu in a runoff. A few said they might vote for Rob Maness, a hard-right Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] favorite and retired Air Force colonel who is also running, though most acknowledge his chances are slim..

“They used to say that the biggest sin in Louisiana politics was to be boring,” said R. Michael McHale, a lawyer in Lake Charles. “Now Louisiana’s become more like Washington. To a certain extent, elections aren’t even about Louisiana anymore.”

Louisianans will say, and perhaps scorn you if you disagree, that theirs is an exceptional state.

Exchanges in French can still occasionally be heard among the older people on the bayou, and at a Starbucks on a bland commercial strip in Lafayette it is possible to have a conversation with a woman about trapping and cleaning muskrat. Much of Louisiana’s distinctiveness is innate, given a set of natural resources — the mouth of an important river, abundant oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and gas reserves underground and off the coast, and a rich but exceedingly fragile coastline — that guarantee singular benefits and liabilities.

But among the greatest expressions of Louisiana’s particularity have been its politics: populist, locally attuned, based on personality rather than party, fond of deal-cutting, often ethically dubious, but, above all, interesting. Or at least that used to be the case.

Roughly $40 million[http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?id=LAS1&cycle=2014] has been spent on the Senate race here by campaigns and outside groups, and television is saturated with a wave of nasty ads that have exasperated the fact-checkers. But it is not the most expensive race in the country, nor is it remarkably nastier than the rest of the paint-by-numbers Senate campaigns this year.

Mr. Cassidy is running a generic if effective Republican campaign, tying Ms. Landrieu[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/us/landrieus-residency-raises-questions-in-louisiana-senate-race.html] to President Obama, to Harry Reid, and to Washington in general. Ms. Landrieu could be described as the standard-bearer for an older style of Louisiana politics, with a bring-home-the-bacon campaign. But even she is relying[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/upshot/mary-landrieus-very-difficult-re-election.html] for her survival on millions of national ad dollars and a typical Democratic constituency of black voters and women.

There are reasons for this: Over the past decade, the bungled government responses to a series of hurricanes, including Katrina, and to the BPoil spill[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/gulf_of_mexico_2010/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] have drained the appeal of entertaining politicians; an aversion to taxes has rendered the old populism model unsustainable; and, perhaps most of all, the effects of 24-hour news channels, national political debates on television, and the Internet have left hyperlocal politicking a mostly fading memory.

“Politics is more nationalized now,” said John Breaux, a former senator and among the last of the Cajun Democrats who could routinely win statewide.

Mr. Breaux was discussing the state’s politics over lunch at a white-cloth Italian restaurant in Washington, where, like many retired Louisiana congressmen, he is a lobbyist. “It used to be folks were not that concerned about what was happening everywhere else, they were concerned about their own state. Now they’re watching Fox News every night. You have an opinion that is national in scope, not Louisiana in scope,” he said.

In states where politics has served as a drab backdrop to daily life, this might not be such a big deal. But politics in Louisiana, which the writer A. J. Liebling[http://www.amazon.com/The-Earl-Louisiana-A-Liebling/dp/0807102032] once described as having an intensity and complexity matched “only in the republic of Lebanon,” have traditionally taken center stage. Even as it came to be seen as a malevolent force across the South, government remained an organizing part of life here. The state’s old Robin Hood-style populism – in which oil companies were heavily soaked, if otherwise given full rein, while taxpayers were spared – was considered quite agreeable. Spending on education, health care and infrastructure was generous and the people did not have to pay for it.

“Politicians were allowed to be funny because the idea was they weren’t stealing your money, they were stealing Standard Oil’s money,” said Gov. Bobby Jindal[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/bobby_jindal/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Louisiana.

This arrangement fell apart after the big oil bust of the 1980s. The shortfall was somewhat remedied by gambling proceeds, sales taxes and income taxes, but these sources brought along with them corruption indictments and antitax crusades. With a major boom in petrochemical activity, the heady days may return. But for now, state services have been cut to the marrow and a $1.2 billion shortfall[http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/14/louisiana-faces-billion-deficit/14064955/] may await in next year’s budget.

Even as the economics changed, Louisiana’s politics remained unusual: The state was alone in the Deep South in voting twice for Bill Clinton and is now the only one of the five Deep South states with a Democrat in the Senate.

This distinctiveness endures in part because the state has three broad categories of voters – not two, as in most other Southern states. White Protestants have mostly been reliable conservatives in northern Louisiana. An engaged black electorate in New Orleans and elsewhere forms a Democratic counterweight.

The white Catholic voters spread across southern Louisiana, many of whom identify themselves as Cajun, make up the third, and often electorally decisive, group. This bloc resists ideological labeling. Cajuns are traditional and conservative but, in part because of the history of discrimination against the Cajun culture in Louisiana, can also be receptive to appeals about obligations to the poor and a little more forgiving on matters of personal virtue.

Furthermore, said J. Curtis Joubert, 83, a former mayor of the Cajun town of Eunice, they knew how to enjoy a good election.

“When chickens started hearing the sound trucks roll into town, they’d hide under the houses because they knew the barbecues were going to be starting up,” Mr. Joubert recalled. “The chickens don’t run and hide anymore. They’re all inside watching television.”

The Waning Cult of Personality

Over a late afternoon beer at a bar in the southern Louisiana city of Houma, Norby Chabert lamented this state of affairs.

“Retail politics is now virtually nonexistent,” said Mr. Chabert, a state senator. He is a son of a populist political dynasty — his father’s name is on the local hospital. But he switched parties to become a Republican in 2011, part of a wave of defections that followed the election of Mr. Obama and the success of unapologetic partisans like Senator David Vitter, a Republican.

“Now it’s just BS, man,” he said of the campaign trail. “It’s TV and radio and direct mail. Your personal style has to matter for 30 seconds.”

For much of the Senate race, the front-runner has been the Republican, Mr. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist with a much milder disposition than the hard-hitting anti-Obama message his campaign suggests.

Tracy Donovan Smith, a lobbyist in Baton Rouge, recalls one afternoon years ago when he, Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Cassidy’s wife were racing down the highway to make it to a Republican gathering in New Orleans. Mr. Smith said he had looked up from the back seat and had been surprised to see what the Cassidys were doing in the front: discussing a daily Bible lesson.

“It’s like we’re going to this convention, we have to do our Bible study,” Mr. Smith said admiringly. “I think they still do it.”

Edwin W. Edwards this is not.

In an interview at a mostly empty Baton Rouge restaurant, Mr. Cassidy attacked the Affordable Care Act, but he said he had little interest in politics.

“In one sense I enjoy running for office,” he said. “Am I a political junkie? Absolutely not. I read biographies. Of presidents. But I also read “Knowledge and Power” by George Gilder.”

As Louisiana politicians in either party note when his name comes up, Mr. Cassidy does not come off as particularly charming or polished. (“Cassidy is as bland as this tablecloth,” Mr. Breaux said. “His mannerisms aren’t translating,” was how Mr. Chabert put it.) During the interview, the impression was reinforced when Mr. Cassidy guffawed in the middle of a question, pointing to a television and remarking about a football player hitting another in the groin with his helmet. But there is a tradition here of dry-toast politicians. For all their attempts at change, they have tended to be remembered mostly by the punch lines about them delivered by the very rogues they were trying to oust from office.

Former Gov. Earl K. Long used to puncture his reform-minded opponents as humorless high-hats. Mr. Edwards used to joked of one opponent for governor, David C. Treen, that he was so slow that it took him an hour and a half to watch “60 Minutes.”

These days, a lack of pizazz is worn by some Louisiana Republicans like a badge of honor, a sign of seriousness of purpose.

Mr. Cassidy talked of the widespread anger at the old way of politics that set in after the disasters of the last decade, a fury that led to a flourishing of muckraking journalism and civic activity in New Orleans, post-Katrina.

Billy Tauzin, a Democratic-turned-Republican former congressman and now, naturally, a Washington-based lobbyist, put it this way: “Breaux, Tauzin and Edwards were colorful. And I hope we were competent. But they just want competence now. They want professional people.”

A Change in Pitch

Burt Tietje is not sure it is that straightforward.

Mr. Tietje, 59, is a farmer in rural Jefferson Davis Parish, in the heart of what used to be the Seventh Congressional District, now extinct, which sent so many Cajun Democrats to Washington, including Mr. Edwards and Mr. Breaux.

Mr. Tietje was never attracted to that crowd. His mother lost her job as a schoolteacher because of her family’s opposition to the Long dynasty. He was a lonely but proud Republican, because that stood for good government. “Until it became something else,” he said.

He saw the Republican pitch change sometime in the 1990s. A message of disdain for populism and cronyism was overshadowed by an antipathy to abortion and gun control, a change driven by the Internet and cable news. Any backlash to the bungled government response to the hurricanes, Mr. Tietje said, was just a lagging indicator.

“The only thing I hear in stump speeches now is national Republican issues,” Mr. Tietje said. “Nobody talks about local issues anymore. I watched the entire Seventh District move from populist Democrats to this right-wing, gun-toting majority.”

In 1996, the year Ms. Landrieu won a squeaker for her first Senate term, the archbishop of New Orleans declared that voting for her, with her advocacy of abortion rights, could be considered a sin. Now drivers on the way to Lafayette are greeted by a large billboard denouncing Ms. Landrieu’s “100% pro-abortion voting record.”

Abortion and gun control are not the only issues that have driven the people of southern Louisiana away from the Democrats. When there is less money to go around, a populist economic agenda gives way to older resentments.

Former Gov. Mike Foster, another Democrat-turned-Republican from Cajun country, in a common theme here, cited voters angered by welfare benefits, which he called “the giveaway stuff.” He said: “They drive through cities, see people walking through streets or on their porches drinking beer and on some sort of take, and they don’t like that.”

Picking a Side

A smattering of politicians and local officials gathered under a tent in the parking lot of St. Leo the Great Church in the no-stoplight town of Leonville, waiting for Ms. Landrieu. She was coming to announce that thanks to a federal grant, Leonville was finally to begin construction on a drainage culvert.

This was the kind of visit that Ms. Landrieu, whose political family name[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/us/politics/in-landrieu-races-obama-helps-and-hinders.html] is esteemed in New Orleans but carries less sway outside the city, has been making all over the state. Her case for re-election has largely been based on the clout she would have as a four-term senator.

It is hardly a populist pitch — her campaign highlights endorsements from happy oil company executives — but it does hew to an old Louisiana line that an unfriendly federal government can be made to work for the state if properly wrangled. The members of the courthouse crowds wondered if the state had changed too much for this still to work. “Bill O’Reilly’s take-no-prisoners mentality has passed on to a lot of people,” said Earl Taylor, the parish district attorney. “It’s gotten so divisive. You can’t live in the middle ground anymore like John Breaux did.”

Now, with everyone having to pick a side, even a populist appeal, such as it exists, comes in two starkly different varieties.

On one side is the view, as explained by Mr. Cassidy, that an overreaching and ever-growing government, personified by the deeply unpopular Mr. Obama, stifles industry and thus the livelihoods of the working class. This is a strong message in an oil-and-gas state where people bump up frequently against federal regulators.

Ms. Landrieu’s version is that rampant privatization and an agenda of slashing services, as personified by the deeply unpopular Governor Jindal, have proved to be much more painful in practice than in theory. This message has its own resonance in a state quite visibly dependent on federal money like flood insurance and disaster aid.

In a brief interview under the outdoor tent, Ms. Landrieu talked of constituent services. But she then veered into an optimistic reading of Catholic Cajun swing voters, suggesting, perhaps somewhat wishfully, that they are being swayed by a higher power than Mr. Obama.

“I actually feel it’s starting to change back,” Ms. Landrieu said. “And you know who’s helping? Pope Francis. Pope Francis is having a major impact on the way that people in Louisiana are feeling about issues of the social gospel and helping the poor and getting back to the roots of the Catholic Church.”

A Wider Focus

The onetime hotbed for Cajun Democrats was Crowley, a town that bills itself as “the rice capital of America.” Both Mr. Breaux and Mr. Edwards got their start here.

The annual rice festival is one of the oldest festivals in the state. Mr. Cassidy visited on one of the days. Ms Landrieu did not attend, but her campaign team has highlighted her votes for price supports for rice farmers and for funding an expansion project for a nearby stretch of Interstate.

None of this seemed to be on the minds of the people in the crowds. The Affordable Care Act came up quickly, amid an antipathy to the president generally. Border security was a chief concern.

“Who’s in charge of this country, the immigrants or us?” asked Gregory Mouton, a 28-year-old car salesman with bright red hair who goes by the name T-Rouge. He was speculating on why Mr. Obama seemed so reluctant to declare an Ebola-related travel ban.

Mr. Mouton, the son of accordion makers, said he was open to politicians of any party. But he was against anyone who was as supportive of the Obama agenda as Ms. Landrieu appeared to be.

Asked whether a politician like Mr. Breaux could win this year on his kind of platform, Mr. Mouton paused.

“I don’t know John Breaux,” he said. “I’ve heard the name.”

Retailers Like Lowe’s Are Getting a Jump on the Holidays

JUST about everyone who buys candy is familiar with Red Vines[https://www.facebook.com/RedVines]. Beginning next week, consumers will hear about Black Vines — as in Vines[https://vine.co/], those popular six-second video clips, that will promote sales and deals for Black Friday[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/business/what-does-black-friday-mean-for-you.html], the big shopping day after Thanksgiving.

The home-improvement retailer Lowe’s[http://www.lowes.com/], which has in recent years used social media platforms like Pinterest to advertise its coming Black Friday[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/retail_stores_and_trade/black_friday/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] sales, plans to use Vine to tease shoppers about what is in store for Black Friday 2014. A dozen Black Friday Vines — scheduled to be released one a day, starting on Monday — will advertise deals on merchandise like DeWalt tools, Dyson vacuums, home safes and artificial Christmas trees. (Lowe’s[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/lowes_companies/index.html?inline=nyt-org] plans to open its stores at 5 a.m. Black Friday, Nov. 28, and close them at regular times that evening.)

Since spring 2013, Lowe’s and its creative agency, BBDO New York, have been releasing Vines offering how-to tips as part of a campaign that carries the theme “Lowe’s fix in six[https://vine.co/Lowes]” and the hashtag #lowesfixinsix. The latest batch of those Vines, released last week on vine.co[http://vine.co] and BuzzFeed[http://www.buzzfeed.com/lowes/home-hacks-that-will-make-you-seem-like-a-diy-genius], provides advice on everything from using a microwave oven to sanitize a sponge to using mayonnaise to remove water stains from wood.

The arrival of Black Friday Vines from Lowe’s underlines how much of a role social media is playing for the Christmas shopping season, which is for retailers “our Super Bowl, the culmination of all our plans,” said Richard Barry, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer of Toys “R” Us [http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2255956]in Wayne, N.J. The 2014 edition of the annual Toys “R” Us holiday catalog, known as “The Great Big Christmas Book,” is on its way to homes around the country and is being promoted in social media like Facebook[https://www.facebook.com/toysrus]and Twitter[https://twitter.com/ToysRUs].

Although retail executives have been worried that the uncertain economy and unsettling news like the arrival of Ebola in America would dampen holiday spending, the last several days have brought some upbeat data. For instance, according to a Nielsen survey released this week, consumers, led by African-American and Hispanic households, said they plan to spend more than five years ago for gifts in important categories like technology, toys and apparel.

“There are some very positive developments,” said Tom Lamb, chief marketing officer of Lowe’s in Mooresville, N.C., and “consumers continue to express a high degree of interest in their home and all things home.”

Lowe’s takes part in Black Friday each year to reach those shoppers who “look forward to it for the thrill of the hunt” for bargains, he added, not to mention that “it’s retail gone wild, really a fun time.”

“We’re really happy with how Vine is doing,” Mr. Lamb said, adding: “Vine has recently started offering tracking metrics to contributors and we’re seeing over 17,000 hours of engagement just this year. At six seconds per view, that’s a huge number.”

Producing short-form ads has “made us better advertisers” generally, Mr. Lamb said, because a Vine video “forces you to have a sharp point and get to it quickly.”

As a result, he added, “you’ll see a lot more 15-second” television commercials from Lowe’s “versus two or three years ago.”

There is, said John Osborn, president and chief executive of BBDO New York[http://www.bbdo.com/], a “simplicity and directness[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/business/media/seeing-a-value-in-simplicity-.html] to Vine that helps us cut through the clutter.” That is important because consumers are becoming increasingly interested in products and services that they perceive will help them “de-complex the world we live in,” he added. Each Vine video in the “Lowe’s fix in six” campaign can be deemed “a nugget of generosity, offering a quick, simple answer to a problem,” Mr. Osborn said, and that applies to the Black Friday Vines in that they will offer generous deals on Lowe’s merchandise.

Another retailer, the discount chain Big Lots[http://www.biglots.com/], is significantly stepping up its presence in social media for Christmas compared with last year. Big Lots, which handles social media internally, will use a hashtag, #NailingThis[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yle5MgVG8ww], that echoes the theme of the Christmas campaign from its creative agency, O’Keefe Reinhard & Paul[http://okrp.com/] in Chicago. There are plans to feature other hashtags at the ends of Big Lots commercials, including #RealGifts.

Target[http://www.target.com/], too, has social media on its mind for the holidays. “We have 140 million followers across our social platforms,” said Jeffrey J. Jones, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Target in Minneapolis. “We want to arm them with the right content to activate their advocacy for Target, to get them to spread the word and speak on our behalf.”

Among the potential conversation-starters being supplied them by Target are an offer of free shipping for all merchandise ordered online, through Dec. 20; partnerships with brands like Toms and the New York retailer Story[http://thisisstory.com/]; and a cheerful, colorful campaign, by the 72andSunny agency[http://www.72andsunny.com/] in Los Angeles, featuring the Christmas song “A Marshmallow World” sung by Karen O.

Although Halloween is still a day away, many retailers, among them Best Buy[http://www.bestbuy.com/] and Kmart[http://www.kmart.com/], have already begun their holiday marketing efforts in social, traditional and digital media. That makes 2014 another year of so-called Christmas creep[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/business/media/autumn-still-looms-but-for-marketers-christmas-has-already-begun-.html].

Front-running Christmas may make sense for retailers. According to the consumer survey by Nielsen, 22 percent of households said they had already started their holiday shopping.

Big Lots is increasing its social media presence with #Nailingthis during the holiday season.  | Lowe’s will use Vine video clips to advertise deals on merchandise like Dyson vacuums. It will release one Vine a day.

The Ebola Hysteria

The absolute hysteria surrounding the Ebola crisis underscores what is wrong with our politics and the policies they spawn.

On Ebola, the possible has overtaken the probable, gobbling it up in a high-anxiety, low-information frenzy of frayed nerves and Purell-ed hands.

There have been nine cases of Ebola in this country. All but one, a Liberian immigrant, is alive.

We aren’t battling a virus in this country as much as a mania, one whipped up by reactionary politicians and irresponsible media. We should be following the science in responding to the threat, but instead we are being led by silliness. And that comes at heavy cost.

The best way to prevent Ebola from becoming a pandemic is to stop it at its source — in West Africa, where the disease is truly exacting a heavy toll with thousands dead and thousands more infected. But the countries in that region can’t do it alone. They need help. The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said on Tuesday[http://news.yahoo.com/world-bank-chief-pleads-more-medics-fight-ebola-173229799.html], “We’ll need a steady state of at least 5,000 health workers from outside the region” to fight Ebola in West Africa. That means health care workers from other countries, including ours.

Many of our health care workers are heroically heeding the clarion call. They are volunteering to head into harm’s way, to put their own lives on the line to save others and to prevent the disease from spreading further. But upon returning to this country some now risk “mandatory quarantine” even if they test negative for the disease and are asymptomatic. (Ebola can be spread only when a patient expresses symptoms.)

The public face of the affront to basic science, civil liberties and displays of valor has become the nurse Kaci Hickox. She accepted an assignment with Doctors Without Borders in Ebola-plagued Sierra Leone. But upon returning to the United States, she was quarantined in a plastic tent[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/26/health/new-jersey-quarantined-nurse/index.html] in a Newark hospital even after testing negative for the virus. She has been transferred to Maine, but there is a state trooper stationed outside the house[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/maine-seek-court-order-force-ebola-quarantine-nurse-kaci-hickox-n236416] where she’s staying.

Hickox is a paladin being treated like a leper.

As Hickox wrote in the Dallas Morning News:

“I had spent a month watching children die, alone. I had witnessed human tragedy unfold before my eyes. I had tried to help when much of the world has looked on and done nothing.”

It would be bad enough if there were just a momentary inconvenience or a legally contestable rights infringement. But it may be more than that. It could deter other health care workers like Hickox from volunteering in the first place.

In other words, irrational governors, like Chris Christie of New Jersey, taking ill-advised steps to control the spread of the disease on a local level could help it to spread on a global one.

That is in part why overly aggressive state-level restrictions have been roundly condemned.

A spokesman for the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said this week:

“Returning health workers are exceptional people who are giving of themselves for humanity. They should not be subjected to restrictions that are not based on science. Those who develop infections should be supported, not stigmatized.”

But stigma feels right as rain for some folks.

When Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary caring for Ebola patients in Liberia, became the first known American Ebola patient, Ann Coulter called him “idiotic”[http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2014-08-06.html] and chastised him for the “Christian narcissism” of deigning to help people in “disease-ridden cesspools” rather than, say, turning “one single Hollywood power-broker to Christ,” which would apparently “have done more good for the entire world than anything he could accomplish in a century spent in Liberia.”

Oh, the irony of Coulter using this flummery to blast Brantly as idiotic.

This that’s-their-problem-we-have-our-own reasoning is foolish and illogical. It somehow neglects the reality that oceans are not perfect buffers and that viruses, unchecked, will find a way to cross them.

And it reveals a certain international elitism that is not only disturbing but dangerous.

As the World Health Organization’s director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, recently pointed out[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/lessons/en/]: “The outbreak spotlights the dangers of the world’s growing social and economic inequalities. The rich get the best care. The poor are left to die.”

Chan also pointed out that there is no vaccine or cure for Ebola — some 40 years after it emerged — in part because “Ebola has been, historically, geographically confined to poor African nations.”

Ebola, like many other diseases, preys on the poor — poor countries and poor populations.

And, on the domestic front, it must not go unmentioned that elections are fast approaching and that politicians are acting — directly or not — out of political self-interest.

In that way, the federal response to Ebola becomes just another opportunity to argue that the federal government is ineffectual, incompetent and out of its depth, particularly under this president. And, in an election year, appearing to be more aggressive than the federal government, while riding a wave of fear, is appealing.

According to a report issued last week by the Pew Research Center, a sizable minority is concerned that Ebola will affect their families. The poll found that “41 percent are worried that they themselves or someone in their family will be exposed to the virus, including 17 percent who say they are very worried.”

Fear has become — and to some degree, has always been — a highly exploitable commodity in the political and media marketplaces. Both profit from public anxiety.

Christie, working feverishly to erase the memories of closed bridges and burned ones, has become the face of the politicians with hard head and heavy hands seeking hefty political reward from leveraging that fear.

He says his quarantine policy is just “common sense.” That’s just nonsense.

A Political Crystal Ball

By now, I’m sure you’re asking yourself: If the Republicans take control of the Senate in next week’s elections, what would it mean to me?

Excellent question!

“We’ll get things done, and it means a stop to the Obama agenda,” said the embattled Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas. Did you notice that “get things done” is immediately followed by “stop?” What do you think that means?

Well, we know that if the Republicans win the majority, all Senate committees would have Republican chairs. The Energy Committee, for instance, might be run by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies. This would be a dramatic change from the current situation in which the Energy Committee is run by Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies.

On a far more exciting note, the Environment Committee could wind up being led by James Inhofe, the author of “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.”

Under the Republicans, the Senate would be an extremely open body, in which the minority party would be permitted — nay, welcomed — to submit clever amendments designed to make the majority take difficult or embarrassing votes that could be used against them in the next election. The minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has complained about the Democrats’ heavy-handedness on this for years and will undoubtedly be eager to change things if he gets in control.

And what about substance? Republican voters would have every reason to expect that the first item on McConnell’s agenda would be repeal of Obamacare. But many Republican senators have positions on the Affordable Care Act that are nuanced in the extreme. Get rid of the program but keep the part about people with pre-existing conditions. Or the bit that lets young adults stay on their parents’ policies. McConnell himself has said that he wants to let his home state of Kentucky keep its extremely popular version of the program, which is known as Kynect. (“The website can continue, but in my view the best interests of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare root and branch.”)

We look forward to seeing that legislation.

Cynical minds might presume that, with a Republican majority, the Senate would simply continue in its current state of dysfunction, working diligently on an agenda (defund Planned Parenthood, strangle the Environmental Protection Agency in its crib) that will die for lack of 60 votes. Democrats, meanwhile, would fall back in love with the filibuster.

Or maybe not. Some people believe that the Republicans would be eager to prove that they really, actually, genuinely can get things done and would work with the White House on matters of common interest, like tax reform.

“Tax reform” would probably mean lowering some rates and making up for the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes elsewhere. The House Ways and Means Committee did some work on that recently, and the committee chairman actually unveiled a plan. Then John Boehner made fun of him. The plan never came up for a vote. The chairman is retiring.

There are a few matters in which a Republican Senate majority would make a critical difference. One is the budget. This is stupendously important, but since we may have to spend the next two years discussing fiscal cliffs and the rules of reconciliation, it doesn’t seem fair to make us start early.

Also, there’s the matter of presidential nominations. “Two words: Supreme Court,” said Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. “If they have the majority, they have far more say over who’s the nominee.”

That could have an impact for decades to come. However, it presupposes that there will be a Supreme Court vacancy. On the plus side, the next two years will be a boom time for prayers for the good health of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Presuming the current justices continue in good form, the Republicans could still block other presidential nominations and we would have to get used to government by acting-heads-of. But that’s already pretty close to the norm. One Republican representative recently denounced President Obama for creating an Ebola czar instead of giving the job to the surgeon general, apparently unaware that we have had no surgeon general for more than a year, thanks to the National Rifle Association’s opposition to the administration’s nominee for the job.

Tracked down by The Huffington Post, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed he really did know the surgeon general’s post was vacant, and that anybody from the office could still do the Ebola job. “I know there’s some confusion there, but I don’t think I was confused,” he said stoutly.

See, Representative Jason Chaffetz is perfectly willing to live with an acting surgeon general. And maybe someone could talk Eric Holder into hanging around for a while longer.

Nicholas Kristof is off today.

Ebola Slowing in Liberia, W.H.O. Says, but International Support Is Still Necessary

GENEVA — Three months after declaring West Africa’s Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic a global emergency, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Wednesday that new infections in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], one of the worst affected countries, appeared to be declining. But the organization also warned against complacency in international efforts to fight the disease.

The health authorities in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] are reporting lower numbers of new infections; treatment centers in the capital, Monrovia, that once turned away victims now had unoccupied beds; and the number of burials of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] victims had started to drop, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the W.H.O. assistant director-general, told reporters in Geneva.

“Do we feel confident that the response is now getting an upper hand on the virus? Yes, we are seeing a slowing of the rate of new cases very definitely” in Liberia, said Dr. Aylward, who is in charge of the operational response to the epidemic.

At least 13,703 people have been infected by the virus, all but 27 of them in the three worst affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the latest estimates cited by Dr. Aylward. Nearly half of the total is in Liberia.

About 5,000 of the infected are reported to have died of the disease, which Dr. Aylward said still has a mortality rate of around 70 percent in the three countries most afflicted.

Despite the positive data from Liberia, Dr. Aylward was cautious. He expressed concern that infection rates could start to oscillate and that areas thought to have been purged of the disease could become reinfected.

“I am terrified that the information will be misinterpreted and people will start to think, ‘Oh, great, this is under control,’ ” he said. “That’s like saying your pet tiger is under control. This is a very, very dangerous disease.”

Just a few mishandled burials, Dr. Aylward said, could “start a whole new transmission chain and the disease starts trending upward again.”

The first death from Ebola in Mali[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/africa/mali-reports-first-death-from-ebola.html] last week underscored the danger that the disease will spill into neighboring countries. W.H.O. data shows new cases of infection in all but two of the districts in Guinea and Liberia that border Ivory Coast.

Dr. Aylward partly attributed the apparent easing in Liberia to aggressive efforts to establish safe burials of victims, who are most contagious at death.

He also said the Liberia government’s intensive public education campaign to minimize contact with the infected, and a rapid increase in the capacity of treatment centers to isolate patients, appeared to have helped.

Fifteen treatment centers are now operating in the three worst hit countries, and another 22 should be functional by the end of November.

Still, achieving a drop in day-to-day infection rates is not ending the epidemic, which Dr. Aylward called “a completely different ballgame.”

The better news from Liberia comes only two weeks after the W.H.O. warned the epidemic could produce 10,000 new cases every week by December. Dr. Aylward did not discard that assessment, but said it would be reviewed.

The positive trend seen in Liberia should be taken as a sign that with the planned investments, “this virus can be stopped,” Dr. Aylward said. “But it’s going to take a very, very aggressive program of work to capitalize on those opportunities.”

The Ebola virus, which has no confirmed cure, began to spread in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in March. It is now considered one of the worst global health emergencies in modern times.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the W.H.O.’s director-general, has spoken in increasingly dire terms about the Ebola outbreak and the need to stop it. She told an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council last month[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/dg/speeches/2014/security-council-ebola/en/] that the outbreak was “likely the greatest peacetime challenge that the United Nations and its agencies have ever faced.”

In Connecticut, a Family’s Confusion After a Girl, 7, Is Barred From School

The third-grader was not feeling sick. She did not have a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or any other symptoms of Ebola. Having just completed a 10-day trip to Nigeria, where she was the flower girl at a family wedding, she was eager to get back to class. But officials at her Connecticut elementary school told her she could not come back.

Concerned by her trip to Africa, they said the third-grader, Ikeoluwa Opayemi, would have to stay out of class at Meadowside Elementary School in Milford for 21 days, the maximum known time it can take for symptoms of Ebola to emerge.

“I said, ‘Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about,’ ” her father, Stephen Opayemi, recalled. After all, his daughter had not been exposed to anyone with Ebola. In fact, there are no known Ebola patients in Nigeria, which has been declared free of the disease[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/20-october-2014/en/] by the World Health Organization.

But according to a lawsuit that the Opayemi family has filed against the school district, local officials insisted that banning the girl from school was necessary — not to contain any possible illness, but to contain the fears of people at the school.

The lawsuit accuses the school district of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination against those who have physical or mental impairments. According to Gary Phelan, the family’s lawyer, it also protects those like 7-year-old Ikeoluwa, who, despite being healthy, are being singled out.

Quarantines to protect the public health have become a charged issue nationwide, as states have attempted to craft policies regarding travelers who may be incubating Ebola. Connecticut’s safeguards go beyond federal recommendations and include the possibility of quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/malloy-ebola-quarantine-system-in-connecticut-raises-concern.html] for asymptomatic people who meet certain risk factors, including recent travel to a country experiencing an Ebola outbreak, which does not include Nigeria.

According to the Opayemi family’s lawsuit, Dr. Andrew Dennis McBride, Milford’s health director, “acknowledged that his decision was not based on any approved state or federal protocol, was not based on any scientific or medical evidence, and violated the C.D.C., World Health Organization, Connecticut Department of Public Health and U.S. State Department protocols.”

On Wednesday, Dr. McBride’s office said he was not available for comment. In a statement, Elizabeth Feser, Milford’s superintendent of schools, said: “In addressing this situation, at all times, my staff and I proceeded in good faith to respond to this public health issue. We acted in the best interest of all of our students and staff.”

As described by Mr. Opayemi, who runs a company that imports specialty foods, recent weeks have been a welter of confused and contradictory directives.

Before he and Ikeoluwa left for Nigeria, he informed her teacher that they were taking the trip and asked what work the young student should take on the journey. Days later, Mr. Opayemi’s wife, Ikeolapo, a registered nurse[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/nursing_and_nurses/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] pursuing a doctoral degree, got a call from Dr. McBride advising her that everyone returning from Africa had to be screened for Ebola. (During the trip, Ms. Opayemi remained home with the couple’s two older children.)

Mr. Opayemi and his daughter returned to Connecticut on Oct. 13, expecting that she would attend school the next day. Instead, the family got another call from Dr. McBride, telling them that Ikeoluwa would not be allowed back for an unspecified period.

“I said, ‘What do I tell her?’ ” Mr. Opayemi recalled, his voice rising. “You mean I should keep my daughter away perpetually and have no idea when she’s going to go back to school?” The next day he received an answer: 21 days.

Mr. Opayemi said he and his wife offered to have their daughter tested for Ebola at their own expense, to have the school nurse monitor her for symptoms, and to consider any other measures. At various points, he said, one or another official seemed amenable to their offers, but in the end they were refused. Dr. McBride “said she needs to be away for 21 days because of the rumors in her school, because of the fear, the climate,” Mr. Opayemi said.

Several parents of Meadowside students, however, said they had known nothing about the matter until they heard about the family’s lawsuit from the news.

“I’m a pretty big supporter of the schools, but I believe they made a significant mistake here,” Christopher Thomas said, a high school social studies teacher whose three children have all attended Meadowside.

“I find it scary that we’re going to let unknown fears from unknown people trump what we know about science,” said Deb McKenna, whose son is a fourth-grader at the school. “I haven’t heard or seen any parent upset, so if it’s a school decision, then the school should own that.”

Ikeoluwa’s school has arranged for a tutor to visit her from 8 to 9:30 a.m. every weekday. Beyond that, she is passing the time by doing class work, reading and having play dates with her friends, none of whom seem worried about being near her.

Mr. Phelan, the family’s lawyer, said he was not aware of similar cases, “but I think this is going to happen.”

“For example, when flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] season hits,” he said, “I think some kids are going to exhibit symptoms that mimic Ebola. This is the first case; it’s not going to be the last.”

A crises mount, can U.S. team cope?; Foreign policy blunders stir talk of a shake-up of the president’s staff

One day this month, as the nation shuddered with fears of an Ebola outbreak and as American warplanes pounded Sunni militants in Syria, President Obama’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, invited a group of foreign policy experts to the White House Situation Room to hear their assessment of how the administration was performing.

She was peppered with critiques of the president’s Syria and China policies, as well as the White House’s repeated delays in releasing a national security strategy, a congressionally mandated document that sets out foreign policy goals. On that last point, Ms. Rice had a sardonic reply.

‘‘If we had put it out in February or April or July,’’ she said, according to two people who were in the room, ‘‘it would have been overtaken by events two weeks later, in any one of those months.’’

At a time when the Obama administration is lurching from crisis to crisis — a new Cold War in Europe, a brutal attempt to form an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East and a deadly epidemic in West Africa, to name just the most obvious ones — it is not surprising that long-term strategy would take a back seat. But it raises inevitable questions about the ability of the president and his hard-pressed national security team to manage and somehow get ahead of the daily onslaught of events.

Early stumbles in the government’s handling of the Ebola crisis, as well as its belated response to the group calling itself the Islamic State, have fueled speculation that Mr. Obama may shake up his team. The group is stocked with battle-tested but exhausted White House loyalists and cabinet members, like Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who are viewed as less cohesive than the ‘‘team of rivals’’ in Mr. Obama’s first cabinet. George W. Bush took that route after the bruising midterm elections in 2006, when he dismissed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.

‘‘There is an inflection point in every presidency, and this certainly is a logical one, if the president feels he might be better served by some replacements on his team,’’ said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

While Mr. Blumenthal said the administration had borne up well under the circumstances, the scale and complexity of the problems ‘‘would exact a toll personally and professionally on any group.’’

There is little evidence that the president plans a wholesale shake-up. But he has already brought in new blood: Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to manage the response to Ebola, and Gen. John Allen, a former commander in Afghanistan, to marshal the coalition against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

Mr. Obama is also leaning more than ever on his small circle of White House aides, who forged their relationships with him during his 2008 campaign and loom even larger in an administration without weighty voices like those of Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary, or Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state.

This month, the White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, traveled to the San Francisco home of Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to negotiate personally over redactions in a Senate report on the Central Intelligence Agency’s detention and interrogation policies after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

That Mr. McDonough would get involved in such an arcane matter puzzles some legislative aides on Capitol Hill, given the other demands on his time. But it testifies to how the president tends to hand delicate assignments to his most trusted advisers. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Hagel, meanwhile, are struggling to carve out a place in the administration and to penetrate the tight-knit circle around the president.

In separate interviews, Mr. McDonough and Ms. Rice said the president was satisfied with his cabinet. ‘‘Deciding policy is just one step,’’ Mr. McDonough said. ‘‘You need the secretaries to implement.’’

To do that, however, Mr. Obama has decided he also needs reinforcements like Mr. Klain and General Allen. Mr. Klain, aides said, is viewed as a potential replacement for John D. Podesta, the president’s counselor, or even Mr. McDonough, if he chooses to leave.

But these outsiders, sometimes dubbed czars, can cause their own problems. General Allen’s appointment as special envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition antagonized the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, several officials said, because he worried that the retired general would stray onto the Pentagon’s turf.

‘‘The title czar carries with it the sense of all-knowing and all-powerful,’’ said Leon Fuerth, who was national security adviser to Vice President Al Gore and has written about management in the White House.

Nobody on Mr. Obama’s staff has genuine czar status, though Mr. McDonough comes closest. He has been equally immersed in domestic policy and politics, but his background is in national security and he has played a far more active role in that area than previous chiefs of staff. Before taking on the C.I.A. report, for example, he flew to Berlin to heal a rift with Germany over the National Security Agency’s eavesdropping on the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Mr. McDonough’s broad portfolio, several officials said, has posed a challenge to Ms. Rice, a blunt-spoken former United Nations ambassador who also has close ties to the president. She coordinated the debate over how to handle the C.I.A. report and the repercussions from the N.S.A.’s surveillance practices, though she may have aggravated those tensions in a heated exchange with her German counterpart.

‘‘I guess I could be a testosterone-driven, territorial kind of personality in this role,’’ she said. ‘‘My view on this is that it’s an asset to have a partner down the hall.’’

Mr. McDonough said he viewed his role as supporting Ms. Rice, and that he did not insert himself into her staff’s core business of developing policies, beyond having a seat at the table like other members of the president’s cabinet. He described Ms. Rice as a friend and said that ‘‘the president has exactly the national security adviser he wants.’’

Some liberals have been deeply disappointed with Mr. Obama’s slowness in embracing the Senate report, and have questioned Mr. McDonough’s involvement in redacting it, noting his close ties to the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, with whom he served as a deputy national security adviser during the first term. Mr. McDonough said he traveled to Ms. Feinstein’s home because he views the role of Congress in foreign policy as sacrosanct.

‘‘This is an important case study of the role of Congress in foreign policy,’’ he said, ‘‘and I want to get it right.’’

Whatever their jurisdictional issues, officials said, Mr. McDonough and Ms. Rice are generally aligned on policy. Both were skeptical about being drawn into the civil war in Syria and about providing weapons to Ukrainian forces to push back Russia-backed rebels. Their caution, one official said, tends to reinforce Mr. Obama’s own instincts.

That may have been a factor in the slow American response to the threat of the Islamic State. Mr. McDonough said he wished the administration had reacted sooner, given the battle for Falluja early this year, and acknowledged that the administration misjudged the robustness of the Iraqi Army.

The steady expansion of the National Security Council, and its growing role in operations, poses another problem, said David Rothkopf, an official in the administration of President Bill Clinton who has written a history of the N.S.C. Mr. Rothkopf attributed the recent ill will between the administration and the Israeli government in part to the N.S.C.’s increased involvement in diplomacy instead of strictly policy-making.

‘‘All N.S.C.s are tempted to meddle in operational issues, but it not only undercuts the deployed officials; it keeps the White House from focusing where it should: on bigger, strategic issues,’’ said Dennis C. Blair, who served as director of national intelligence until 2010, when he was forced out after feuding with other intelligence officials.

Ultimately, of course, the administration’s crisis management reflects on the president. Mr. Obama, several officials said, came back from a summer vacation frustrated that the White House seemed reactive to events, and instructed his staff to shift their response into a higher gear. Yet he remains deliberative, methodical and not swayed by outside criticism of his style. His blow-up during a meeting on the response to Ebola two weeks ago was the exception rather than the rule, they said.

‘‘We’re managing a multi-ring event and, I think, reasonably well,’’ said Ms. Rice, who had just listened in on Mr. Obama’s call to Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada after last week’s terrorist attack in Ottawa. ‘‘We’ve got a lot of balls in the air, and frankly, they’re still in the air.’’

Ebola care center reports a puzzling lull; Liberians being treated for the disease are far fewer than was expected

For days this month, the ambulances from this Ebola treatment unit went out in search of patients, only to return with just one or two suspected cases. And many times, those people ended up testing negative for the disease.

‘‘Where are the patients?’’ an aid worker wondered aloud as colleagues puzzled over the empty beds at the International Medical Corps treatment unit here in Bong County, Liberia, which opened in mid-September. Around the country, treatment centers, laboratory workers who test for Ebola, and international and national health officials attempting to track the epidemic have noticed an unexpected pattern: There are far fewer people being treated for Ebola than anticipated.

As of Sunday, fewer than half of the 649 treatment beds across the country were occupied, a surprising change in a nation where patients had long been turned away from Ebola units for lack of space.

Now, the rate of new admissions to treatment centers is dropping or flat, the number of samples being submitted to Ebola laboratories has fallen significantly, and the percentage of people testing positive for the disease is down.

‘‘The numbers are decreasing, but we don’t know why,’’ said Malin Lager, a spokeswoman at a Doctors Without Borders treatment center just outside Monrovia. Its vast campus of white tents, which has a capacity for 253 patients, had only 90 on Sunday. ‘‘It’s too early to celebrate,’’ Ms. Lager said.

Liberia has long been a focal point of the Ebola epidemic, the nation with the most cases and deaths from the disease, prompting a global call to action. Hundreds of new beds have been added in recent weeks, but now many are going unfilled even before any of the 18 treatment centers being built by the American military have opened, leaving many officials here confounded.

The World Health Organization acknowledged Wednesday that the spread of Ebola might be slowing in Liberia. Bruce Aylward, the organization’s assistant director general, in a dial-in news conference from its Geneva offices, said there had been a drop in the number of burials in Liberia and no increases in laboratory-confirmed cases.

While Dr. Aylward cautioned that it was premature to draw conclusions, and that Ebola cases could rise in Liberia again, he appeared to be optimistic that the global effort to combat the outbreak was making headway. ‘‘Do we feel confident that the response is now getting an upper hand on the virus?’’ he said. ‘‘Yes, we are seeing a slowing rate of new cases, very definitely.’’

Some are debating whether the dire warnings issued by the World Health Organization — that there could be as many as 10,000 new cases each week in West Africa by December, about 10 times the rate it recently reported — might be grossly inflated.

‘‘The projections were based on nothing happening’’ to curb the outbreak, the United States ambassador to Liberia, Deborah R. Malac, said during a visit to the International Medical Corps treatment center this month. ‘‘More things are happening every day.’’

For now, most officials are continuing to plan for the worst so as not to interfere with the mounting international response, which is seen as critical to preventing a resurgence. Even a single unsafe burial, in which mourners touch highly infectious corpses, can result in dozens of new cases.

The empty beds in Liberia come in the context of an intense public health campaign to educate the nation about the dangers of the disease and ways of combating it — from posters and billboards to messages broadcast when residents make phone calls. ‘‘Lonestar Cell cares about your health. Ebola is real,’’ one company’s recording says.

Some consider the latest developments an indication that the efforts to combat the virus, including the opening of new treatment units, are beginning to succeed.

‘‘We can see it subsiding bit by bit,’’ the Rev. Omalley M. Segbee told his congregation at Sunday services at the Grace Baptist Church in the town of Gbarnga. ‘‘This means you are on our side, oh Lord.’’

But because Liberians celebrated early once before — believing the virus had been eradicated in the spring, only to see it rage back with greater force in the summer — there is a near universal hesitance to call the outbreak under control. Liberia’s neighbors, Sierra Leone and Guinea, have been experiencing a troubling surge of cases in recent weeks.

There is also the likelihood that many people dying of Ebola in Liberia are hidden from the authorities, as has been true throughout the epidemic.

Many parts of the country are not well monitored, many contacts of Ebola patients are not traced, and officials have long acknowledged that the statistics on the numbers of Ebola cases across West Africa are rough estimates, at best.

Treatment beds and laboratories in Liberia are also concentrated in the capital. Large swaths of the country are hours away from these centers on bad roads, in areas that lack cellphone services, which is why the new treatment centers being built far from other Ebola facilities are considered so important.

Many of the monitoring experts, too, are in the capital. Months into the crisis, officials still remind themselves of the need to get out into the wider country to test their assumptions about the epidemic. But even in the capital, many Ebola patients are suspected to have died at home, leaving big gaps in data on the scope of the disease.

Anna Halford, a field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, says the charity has a broad network of community members who promote Ebola awareness in and around the capital. ‘‘Not a single one of the supervisors believes there is a significant drop in cases,’’ she said.

Families may keep sick relatives at home for many reasons, including rumors of mistreatment inside Ebola units and fears of quarantine and stigma, she said. Beyond that, ‘‘It is a disease that comes in waves because of the variability of the incubation period and because of the mobility of people,’’ she said.

Last week, to better understand whether gaps in detecting and tracing cases might explain why treatment numbers are low, the World Health Organization dispatched experts to the country’s far-flung districts.

Employees of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also went out into communities to attempt to get a better understanding of the situation. Their conclusions are expected in the coming days.

As Samson Arzoaquoi, who heads the Ebola task force in Bong County, bumped along a dirt road over the weekend, he said the area had been quieter.

‘‘This time is not yet a time for us to rejoice,’’ he warned a crowd gathered to begin an Ebola outreach program. ‘‘If we begin to laugh and celebrate, what will happen? We will go right back where we are coming from.’’

“The first real gaffe of the night came from the moderator,” said the television news broadcaster John Snell, after he confused the order of the candidates during the second and last debate between the Louisiana[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/politics/national-concerns-drain-color-from-politics-in-louisiana.html] Senate contenders.

It was also about the only unexpected thing that happened in the debate at Louisiana State University, which pitted Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Democratic incumbent, against Representative Bill Cassidy, a Republican, and retired Col. Rob Maness, a Republican Tea Party favorite.

Mr. Cassidy talked about President Obama: Ms. Landrieu’s voting record with Mr. Obama, the Obama-Landrieu economy, Mr. Obama’s failure to protect the country from Ebola and “Obamacare.”

Mr. Maness used his answer to a question about the historical roots of racial income inequality to talk about Mr. Obama’s health care law. “Repeal, replace and pull it out by the roots,” he began.

Ms. Landrieu, the last Senate Democrat in the Deep South, took swings at “these two,” as she called her opponents, for being too far to the right. But she also made sure to point out that she wants to build a “smart fence” on the border, that she would support Louisiana’s ban on same-sex marriage and that she has gone against Mr. Obama on some issues.

Mr. Maness concluded the debate with a closing statement that quoted extensively from the fictional Col. Nathan P. Jessup in the movie “A Few Good Men.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Showdown on quarantine policy.

Kaci Hickox, the Maine nurse who cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone but who has not shown symptoms of the virus, defied [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/kaci-hickox-nurse-under-ebola-quarantine-takes-bike-ride-defying-maine-officials.html]the state’s quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/kaci-hickox-nurse-under-ebola-quarantine-takes-bike-ride-defying-maine-officials.html] of her today by going on a bike ride with her boyfriend.

It was not clear how Maine would react. On Wednesday, the state’s health commissioner said that she would seek a court order to enforce the 21-day quarantine in what has become a fight between individual rights and public safety.

A CBS News poll showed 80 percent of respondents saying residents returning from West Africa should be quarantined[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-americans-believe-there-should-be-a-quarantine-to-deal-with-ebola/] until it is certain they do not have Ebola.

• Flashpoint in Jerusalem.

The Israeli police today killed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/middleeast/yehuda-glick-shooting-suspect-killed-jerusalem.html] a Palestinian[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] man suspected of shooting and seriously wounding a right-wing Israeli activist who has agitated for more Jewish access to a contested holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.

Israel’s closing of the site[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29828547] today, the first in 14 years, was called a “declaration of war” by a spokesman for the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.

• The tight, and pricey, races.

President Obama travels to Portland, Me., this afternoon for a campaign event[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/30/us/politics/ap-us-obama.html] with Representative Mike Michaud, who is in a close contest for governor there.

Democrats in the closest Senate races across the South are turning to[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/politics/from-democrats-election-focus-on-racial-scars.html] racially charged messages, and spending in the North Carolina campaign is the first to top $100 million[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/29/us/politics/ap-us-senate-north-carolina-cost.html].

Democrats appear to be slipping in the latest polls with Latino voters[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/latino-support-for-democrats-drops-a-bit-poll-says.html] and younger voters[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/29/?entry=3855&_php=true&_type=blogs&partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0].

• Game for the ages.

Madison Bumgarner strengthened his case[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/upshot/madison-bumgarner-joins-an-elite-list.html] as one of the best pitchers in World Series history, pitching five scoreless innings to lead the San Francisco Giants to victory[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-giants-beat-royals-in-game-7-to-win-title.html] over the Kansas City Royals.

The Giants are the second team, after the Boston Red Sox, to win three championships in the 21st century.

• Apple C.E.O. is “proud to be gay.”

Timothy D. Cook, in an essay today in Bloomberg Businessweek[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay], publicly acknowledges that he is gay.

• Checking for chemical exposure.

The Pentagon will begin offering[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/world/middleeast/iraq-chemical-weapons-pentagon-response.html] medical examinations and long-term health monitoring for troops who served in Iraq, in response to an investigation by The Times[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/14/world/middleeast/us-casualties-of-iraq-chemical-weapons.html] of how some were exposed to nerve and mustard agents.

• Pensions in the balance.

A federal judge is expected to rule today on the plan for Stockton, Calif., to exit bankruptcy[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stockton-bankruptcy-20141030-story.html]. The decision hinges on whether pension plans in such cases should be left intact.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks aremostly higher. Europe shares ended ahead, and Asian indexes ended mixed.

• The Commerce Department reported[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/business/economy/us-economy-q3-2014-gdp.html] that the nation’s economic output rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, offering another sign that growth is steady if unspectacular.

That is down from 4.6 percent in the second quarter, but still a healthy pace.

• Samsung’s quarterly profit fell 60 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/business/samsung-reports-lowest-profit-in-3-years.html] to its lowest in more than three years. It has lost smartphone market share for the last two quarters.

Shell’s earnings[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-plc-earnings-q3.html] rose, while Barclays posted[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/barclays-profit-falls-on-weaker-investment-banking-and-legal-costs/] lower profit. Other earnings expected today: Starbucks, Altria, MasterCard and LinkedIn.

NOTEWORTHY

• Homecoming in Cleveland.

LeBron James plays his first regular-season N.B.A. game in a Cavaliers uniform since returning to Cleveland tonight (8 o’clock Eastern, TNT).

James, an Ohio native, played his first seven seasons in Cleveland before leaving in July 2010 to join the Miami Heat, where he won titles in 2012 and 2013.

• Swan song.

The 12th and final season of the sitcom “Two and a Half Men[http://www.cbs.com/shows/two_and_a_half_men/],” starring Ashton Kutcher and Jon Cryer, premieres tonight. It began in 2003 and originally starred Charlie Sheen (9 o’clock Eastern, CBS).

The fight heard ‘round the world.

Today is the 40th anniversary of “The Rumble in the Jungle[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-foreman.html],” the boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman held in Zaire, which is thought to be one of the sport’s greatest battles.

Ali hung back on the ropes, a strategy he later called the “rope-a-dope,” and allowed the undefeated Foreman to punch away and wear himself out. Ali then knocked him out in the eighth round to regain the world heavyweight title.

BACK STORY

Mischief night. Devil’s night.[http://www4.uwm.edu.proxy.bc.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_110.html] Gate night. Cabbage night. Devil’s eve. Goosey night.

Those are some of the names[http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/10/28/night_before_halloween_mischief_night_devil_s_night_cabbage_night_devil.html] for the pre-Halloween hooliganism that takes place in pockets of the United States and Canada on Oct. 30 each year.

It evolved over the last century after community leaders clamped down on Halloween night mayhem to make it more of a family affair.

In Vermont, teenagers throw rotten vegetables at cars and houses on cabbage night. In the Midwest, vandals would unlock farmers’ gates. Toilet-papering trees, egging houses, soaping cars and smashing pumpkins are other common pranks.

But no city has had it worse than Detroit, where arsonists set fire to hundreds of abandoned houses, cars and Dumpsters on devil’s nights in the 1980s.

By the end of the decade, the city had imposed a strict Oct. 30 curfew[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/30/us/detroit-journal-city-hoping-to-quell-fires-of-devil-s-night.html] for minors and asked volunteers to walk the streets to prevent mischief. This year, Detroit’s patrols and curfews started[http://www.metrotimes.com/Blogs/archives/2014/10/09/duggan-announces-measures-for-devils-angels-night] Wednesday.

They have helped. Last year, 95 fires were reported[http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/angels-night-annual-arson-prevention-effort-set-to-get-underway-in-detroit/29399862] on the officially renamed Angels’ Night, down from more than 800 in 1984.

C.D.C. Ebola Guidelines Aren’t Good Enough for Some States
By PHILIP M. BOFFEY

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published scientifically sound recommendations on how to monitor health care workers who return to this country after treating Ebola patients. The agency hoped that its rules would head off the confusion resulting from separate state-by-state policies.

So what has happened since the C.D.C. issued its recommendations on October 22 and refined them on October 27? Over the past week, eleven states have announced quarantine and monitoring policies that are more stringent than C.D.C. guidelines.

Researchers at Arizona State University’s law school, led by Professor James G. Hodge, Jr., concluded that the following states[https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/dzf8u4/Ebola-Outbreak-2014---Network-Overview.pdf] all exceeded C.D.C. guidelines in important ways: California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. In some cases, states would impose quarantines on a broader class of people than C.D.C. does. In other cases, they would restrict the activities that quarantined persons can engage in to a greater degree than C.D.C.To cite one example, California may impose a 21-day quarantine on a case-by-case basis on anyone who has traveled from an Ebola-stricken area and has had contact with an Ebola patient while there. By contrast, the C.D.C. guidelines impose a 21-day quarantine only on doctors, nurses and other health care workers deemed at “high risk” of Ebola. That narrow group includes people who got an Ebola patient’s body fluids directly on the skin or splashed in the eyes or injected through a needle stick, or who touched a dead body without wearing appropriate protective equipment.

People with slightly lesser degrees of contact with an Ebola patient would not be quarantined but would have their temperatures and symptoms monitored twice a day, once through observation by a public health official, and once through a phone call. They could be excluded from visiting public places or workplaces, as well as from travel on planes, ships, trains, buses or subways.

The driving force behind stricter state policies surely isn’t science. Various governors wanted to show toughness in the face of a danger that has been wildly exaggerated to bolster their campaigns for re-election or to reassure a panicky public.

The remaining states appear to be adhering to C.D.C. guidelines, at least for now, either because they believe the guidelines are justified by scientific evidence, or because they have had no cases to worry about.

Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, strongly endorses the C.D.C. guidelines and contends that differing state approaches will only sow confusion in citizens wondering how real the danger is and what to do about it. But the likelihood that any governors will back down is close to nil.

The best that can be hoped is that they find ways to mitigate the adverse impact of a quarantine on the heroic health care workers who are risking their lives to stop the epidemic in West Africa. New York, which has one of the more stringent quarantine policies among the states, is belatedly trying to do just that.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today that they will create a program to ensure that health care workers who travel to West Africa to treat Ebola patients will have their pay, health care and employment continue seamlessly when they get back. The state would also reimburse the health care workers and their employers for costs associated with any quarantine upon their return. They hope to alleviate concerns that the state’s mandatory quarantine policy could deter medical workers from volunteering to travel overseas to fight the epidemic.

Of course, the best way to solve that problem would be to stop overreacting and adopt the more rational C.D.C. approach to quarantines and monitoring.

Reading The Times With David Salle

David Salle is an American painter, printmaker and stage designer. His work is in the permanent collection of museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum and the Tate Gallery. Mr. Salle is credited with having helped define postmodern sensibility.

He reads the paper in pre-modern form, “Always and only in print, standing up at a kitchen counter,” he says.

Q.

Do you read the paper straight through or skip around?

A.

I skip around – and often save the best (Wednesday, Food) or the worst (Thursday, Style) for last.

I do not read the sports section, although photographs of athletes are often the most dynamic thing in the paper, visually.

Q.

Is reading the paper more sport than chore?

A.

Neither. I read the paper because I have always done so; it’s part of living here. When I’m not in town – for months at a time during the summer – I don’t look at it at all.

Q.

Anything on Page 1 that speaks with particular force to postmodern sensibility?

A.

I don’t know if it’s my postmodern sensibility, but the strip at the bottom of Page 1 advertising Christie’s upcoming auction caught my eye. Brando and Elvis.

Today’s paper is all about cinema in one way or another; the cinema effect is all over it and spilling out of it.

The language used in the story[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html?ref=us] about lobbyists, bearing gifts, pursuing state attorneys general: “… allegations of deceptive advertising… it moved quickly to shut the investigation down….” What is that if not the plot of a Hollywood film?

What’s new in this story is how completely unabashed the lobbyists are – they don’t even bother to hide the fact that the government is for sale. They are in fact quite pleased with themselves; the more people know about it, the better it is for business.

The photo of Florida’s attorney general [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html?ref=us]on Page 1 has an echo of Fassbinder: an attractive blond woman, smiling blithely, surrounded by men dressed in dark suits and ties who look as though they have something to hide. I think it’s a photograph of Florida attorney general Pam Bondi being interviewed by the press – someone’s holding a microphone in the lower left corner – but as an illustration of (apparently legal) corruption, the photograph is beautifully staged.

Q.

Did you follow the Times series on Rikers Island? There is a follow-up story[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/top-uniformed-jail-officer-to-step-down-over-rikers-violence.html] on the front page today about high-ranking Rikers officials stepping down after much criticism over the handling of violence and brutality at the jail.

A.

I approach the paper in a more impressionistic way; I don’t really follow stories as such.

Q.

Are there certain kinds of stories you tend to skip?

A.

It has more to do with a certain kind of language – when the paper is obliged to quote some bureaucratic-speak, the kind that means the opposite of what it says.

Some things that are just irredeemably sad I might skip over. Like the Rikers story. It depends on how I’m feeling.

Q.

National news story: “Secret Service Investigator Quit Amid His Own Scandal.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/politics/investigator-in-secret-service-prostitution-scandal-resigns-after-being-implicated-in-own-incident.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22%7D]” That’s right, the investigator of a 2012 prostitution scandal resigns after he is implicated in … his own prostitution scandal. Any response to this piece?

A.

I’m shocked, shocked. The funny thing is, the guy must have forgotten just which cathouses they had under surveillance – probably because there were so many. Or maybe he thought he was invisible. Either way, the Secret Service can probably get along without him.

Q.

Also in the front section, “French Culture Minister’s Prosaic Reading List Draws Criticism.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/world/europe/fleur-pellerin-patrick-modiani-france-culture.html]” The French culture minister admits she hasn’t read a book in two years. She horrified the French. Her revelation inspired one Frenchman to declare, “Barbarism is here.” What do you think?

A.

“Barbarism” must mean something different in French. I knew Michel Guy – he was minister of culture in the mid-70s and remained active in the ministry into the ’80s. A real aesthete, a man of taste as well as vision. He paved the way for the Musée Picasso, among other things. That was then. The current one, who I don’t know at all, seems to be a rather stylish bureaucrat, perhaps an effective one. Her job is to create access to culture, not necessarily to consume it. At least the French still have the job. Should we spend time bemoaning the lack of literary curiosity of one minister? I’d rather read a book.

Q.

Have you tired of Ebola news?

A.

After some relentless, close-up images of the crisis, the front-page photo of the field hospital was taken at a merciful distance. It’s the irony that great tragedy can produce some ravishing images – today’s picture looks like something from a Jane Campion film. I’m not tired of the Ebola news, just very saddened by it.

Q.

Did you find any good news in the paper today?

A.

In the business section: Simplicity is in on Madison Avenue.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/business/media/seeing-a-value-in-simplicity-.html] Very good news.

Q.

Do you read obits? Any today that caught your attention?

A.

I always read the obits. I was sorry to read about Kit Carson[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/movies/l-m-kit-carson-actor-and-writer-dies-at-73.html]. I knew him briefly in the ’80s, when he wrote the remake of Godard’s “Breathless,” and again in the ’90s. He gave me a DVD of “Bottle Rocket” and told me the guy – Wes Anderson – was very talented.

Q.

Any columnists you particularly like?

A.

The only columnist I look at regularly is Paul Krugman, who should be required reading for eighth grade and up.

Q.

Arts. Anything in this section that particularly surprised or delighted you?

A.

Godard’s dog, Roxy.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/movies/goodbye-to-language-the-latest-from-jean-luc-godard.html] Here’s Godard again – and from A. O. Scott’s description, still defecating on the audience.

Q.

Anything in the paper today that made you laugh?

A.

It didn’t exactly make me laugh, but there is a description of what Republicans favor[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/28/?entry=3786&_php=true&_type=blogs&ref=politics], and Elvis is on the list. He is also irresistible to auction houses – see the pullout “Experience Christie’s” section inviting readers to try out their app. Edouard Manet, Andy Warhol, channeling two beloved movie icons, and some Chinese painter – simplicity is in.

Your Evening Briefing

Good evening.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• The big reveal.

The announcement by Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, that he was “proud to be gay”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/technology/timothy-cook-apples-chief-executive-says-he-is-proud-to-be-gay.html] was a milestone for the business world.

But in Silicon Valley?

“It isn’t a shock to many in the tech world that Mr. Cook is gay,” says our tech-culture columnist Nick Bilton. “He has long been a vocal advocate for gay rights.”

And the industry itself tends to be gay friendly, with some of the biggest companies helping fund opponents of a gay marriage ban in California, he says.

That said, “There definitely seems to be a sense of pride in the valley today that he will now openly talk about this,” Mr. Bilton says.

The big question, he says, is whether it will “create a domino effect for other companies that are run by L.G.B.T. chiefs, some of whom have been afraid to do the same for fear that it will alienate customers.”

• The nurse’s gamble.

“If she does get sick, or if her boyfriend does, that obviously will prove her and all the experts who reject mandatory quarantines wrong, and really drive hysteria over the edge.”

That’s our correspondent Kate Zernike on the potential fallout if Kaci Hickox, the Maine nurse rebelling[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/kaci-hickox-nurse-under-ebola-quarantine-takes-bike-ride-defying-maine-officials.html] against the authorities who want to quarantine her, actually comes down with Ebola.

“It would be much, much harder for officials or aide workers to try to convince the public that their fears aren’t justified,” she says.

Ms. Hickox has no symptoms and has tested negative, but her 21 days — the longest it has ever taken the disease to show up — are not up.

Already, she is going against the wishes of most Americans, who, according to polls, want health care workers who’ve treated Ebola patients in West Africa to observe a quarantine.

“She’s counting on being able to prove to people that the hysteria over Ebola is not justified,” Ms. Zernike says, “that not every aid worker returning will get the disease, that it’s not communicable unless someone has symptoms, which so far she doesn’t.”

• Surreality show.

Discovery’s “Rival Survival”[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/rival-survival] on Wednesday night followed two United States senators from opposite sides of the aisle as they foraged for food and water on a desert island.

We asked our Op-Ed columnist Gail Collins to play TV recapper. Here’s what she sent us:

“The theme, of course, is whether or not a Democrat (Martin Heinrich of New Mexico) and a Republican (Jeff Flake of Arizona) can work together when they are, as the narrator informs us, ‘Bitter Enemies!’

“Actually, in the grand scheme of things, Flake and Heinrich are not enemies at all. They appear never to have even met. If you wanted people who actually despised one another you’d need, say, John McCain and Ted Cruz. Who are both Republicans but really, that pairing would make one hell of an episode.

“Anyhow, Flake and Heinrich swim through shark-infested waters, fail to start a fire, fail to build a shelter and fail to catch a fish. There’s a metaphor here, but it isn’t about bipartisanship.

“The only true miracle of their outing is that two men appear able to go for days without nourishment or hydration without ever growing snappish. All those long days shaking hands at the mall have paid off.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed up. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.6 percent, led by health care and utilities.

1983 | Having Claimed 558 Lives, AIDS Finally Made It to the Front Page
DAVID W. DUNLAP

NYTB

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
David W. Dunlap[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/david_w_dunlap/index.html] is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 39 years.

So much isn’t parallel or comparable, I know. But a New Yorker of a certain age (mine, 62) cannot help contrasting the abundant coverage of the arrival of the Ebola virus in the United States with the little-noted emergence three decades earlier of the human immunodeficiency virus.

With Lawrence K. Altman[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/lawrence_k_altman/index.html]’s article of July 3, 1981, “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html],” The Times carried one of the first accounts anywhere of a syndrome whose outlines had seemed until then to be no more than terrifying rumor. “Doctors in New York and California have diagnosed among homosexual men 41 cases of a rare and often rapidly fatal form of cancer,” the article began. “Eight of the victims died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.”

The publication of Altman’s article was a turning point in awareness[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/05/memories-aids-new-york.html] for many gay men. It served that role dramatically in the movie “Longtime Companion[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29964/Longtime-Companion/overview]” and in Larry Kramer’s play, “The Normal Heart[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/22/theater/theater-the-normal-heart-by-larry-kramer.html].” As the play opens, Dr. Emma Brookner recounts to the protagonist, Ned Weeks, how inattentive the press had been. “Last week, which brought you running, The Times ran something on some inside page. Very inside: Page 20.”

Multiple deaths in New York City from a mysterious, fast-acting killer whose spread was incredibly targeted yet disturbingly inchoate. What a story.

I can easily imagine the metro desk of 2015 jumping in to follow up on Altman’s account: “Find out who’s died. Call Larry. Reach out to the families. Speak to neighbors. Try to talk to the patients. What hospitals are they in? Who are their doctors? Learn everything you can. When did they get sick? Where do they live? How old are they? And we’ve got to be clear about possible risks.”

The metro desk of 1981, to which I also belonged, did nothing.

The next article in The Times appeared in August. It was by The Associated Press. By then, more than 100 cases[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/082981sci-aids.html] of Kaposi’s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia had been reported, overwhelmingly among gay men, almost half of whom had died. Readers waited four months for the next report, on page D24, by United Press International, as five or six new cases were appearing each week.[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/10/us/homosexuals-found-particularly-liable-to-common-viruses.html]

The Times was “setting the tone for noncoverage nationally,” Randy Shilts wrote in “And the Band Played On[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/books/plenty-of-blame-to-go-around.html]” (1987). “There was only one reason for the lack of media interest, and everybody in the [Centers for Disease Control] task force knew it: The victims were homosexuals.”

Not until May 25, 1983, did AIDS appear on the front page; not until 1,450 cases — 558 of them ending in death[http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/us/health-chief-calls-aids-battle-no-1-priority.html] — had been reported; not until the government’s top health official said the investigation of AIDS would be the “No. 1 priority” of the Public Health Service. By then, however, a dam seemed to have burst at The Times. There were 20 articles on AIDS that month alone.

“Though the newspaper followed developments in the AIDS story, mention of the epidemic rarely appeared in the metro section or national news reporting,” Shilts wrote. “Homosexual reporters, particularly in New York, tended to know their place and keep their mouths shut, if they wanted to survive in the news business.”

I’m afraid that included me. More protective of my career than my community in the early years of the epidemic, I kept my own counsel about how we were ignoring AIDS. My first big story, concerning a new residence for homeless AIDS patients[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/nyregion/for-homeless-with-aids-a-new-home.html], did not appear until January 1987.

Though one reporter can’t change the course of the Times battleship, I have seen passionate, knowledgeable, persistent reporters nudge it a degree or two. The greatest regret of my career is that I didn’t try to do more, when I might have made a small difference, to improve our coverage of AIDS.

Ebola, by contrast, doesn’t seem to want for friends in court.

Talking to Bellevue Workers About Ebola’s Stigma
ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

NYT Blogs
NYTB

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
Reporters and editors on the International, National and Science desks have been working around the clock to cover the news about Ebola. When the story came to New York, Anemona Hartocollis, the Metro health reporter, was called on to cover a new angle: the stigma facing health workers at Bellevue Hospital Center[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/bellevue-workers-worn-out-from-treating-ebola-patient-face-stigma-outside-hospital.html?ref=nyregion&_r=0].

It was a remark by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday that got us thinking about the psychological stress that people at Bellevue Hospital Center might be feeling as they took care of New York’s first Ebola patient.

In a “media availability” at the hospital Sunday, the mayor chastised his fellow citizens for mistreating Bellevue workers, especially the nurses, out of fear that they would spread Ebola. “This is absolutely unacceptable,” he said.

After working many days without a break (including the previous weekend, on an article about how a new state law has barred 34,500 mental patients from having guns), I managed to beg off duty Sunday and was at the movies. But a senior editor heard the mayor’s talk and was intrigued.

The Ebola story in New York has been a tough one from the beginning because, as reporters, we have been very dependent on official sources like the health department, the mayor’s office, the police and emergency services. These sources are wonderful at feeding the news beast the basic information, but often they do not go much beyond that. And obviously, they have a strong interest in protecting their own reputations and not releasing anything negative. So Mr. de Blasio’s public admission that Bellevue workers were feeling stigmatized was jarring.

Mr. de Blasio spoke only in generalities about how the workers were being mistreated. My assignment was to get workers to talk and to find specific cases that we could document. My first move was to search my Google contacts for the word “Bellevue.” Up popped random names and numbers I had saved from other Bellevue stories, like Hurricane Sandy, which had forced the hospital to evacuate. It did not take long to find that, as I expected, Bellevue workers had been warned by the public relations department not to talk to the press.

Nonetheless, over two days, I continued working my sources. At the same time, my editor sent two intrepid stringers to buttonhole Bellevue workers outside the hospital and at nearby subway stops. Sometimes you get the story just by pounding the pavement. At 8 p.m. one night, I hopped on my bike and rode through the dark Manhattan streets to one nurse’s apartment to knock on her door. Not that I didn’t try to talk myself out of it. It was late, and I was tired. Before going, I did a Google Maps search and saw that it was only a 16-minute ride from the office, not enough time to complain about. Then I called my husband, thinking he might tell me the kids really needed me at home, but he declined to get involved. Then I thought of my editor, and how I would explain to him that I had gone home instead of the extra mile. So I was stuck. I went.

By the second day, we had enough of what the editors wanted – specific, reliable information – to feel confident in writing the story. Nurses and other employees talked about their own perhaps irrational but understandable fears of passing the virus to their families, despite their protective gear and sanitizing showers. They talked about being shunned by friends and acquaintances who knew where they worked.

Eventually, I got an email from Bellevue saying officials there thought the stigma faced by health care workers was important to talk about. Dr. Nate Link, Bellevue’s medical director, took time out of an incredibly stressful day – including one more visit from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – to walk me through the Ebola protocol at Bellevue and try to make it clear to the layman. He confirmed the problem of worker stigma, again in general terms.

In the end, the story came to life through its details, like how Mayra Martinez, a personal care associate at Bellevue, was told by her longtime hairdresser to find another beautician. One of the stringers, Nate Schweber, was at the subway at dawn and encountered Ms. Martinez as she walked out in her scrubs. She had just overheard two passengers joking about Ebola on the train, and she was primed to confide in someone. In the end, old-fashioned leg work paid off for all of us.

Detection, Prevention and Treatment: Researching Issues Around Ebola in the United States

Note: We have already published a lesson on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/learning-from-disaster-exploring-the-ebola-epidemic/], which we will continue to update. This lesson is focused on the issue of Ebola in the United States. Consult the Ebola Times Topics page [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] to find the most recent reporting.

For over six months, the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been ravaged by an out-of-control epidemic, but it wasn’t until late September, with the diagnosis of the disease in Thomas Eric Duncan in a Dallas hospital, that Ebola hit home for many Americans

After some early fumbling, federal, state and local authorities have put in place and revised a set of guidelines to keep the Ebola virus from spreading in the United States.

Use the resources below to take on any one of the topics we have suggested on their own, or do as we suggest in “Your Task” and have students look at the big picture via a simulation exercise.

Simulation Exercise

Your Task: You have been hired by the director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to draft a report on how to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus in the United States. What have we learned so far? Either working as a team with your classmates, or individually, first answer the questions below using the suggested resources as well any other trusted sources you find on your own. Then prepare a detailed, thorough report that focuses on both the lessons that have already been learned, as well as the areas in which improvement is still needed. What recommendations would you give Dr. Thomas R. Frieden [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/cdc-director-becomes-face-of-nations-worry-and-flawed-response.html], the director of the C.D.C.? Why?

1. What do we know about how the Ebola virus spreads? What are the disease’s symptoms?

To make any progress in stopping the disease, we need to understand how the virus is spread and how it progresses in an infected person. Start by watching this three-minute Q. and A. video and read this article about the risks of Ebola and what “direct contact” means [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/understanding-the-risks-of-ebola-and-what-direct-contact-means.html]. The Well blog will help you answer specific questions if you are wondering about Ebola and whether it spreads through mosquitoes [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/do-mosquitoes-spread-ebola/], airplanes [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/ask-well-ebola-on-airplanes-ebola-in-sneezes/] or even bowling balls [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/can-you-get-ebola-from-a-bowling-ball/].

2. How many cases have been treated in the United States? What has been the outcome in those cases?

Thousands of new cases are being diagnosed in West Africa every week, and many more people are dying. In Europe and the Americas, however, only a handful of cases have been treated — and the majority are health and aid workers who contracted Ebola in West Africa and were transported back to their home country for treatment.

To get an overview of all known cases outside West Africa, consult “How Many Ebola Patients Have Been Treated Outside of Africa?,” [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] (part of the Times Q. and A. on Ebola). You can use the embedded map to determine how many of those patients have recovered or died.

3. How are we preventing new undiagnosed cases from entering the United States?

The nation is still debating how to prevent new cases of Ebola from entering the country. Some politicians initially called for a ban on all flights [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/on-ebola-response-congressional-republicans-put-new-focus-on-visa-suspensions.html] from the affected nations (there are no direct flights to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea). Some governors have instituted 21-day quarantines [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/new-york-ebola-case-craig-spencer.html] for all health care workers returning to their states from the region, raising opposition from health care workers and the C.D.C.

The country’s policy on travelers — either foreign nationals or American citizens — entering the United States from the affected West African countries is still in flux as officials try to balance an effective evidence-based approach while also instilling confidence in the American public. It’s a difficult balance, especially with the midterm elections on Nov. 4.

For a brief overview, read “What Is the United States Doing to Make Sure That Ebola Does Not Spread?” [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html#tracing] (part of the Times Q. and A. on Ebola).

4. What are the best guidelines for keeping health care workers safe?

The nation’s first attempt to identify and treat a newly diagnosed Ebola case didn’t go well. The patient, Mr. Duncan, was sent home from a Dallas emergency room and didn’t return again until three days later, after losing valuable treatment time that might have saved his life and potentially spreading the disease to others (though it was later determined no one else contracted the disease from him before he was admitted). During his treatment at the hospital, two nurses who cared for Mr. Duncan also became infected with the disease.

You can start by reading a Times article reporting on the second Dallas nurse becoming infected [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/ebola-outbreak-texas.html] with Ebola to better understand how the nation was getting increasingly uneasy about the threat of the disease spreading. Then, read about how New York City learned from Dallas’s mistakes [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/new-york-ebola-response-polar-opposite-of-dallas.html] for its first case, Dr. Craig Spencer, who fell ill with the virus after treating patients with Ebola in Guinea.

Next, look through the following articles to learn how new guidelines were adopted in the wake of Dallas’s experience.

* Lax U.S. Guidelines on Ebola Led to Poor Hospital Training, Experts Say [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/us/lax-us-guidelines-on-ebola-led-to-poor-hospital-training-experts-say.html]

* Changes to Ebola Protection Worn by U.S. Hospital Workers [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/15/us/changes-to-ebola-protection-worn-by-us-hospital-workers.html]

* C.D.C. Issues New Guidelines for Ebola Care [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/cdc-issues-new-guidelines-for-ebola-care.html]

5. How are we preventing infected individuals from spreading disease?

To stop a disease from spreading, it’s not enough to just isolate and treat infected individuals. Officials are using contact tracing [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/tracing-ebola-contacts-can-stop-virus-in-its-tracks-experts-say.html], hazardous waste disposal [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/waste-from-ebola-poses-challenge-to-hospitals.html] and site decontamination [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/ebola-new-york-hazmat-workers.html] to prevent the virus from infecting anyone else. First, find out what these strategies are. Then advise whether you think a good enough job is being done and if you believe the nation is equipped to handle any future challenges.

6. What treatments have worked best? How close are we to finding a cure or vaccine?

Right now we’re trying to fight Ebola with proven infectious disease protocols — isolation, quarantines, contact tracing and decontamination — but there is hope that we can find a cure or a vaccine sooner rather than later to stop the current epidemic or at least prevent future ones.

For a quick overview on treatments and cures, consult these two sources:

* Are There Drugs to Treat or Prevent Ebola? [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html#drugs] (part of The Times Q. and A. on Ebola)

* Treating Ebola: The Hunt for a Drug [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/23/world/africa/ebola-drugs.html]

To learn more about the complex topic of research funding, read the article “Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf.” [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/health/without-lucrative-market-potential-ebola-vaccine-was-shelved-for-years.html] You may find it particularly helpful for understanding how we might prevent future outbreaks of Ebola or other infectious diseases around the world.

7. How well are we preventing panic and promoting confidence in the American health care system?

Unlike West Africa, which is confronting a full-scale epidemic, the United States has had a small number of cases diagnosed or treated here. On the other hand, the United States has had “a much larger outbreak of anxiety than we have of Ebola,”

CORRECTION APPENDEDA nurse who cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone was headed for a legal showdown with the State of Maine on Wednesday over whether the state can quarantine her against her will.

The dispute is heightening a national debate over how to balance public health and public fears against the rights and freedoms of health care workers, and troops, returning from West Africa.

''This is a tipping point in this whole process,'' the nurse, Kaci Hickox, said in an interview, one of several she did from her home in northern Maine on Wednesday, as state troopers and television trucks stood outside.

''So many states have started enacting these policies that I think are just completely not evidence-based. They don't do a good job of balancing the risks and benefits when thinking about taking away an individual's rights.''

But Maine's health commissioner, Mary Mayhew, said at a news conference late Wednesday that the state was seeking an immediate court order enforcing a 21-day quarantine of Ms. Hickox after she declared that she would leave her home if state officials did not lift the restrictions by Thursday morning.

''While we certainly respect the rights of one individual, we must be vigilant in protecting 1.3 million Mainers, as well as anyone who visits our great state,'' Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, said in a statement issued earlier in the day. In Maine and elsewhere, the fight over Ebola was poised to be one of the final defining moments of the midterm elections, with Mr. LePage in a close race for re-election, along with governors of both parties in other states that had imposed quarantines, including Connecticut, Georgia and Florida.

California also issued tough new rules on Wednesday.

Ms. Hickox's defiance put the focus for the next few days on one of the most remote reaches of the country, a home she shares with her boyfriend in the border town of Fort Kent. If she indeed leaves the home on Thursday and state officials subsequently detain her, she will have three days to seek a court order to challenge the quarantine.

Her lawyers, in New York, said they intended to fly to Maine to do so in that event.

Ms. Hickox, 33, returned last Friday from a month treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with the rescue group Doctors Without Borders, She was isolated in a tent at a New Jersey hospital after she registered a low-grade fever on a forehead scanner, though she had not previously registered a fever and has not since.

She has never shown symptoms of the virus and tested negative for it several hours after being quarantined; the virus is considered contagious only when a person displays symptoms. She was released Monday and allowed to travel to Maine after her lawyers threatened New Jersey officials with a legal challenge.

In the interview, Ms. Hickox said that the stigmatization of health workers had ''exploded'' across the country. She warned that quarantines would ultimately lead to families' being shuttered inside their homes and would deter aid workers from going to West Africa to treat Ebola at its origin.

''I understand how fear spreads,'' she added. ''But if I'm a nurse and I have a patient in the hospital, it's our responsibility as medical professionals to advocate for our patients. Now, it's the medical professionals who are being stigmatized. Even if there is popular public opinion, we still have to advocate for what's right.''

On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, ordered quarantines for all people entering the country through two area airports if they had had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. Since then, other states and the Pentagon have also issued rules that are stricter than guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel imposed mandatory 21-day quarantines on members of the armed services returning from the three Ebola-stricken West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- whether or not they had any symptoms of the virus, and despite the fact that they had no contact with Ebola patients, but had been building clinics.

Unlike even the toughest state bans, including in New York and New Jersey, the Pentagon restriction offered no provision for at-home quarantine; the service members will have to remain in isolated facilities on military bases and will not be allowed to see their families for the 21 days.

Those strictures were far tougher than the revised C.D.C. guidelines for returning travelers, announced Monday. Those guidelines require people who have been in contact with Ebola patients to submit to twice-daily contact with a local health official, one in-person and one by phone, for 21 days.

California, too, went further than the C.D.C. on Wednesday, announcing a mandatory 21-day quarantine for any travelers who had contact with an Ebola patient, whether or not the travelers showed symptoms. But the state said it would allow local health authorities to enforce the order on a ''case-by-case'' basis, with varying levels of restriction and monitoring.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas cited the agency's guidelines in announcing Wednesday that a nurse returning from Sierra Leone who showed no signs of the disease had agreed to a ''self-quarantine'' at home, which would include twice-daily monitoring by the state Department of Health.

Speaking at an event in the East Room of the White House where he met with medical professionals volunteering to treat Ebola patients, President Obama said Americans owed them gratitude and respect, noting that they had helped speed treatment and reduce the spread of the virus in West Africa. The White House has said that the new state quarantines are too rigid.

''If we are not dealing with this problem there, it will come here,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I know that, with all the headlines and all the news, that people are scared,'' Mr. Obama added. ''America has never been defined by fear.''

The fear runs deep; a CBS News poll released Wednesday taken last week showed 80 percent of Americans saying United States citizens and legal residents should be quarantined until it is certain they do not have Ebola, and just 17 percent saying they should be allowed to enter if they do not show symptoms. More than a quarter of those polled said foreign visitors from West Africa should not be allowed into the United States at all.

From colonial times, states and cities have had the power to quarantine individuals deemed to pose a threat to public health. But that power is subject to limits under the federal Constitution and many state ones, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and an expert on quarantine policies.

According to numerous federal and state court decisions, Mr. Gostin said, the state must show that it made ''an individualized assessment that a person poses a risk,'' and demonstrate to a court that the decision was based on a sound scientific evaluation.

When depriving a person of liberty, the state must use the least restrictive alternative to achieve public safety. Given that Ebola does not spread through casual contact and that infected individuals are not contagious unless they are symptomatic, it could be difficult to justify a complete quarantine over lesser measures such as the twice-daily monitoring now recommended by the federal agency.

Maine law allows the state to go to court to quarantine someone when needed ''to avoid a clear and immediate public health threat.''

Ms. Hickox said that she believed self-monitoring was the best policy, that she would not want to put anyone in harm's way and that if she had symptoms she would immediately go to state health officials for isolation and testing.

She accused states of ''making things up as they go.'' In Maine, she said, she was told that if she stayed with her family and developed symptoms, her entire family would be quarantined. Already, she said, her boyfriend, a nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent, had been asked to stay away from the college for two weeks.

Ms. Hickox also disputed the characterization of her four-day detainment in New Jersey by Mr. Christie, who on Tuesday told reporters she had been ''inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cellphone, access to the Internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark.''

She said she had been dressed in paper scrubs inside the tent, which was ''chilly,'' and was only warm enough after workers from Doctors Without Borders delivered warm clothing. She was given hospital food, except for one meal of Kentucky Fried Chicken, and had no shower and no Internet access until a friend brought her a computer and an Internet hot spot.

She tested negative for Ebola early Saturday morning, less than 12 hours after arriving at the hospital, she said, and never registered a fever after a forehead scan at the airport registered her at 101 degrees.

''The fact that they still held me Saturday and Sunday and the morning on Monday says a lot,'' she said. ''It says to me that no one had made a plan before they detained me.''

Correction: November 3, 2014, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a legal showdown over whether Maine could impose a quarantine on Kaci Hickox, a nurse who cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, misstated part of the name of the federal organization that established monitoring guidelines for the disease. It is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not the Centers for Disease Control and Protection.

Don’t Let Ebola Dehumanize Africa

A few days ago, I posted a note on Facebook about my scheduled concert next week at Carnegie Hall honoring the late South African singer Miriam Makeba, who was known widely as Mama Africa. I was saddened to see the following comments appear: “Instead of mama africa it should be mama ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]” and “I wonder if she is bringing aby Ebloa [sic] with her?”

Overnight it seems that all the naïve and evil preconceptions about Africa have surfaced again. Ebola has brought back the fears and fantasies of Africa as the Heart of Darkness and the fearmongering about the disease threatens to reverse decades of progress for Africa’s image.

I’ll always remember the night Mama Africa entered my life. I was about 9 years old and there was an old turntable standing in the corner of the dining room of our house in Benin.

I was browsing through my brother’s vinyl-record collection and discovered a Makeba album called “Pata Pata.” On the cover, Miriam’s shoulders were bare; she had a gentle but determined smile. I carefully dropped the needle and an irresistible groove literally jumped out at me. I couldn’t help dancing.

Ms. Makeba became my role model. Every night I dreamed that one day I would be like her, travel the world, meet powerful people and address the United Nations like she did in 1963, when she denounced the South African apartheid regime in front of the whole world.

That an African person — a woman — could accomplish all this and could stand up for her people even though her life had been defined by hardship was amazing to me. She was exiled twice: first from South Africa by the racist apartheid regime, and then from America while she was married to Stokely Carmichael, the Black Panther activist.

Ms. Makeba managed to transform, in the eyes of the world, the image of the African woman. She gave us a human face — a strong face that went beyond all the clichés carried by movies and TV shows. As I kept singing her songs throughout my career, I always felt that my mission was to keep her legacy alive — especially today.

Fifty years after the independence of most African states, and 20 years after Nelson Mandela came to power in South Africa, the image of the continent is once more under siege because of Ebola.

But what is the true root of the Ebola crisis? It’s nothing evil or dark, but rather the precariousness of the health care infrastructure of some West African countries.

When you don’t have enough doctors, nurses or hospital beds, a disease isn’t easy to stop. Instead of panicking about the spread of the disease in the New York subway system, we should worry about how quickly families in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone can receive the basic equipment that will allow them to care for their sick relatives in a dignified way, without risking their lives. That is what will ultimately halt the spread of Ebola.

Meanwhile, in the West, rumors and fear are spreading like fire. When I jumped into a taxi in New York recently the driver asked me where I came from. When I said: “I’m West African,” he just muttered one word: “Ebola.” The situation here has only gotten worse with the news that a young American doctor returning from Guinea has contracted the disease and had traveled around the city while he was potentially contagious.

Meanwhile, for the approximately 10,000 Liberians and other West Africans who live in the borough of Staten Island, life is becoming a nightmare. Last week, the media reported that many Liberians on the island are starting to change their daily habits to fight the stigma of Ebola. They are seeking to avoid any physical contact — even casual handshakes with neighbors. Many say they are being ostracized by friends when they come back from Africa. On Twitter, the hashtag #IAmALiberianNotAVirus testifies to many of those sad situations.

And the fear and misconceptions aren’t limited to New York. A few weeks ago, I was giving a lecture at an elementary school in Florida. The students were asking me many relevant and funny questions. Among them a young child asked me: “Are all the African kids skinny? Can you always see their ribs?”

I told him that not every African child was like that, and smiled. But inside I wanted to cry. I realized that 30 years after the legendary song “We Are the World” was recorded to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia little has changed in the way Africa is perceived.

Yes, some parts of Africa are still underdeveloped socially and economically, and that must change. But Africa is much more than emaciated children and poverty. Africa is first and foremost a continent of culture, beauty, art and, of course, music.

Much of the music we are listening to today has its roots in Africa. Even Bach was inspired by the dances of slaves when he composed his “sarabandes.” Newspapers and textbooks carry a responsibility to show a more balanced image of the continent and its rich history.

When I sing in tribute to Miriam Makeba at Carnegie Hall next week it is because Africa, our motherland, deserves better than to be dehumanized by our ignorance and our fear.

Angélique Kidjo is a singer and songwriter from Benin, a Unicef good-will ambassador, and the author of “Spirit Rising: My Life, My Music.”

Health
Genes Influence Ebola Infections in Mice, Study Suggests

Some people exposed to the Ebola virus quickly sicken and die. Others become gravely ill but recover, while still others only react mildly or are thought to be resistant to the virus. Now researchers working with mice have found that these laboratory animals, too, can have a range of responses to Ebola, and that in mice, the responses are determined by differences in genes.

This is the first time scientists have been able to breed mice that developed Ebola infections resembling those in humans complete with some puzzling features seen in people.

About two-thirds of people who die from Ebola never develop the terrifying hemorrhages that appear in others a day or two before death, in which eyes turn fiery red, gums bleed, red dots emerge on the skin as blood seeps out of capillaries, and blood appears in vomit and diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Many mice, too, die of Ebola without hemorrhages.

The mouse studies indicate the animals that hemorrhage and — by implication, humans— die because their immune systems overreact to the virus. The result is an inflammatory response[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immune-response/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that makes cells leak fluids and white blood cells, and makes tissues and organs deteriorate. Many die at that point. In those mice — or humans — that survive long enough, the researchers propose, blood eventually starts to seep out of vessels.

Although the investigators have not yet pinned down the exact genetic reasons why mice vary so much in their responses to the Ebola virus, they have identified two genes that seem to be crucial in determining if a mouse will die or whether the infected mouse will even become ill.

The study[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1259595], published online Thursday by the journal Science, is “a significant advance,” said Dr. James Musser, director of the Center for Molecular and Translational Human Infectious Diseases Research at Houston Methodist Research Institute. Using mice in experiments, he said, can change the nature of Ebola research. Until now, investigators have mostly used macaques, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters because the mouse strain they usually study does not get an Ebola infection that mimics how human patients react.

“This provides a tremendous opportunity to drive toward answers to questions that heretofore were intractable,” Dr. Musser said, mentioning in particular the question of how much genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] determines susceptibility or resistance to Ebola. He added that the mice could be invaluable in initial tests of vaccines and potential drugs.

Dr. Matthew Waldor, an infectious disease researcher at Brigham and Woman’s Hospital who also was not involved with the study, had the same opinion, calling it “a cool study.”

The work, by Angela L. Rasmussen and Michael G. Katze of the University of Washington and their colleagues, began three years ago, long before the current Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html]. They were inspired by their studies with the 1918 influenza[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus that caused a worldwide lethal pandemic.

Using a variety of mouse strains, they found that genetics determined whether a mouse got sick or died from the flu, or never got sick at all. People, too, seem to have different responses to the same influenza virus. Dr. Katze, who has studied Ebola for the past decade, and Dr. Rasmussen, who chose to study infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] because when she was in college she read “The Hot Zone,” a book that told a terrifying tale of Ebola in Africa, wanted to find out if genes determine responses to Ebola.

So little was – and is – known about the disease, Dr. Katze said. “All we know is that not everyone gets hemorrhagic fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], not everyone gets sick,” he said. “There are a million articles about Ebola but very little scientific literature on the virus,” he added, explaining that most of what has been published is opinion pieces, epidemiology, and clinical observations.

He and Dr. Rasmussen decided to study Ebola not just in the one standard mouse strain that had proved so unsuitable for research on the disease but in 47 different genetic varieties. The mice were developed by a consortium of researchers that bred laboratory mice to resemble the genetic diversity found naturally in mice.

But studying Ebola was not easy. The infected mice had to be observed and autopsied in a secure biocontainment lab run by the federal government in Hamilton, Mont.

The first question that intrigued Dr. Rasmussen was, Why do some mice, and humans, die from Ebola?

The mouse studies showed that animals that died after bleeding had an overblown inflammatory response to the virus. They also had low activity of two genes, Tie1 and Tek, that made their blood vessels more permeable. The leaky vessels allowed white blood cells to stream out, escalating the inflammatory response and causing a chain reaction of damaging immune system chemicals that destroyed organs. The same sort of thing happened in mice that died from the flu, although those genes, Tie1 and Tek, did not appear to be involved in the influenza deaths, Dr. Rasmussen said.

She said that “a big take-home lesson from the paper” is that genetics plays a major role in determining the outcome of a mouse’s Ebola infection. By inference, she said, genetics probably plays the same role in humans.

But many questions remain and, even with mice, the work is slow and difficult. There are only about a half a dozen labs in the United States equipped to safely study Ebola, and work in those labs is tedious with researchers dressed in moon suits. It takes years of training to even be prepared to work in one of the labs, Dr. Katze said.

The scientists want to further investigate genes that determine susceptibility in mice and hope to examine tissue from Ebola patients to see if they have analogous genetic variants. But that is difficult, Dr. Katze said. Many labs want tissue samples and, with patients in West Africa, it can be difficult to get an accurate description of the course of the disease. Then there is the question of how to transport the tissue to the United States. “Nobody will let you put it in a can and take it on a plane with you,” Dr. Rasmussen said.

There are now Ebola patients in the United States but because of privacy issues, Dr. Rasmussen said, “the status of tissue or blood samples from those patients is unclear."

For now, said Dr. Katze, the field is somewhat chaotic. “We don’t know what the genes are in humans,” he said, " but when we find out what the genes are in mice, then we have a clue.”

Deadly Fungal Disease Threatening Salamanders May Spread Through Pet Trade
By JAMES GORMAN

An emerging infection similar to one that has caused the extinction of hundreds of frog and toad species around the world is now killing salamanders in Europe and could easily spread to the United States, with disastrous effects, scientists reported Thursday.

Writing in the journal Science[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1258268], an international team of 27 researchers blamed the spread of the disease on “globalization and a lack of biosecurity” and said the importation of the fire-bellied newt in the pet trade with Asia was the likely cause.

The lead researcher, An Martel[https://biblio.ugent.be/person/801001432728] of Ghent University in Belgium, said in an interview that both Europe and the United States needed to start screening amphibians in the pet trade. “When animals are traded they should be screened,” Dr. Martel said. “It should involve the world.”

Other scientists agreed. “We need to pay attention to this paper,” said Vance T. Vredenburg[http://biology.sfsu.edu/people/vance-vredenburg] of San Francisco State University, one of the scientists who has sounded the alarm about the extinction of hundreds of frog and toad species worldwide over the last four decades.

“We need to think about biosecurity not just in terms of humans and food that we eat and crops that we grow,” he said. “We need to think about functioning ecosystems.”

Dr. Vredenburg is a co-author of a 2008 paper[http://www.pnas.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/105/Supplement_1/11466.full] that described the disappearance of frog species as a prime example of what some scientists call the sixth extinction, a mass death of species going on now and caused by humans.

In the case of the frog disappearances, the culprit, a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, was not identified until decades after the extinctions had begun. Where it originated is still not known.

The effects of that fungus, Dr. Vredenburg said, represent “the worst case in recorded history of a single pathogen affecting vertebrates,” causing an “extinction rate 40,000 times higher than in the last 350 million years for amphibians.”

The fungus killing salamanders and newts, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, is in the same genus, and also kills animals by infecting the skin. But this time, said Dr. Vredenburg, “We found it early enough to have a chance. The Titanic knows there’s an iceberg out there.”

The United States, as yet untouched by the infection, has the greatest biodiversity of salamanders in the world, and many of the species are already threatened or endangered. The animals are seldom noticed, but are an integral part of forest and aquatic ecosystems, as predators and prey.

One recent study suggested that their decline could affect climate change[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/08/science/salamanders-hefty-role-in-the-forest.html?_r=0] because the proliferation of some of the creatures they eat could cause greater release of carbon into the atmosphere.

Dr. Martel and other scientists first identified the fungus[http://www.pnas.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/110/38/15325.full.pdf] a year ago, and described its role in the deaths of fire salamanders in Europe. In the new paper, they investigated its origin, presence around the world and the susceptibility of different species to it.

In the lab, the researchers experimentally infected 44 species of salamanders and newts (salamanders live on land, newts in the water). Forty-one, they wrote, “rapidly died.” It did not affect frogs and toads.

Several Asian species were resistant, and molecular biology studies of DNA suggested that there may be a reservoir of the fungus in Asian newts popular in the aquarium trade.

The study found evidence of the fungus in amphibians in Vietnam, Thailand and Japan, where the animals were not affected, and in the Netherlands and Belgium, where it killed numerous populations. Dr. Martel identified the shipping of live newts for the aquarium trade as the way the fungus spread.

James Collins[http://www.collinslab.asu.edu/cv.html], at Arizona State University, who has studied the spread of fungal disease in frogs, said that further study was needed to prove that the pet trade was the culprit in the disease’s spread, since it was possible that the fungus was wind-borne, or spread by migrating birds.

But, Dr. Collins said, it was clear that the fungus and the lack of screening in the shipping of live animals posed a major threat to salamanders in the United States and Europe. Disease screening exists for threats to agriculture, he said, but not for animals in the pet or aquarium trade.

“When something like Ebola emerges,” he said, international and federal agencies like the World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can act. “Something like that is needed,” he said.

Karen R. Lips[http://biology.umd.edu/faculty/karenrlips] at the University of Maryland, one of the co-authors of the Science paper, met Thursday with Fish and Wildlife Officials to talk about the new fungus. She said that there were now bills in Congress[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr996/text] that could enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to screen for infected wildlife.

“If Congress wanted to, they could take action,” she said.

Influenza, a Familiar Virus, Requires Attention, Too

It’s not surprising that Americans have been focused on the recent Ebola scare, given that it’s a potentially lethal virus newly arrived here in the United States. But there’s another, more familiar germ that Americans should worry about: the influenza virus.

Flu season is here. Typically, seasonal flu viruses begin circulating in October and can linger as late as May, but cases generally peak between December and February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An average of 200,000 people are hospitalized each year because of the flu, the agency estimates.

The agency recommends flu vaccinations for everyone 6 months old or older, with a few exceptions. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to take effect, so it is best to get vaccinated early. While getting vaccinated doesn’t guarantee you won’t get sick, the agency says you are 60 percent less likely to need medical treatment for the flu if you get the vaccine. Still, fewer than half of American adults did so during the last flu season.

There is now one fewer hurdle to getting the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine is covered as a preventive treatment under the Affordable Care Act. That means most insurance plans allow you to receive it without charge.

Large retail pharmacies generally offer flu shots on a walk-in basis and many accept insurance. Last year, 90 percent of flu shots provided at CVS pharmacies or the chain’s Minute Clinic locations were covered by third-party insurance, said a CVS spokesman, Mike DeAngelis. Walgreens reports a similar statistic.

If you lack health coverage, you will pay about $15 to $32 for the standard flu shot at retail chains. You will typically pay a bit more for the inhaled nasal version of the vaccine.

The traditional flu vaccine is “trivalent,” meaning it’s formulated to protect against three strains of the virus. Now there is a “quadrivalent” vaccine, which protects against four strains. The C.D.C. doesn’t recommend one version over the other and advises that if the quadrivalent version isn’t available, you should get the trivalent, rather than opting to wait.

You might want to check with your health plan to make sure the newer quadrivalent vaccine is fully covered, although at least one big health insurer, WellPoint, said members were covered for either version.

The C.D.C. said early in October that some big manufacturers had delayed shipments of flu vaccine because of production problems, but that it still expected an adequate supply of vaccine for this flu season. The agency didn’t immediately respond to a request for an update on vaccine supplies.

If you don’t have time to get to your doctor or to a clinic, many large employers make it convenient — and cheap — for employees to get vaccinated at work. The Society for Human Resource Management says 58 percent of employers offer on-site seasonal flu vaccinations, often at no charge.

Here are some questions about flu vaccine:

■ Will my insurance cover the inhaled flu vaccine, or just the shot?

It’s possible that coverage of the vaccine may vary depending on the mode of delivery. “It’s hard to make a blanket statement” about coverage, said Alina Salganicoff, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So, it is best to check with your health plan.

■ Are free flu shots available if I don’t have health insurance?

Many county health departments offer free flu vaccine clinics, so you should check your local government listings. To locate flu shot clinics generally, you can use the C.D.C.'s vaccine finder tool[http://www.flu.gov/prevention-vaccination/vaccination/].

■Will Medicare cover flu shots?

Yes, Medicare, the federal health plan for those 65 and older, covers the flu vaccine without a co-payment. Older people can ask for a special high-dose flu vaccine for those over 65, who tend to have weaker immune systems. The high-dose version has four times as much antigen — the component that starts up the immune system — as the standard flu shot. Again, however, if the high-dose version isn’t available, the C.D.C. advises getting the traditional version.

A Final Rush, for Everyone but Perry

AUSTIN — As Election Day looms, Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick, the Republican candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, are touring together — a new thing for them. The Democrats they face, Wendy Davis and Leticia Van de Putte, have been together off and on from the start.

Joint appearances with other candidates offer a peek at who the contestants think will add to and subtract from their campaigns. Watch who they run to, who they run from and who they just ignore. The teams at the top of the two major-party tickets have decided appearing together is an additive. Celebrities work, too: Mr. Abbott made a couple of appearances this week with the actor Chuck Norris, a conservative star, and the actress Eva Longoria spoke at the start of Ms. Van de Putte’s statewide bus tour a few days ago.

The top elected Republican in the state, Gov. Rick Perry, has been virtually invisible. Instead, he is operating in another political zone, audaciously urging a National Guard deployment on the Texas-Mexico border, publicly trying to deal with the Ebola scare in Texas and making foreign policy speeches in London and California intended to unveil a prospective presidential candidate’s views on America’s place in the world.

Spin it Mr. Perry’s way — that the state races are behind him now that his sights are set on national office. Or spin it the way the candidates might think — that a fresh start for a new government would be stained by the legacy of a governor who has been in office 14 years.

Mr. Perry’s record is at the center of many Democratic campaigns, where candidates are reminding voters of education cuts and holes in the state’s health and welfare safety nets. And it is evident in some Republican campaigns, too, where candidates have raised questions about “crony capitalism” and irregularities with economic incentive funds run by the governor’s office.

He is the man without a face this year. President Obama’s face, however, is everywhere.

Democrats all over the country have spent the better part of the year avoiding the president. His popularity is at a low point, and Democrats remember the drubbing they got in the president’s first midterm election in 2010. That was the rise of the Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and an anti-Washington dust storm so thick it even took out some popular Republicans, like United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who lost that year’s primary for governor to Mr. Perry.

When the president visited Texas to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the federal Civil Rights Act, Ms. Davis met with him, but not publicly. The Davis campaign did not want to provide the Republicans with usable evidence that he and she were confederates.

In the first debate between Mr. Abbott and Ms. Davis, the strained association was evident; given a chance to ask Davis a question, Mr. Abbott asked if she regretted voting for Mr. Obama for president.

She balked. “Mr. Abbott, what I am working on right now is running for governor of this incredible state and bringing polices forward that benefit this state,” Ms. Davis said.

In an interview the next day, she rebooted. “There are things our president has done I agree wholeheartedly with,” she said at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. “There are things I disagree with too. In my area of the state, both President Obama and Greg Abbott tried to intervene and stop the merger between US Airways and American Airlines. Do you understand what that would have done for the economy of the state? Neither of them showed an understanding of the economic engine that is American Airlines.”

A month later, running behind in the polls with a few days left in her campaign, Ms. Davis might be the only prominent Democrat in the country saying she would welcome a political visit from the president. Maybe it would excite Democratic voters to her advantage. Running away was no help: Even without a photograph of the two, Mr. Abbott ran a commercial that concluded a vote for her would be a vote for “Governor Obama.”

Funny: The state’s actual governor was barely mentioned.

In New York, Protections Offered for Medical Workers Joining Ebola Fight

New York officials announced on Thursday that they would offer employee protection and financial guarantees for health care workers joining the fight against the Ebola outbreak in three West African nations.

The announcement was an effort to alleviate concerns that the state’s mandatory quarantine policy could deter desperately needed workers from traveling overseas.

Under the new protections, modeled after the rights granted military reservists, workers could not suffer any pay cuts or demotions for serving in Africa, and the state would make up any lost income if they had to be quarantined when they returned.

“In particular, the State of New York and the City of New York will work to ensure that health care workers who selflessly travel to West Africa to treat Ebola patients would have their pay, health care and employment statuses continue seamlessly when they get back,” said a statement from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] and Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing the initiative.

Governor Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] announced the quarantine policy last Friday, one day after a doctor who had worked in Guinea treating Ebola patients became the first person in New York City to receive an Ebola diagnosis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html]

Under that policy, any person returning from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone, where the epidemic has hit hardest, is to be quarantined, at home when possible, if he had direct contact with an Ebola patient.

The quarantine is to last 21 days from the person’s last exposure to Ebola.

Several states have announced similar policies, including New Jersey, where a nurse, Kaci Hickox, was quarantined for three days in a tent at University Hospital after landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, and in Maine, where she lives.

Ms. Hickox is challenging that state’s attempts to limit her movements.

Federal officials and public health experts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html] have criticized the quarantines, saying that they are not necessary because a patient is not contagious until Ebola symptoms arise, and that quarantines will discourage doctors and nurses from working in West Africa.

Mr. Cuomo has since sought to portray his quarantine order as a necessity, but one that does not need to cause undue burden.

“The state would also provide necessary reimbursements, to health care workers and their employers, for any quarantines that are needed upon their return, to help protect public health and safety in New York,” the statement Thursday said.

Also on Thursday, the World Bank announced an additional $100 million to speed deployment of foreign health workers to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, had pledged $100 million this month to help increase the flow of foreign health workers, with much of the money going toward medical evacuation services in case workers are infected. Lack of evacuation financing had been a major obstacle to getting more workers to sign up.

The New York City patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, had worked for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. He returned home this month and fell ill on Oct. 23. He is currently being treated in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was in serious but stable condition.

Three people who had direct contact with Dr. Spencer before his hospitalization, including his fiancée, are in quarantine. They all remain symptom free, officials said.

A family member of Morgan Dixon, Dr. Spencer’s fiancée, said Thursday evening that Dr. Spencer was communicating with Ms. Dixon and said he would be fine.

“Both seem to be doing very well,” said the family member, who, to protect the family’s privacy, did not want to be named. “We look forward to the day we can all be together again.”

Another 114 people — the vast majority are travelers arriving in the city from West Africa in the past three weeks — are being actively monitored by health workers, but are not being quarantined or having their movements restricted, officials said.

That list includes Bellevue Hospital staff members taking care of Dr. Spencer, the emergency medical workers who transported him to Bellevue and the lab workers who conducted his blood test.

Those being monitored are in regular communication with health workers who check in with them daily, rather than relying on them to self-monitor.

The system seeks to ensure that any individual who becomes ill can be isolated and evaluated before infecting anyone else.

“We must also do more to encourage additional health care professionals to join this critical fight,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. “The partnership unveiled today will be instrumental in growing the ranks of these valiant doctors and nurses.”

While some employers allow doctors and nurses to work for a period of time in Africa by taking a paid sabbatical or using vacation time, the new policy would ensure that anyone who wanted to go help would not have to worry about being penalized after returning.

It was not immediately clear whether the policy would be made official through state regulation or law.

Hospital officials generally expressed support for the idea. Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, “I believe it will be an easy sell.”

Why Republicans Keep Telling Everyone They’re Not Scientists

WASHINGTON — Gov. Rick Scott[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/richard_l_scott/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] of Florida, a Republican who is fighting a Democratic challenge from former Gov. Charlie Crist[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/charlie_crist/index.html?inline=nyt-per], was asked by The Miami Herald if he believes climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is significantly affecting the weather. “Well, I’m not a scientist,” he said.

Senator Mitch McConnell[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mitch_mcconnell/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] of Kentucky, who is locked in the tightest re-election race of his career, was asked earlier this month by The Cincinnati Enquirer if he believes that climate change is a problem[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/science/earth/climate-change-report.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}]. “I’m not a scientist,” he said.

House Speaker John A. Boehner[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_a_boehner/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}], when asked by reporters if climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] will play a role in the Republican agenda, came up with a now-familiar formulation. “I’m not qualified to debate the science over climate change,” he said.

“I’m not a scientist,” or a close variation, has become the go-to talking point for Republicans questioned about climate change in the 2014 campaigns. In the past, many Republican candidates questioned or denied the science of climate change, but polls show that a majority of Americans accept it — and support government policies to mitigate it — making the Republican position increasingly challenging ahead of the 2016 presidential elections.

“It’s got to be the dumbest answer I’ve ever heard,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has advised House Republicans and conservative political advocacy groups on energy and climate change messaging. “Using that logic would disqualify politicians from voting on anything. Most politicians aren’t scientists, but they vote on science policy. They have opinions on Ebola, but they’re not epidemiologists. They shape highway and infrastructure laws, but they’re not engineers.”

Jon A. Krosnick, who conducts polls on public attitudes on climate change at Stanford, finds the phrase perplexing. “What’s odd about this ‘I’m not a scientist’ line is that there’s nothing in the data we’ve seen to suggest that this helps a candidate,” Mr. Krosnick said. “We can’t find a single state where the majority of voters are skeptical. To say, ‘I’m not a scientist’ is like saying, ‘I’m not a parakeet.’ Everyone knows that it just means, ‘I’m not going to talk about this.’ ”

But Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that while debate moderators and editorial boards may continue to press the climate change question, the issue does not resonate with voters. He pointed to a Pew Research Center poll showing that Americans rank climate change near the bottom of policy concerns.

“It is very difficult to find an issue that voters place lower on the list than climate change,” Mr. Ayres said. “It vies with gay marriage and campaign finance reform as the least important issue. Most voters care about jobs, economic growth, health care and immigration.”

For now, “I’m not a scientist” is what one party adviser calls “a temporary Band-Aid” — a way to avoid being called a climate change denier but also to sidestep a dilemma. The reality of campaigning is that a politician who acknowledges that burning coal and oil contributes to global warming must offer a solution, which most policy experts say should be taxing or regulating carbon pollution and increasing government spending on alternative energy. But those ideas are anathema to influential conservative donors like the billionaire brothers Charles[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/charles_g_koch/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] and David Koch[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/david_h_koch/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] and the advocacy group they support, Americans for Prosperity.

Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said his group intends to aggressively work against Republicans who support a carbon tax or regulations in the 2016 presidential primary campaigns. “They would be at a severe disadvantage in the Republican nomination process,” Mr. Phillips said. “We would absolutely make that a crucial issue.”

In the meantime, climate change has come up this year in at least 10 debates in Senate and governor’s races — including Florida, New Hampshire, Colorado, Iowa and Kentucky — forcing Republicans to respond to a growing number of questions about the issue. In 2012, President Obama and Mitt Romney never once mentioned climate change in their three debates.

All the Republican presidential candidates that year but one — Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah — questioned or denied human-caused climate change. Republican strategists at the time saw that position as essential to winning support from the conservative base and inconsequential in influencing swing voters in the general election.

Since then polls show[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/upshot/is-global-warming-real-most-in-US-believe-in-climate-change.html] that the political landscape has changed. A 2013 survey by USA Today and Stanford University found that 71 percent of Americans say they are already seeing the results of climate change, and 55 percent support limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Jon Krosnick, a professor at Stanford University, analyzed polls in 46 states conducted between 2006 and 2013 and found that in every state surveyed, at least 75 percent of the population acknowledged the existence of climate change, and at least 67 percent said the government should limit greenhouse gas emissions.

One result is that a cadre of Republican staffers and advisers, most under the age of 40, have started pushing their bosses to find a way to address the issue.

“The general dialogue has been, ‘We have to do something about this,’ ” said one Republican adviser who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly. “We have to be less head-in-the-sand and acknowledge we are losing public opinion on this issue.”

While the politicians debate, the scientific evidence linking weather extremes to climate change continues to mount. Earlier this year, the National Climate Assessment[http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/], a study by 13 federal agencies, detailed the ways in which climate change caused by burning coal and oil is threatening the American landscape[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/opinion/climate-disruptions-close-to-home.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}], from rising sea levels in Florida to more wildfires in Colorado to more devastating droughts across the southwest. Major corporations, including longtime Republican donors like ExxonMobil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/exxon_mobil_corporation/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}], Walmart[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/wal_mart_stores_inc/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] and Coca-Cola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/coca_cola_company/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}], have acknowledged the science of human-caused climate change and are planning for future taxes[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/business/energy-environment/large-companies-prepared-to-pay-price-on-carbon.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22}] or regulations on carbon pollution.

For Mr. McKenna, the energy lobbyist and Republican adviser, the political future is clear. “We’re going to keep getting this question until we nail down a hard answer,” he said.

Gov. Rick Scott, like many in his party, sidesteps climate change by saying he is not a scientist. | Charles Ommanney for The New York Times

In New England, Obama Rallies Base on Economic Growth

PORTLAND, Me. — President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] declared himself “wistful” on Thursday as his time on the national campaign stage draws to a close. He defended his economic record as he sought to energize Democrats ahead of midterm elections in which his party’s control of the Senate is at stake.

“This country has made real progress since the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes,” Mr. Obama said at a campaign rally for Representative Michael H. Michaud, who is in a tight race for governor with the Republican incumbent, Paul R. LePage. Republicans, the president said, “just keep on offering the same tired theories of the economy that we know haven’t worked. In fact, they’ve undermined the middle class.”

In a brief New England swing through solidly Democratic territory, Mr. Obama was seeking to rally core supporters and dramatize the stakes on Election Day. He pointed to a new government report showing that the economy grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter as evidence that his policies have worked.

It is a theme he will highlight on Friday in a speech in Providence, R.I., as he labors to shift the public focus from his administration’s handling of the Ebola crisis to pocketbook issues that his advisers said play to Democrats’ advantage.

But world events were frustrating Mr. Obama’s plans, just as they have for the past several months, and threatening to drown out his closing arguments in the campaign.

As Air Force One[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/presidents_and_presidency_us/air_force_one/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] touched down amid the autumn foliage here, an increasingly politicized feud raged over the plight of Kaci Hickox, a nurse who has returned to her home[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/kaci-hickox-nurse-under-ebola-quarantine-threatens-lawsuit.html] in Fort Kent, Me., after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and is protesting a state-imposed 21-day quarantine.

Mr. LePage said on Thursday that he was at an impasse with Ms. Hickox and would “exercise the full extent of his authority” to enforce the quarantine. Mr. Obama has made it clear he does not believe health workers exposed to Ebola should be barred from going out in public, and on Wednesday called them “heroes” who should be treated with “dignity.”

But he tried to steer clear of the controversy on Thursday. The president did not meet with Ms. Hickox and said quarantine policies are a matter that should be left to states.

“The president believes that the state can and should be responsible for setting this policy,” Mr. Earnest told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama as he made his way to Maine, adding that the policy should be guided by science.

Mr. Obama’s visit to Portland, where he also attended a closed-door fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee, is part of a final, five-state campaign swing the president is making through politically friendly areas.

The itinerary keeps him far from the main battlegrounds of this year’s elections as Democrats fight to keep Senate seats in competitive states Mr. Obama carried — like Iowa, North Carolina and Colorado — and in Republican-leaning places he lost, including Alaska and Louisiana.

While Rhode Island is home to a close governor’s race — a new Brown University poll[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/30/?entry=4014] found Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, preferred by 38 percent of likely voters, and Allan Fung, a Republican, backed by 37 percent — Mr. Obama has no campaign events planned after his economic speech there on Friday.

“I’m not on the ballot this time, and this is the last election cycle in which I’m involved as president,” he told the audience in Portland. “It makes me a little wistful, because I do like campaigning — it’s fun.”

Liberia’s Ebola Crisis Puts President in Harsh Light

MONROVIA, Liberia — The president waited until her family members were seated around the dining table before announcing, with no fanfare, the latest defection from her cabinet.

“I lost my justice minister today,” she said, picking up a spoon before heading out to visit Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] treatment units.

As the table erupted with questions, the president, having said all that she intended to, finished up her lunch of Libby’s tinned corned beef and rice — the Liberian equivalent of ramen noodles — and rose.

“We’re late,” she announced, not mentioning that everyone had been waiting for her for four hours. “Let’s go, let’s go.”

For the last eight years, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per], 76, has walked a precarious political tightrope. As Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s first elected leader after a devastating civil war, she has juggled enemies and allies while pushing this country on its first sustained course of economic growth in decades.

Now, Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] has brought many of those gains to a screeching halt. The foreign investors so lovingly wooed by Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, a former World Bank bureaucrat, have fled. Today, ordinary Liberians on the street fling around the obscure phrase “force majeure” to describe why businesses have closed, employers have left and road construction has ended.

Public schools, in a country where less than 50 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled, have been shut for months. The World Bank warns that Ebola could slash Liberia’s fragile economy by nearly 12 percent. All but two foreign airlines, which Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf had proudly welcomed back to the country after two decades of isolation, stopped flying here.

“Right now, all the international attention is on Ebola,” she said of critics, including at the United Nations, who say she has been more worried about the economy than a health catastrophe. “If we don’t focus on our economy, we will not be able to sustain it when they are gone.”

Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf is the first woman elected president of an African country[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/international/africa/12liberia.html], a Nobel Peace Prize winner[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/nobel-peace-prize-johnson-sirleaf-gbowee-karman.html] and arguably the most recognized leader on the continent. Rising from a junior bureaucrat, she became one of the few top Liberian officials not executed by firing squad during the 1980 military coup. From a jailed dissident in the 1980s, she became one of Newsweek’s 10 top leaders in the world.

But Ebola is threatening to derail that legacy. The epidemic has exposed crippling weaknesses in the public health system, decrepit infrastructure that has still not been dealt with more than a decade after the war, and endemic corruption that, despite Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s protestations of “zero tolerance,” continue to characterize the interactions between Liberians and their government.

“The international community has arrived and is now seeing our backyard for the first time,” said Francis Dunbar, a former deputy finance minister who now supports Benoni Urey, a Johnson Sirleaf rival who was once a close adviser of Charles Taylor, the former president convicted of crimes against humanity. “The front yard is clean but the backyard is dirty.”

Karin Landgren, the United Nations secretary general’s special representative here, echoed a similar theme. “Ebola has shown a very harsh light on the many things that had not been done adequately. Very tangible things, like the health care system.”

With the global spotlight on Liberia, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s many domestic critics have found an international audience. Last month, the asthmatic daughter of Representative Edward Forh, a legislator, died after nurses refused to admit her until Ebola tests were run. Distraught, Mr. Forh took to the airwaves to denounce Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s government, saying that the president was “surrounded by two groups of people: one group completely ignorant and the other group completely deceitful.”

But just last year, Mr. Forh’s colleagues in the Liberian Legislature voted to arrest one of the president’s allies for releasing a recording in which Mr. Forh suggested that public funds should be given to him in a kickback scheme.

“You eat some, I eat some,” Mr. Forh was recorded saying, meaning kickbacks and bribes.

The epidemic has inflamed such longstanding fights. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf says the criticism does not take into account how hard Liberia’s culture of corruption is to overcome, and how widespread the postwar problems she inherited were.

When she took office in 2006, unemployment was so high no one bothered to calculate it. There was no running water and no electricity, as gunmen had bombed the country’s hydro plant. Downtown Monrovia at night looked medieval: candles in shopfronts cast their dim glow on the ribbons of dirty water running down the gutters.

Children routinely died of curable diseases like tuberculosis, malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and measles[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Even among the unafflicted, few went to schools, and those who did had no textbooks. Liberia was $4.7 billion in debt, no longer considered creditworthy.

By just about every economic indicator, the country has come a long way since. Growth shot up to 8.9 percent in 2013, from 5.3 percent in 2006. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf prodded international lenders to forgive Liberia’s debt. Monrovia now has electricity, although many cannot afford it, while running water has been making a slow return around the country.

“Look, I know that I’m a soft target for criticism right now,” the president said. Her S.U.V. hit a pothole so deep she had to reach out to grab the armrest. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf glanced out the window, at an enormous pile of trash in front of a long-shuttered paint factory. Muttering “trash like you wouldn’t believe,” she instructed her security detail to call the property’s owner to clean up.

“People have forgotten the environment in which we used to live, because things now have become so free,” she said. “What moves a lot of the perceptions out there is our free talk on the radio, and in the press.”

In the past, critics of the government were often jailed or even executed. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf was jailed after calling members of the military government of President Samuel K. Doe “idiots.”

Today, the radio in Liberia buzzes with critics denouncing Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf for nepotism (she appointed her son to run the national oil company), corruption (she has dismissed a string of officials in her government for corruption but has not prosecuted them) and, most recently, for supposedly manufacturing the Ebola epidemic as a ruse to get foreign aid money.

Many Liberians, including some critics of Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, say that Liberia has no political leader more capable of steering the country out of its latest crisis, especially given her international reputation. When she sat down on the night of Sept. 9 and wrote a letter to President Obama pleading for help, the response came days later and dwarfed anything that neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea have been able to muster: 4,000 American troops, to build 18 Ebola treatment units in Liberia.

Now, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf is trying to leverage Ebola help for broader economic projects — like fixing the runway at the airport.

“The support that’s coming must not all go into Ebola,” Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf said.

On a muddy highway, her motorcade came to a small market along the road, with women selling fruits and vegetables.

“Aye, man, I need to buy those women them bananas,” Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf said. “Buy those women’s red potatoes and bananas. And some of those guavas them.” The motorcade stopped, and from one of the cars, an aide jumped out with a wad of cash and cleaned out the market.

The weeks since Ebola hit have been dotted by crisis after crisis, some big, many minuscule. Two days before, Justice Minister Christiana Tah had sat unspeaking at a meeting with international donors. Everyone argued around a massive table at the foreign ministry, with Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf at the head, looking like a stern teacher trying to rein in a bunch of unruly children.

Her health minister harrumphed about international “free agents” doing as they pleased without so much as a by-your-leave from the Liberian government. The American ambassador shot back that there were plenty of mechanisms to keep aid groups in their proper place.

And the minister of defense, Brownie Samukai, was heckled for 15 minutes by a Liberian women’s empowerment leader to pass one of the platters of Spam and cheese offered as snacks. He ignored her, trying to pay attention to the meeting, but his heckler raised her voice louder.

“I say, Brownie, you will not pass people de food?” the advocate demanded. “This how you treat women?”

Finally, an exasperated Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf called a timeout. “Very well,” she said. “Y’all can take a break to have some chips.”

On the drive to visit Ebola treatment units, she recalled that moment with a shake of her head.

“We’re accustomed to the president being at the pivot of everything, making every decision, because we’ve been used to an imperial presidency,” she said. “And even if I’m not so inclined, they almost make you make every decision.”

Just hours before, the justice minister, Ms. Tah, used her resignation news conference to accuse Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf of trying to block a corruption investigation into Liberia’s National Security Agency, which is headed by another of the president’s sons. Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf denied the charge; it was the same son, Fumbah Sirleaf, who helped American agents[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/world/02liberian.html] pull off West Africa’s largest drug bust in 2010.

Ms. Tah’s resignation came on the heels of Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s firing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html] of officials who had abandoned the country during the Ebola outbreak.

And now Mr. Forh was on the radio again, saying her government should take responsibility for his daughter’s death.

Her S.U.V. had driven only 44 miles from Monrovia, but the potholes and rain — the Chinese contractors hired to pave the road left in August along with others fleeing Ebola — meant the drive had taken an hour and a half. The trip would be an additional 143 miles, on an even worse road. But Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf was determined to go and return by the next night — she had more Ebola-related meetings to manage.

“My adrenaline flows better in a crisis,” Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf said as a line of buses — each stenciled with slogans like “God’s Appointed Time” and “God is in Control” — pulled over to let her motorcade pass.

She grinned. “This will end up as one of the biggest challenges I’ve had in a life of many challenges,” she said. “And like all the other challenges, we will overcome this.”

In New York Attorney General Debate, Cahill and Schneiderman Go on the Attack

Trading insults, invective and the occasional idea, the two major-party candidates for New York State attorney general met in their only debate on Thursday night, sharply clashing over ethics and transparency while displaying what seemed to be an unvarnished distaste for each other.

Trailing by double digits in recent polls, the Republican candidate, John P. Cahill[http://cahillforag.com/], attacked early, accusing the Democratic incumbent, Eric T. Schneiderman[http://www.ag.ny.gov/], of being a lax lawman with little statewide or national stature.

“The No. 1 question I’ve received on this campaign is, ‘Who is your opponent?’ ” said Mr. Cahill, while accusing Mr. Schneiderman, a former state senator from Manhattan, of never traveling the state.

“Staying in the West Side of Manhattan and Lower Manhattan is not going to do it.”

Mr. Schneiderman, however, insisted that his record — including corruption prosecutions, drug arrests and a $613 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/morgan_j_p_chase_and_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org] — more than spoke for themselves, saying he was “not doing this to grandstand or to make headlines.”

“The office is now running superbly,” he said, adding, “And I’m sure the attention will follow.”

Such a high-minded résumé recital, however, quickly gave way as Mr. Cahill repeatedly pressed Mr. Schneiderman about his integrity and his independence, accusing him of being part of a culture of corruption in the state Capitol.

“I won’t be kowtowed by anybody in Albany,” he said.

That included, said Mr. Cahill, the case of an assemblyman, Vito Lopez[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/nyregion/vito-lopez-says-he-will-resign-on-monday.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}&_r=0], who resigned in May 2013 after being accused of sexually harassing female employees. But Mr. Schneiderman fired back, saying such accusations were “repugnant.”

“The assertion that I had anything to do with the settlement in the Vito Lopez case was completely dismantled” by a state ethics commission, he said. “You keep saying things even though you know they are not true.”

Mr. Cahill, 55, tried to press the point, and Mr. Schneiderman, 59, continued to speak his mind, even as the moderator, Liz Benjamin, tried to break in.

“Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen?” said Ms. Benjamin, as the two bickered. “I would like to move on now.”

The debate, held at Hilbert College, in Hamburg, outside Buffalo, and sponsored by NY1, came five days before an election in which Mr. Schneiderman holds several advantages, including a big financial edge, an ability to garner headlines with news releases and an electorate where Democrats far outnumber Republicans.

Needing a late surge, Mr. Cahill was openly aggressive and disdainful of Mr. Schneiderman’s style of law enforcement, at one point accusing him of not reading a major 2013 gun control bill — the Safe Act — before celebrating it.

“Did you read the bill before you put out your press release?” Mr. Cahill said.

Mr. Schneiderman shot back, suggesting that Mr. Cahill — a former top aide to Gov. George E. Pataki — was being disingenuous.

“I’m sorry, John, when you were secretary to the governor, did you share legislation that was being negotiated by three men in a room with Eliot Spitzer?” Mr. Schneiderman said, referring to the state attorney general during some of Mr. Pataki’s administration.

Mr. Cahill said he would have if it was relevant. Mr. Schneiderman said that he doubted that was true. Mr. Cahill retorted, “Were you there?”

 The debate was heated enough that a question about Ebola seemed to be a light topic, and a rare issue on which they both agreed, albeit only on whether a forced quarantine was lawful. But the two men battled repeatedly about money and corruption in politics. In particular, Mr. Cahill stressed Mr. Schneiderman’s role in a state commission to investigate public corruption that was hastily dismantled[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias&] in March by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, leading to a federal investigation. Mr. Schneiderman helped Mr. Cuomo form the panel, and on Thursday Mr. Cahill sought to link him to its questionable demise, calling the panel “the Schneiderman commission.”

“He ran for office four years ago on the premise that he was going to change the culture of corruption in Albany,” Mr. Cahill said. “Does anybody in this state believe that that’s changed since he’s been attorney general?”

There were a few unintended moments of levity, however, if only as the crowd at Hilbert sought to break the tension. At one point, Mr. Cahill swore he would never run for governor and pressed Mr. Schneiderman to do the same. “Eric, will you take that pledge with me?” he said.

Mr. Schneiderman demurred at first, smiling. “I appreciate your aggressiveness here,” said Mr. Schneiderman.

The audience laughed. But Mr. Cahill didn’t.

“It’s not aggressiveness,” Mr. Cahill said. “It’s passion about the job and the role of the attorney general.”

A Path to Holding Onto Power for Democrats: It’s a Long Shot

Good Friday morning from Washington and happy Halloween. With four days before the midterm elections, gains in Arkansas and North Carolina push the Republican Party’s chances of winning the Senateto 71 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/30/upshot/senate-forecast-comparisons.html], geography questions vexed Scott P. Brown at a New Hampshire debate, and we compare the bookshelves of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Bruce Springsteen. First, a look at the Democrats’ paths to Senate control.

The question is increasingly insistent: Is there any way Democrats can hang onto the Senate given unfavorable polling and the difficult electoral landscape they face?

Many party operatives concede that it is getting harder to envision, but there are narrow paths that would allow Democrats to win at least 50 seats. That would keep them in power because Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would break any ties. Democrats can afford to lose a net of five seats at most.

For argument’s sake, award Republicans four seats where they appear very strong and which are now held by Democrats: Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

That means if Democrats fail to knock off any Republicans, they must then win at least five of six other battlegrounds: Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, New Hampshire or North Carolina. That’s a tall order and suggests the party’s limited prospects.

But add three states to the mix where Republican-held seats are most at risk: Georgia, Kansas and, to a lesser degree, Kentucky. A victory in any or all of them — provided the independent candidate in Kansas could be persuaded to join Democrats in the Senate — gives the party breathing room.

It still seems more likely than not that Republicans will triumph. One thing is certain: If Republicans do not gain the Senate majority this year given their ample opportunities, the party is in for a major round of recriminations.

– Carl Hulse

Heated Question for Brown at Debate: Where’s Sullivan County?

Where is Sullivan County, N.H., anyway? West of Concord? North? Northwest?

That question ended up dominating the final debate, or at least the postdebate, between Scott P. Brown and Senator Jeanne Shaheen on Thursday night.

It started when a panelist, James Pindell of WMUR-TV in Manchester, asked them to discuss the economy in Sullivan County, which he said was in the western part of the state.

Mr. Brown, a Republican who moved to New Hampshire last year after losing his Senate seat in Massachusetts, began vaguely, talking about infrastructure “up north.”

Mr. Pindell interrupted, saying: “We’re talking about Sullivan County, and I think you were talking about the North Country?”

Mr. Brown said he was talking about “any place past Concord, actually, and the challenges of our state.”

Mr. Pindell interrupted again: “Sullivan County is west of Concord. It’s not north of Concord, Senator Brown.”

Mr. Brown’s critics came out in force on Twitter, many offering maps to Mr. Brown[http://pic.twitter.com/ZnU1TL0qpj] because, as one of them said, “he obviously needs one.” Mr. Brown’s supporters brought out their own maps showing that part of Sullivan County is indeed north of Concord’s city limits.

So, hours after the debate, Mr. Pindell found himself back before the cameras, saying, “On this point, Scott Brown was right.”

“I was wrong, and I apologize to Scott Brown and to both campaigns,” he said.

Ms. Shaheen kept a straight face during the geography lesson, but her campaign later announced that on Friday, she would visit Sullivan County — wherever it is.

A Mayor Both Thin-Skinned and Big-Hearted

When I left The Boston Globe, where I oversaw coverage of Mayor Thomas M. Menino, he recorded a gag video message for the folks at City Hall in New York, where I was headed.

“Mayor Bloomberg asked me what it would be like to have Carolyn Ryan covering them,” Mr. Menino said, then looked gravely into the camera.

“You’ll see,” he said ominously. “You’ll see.”

Covering Mr. Menino, for most of us, followed a familiar trajectory.

When you were new, he liked you, he courted you, he thought perhaps you were different from the tired cynics on the City Hall beat.

That lasted a day or two — until you ran a story he didn’t like.

Then you were suddenly, in his eyes, a target of suspicion, or a sadly misguided soul.

Still, there was a tenderness about Mr. Menino, who died Thursday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/thomas-m-menino-mayor-who-transformed-boston-dies-at-71.html] at age 71. And I couldn’t help but be drawn to it.

He once told me he would have become a social worker if he had not been mayor, and it was easy to see his heart open up, especially around poorer kids.

He was often ridiculed because of his diction. When he spoke, syllables disappeared, and words ran together in a way that only he and his wife seemed to understand.

But he had a kindness toward those who had been marginalized, especially gay men and lesbians. One night, we were chasing a story that the city was not eager to see published. I raced downtown to see if I could persuade the mayor to confirm it. I knew where he would be: at an event he loved, a dinner for the Fenway Community Health Center, which cared for Bostonians with AIDS.

I followed him to an elevator bank and asked him to take mercy on me and confirm the information. His mood was generous, because of the Fenway crowd. He gave up what we needed, in a whisper. “Now get out of here,” he told me, laughing as he walked away.

– Carolyn Ryan

If You Can’t Say Anything Nice, Say Something Innocuous

“Kill them with kindness” is not usually a winning strategy at the polls.

That’s why candidates seem stumped when debate moderators ask them to play nice as their hour of verbal jousting winds up.

It’s been a popular question this season: “Can you say something nice about your opponent?” Responses ranged from salty to silent, but many candidates gave diplomatic, if empty, compliments.

In Alaska, the Republican nominee, Dan Sullivan, said Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, “has a lot of respect for the Alaska native people.”

Charlie Crist, the Democratic candidate in Florida, wrapped his praise of Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, with a reference to Ebola by tipping his hat to the state’s preparedness: “It’s better to be prepared than to panic.”

Joni Ernst, the Republican contender in Iowa, said Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat, was a good father. He honored her military service.

Senator Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican, displayed his backhand. The independent Greg Orman, he said, was a good dresser.

Gov. Paul R. LePage, Maine’s Republican governor, couldn’t come up with anything, and he has two opponents.

The most famous not-quite-a-putdown may have been President Obama’s remark to Hillary Rodham Clinton in a 2008 debate: “You’re likable enough, Hillary.”

Who’s the Boss of the Bookshelf? Christie or Springsteen?

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey can sing from memory nearly every lyric of every Bruce Springsteen song. But if he really wants to win the Boss’s admiration, the governor may want to hit the books.

It turns out that Mr. Springsteen is a voracious reader, which he details in an article to be published Sunday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/books/review/bruce-springsteen-by-the-book.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A11%22%7D] in The New York Times Book Review Mr. Springsteen cites Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky as favorites, says he loves the “bawdy, rowdy humor, excellence and longevity” of Philip Roth, and admits that the last book that brought him to tears was “The Road” by Cormac McCarthy.

Mr. Christie loves “The Great Gatsby” and has said that he’s read the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic twice.

Mr. Springsteen has his own book — his first — coming out on Tuesday called “Outlaw Pete.” It’s a children’s book, but it just might find a place on the governor’s bookshelf.

Why?

It’s based on a Springsteen song.

Good morning on this cool Friday.

Perhaps the least frightening news item this week was an article that appeared Tuesday in The Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/flickering-lights-strange-music-and-a-ghost-at-a-brooklyn-restaurant-maybe.html] about a ghost that supposedly haunts a Williamsburg restaurant called Sweetwater.

After the story was published, people stopped by to look at the building on North Sixth Street, many of them “real characters,” said the Brooklyn restaurant’s owner, Nina Brondmo.

Several poked their heads inside to ask employees if they had seen anything spooky lately.

They hadn’t.

But privately, more Sweetwater employees came forward to tell their own experiences with the ghost this week, Ms. Brondmo said.

A dishwasher said one night, he saw a woman standing in the restaurant’s basement.

The morning cook said that he heard a voice call out his name.

“It’s always a woman, and they always think it’s me, even though I’m upstairs asleep,” Ms. Brondmo said.

Halloween isn’t a particularly busy night for Williamsburg restaurants. The parade tends to steer business to Manhattan.

But Ms. Brondmo is bracing for a potentially big Halloween turnout of those who’d like a side of the paranormal with their sea scallops.

Per tradition, the staff members at Sweetwater will wear costumes. They usually decide on a theme. This year it’s ghosts.

Obviously.

AND FINALLY …

Little ice queens abounded at a recent Halloween party at Gracie Mansion.

And at a celebration at Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

The inspiration was Elsa, the ice queen from the Disney megahit, “Frozen.”

Her highness’s likenesses have largely displaced witches and pumpkins at Halloween this year, The Times reports.

And stores in the city have scrambled to keep the ice-blue dress, with a diaphanous veil, in stock.

“This is what she wants,” one father told a reporter, referring to his daughter’s “Frozen” obsession.

“I’m into it. I can’t get away from it.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Jerusalem sacred site reopens.

The police in Israel are out in force[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-jerusalem-temple-mount-al-aksa.html] today at the holy site known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount after Palestinian[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] leaders called for a mass protest.

On Thursday, Israeli authorities killed a Palestinian[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-jerusalem-temple-mount-al-aksa.html] suspected of trying to assassinate a leading agitator for increased Jewish access to the site.

• Seven-week manhunt ends.

In Pennsylvania overnight, a man accused of killing one state trooper and seriously wounding another in an ambush last month was captured[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/eric-frein-accused-in-killing-of-trooper-is-reported-held-in-pennsylvania-.html].

Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the suspect, Eric Frein, who is to be arraigned today.

• A warmer winter for Europe.

In a deal brokered by the European Union, Russia agreed to resume[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/30/world/europe/30reuters-ukraine-crisis-gas.html] supplying gas to Ukraine for the winter, also ensuring the flow into the rest of Europe.

It’s a victory for the E.U. leadership team, whose term ends today.

• Obama on the road.

The president wakes up in Rhode Island this morning, where he will speak about the economy and “the importance of pursuing policies that help women succeed” at Rhode Island College, a coed school.

Mr. Obama is appearing with State Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who is in a dead heat in the race for governor. The state’s 7.6 percent unemployment rate is the third-highest in the nation, behind Georgia and Mississippi.

Tonight, the president will welcome trick-or-treating children and military families at the White House.

• Popular uprising.

The president of Burkina Faso, a tiny landlocked country in West Africa, quit[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/africa/burkina-faso-unrest-blaise-compaore.html] as violent protests to his 27-year reign showed no signs of winding down.

It was not clear who would replace him, but Reuters reported that the armed forces chief had taken control.

• No court order for Maine nurse.

A District Court judge today lifted restrictions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/us/ebola-maine-nurse-kaci-hickox.html] on the nurse who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and defied a state-ordered quarantine.

The judge said she must continue daily monitoring and coordinate travel with state health officials, but since she has shown no symptoms she should not be confined.

• Halloween worries.

The Denver police are warning[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/new-scrutiny-on-sweets-with-ascent-of-marijuana-in-colorado.html] parents to double-check their children’s candy haul tonight for any suspicious-looking treats that might be infused with marijuana.

The holiday will also see the use of teal-colored pumpkins[http://www.foodallergy.org/teal-pumpkin-project#.VFMy0Ycl5hl] across the nation to signal that homes have allergen-free nonfood treats.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are up about 1 percent. European shares closed ahead about 2 percent.

• The Nikkei index surged 5 percent after the Japanese central bank unexpectedly said it would expand its economic stimulus program[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/business/international/japans-central-bank-unexpectedly-moves-to-stimulate-economy.html].

• Two trouble spots in the eurozone — inflation and unemployment — were little changed in the most recent periods, reports said today.

• Andy Rubin, a high-ranking Google executive who spearheaded Android[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/andy-rubin-leaves-google-during-executive-shake-up/], says he is leaving to start a tech incubator.

• A co-founder of the Pirate Bay file-sharing site, found guilty of hacking into computers and illegally downloading police files in Denmark, was sentenced today to three and a half years in jail[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29832318].

• Russia raised interest rates to 9.5 percent from 8 percent, more than expected, in an effort to halt the slide in the ruble.

• Exxon Mobil and Chevron reported higher quarterly earnings after a[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-and-chevron-report-3Q-earnings.html] surge in refining profits[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-and-chevron-report-3Q-earnings.html] helped to offset lower oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and gas output and slumping crude oil prices.

Sonywidened its loss[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-31/sony-posts-narrower-than-expected-loss-on-playstation-sensors.html], which was cushioned by higher PlayStation 4 sales.

NOTEWORTHY

• Chasing the gore.

In “Nightcrawler[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/movies/nightcrawler-stars-jake-gyllenhaal-as-an-obsessive.html],” opening today, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a freelance videographer who tries to corner the market on grisly images of crime and accident scenes. Rene Russo, Ann Cusack and Bill Paxton also star.

And the horror film “Saw[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/movies/29saw.html]” is being re-released for one week only to celebrate its 10th anniversary.

Here’s what else is coming[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/intheaters.html] to theaters today.

• Popular reads.

Richard Flanagan’s “The Narrow Road to the Deep North[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/books/the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-by-richard-flanagan.html],” winner of the Man Booker Prize[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/m/man_booker_prize/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], arrives at No. 10 on The New York Times’s hardcover fiction list[http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-11-02/hardcover-fiction/list.html]. Jodi Picoult’s “Leaving Time” is No. 1.

Get an early look at all our best-seller lists[http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html].

• New Hogwarts tale.

A new 1,700-word story focusing on the background of the Hogwarts professor Dolores Umbridge, who first appeared in “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html],” is being released today on J.K. Rowling’s Pottermore.com[https://www.pottermore.com/en-us/]. Free registration is required.

• Grim anniversaries.

Thirty years ago today, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India was assassinated[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1031.html#article] by two Sikh members of her security team, leading to Hindu-Sikh clashes across the country. Human-rights groups put the death toll at over 10,000.

It’s also the 15th anniversary of the crash of Egyptair Flight 990[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/us/crash-egyptair-990-overview-egyptian-jet-carrying-217-plunges-into-atlantic.html] off Massachusetts, en route to Cairo from Los Angeles, killing all 217 on board.

BACK STORY

Tuesday’s House contests appear to have even less drama than usual for a midterm election.

Of 435 congressional seats, only 22[http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings] — 16 held by Democrats and six by Republicans — are considered tossups. About a dozen others are considered competitive.

In addition, the number of uncontested races has nearly tripled[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-uncontested.html] from the last two elections, to 32 districts. Another 45 districts have candidates from only one major party.

Following the money confirms that this is a year lacking excitement.

Our colleagues at the Upshot found[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/upshot/outside-spending-shows-how-few-of-the-house-races-are-competitive.html] that just 25 contests account for 80 percent of all independent spending reported to the Federal Election Commission for general-election House races.

Redistricting[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-redistricting-101.html], which often falls into the category of gerrymandering, has played a major role in the one-sidedness.

But some political scientists now believe that geography is also a factor[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-geography.html]: Democrats are more likely to live in urban areas, Republicans more in suburban areas or in rural areas.

Either way, you probably won’t have to stay up late on Tuesday to learn who your representative is.

Op-Talk
The Most Offensive Article You’ll Read About Offensive Halloween Costumes? All of Them

Since the dawn of the age of social media, every year around Halloween media outlets publish dozens of posts about the most offensive costumes making the Internet rounds. The outfits usually pertain to the year’s biggest news events, often the most tragic and thus least funny — wars, bombings, shootings, disease.

Some of the offenders are celebrities, such as the actress Julianne Hough, who wore blackface[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/26/julianne-hough-crazy-eyes_n_4165972.html] last year for her rendition of “Crazy Eyes” from the popular show “Orange Is the New Black.” But most of them are regular people, living their 15 minutes of fame, or rather infamy, all thanks to the Internet.

And some say pointing fingers at your token Internet jerk is not where the media should be focusing their energy. “Random people’s tasteless Halloween costumes lend themselves to click-bait and listicles; they invite us to assume the comfortable posture of righteous indignation,” writes Alice Robb at The New Republic.[http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120048/offensive-halloween-costumes-are-not-news] “Millions of Americans dress up for Halloween every year, and isolated examples of tasteless costumes do not reflect any meaningful trend or say much of anything about our culture.”

In 2013, the culprits that raised cries of the “demise of our culture” in listicles and on social media included the woman dressed as a Boston Marathon bombing victim[http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/what-happens-when-you-dress-as-a-boston-marathon-victim] and the men who dressed up[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/trayvon-zimmerman-halloween-costume_n_4170528.html] as Trayvon Martin and his shooter, George Zimmerman. This year, they include the “Sexy Ebola Nurse” costume [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/30/sexy-ebola-nurse-more-of-the-year-s-worst-halloween-costumes.html]and the corresponding hazmat suit for the nurse’s partner, the teenage ISIS fighters, as well as the Ray and Janay Rice outfit[http://gawker.com/ray-rice-halloween-costumes-combine-blackface-domestic-1650963461], in blackface.

And almost every kind of news outlet falls in the offensive Halloween costume article trap. Ms. Robb points out that MSNBC[http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/2014-most-offensive-halloween-costumes], Salon[http://www.salon.com/2013/10/30/the_10_most_offensive_halloween_costumes_ever/] and CNN[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/24/living/bad-halloween-costume-ideas/] have all used social media to make lists of most offensive costumes. GQ created a flowchart[http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/10/halloween-offensive-costumes.html] for their readers to see if their costumes were offensive. Mother Jones reposted a similar quiz[http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/quiz-your-halloween-costume-racist-sexist-xenophobic-or-fascist] that it assembled last year. Even NPR had a piece[http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/10/30/359836886/so-for-halloween-youre-dressing-up-as-a-sexy-ebola-nurse] on the “Sexy Ebola Nurse” — albeit in true NPR fashion, the writer adds historical context of dressing up as a disease.

“Pointing a finger at the faux pas of a man on the street is journalistic laziness, and representative of a larger trend toward a kind of journalism that is little more than a search for superlatives: ‘The Most Amazing Video You’ll Ever See …’ ‘The Dumbest Thing a Politician Has Ever Said …’” writes Ms. Robb. “This tendency has obscured the parameters of who’s an appropriate target for derision.”

Charlotte Lytton at The Los Angeles Times agrees[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-offensive-sexy-halloween-costumes-20141030-story.html], suggesting we take a step back in our anger. “The majority of these costume crimes seem to be committed by people who are fairly youthful (albeit clearly old enough to know better and young enough not to care), and if we all got heated about every misguided jerk, the world would be a pretty dark place.”

She adds that “every time a photo of an offensive Halloween costume gets shared, or liked, or even made the subject of an angry article, we’re just expanding its reach far beyond the parameters it would have existed within had we not got involved.”

There is no doubt, Ms. Lytton says, that these people are toying with boundaries of what is acceptable, “but dressing as a scantily clad aid worker won’t make any more people die of Ebola.”

While both authors say that perhaps we should let the “morons” be, they emphasize that blackface “should not pass,” and that everyone should know it’s unacceptable (explained here by Vox[http://www.vox.com/2014/10/29/7089591/dont-get-whats-wrong-with-blackface-heres-why-its-so-offensive]).

There are some who can pull off a seemingly offensive joke. It’s not Julianne Hough in blackface, or Prince Harry dressed as a Nazi, but professional comedians who play on the notion of distancing oneself from tragedy or suffering.

“It takes a skilled practitioner to make it work: Sarah Silverman can get away with making jokes about the Holocaust; The Onion won acclaim for devoting an issue to 9/11 two weeks after the attack. Most, however, are likely to offend,” writes Ms. Robb.

Ms. Lytton adds that the comedy industry “would wilt and die without the ability to poke fun at current affairs.” She asks: “Why are we so offended when people exhibit a similar level of mockery through their clothing?”

If someone actually wants to emulate an ISIS fighter or an abuser, Ms. Lytton writes, “we’d have real cause for concern, but people dressing provocatively should just be greeted with a shake of the head and nothing more.”

U.S.
From Governors, a Mix of Hard-Line Acts and Conciliation Over Ebola

FORT KENT, Me. — In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, issued a stern warning on Thursday to medical experts coming to an international conference on tropical diseases that they should stay away if they had been in Ebola-affected countries in the past 21 days, and that those who defied would be confined to their hotel rooms.

But in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, who last week called for mandatory quarantines for health care workers returning from West Africa, sounded a more conciliatory note, joining Mayor Bill de Blasio to announce financial incentives to encourage health professionals to go to West Africa to treat Ebola patients.

And here in Maine, Gov. Paul R. LePage, a Republican, said he was simply trying to enforce federal guidelines when he called for quarantining a nurse who recently returned from Sierra Leone. But the nurse, Kaci Hickox, has called the quarantine unjustified because she had no symptoms of Ebola — and she went on a bike ride Thursday to register her protest.

As more doctors and nurses return from Ebola-stricken countries in West Africa, public anxiety has soared about the potential for contagion — even though only one person in the United States has died from the virus, and several have recovered or returned from West Africa and never shown symptoms.

In response, governors of both parties are struggling to define public health policies on the virus, leaving a confusing patchwork of rules regarding monitoring, restricting and quarantining health care workers who have treated Ebola patients, whether domestically or abroad.

Over the past week, both liberal and conservative governors have imposed measures that went beyond what the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and many medical experts have said are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. Some of the toughest policies have been imposed by governors in tight races — such as Connecticut, where a Democratic incumbent was fighting a tough challenge, and Georgia and Florida, where Republicans were.

But there were also governors with wide leads in their races — including Mr. Cuomo in New York, which has one confirmed Ebola case, and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, which has none — who have imposed strong measures. That suggests, political analysts said, that governors from both parties are worried about potential political damage should their states appear unprepared for an outbreak.

“This nurse is making a good case, but if anybody in Maine or anyplace else catches Ebola, they’ll say, ‘Why didn’t the governor do more?' ” said Maurice Carroll, the director of the polling institute at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, where Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has confined at least eight people to their homes under mandatory quarantine policies.

“Is it nice to lock people up, put a lady in a tent without a toilet? No,” Mr. Caroll said, referring to how Ms. Hickox was treated in New Jersey after she landed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday. “But the alternative is, if something goes wrong, you get blamed. The decisive is what pays off.”

In Maine, Mr. LePage said in a statement that he had been trying to negotiate an agreement with Ms. Hickox, based on C.D.C. guidelines for how to prevent the spread of Ebola. Those guidelines, he said, would allow her to go about in public as long as she maintained a three-foot distance from others, and submitted to health officials to monitor her temperature and any symptoms.

Those negotiations seemed stalemated Thursday night. But Ms. Hickox, too, seemed to be stepping back from her earlier pledge to defy quarantine, emerging from her house with her boyfriend to go for a bike ride taking a trail that led them west, away from the town’s main street.

Mr. LePage said in his statement that he remained open to an agreement, but also that he would “exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law,” and said Maine law provided the state “robust authority” to address threats to public health.

Ms. Hickox, 33, had been quarantined in a tent in a Newark hospital for four days after registering a fever of 101 on a forehead scanner at the airport Friday, though she had not registered a fever earlier in the day and has not since. She was released to Maine on Monday after her lawyers threatened legal action in discussions with the state attorney general’s office.

Thursday, the American Nursing Association issued a statement in support of Ms. Hickox, saying that she did not require quarantine under C.D.C. guidelines for monitoring by local health authorities because she had shown no symptoms. The association, which along with the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association supports those guidelines, cautioned that overly restrictive conditions “will only raise the level of fear and misinformation that currently exists.”

Dr. Alan J. Magill, the president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, said the move by Louisiana to block doctors who had treated Ebola patients from its conference this weekend would harm crucial sessions where scientists, doctors and administrators who had been in the region were going to teach others.

So far, 10 to 15 participants had scrapped their trips, he said.

“We are clearly going to lose some of our speakers who have had the most experience, and that would deprive the learning from going forward,” said Dr. Magill, also the drector for malaria at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Health Program.

The letter from Louisiana officials to conference participants stated that the measures were being taken “out of an abundance of caution.” Governor Jindal earlier urged an outright travel ban and accused the Obama administration of “malpractice” in its handling of the Ebola situation.

California officials said that travelers who had contact with Ebola patients in the three countries stricken by the virus in West Africa — Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea — would be evaluated by county health officials and issued orders outlining their activities and monitoring for 21 days. All orders will be legally binding.

“The governor has said publicly about this issue that he is not inclined to make any political decisions about something as serious and dangerous as Ebola,” said Diana S. Dooley, the secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency. “He wants this to be science-driven to protect the public, protect workers and to respect those health professionals that are going to Africa to fight this disease.”

Mr. Cuomo had taken among the toughest stances when he appeared last week with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, to announce mandatory quarantines — for which Ms. Hickox was the first test case. He backed off a few days later, saying that he had always intended for people to be quarantined at home, not in hospitals.

Thursday, he was taking pains to show that he did not want to deter health workers from going to West Africa to treat Ebola patients, announcing plans to offer financial incentives for such work.

“The depth of the challenge we face in containing Ebola requires us to meet this test in a comprehensive manner on multiple fronts, and part of that is encouraging and incentivizing medical personnel to go to West Africa,” the governor said in a statement.

The military, too, was trying to explain its Ebola policy, announced Monday, which is significantly tougher than the C.D.C.'s guidelines, requiring that all troops returning from West Africa be isolated on bases and not allowed to see their families for 21 days. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted Thursday that American troops would be in West Africa for longer than the typical civilian health care worker, and in greater numbers.

“We did factor in science,” General Dempsey told reporters. “Physics is the science we factored in.”

Jess Bidgood reported from Fort Kent, and Kate Zernike from New York. Sabrina Tavernise and Michael Shear contributed from Washington and Ian Lovett from Los Angeles.

Correction: November 1, 2014, Saturday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about governors who are struggling to define public health policies on Ebola misstated the title of Dr. Alan J. Magill, who criticized Louisiana’s move to block doctors who had treated Ebola patients from attending a New Orleans conference. He is director for malaria at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Health Program, not director of the Global Health Program.

The New Thing in Google Flu Trends Is Traditional Data
By STEVE LOHR

Google is giving its Flu Trends service an overhaul — “a brand new engine,” as it announced in a blog post [http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/10/google-flu-trends-gets-brand-new-engine.html]on Friday.

The new thing is actually traditional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that is being integrated into the Google flu-tracking model. The goal is greater accuracy after the Google service had been criticized for consistently over-estimating flu outbreaks in recent years.

The main critique came in an analysis done by four quantitative social scientists,[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/google-flu-trends-the-limits-of-big-data/] published earlier this year in an article in Science magazine, “The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis.” The researchers found that the most accurate flu predictor was a data mash-up that combined Google Flu Trends, which monitored flu-related search terms, with the official C.D.C. reports from doctors on influenza-like illness.

The Google Flu Trends team is heeding that advice. In the blog post, written by Christian Stefansen, a Google senior software engineer, wrote, “We’re launching a new Flu Trends model in the United States that — like many of the best performing methods in the literature — takes official CDC flu data into account as the flu season progresses.”

Google’s flu-tracking service has had its ups and downs. Its triumph came in 2009, when it gave an advance signal of the severity of the H1N1 outbreak, two weeks or so ahead of official statistics. In a 2009 article in Nature explaining how Google Flu Trends worked, the company’s researchers did, as the Friday post notes, say that the Google service was not intended to replace official flu surveillance methods and that it was susceptible to “false alerts” — anything that might prompt a surge in flu-related search queries.

Yet those caveats came a couple of pages into the Nature article. And Google Flu Trends became a symbol of the superiority of the new, big data approach — computer algorithms mining data trails for collective intelligence in real time. To enthusiasts, it seemed so superior to the antiquated method of collecting health data that involved doctors talking to patients, inspecting them and filing reports.

But Google’s flu service greatly overestimated the number of cases in the United States in the 2012-13 flu season — a well-known miss — and, according to the research published this year, has persistently overstated flu cases over the years. In the Science article, the social scientists called it “big data hubris.”

The lesson seems to be that in fields like public health and economics, where there are long-standing information-gathering systems, the smart move is to marry the new data with the old. The new breed of data from the web, cellphones and sensors can be a powerful, knowledge-enhancing asset. But it is a signal, not the signal.

David Lazer, a professor of political science and computer science at Northeastern University, and the lead author on the Science article, said it was “great” that Google was overhauling its flu-tracking engine to blend in the C.D.C. data. But Mr. Lazer said he and other researchers would like to examine how Google’s service works in detail including seeing at least a subset of the flu-related search terms it monitors — something Google has not yet disclosed.

In its blog post, Google said it would soon publish a technical paper on the changes in Flu Trends. But Google’s reluctance to disclose more is explained by its concern that Flu Trends runs through the corporate mother ship, the Google search engine. And Google is in a constant cat-and-mouse game with competitors, marketers, advertisers and search consultants trying to figure out the secrets of its search technology.

Mr. Lazer raises a good issue about the terms under which researchers might gain access to the increasingly valuable data sets amassed by private companies. But it’s also an issue that extends well beyond Google and Flu Trends. For example, The Economist recently ran a piece on the foundering efforts to get cellphone data[http://www-economist-com.proxy.bc.edu/news/science-and-technology/21627557-mobile-phone-records-would-help-combat-ebola-epidemic-getting-look] that could be invaluable for tracking the Ebola epidemic.

Google likes to think of itself as a learning machine, and the latest step by Google Flu Trends fits that mold. It built something valuable and Google’s engineers are improving it as they learn more. Google Flu Trends now operates in 29 countries, a related Dengue Trends service is in 10 nations.

U.S. and Cuba Come Together Over Ebola, Infuriating Republicans

After some initial hedging [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/opinion/cubas-impressive-role-on-ebola.html], the United States seems to have embraced the idea of working closely with Cuba [http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/the-u-s-will-collaborate-with-cuba-on-ebola/] on the global response to the Ebola epidemic.

A mid-level official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attended a regional summit in Havana on Wednesday hosted by an association of left-leaning Latin American nations.

“This a world emergency and we should all work together and cooperate in this effort,” Nelson Arboleda [http://blogs.cdc.gov/global/2014/03/31/cdc-supports-the-ministry-of-health-in-guatemala-in-the-creation-of-a-national-public-health-institute/arboleda/], the CDC’s chief for Central America, told reporters at the conference.The conference was hosted by the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America, also known as ALBA [http://www.portalalba.org/], a regional group whose members include Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. It’s fair to say the United States is not typically on the guest list of ALBA summits, since the group is led by countries with frosty relationships with Washington, and was formed partly to counterbalance its influence in the hemisphere.

But if there’s an upside to the Ebola crisis, it’s that it seems to be injecting a dose of pragmatism to Washington’s poisonous relationship with Havana.

Cuba has emerged as one of the leading players in the effort to contain Ebola in West Africa by pledging to deploy hundreds of doctors and nurses to treat patients in the three countries with the most cases.

As the first wave of Cuban doctors arrived in Africa, officials in the United States seemed unable to decide whether they would coordinate with them in the field. They later said they happily would, but have stopped short of offering to treat or evacuate Cuban medical personnel who may contract the virus.

Cuba’s state-run newspaper Granma noted Mr. Arboleda’s attendance in passing, but didn’t treat his visit like a watershed moment. Similarly, when Secretary of State John F. Kerry recently delivered a speech on Ebola, the State Department took the unusual step of inviting Cuba’s top diplomat in Washington, but didn’t draw attention to his attendance.

Predictably, a couple of Republican lawmakers from South Florida have been critical of the Cuban medical mission. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart blasted the C.D.C. on Thursday for sending Mr. Arboleda to the meeting.

“It’s a disgrace that the United States sent a representative to an ALBA meeting in Havana and praised the Cuban dictatorship for sending forced medical labor to West Africa,” he said in a statement. [http://mariodiazbalart.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/diaz-balart-disgraceful-that-us-sent-cdc-official-to-alba-meeting-in]

Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen warned earlier this month that the Cuban doctors serving in Africa could bring the virus to Latin America, posing a threat to her community.

“The Castro regime’s decision to send Cuban doctors in a thinly disguised propaganda attempt may put South Florida at risk,” she warned. [http://ros-lehtinen.house.gov/press-release/ros-lehtinen-wants-assurances-miami-airport-will-be-ebola-free]

Thankfully, theirs are becoming increasingly lonely voices [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/the-shifting-politics-of-cuba-policy.html]in the debate over Cuba policy.

SEOUL, South Korea -- For American health officials fretting over states going their own way on Ebola quarantines, consider this: North Korea, which in the best of times allows a limited number of people in or out, is rattled enough about the virus that it reportedly will quarantine anyone coming into the country from anywhere.

The country's state-run news media reported on Thursday that all those returning from overseas trips will be quarantined for 20 days. And The Associated Press, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, said that diplomatic missions there were told that foreigners coming into the country would be quarantined under medical observation for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the disease. (It was unclear why there was a discrepancy in the quarantine periods.)

''We are doubling our efforts to detect potential patients in time,'' the North's state-run Pyongyang Radio said on Thursday, reporting tightened quarantine efforts at ports, borders and airports. The North Korean broadcast was monitored by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

North Korea, one of the world's most isolated countries, often expresses fears of threats from other nations -- mainly those from the United States and South Korea -- and lectures its people frequently about those threats. According to The Associated Press, a high-level delegation from Japan was greeted this week by a group that included two people in full hazardous-material gear.

Ebola epidemics are ravaging three nations -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- while other countries, like the United States, have had a small number of cases. Japan is not one of those countries.

It was unclear if people already temporarily in North Korea, for example on business, would have to remain there for the quarantine period even if their trips were scheduled to end sooner. According to tour operators, the country last week was worried enough about Ebola to bar tourists, who have been a source of income for the impoverished country.

Foreigners from Ebola-affected areas are to be quarantined at one set of locations, while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations, including hotels, according to The Associated Press. The report said staff members of diplomatic missions and international organizations would be allowed to stay in their residences.

Also unclear was whether North Korea would quarantine Kim Yong-nam, the head of its Parliament, when he returns from Africa, where he is leading a delegation. He is not traveling in the affected areas.

The country appeared to be controlling some outbound travel as well. This week, Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based organization that specializes in promoting educational exchanges with North Korea, said the country was not sending people to attend a workshop in Singapore.

''We are still trying to find out more about these latest measures and when they will be reverted so that our programs can continue,'' Choson Exchange said on its website.

Academic Zombies Attack! (Again)

What is it about professors and zombies?

The past few years have seen the rise of so-called zombie studies, [http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/SB10001424052702304851104579361451951384512] with books like “Zombies and Sexuality,” “Economics of the Undead,” and “Braaaiiinnnsss!: From Academics to Zombies,” as well as the spread of courses pondering the undead on campuses across the country.

And the onslaught keeps coming. Last month, the august Princeton University Press waded into the bloodbath with the mathematician Colin Adams’s “Zombies and Calculus,” [http://press.princeton.edu.proxy.bc.edu/titles/10315.html] a novel about a mild-mannered professor at a liberal arts college who finds himself confronted by a student “whose hunger is not for knowledge.” Soon he is helping a small band of survivors fight off a full-scale zombie invasion with the help of tangent vectors, parametric curve derivatives and exponential growth analysis. (Don’t panic! The scary math details are quarantined in an appendix.)

Philosophers have long used hypothetical zombies — apparently safely — in thought-experiments [http://plato.stanford.edu.proxy.bc.edu/entries/zombies/] aimed at illuminating the nature of consciousness. But zombie talk isn’t without unpleasant real-world side-effects, especially when researchers are using the undead to think about the spread of nonfictional infectious diseases.

Just in time for Halloween, the Chronicle of Higher Education has posted [http://chronicle.com.proxy.bc.edu/article/A-Brief-History-of-Academics/149755/] “A Brief History of Academics Writing Seriously About Zombies,” which revisits the experiences of Steven Schlozman, [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/the-harvard-doctor-who-accidentally-unleashed-a-zombie-invasion.html?pagewanted=all&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D] a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and the author of the 2011 novel “The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse.”

That novel centered on Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency Syndrome, a fictional, zombie-creating illness supposedly discovered by a researcher from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who died before he could publish his findings. The novel was clearly presented as such, but when Dr. Schlozman went on late-night radio to talk about the disease, his email account was flooded with panicked questions from listeners.

Something similar happened that same year when the C.D.C. posted a tongue-in-cheek blog post called “Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse,” increasing traffic by at least thirtyfold and crashing the server. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/health/20cdc.html]

The C.D.C., which still maintains a “zombie preparedness” [http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/phpr/zombies.htm] Web page, considered the campaign a great success. But as the recent hoax [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/ebola-risen-from-the-dead-viral-zombie-story-is-a-complete-hoax-9777916.html] about an “undead” Ebola patient shows, “feeding people’s appetites for zombie scenarios can be a tricky science,” writes Steve Kolowich, the Chronicle reporter. “When serious researchers talk about zombies with anything resembling a straight face, misunderstandings can spread through the public imagination faster than scientists can contain them.”

Market Closes Up With a Big Assist From the Bank of Japan

For investors, there was no shortage of excitement in October.

Stocks started the month modestly below a nominal high, only to cascade to their worst slump in two years. But after flirting with a correction, or a 10 percent drop, the market rebounded and closed at new highs on the last day of the month.

All told, stocks ended October solidly higher, up 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average capped the rally by rising 195.10 points, or 1.1 percent, to end at 17,390.52 on Friday. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 23.40 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,018.05, and the Nasdaq added 64.60 points, or 1.4 percent, to 4,630.74. Both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 were at record highs.

It’s a remarkable turn given the month’s volatility, which at times approached levels from the 2008 financial crisis. Then again, the month has an unfortunate history for unsettling moves, with the stock market crashes of 1929 and 1987 both happening in October.

This October, the market’s seesaw path was driven by fears that Europe’s economy was slipping back into a recession, worries about plunging oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] prices and concerns of possible weakness in the United States economy. Oh, and don’t forget Ebola. Those anxieties sent the market, for the most part, straight down for two weeks.

The nadir came on Oct. 15, when the S.&P. 500 came with a hair’s breadth of going into a correction. Investors had suspected such a drop. The last one occurred in late 2011, and typically corrections happen every 18 months or so.

But just after the market came close to going into a correction, it bounced right back. Strong corporate earnings were the primary driver of the rebound as well as signs that central banks in Japan and Europe were going to do all they could to stop their economies from dragging everyone else down with them.

“I don’t think it’s a surprise that we came close to a correction,” said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. “We’ve been expecting one for a while. I think the bigger surprise has been how we rip-roared all the way back up.”

He added, “When you hit someone over their head with a hammer, you don’t expect them to get up immediately.”

Companies have been, for the most part, reporting strong quarterly results the last two weeks. Corporate profits are up 7.3 percent from a year ago, according to FactSet, compared with the 4.5 percent investors had expected at the beginning of the month.

And any worries about the U.S. economy earlier in the month evaporated as the data rolled in, starting with Thursday’s data showing the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace last quarter.

On Friday, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment rose to 86.9 from 84.6 in September. That’s the highest since July 2007, five months before the Great Recession began, and it suggests consumers have largely dismissed concerns about slowing global growth. Instead, greater hiring and lower gas prices are boosting their outlook.

“Market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and worries about the global economy weren’t able to sour consumers’ moods this month,” said Greg Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics.

Still, consumer spending slipped 0.2 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported Friday, the weakest performance since an identical decline in January. Income edged up 0.2 percent in September in the smallest monthly gain since a flat reading last December.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected consumer spending to accelerate to a 2.5 percent rate in the current October-December quarter, faster than the 1.8 percent spending gain in the third quarter.

“The next couple of months will see spending pick up strongly as people start to spend their windfall from falling gas prices,” Mr. Shepherdson said.

Friday’s advances in the market were driven by the Bank of Japan, which surprised investors by announcing it would increase its bond and asset purchases by 10 trillion yen to 20 trillion yen ($90.7 billion to $181.3 billion) to about 80 trillion yen ($725 billion) annually.

Japan’s move comes only two days after the Federal Reserve brought an end to its own bond-buying program. That form of stimulus is called quantitative easing[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/q/quantitative_easing/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], also known among investors as Q.E.

“The Japanese central bank has taken the Q.E. baton from the Fed, and equity traders couldn’t be happier,” said David Madden, market analyst at IG.

Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.3 percent. France’s CAC 40 jumped 2.2 percent and Germany’s DAX climbed 2.3 percent.

Shares of Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment company, were down slightly in after-hours trading. The company said its losses ballooned to 136 billion yen ($1.2 billion) last quarter.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer maker, was up almost 1 percent after it reported a 5.5-percent increase in earnings for the third quarter. Net profit at the brewer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona was $2.5 billion, compared with $2.37 billion in the same period a year earlier.

Shares of Madison Square Garden, which is mulling splitting into two separate companies, were up more than 2 percent, closing at a nominal high of $75.76. The company said that its fiscal first-quarter net income rose to $108.1 million, or $1.38 per share as it recorded a gain from selling its music television network Fuse.

In other markets, the price of U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 58 cents to $80.54 a barrel in New York as increasing production from OPEC members added to already high global supplies of oil. Brent crude, used to price oil in international markets, dipped 38 cents to $85.86 in London.

In other energy futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline fell 2.6 cents to close at $2.169 a gallon, heating oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/heating_oil/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fell was flat at $2.515 a gallon and natural gas rose 4.6 cents to close at $3.873 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.31 percent Thursday.

In metals trading, the price of gold fell $27 to $1,171.60 an ounce. Silver fell 31 cents to $16.11 an ounce and copper fell 2 cents to $3.05 a pound.

Connecticut Girl Returns to School After Being Barred Amid Ebola Fears

A Connecticut girl returned to class Friday morning for the first time since coming home from a trip to Nigeria and subsequently being barred[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/in-connecticut-a-familys-confusion-after-a-girl-7-is-barred-from-school.html] from school out of fear of the Ebola virus.

The girl, Ikeoluwa Opayemi, 7, was allowed back at Meadowside Elementary School in Milford, reversing the school system’s earlier decision to keep her out of class for 21 days, the longest-known time it can take for symptoms of the disease to emerge. She and her father, Stephen Opayemi, had traveled to Nigeria to attend a family wedding

The Opayemi family had sued the Milford schools after Ikeoluwa was prohibited from returning to class, arguing that the girl, who was not sick, did not pose a health risk since Nigeria is not among the African nations where the virus is rampant.

The 21-day ban would have expired over the weekend, allowing Ikeoluwa to return on Monday. But on Thursday, Milford’s superintendent of schools, Elizabeth Feser, and Mr. Opayemi issued a joint statement saying that the girl’s doctor had declared that “she is perfectly healthy and can take part in school activities, without restriction.”

Mr. Opayemi said on Friday afternoon that his daughter had not encountered any trouble on her first day back at school. “Nobody has made any negative comments,” he said. “It’s Halloween day, so everybody is happy. Everything went well, everyone was O.K.”

The lawsuit, which both sides agreed to settle, came as several states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, defended their decisions to quarantine healthy travelers returning from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the spread of virus has reached epidemic proportions.

Mr. Opayemi said the authorities had told him the ban, which exceeded state and federal Ebola policies, was intended to address local residents’ fears, whether justified or not. The family’s lawsuit described the prohibition as a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act[http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fs-ada.cfm], which protects the rights not only of people with mental or physical disabilities, but also those of healthy people who are mistakenly treated as being ill.

Earlier this week, Mr. Opayemi explained why his family had sued. “We wanted to show our daughter that we fought for her in the future when she grows up,” he said. “The second reason is, I want to change the narrative about my daughter. She’s not a girl who was sent home because she had Ebola. This is a girl who was wrongly sent home because of irrational fear, ignorance and overreaction.”

U.S.
Judge in Maine Eases Restrictions on Nurse

FORT KENT, Me. — In a victory for a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa, a judge in Maine on Friday rejected arguments by the state that her movements should be firmly restricted, praising her “compassion” even as he acknowledged the public’s fears about the virus.

The order by Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere, the chief judge for the Maine District Courts, requires the nurse, Kaci Hickox, to submit to daily monitoring for symptoms, to coordinate her travel with public health officials and to notify them immediately if symptoms appear. But the judge rejected tighter restrictions because Ms. Hickox “currently does not show symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious.”

“We need to remember as we go through this matter,” the judge wrote, “that we owe her and all professionals who give of themselves in this way a debt of gratitude.”

The order seemed likely to end the three-day standoff between Ms. Hickox and Maine, and lawyers said it could influence courts in other states where health care workers returning from West Africa face quarantines or travel restrictions. Ms. Hickox has asserted that automatic quarantines will discourage health care workers from traveling to Ebola-stricken countries, while Maine and other states contend that such restrictions are necessary to protect public health.

“This decision isn’t binding on other states, but it will certainly influence them,” said Steven Hyman, one Ms. Hickox’s lawyers. “The judge made a reasonable decision about setting smart limitations.”

There may be another hearing on Tuesday, but Mr. Hyman said he did not expect the judge to change his ruling.

In a statement, Gov. Paul R. LePage, who had pushed for restricting Ms. Hickox’s movements during the virus’s 21-day incubation period, called the decision “unfortunate,” but said the state “will abide by the law.”

“My duty to protect the health of the individual, as well as the health and safety of 1.3 million Mainers, is my highest priority,” said Mr. LePage, a Republican in a tight re-election race. “Despite our best effort to work collaboratively with this individual, she has refused to cooperate with us.”

Ms. Hickox, 33, returned last Friday from a month treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and was isolated in a tent at a New Jersey hospital after she registered a low-grade fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on a forehead scanner, though she had not previously registered a fever and has not since. She was allowed to come to Maine on Monday, and has been staying in Fort Kent, an outpost of about 4,000 on the Canadian border, with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur.

For some residents here, the news that Ms. Hickox would not be required to submit to a quarantine was cold comfort. Indeed, the police chief, Tom Pelletier, said the station had received dozens of calls from people around the country this week wanting Ms. Hickox to be arrested.

“If she respects the people around her, she should do it on her own,” said Lucienne Hebert, 58, a lifelong resident. “I don’t appreciate outsiders coming in here and causing this much chaos.”

Maine had pushed for Ms. Hickox to abide by what it considers an “in home” quarantine, based on guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Under those guidelines, anyone who has had direct exposure to Ebola should, during the 21-day incubation period, be monitored daily by health officials, coordinate travel with the authorities, stay away from public places and gatherings, not go to work, and maintain a three-foot distance from others.

Maine law allows the state to go to court to quarantine someone when needed “to avoid a clear and immediate public health threat.” But that power is subject to limits, and according to numerous federal and state court decisions, the state must show that it made “an individualized assessment that a person poses a risk,” as well as demonstrate to a court that the decision was based on a sound scientific evaluation, legal experts said.

When depriving a person of liberty, the state must also use the least restrictive alternative to achieve public safety.

Given that Ebola does not spread through casual contact and that infected individuals are only contagious if they are symptomatic, Maine needed to show why a quarantine was necessary instead of less restrictive measures, such as the twice-daily monitoring recommended by the C.D.C.

On Thursday, Judge LaVerdiere issued, at the state’s behest, a one-day order imposing several restrictions on Ms. Hickox while he weighed the arguments. But Friday morning, the judge lifted those restrictions. The state, he said, had not proved “by clear and convincing evidence that limiting respondent’s movements to the degree requested” was needed to protect the public.

“We would not be here today unless respondent generously, kindly and with compassion lent her skills to aid, comfort and care for individuals stricken with a terrible disease,” the judge said of Ms. Hickox. But he also cautioned her to avoid spreading alarm in the community.

“The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,” the judge said. “The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational. However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. She should guide herself accordingly.”

Speaking to reporters outside the house she shares with her boyfriend here, Ms. Hickox said she was “satisfied” and “humbled” by the judge’s ruling, adding that she was “sensitive” to his advice to be mindful of the public’s anxieties about Ebola.

“I know that Ebola is a scary disease,” she said. “I have seen it face to face. And I know we are nowhere near winning this battle.”

States across the country, including New York, New Jersey, California and Florida, have been scrambling to enact safeguards against the spread of the virus that go beyond what the C.D.C. and many medical experts have said are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.

New Jersey, where Ms. Hickox was quarantined for three days after arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport, released quarantine protocols Friday that allow travelers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa but have showed no symptoms to spend their quarantines at home, if they live in New Jersey, or at “suitable housing locations” if they live elsewhere and cannot safely be taken there. They also said the state would “provide assistance to quarantined individuals” for any lost income.

About 100 travelers from West Africa are having their health monitored in New Jersey, but none are under quarantine because they had no contact with Ebola patients, state officials said.

Wendy E. Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University who specializes in public health, said the ruling, though not binding outside Maine, “will likely make other states stop and pause and be very careful to act only when there is a real risk of infection.”

The American Nurses Association, which has warned that quarantines could discourage American health workers from going to West Africa, applauded the ruling.

Ms. Hickox did not say whether she planned to head into town before Nov. 10, when her 21-day incubation period ends. But she said she was trying to respect the community, a notion her boyfriend, Mr. Wilbur, echoed to reporters outside their house on Friday.

“I don’t really want to put the people of Fort Kent out more than we already have,” he said.

Jess Bidgood reported from Fort Kent, and Dave Philipps from New York. Kate Zernike contributed reporting from New York.

As my colleagues Hervé Taoko and Alan Cowell report[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/world/africa/burkina-faso-unrest-blaise-compaore.html], protesters in Burkina Faso forced President Blaise Compaoré from office on Friday, one day after they ransacked Parliament[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/images-of-a-dramatic-day-in-burkina-faso.html] to prevent a vote that could have allowed him to extend his rule.

The president, who had first seized power[http://www.ina.fr/video/CAB87037404] in a military coup in 1987, tried to strike a deal to stay in office until elections next year, but he finally agreed to step down after protesters again massed in large numbers in the main square of the capital, Ouagadougou, and outside the military headquarters.

In addition to chanting “Lougué! Lougué!,” some of the demonstrators held aloft signs, including one that made a topical reference, equating President Compaoré to Ebola.

Video from the Burkina Faso news site Droit Libre TV[http://www.droitlibre.net/ouagadougou-entre-doute-et-euphorie.html] showed protesters outside the army headquarters on Friday morning and packed into what they have renamed Revolution Square. The report also showed Gen. Honoré Nabéré Traoré, the chief of staff of Burkina Faso’s armed forces, declaring that he was taking charge of the transition, not General Lougé.

U.S.
Better Staffing Seen as Crucial to Ebola Treatment in Africa
By DENISE GRADY

Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary who contracted Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] this August, was first treated there. Each nurse on the ward cared for 15 or 20 patients, and none could work for more than an hour at a time because the protective gear was so suffocatingly hot. They never drew his blood for lab tests. There was no lab.

“A nurse makes rounds maybe once every eight hours,” Dr. Sacra said. A doctor came by once a day. “The staff is so few.”

After he was evacuated to Nebraska Medical Center, a nurse stayed in his room all the time, and dozens of people were involved in his care. He had daily blood tests to monitor his electrolytes, blood count, liver and kidneys, and doctors used the results to adjust what went into his intravenous lines.

The stark difference in the care available in West Africa and the United States is reflected in the outcomes, as well. In West Africa, 70 percent of people with Ebola are dying, while seven of the first eight Ebola patients treated in the United States have walked out of the hospital in good health. Only one died: Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian, whose treatment was delayed when a Dallas hospital initially misdiagnosed his illness.The survival gap can and should be narrowed, experts say, and they agreed that the single most important missing element is enough trained health workers to provide the kind of meticulous intensive care that saved Dr. Sacra and the others treated here. West Africa is starved of doctors, nurses, hospitals and equipment, so more outside help is urgently needed, they said.

“There is no reason we can’t turn this around,” said Dr. Paul Farmer, a Harvard professor and co-founder of the aid group Partners in Health[http://www.pih.org/], which is setting up treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] for 500 patients each. “You need the four S’s,” he said. “Staff, stuff, space, systems.”

Doctors say the key to surviving Ebola, and what has saved the patients in the United States, has been a higher level of “supportive care” to treat deadly symptoms like severe fluid loss and organ failure. That means the patients received intravenous fluids and salts to replace what they lost through vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a fluid loss that can reach five to 10 quarts a day during the worst phase of the disease. Without the fluids, blood pressure[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/blood-pressure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] can crash, and the patient can quickly go into shock and die.

Most of the patients in the United States also received experimental drugs or plasma transfusions, but doctors say rehydration played a major role in saving them.

“It’s not rocket science,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an infectious disease expert from Tulane University who has treated Ebola patients in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone. Fluid replacement is done routinely for all sorts of illnesses in the United States, he said. But he added, “It’s much more challenging in Africa.”

The greatest need, he said, is for a larger staff. “Biggest impediment to this outbreak,” he said. “We need people to do the work.”

Dr. Bausch and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both veterans of multiple Ebola outbreaks, said they could not be sure yet, but thought this new strain of Ebola was causing more severe and copious diarrhea than earlier strains, increasing the need to monitor and replace fluids and electrolytes.

Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, who directed the care of patients evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, said his medical team was surprised at the amount of fluid and potassium lost, and alerted doctors at treatment centers in Africa that patients there might need more replenishment than expected.

Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist for Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org], echoed the need for more pairs of hands: “If somebody said, what would I love to be able to bring to bear? Dialysis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/dialysis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] machines? Ventilators? Infusion pumps? No, I would want more person-hours of skilled nursing for patients.”

Ebola wards need an unusually high level of staffing, Dr. Sprecher said. Not only does each patient require a lot of care, but the protective gear causes health workers to overheat so quickly and severely, especially in wards that lack air-conditioning in bare-bones facilities, that they cannot work for more than an hour without coming out to cool down. Extra workers are needed so that they can spell each other.

Doctors and nurses working in the Ebola zone are disturbed by the limited care they can provide and the high death rates. Indeed, if they become infected, they leave if they can: at least 10 volunteers from developed countries have been flown to Europe or the United States for treatment rather than remain in the West African hospitals where they worked.

One volunteer, Dr. Craig Spencer, who returned to the United States from treating Ebola patients in Guinea and fell ill on Oct. 23, is being treated for the virus in New York.

Like most of the aid workers treated in the United States, those evacuated to Europe have generally fared better than patients in Africa. Two of three sent to Germany survived, as did one in Britain. Two priests repatriated to Spain died, but a health worker infected while caring for one of them survived.

Although the level of intensive care is important, doctors also say it is not the whole story. Dr Ribner suggested that two nurses infected in Dallas may have recovered quickly because they are young, in their 20s.

“We know from a lot of data coming out of Africa that younger patients do much better,” he told reporters on Tuesday. He also suggested that the gear they wore, though it obviously did not prevent infection, may have spared them a worse infection by minimizing the amount of the virus to which they were exposed.

“The higher the viral load that you get infected with, the more severe your disease is likely to be,” Dr. Ribner said.

He also mentioned that some of the sickest patients in the United States were saved by ventilators and kidney dialysis. Those treatments are not available in the field hospitals in West Africa where Ebola is being treated.

Dr. Sprecher said that most patients in West Africa were not well nourished, and that Ebola quickly sapped what little reserves they had and then made them too sick to eat. He said Doctors Without Borders was considering different options for feeding. Nasal tubes have failed: Ebola patients tend to rip them out, he said. Intravenous nutrient solutions may be needed, he said, but they are not simple to administer, and the obstacle once again is staffing.

He said Doctors Without Borders was also trying to find ways to do the routine monitoring of electrolytes that can help fine-tune treatment for severe fluid loss. At present, the only lab work done on a typical patient is a single test to see whether the person has Ebola.

Short-staffed and overwhelmed with severely ill patients, the group has judged that drawing and handling blood posed too much of a risk to its workers from spills or being stuck with needles. In addition, there simply have not been enough medical workers to follow up on those blood tests by doing things like adjusting the electrolyte levels in intravenous fluids.

But now, Dr. Sprecher said, the possibility of testing patients’ blood chemistry every other day was being investigated.

He said that over all, the death rate was about 60 percent at Doctors Without Borders’ six treatment centers in West Africa, and dropping somewhat. A similar pattern of improving survival has occurred in other Ebola outbreaks, probably because early on, the first patients to seek treatment tend to be the sickest, and many are too far gone to be saved. Gradually, people show up in earlier stages of the disease, when their odds of surviving are higher.

But Dr. Sprecher said he did not expect big drops in the death rate. “I think we could do better,” he said. “But this is not like cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or dengue, where you can get it down to 1 percent. I could be wrong. There are people who have a lot of hope for supportive care, for doing it better. I’ll be happy to be proven wrong.”

Dr. Farmer of Partners in Health said that too often, aid workers in Africa become “socialized to scarcity”— resigned to shortages of help and supplies, and to accepting that there is only so much they can do. He challenged that idea, arguing that the standard of care should be the same everywhere.

“Let’s have a medical moon shot,” he said.

Subdued Chris Christie Still Finds Center Stage

SCHOFIELD, Wisc. — Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey on Friday played a rare second fiddle at a campaign rally here for Gov. Scott Walker[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/scott_k_walker/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Wisconsin, dialing back his intensity after a week in which he dominated headlines for his handling of Ebola procedures and a heckler back home.

During a factory tour of Wausau Supply, he followed Mr. Walker closely, listening intently but rarely jumping into the conversation. He introduced Mr. Walker, rather than the other way around.

And he dedicated most of his speaking time at the rally to talking about the “honesty and integrity” of Mr. Walker, before embracing him and relinquishing the stage.

“I’ve got to tell you Chris, you are a lot of fun,” Mr. Walker said. Mr. Christie smiled.

The event showed a thawing in the relationship between the two governors. Some of Mr. Walker’s supporters had complained that Mr. Christie, as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, had not funneled enough money to Wisconsin.

It was also a sign that Mr. Christie had cooled off a little, following a tumultuous week in which he filled news reports with brash sound bites. He faced off with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over Ebola procedures (“We’re right and they’re wrong,” he said of his decision to order quarantines for people entering the country through airports if they had direct contact with Ebola patients in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone); was threatened with a lawsuit by a nurse he had quarantined (“Whatever. Get in line.”); and then engaged in some classic banter with a heckler at a Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] event (“Sit down and shut up.”).

Mr. Christie spoke calmly, almost somberly, as he introduced Mr. Walker. He described the difficulties governors can face, referring to the recall election Mr. Walker survived[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/politics/walker-survives-wisconsin-recall-effort.html] and his own experience with Hurricane Sandy — or, perhaps more subtly, the turmoil of the past week.

“They don’t teach you how to deal with that in new governor school,” Mr. Christie said, evoking a few chuckles from the crowd of about 100. “There’s no three-ring binder.”

Critics of Mr. Christie were quick to cite the events of the week as proof that he has not changed, saying that the tell-it-like-it-is attitude that endears him to many in his home state can ruffle some across the country. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, who is also known for his bluntness, has said Mr. Christie has a “Sopranos’ approach to politics.”

The only New Jersey attitude that was revealed in Wisconsin, however, was the “Jersey Fresh” logo on Mr. Christie’s blue fleece jacket. Yet, even a subdued Mr. Christie commands the spotlight.

While Mr. Walker was front-and-center on the stage, those in the crowd were excited to see Mr. Christie.

Ruth Jensen, 78, brought her son-in-law, John Melmonte, to the event and gleefully had him take a photograph of her with Mr. Christie. “I like his straightforward attitude,” Ms. Jensen said of Mr. Christie, noting that she hated “all the artificial stuff she sees in politics.”

Ted Kovolewski, 77, said he had long admired Mr. Christie “for saying whatever is on his mind.”

Both said they would vote for Mr. Christie over Mr. Walker if the two ran for president in 2016; they were happy to see him helping Mr. Walker, whom they both plan to vote for in the governor’s race here.

Mr. Christie also reiterated his commitment to send more campaign money to Wisconsin, citing it as one of the three governor’s seats that the party must defend.

Should Mr. Christie run for president, he is amassing political points with many Republican governors — who, he noted in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce last week, control “the voting mechanisms” in their states.

Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions hang over nearly every event he attends.

The stop here was one of the final opportunities for Mr. Christie to showcase himself as a national figure — one just as comfortable in the factories of Wisconsin and the diners of Arkansas as on the boardwalks of the Jersey Shore — before the presidential campaign begins in earnest.

Mr. Christie said last Sunday that he would make a decision on a possible presidential run in “the beginning of next year.” “I’m not being coy about it,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I’m obviously thinking about it but I won’t make any decision until next year,” he said.

Mr. Christie’s five-day, 19-state schedule in support of Republican candidates for governor — which includes stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida — resembled that of someone considering his own national campaign.

Even the entourage hinted at lofty ambitions, as three S.U.V.s accompanied the Mr. Walker’s bus between events, and aides clustered around both governors as they toured the factory.

There was even a reporter from a French news channel in the gaggle of reporters, most of them from local news media, following the event on Friday. Her one question was directed to Mr. Christie, asking him to identify the foreign policy he considers most important.

Mr. Christie demurred, calmly. “There will be plenty of time for all of our national leaders to be discussing the shortcomings of the president.” But, he added, “Now’s not the time.”

Alarmed by Ebola, Public Isn’t Calmed by ‘Experts Say’

When public health leaders and government officials make the case against isolating more people returning from the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] hot zones in West Africa, or against imposing more travel restrictions from that region, time and again they cite science and experts. It isn’t working very well.

Polls show[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-americans-believe-there-should-be-a-quarantine-to-deal-with-ebola/] the overwhelming majority of Americans favor quarantine in cases like that of Kaci Hickox, the nurse who was held against her will in a Newark hospital on the orders of one governor and has fended off the efforts of another governor to sharply restrict her movements. Some prominent conservative commentators dismiss the assurances of scientists, Obama administration officials and the news media as unreliable, elitist blather.

Sean Hannity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/sean_hannity/index.html?inline=nyt-per] said on his radio show, “I’m not covering what the Centers for Disease Control[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] says — I don’t trust them.” On his show, Rush Limbaugh talked sarcastically about “how we just have to trust the scientists of the world.”

When a doctor in New York was found to have Ebola, Michelle Malkin said on Twitter, “Now we get to watch smug NYC journos who were lecturing everyone else not to freak out about Ebola ... freak out about Ebola.” And when Democrats said Republican budget cuts were to blame for the lack of Ebola preparedness, the blogger Eric Erickson dismissed the way health research dollars are spent.

Such comments would find a ready audience even in a nation not dreading a lethal outbreak, and one reason is that the science of handling Ebola — what protective gear to wear, how to dispose of waste — has shifted.

Even defenders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the agency has hurt the case for trusting scientists, by making overly broad[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/ebola-dallas-texas-presbyterian-hospital-apology.html] assurances early on, or changing guidelines[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/15/us/changes-to-ebola-protection-worn-by-us-hospital-workers.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias&] on handling the disease, indicating that the earlier ones were not strict enough.

This comes on top of a broader mistrust of elites. “Skepticism about science and expertise and authority has a pretty big constituency out there,” said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. It is not enough for policy makers to be right on the science, he said; they must also find a way to reassure “people who are all too ready to interpret expert opinion as elitist and condescending.”

That sort of view runs across the political spectrum, he said, on issues like the safety of vaccinations[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immunizations-general-overview/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], prescription drugs or fluoridated water, and studies have shown that attempts to correct misinformation often end up reinforcing it, instead. But in recent years, that mistrust has been most visible on the right, where many people dismiss scientific consensus on global warming and evolution.

On Ebola, Republican politicians have found new lines of attack[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/on-ebola-response-congressional-republicans-put-new-focus-on-visa-suspensions.html] against the Obama administration, stoking fears of the disease. But even if, as Democrats claim, those attacks are politically motivated, the Republicans making them have often made the case in the more appealing way.

Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine, a Republican, said of his attempts to isolate Ms. Hickox, “I’m just asking her to be reasonable,” and it seems that many in Maine agree with him.

When Senator Elizabeth Warren[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/elizabeth_warren/index.html?inline=nyt-per], Democrat of Massachusetts, challenged Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, to “bring out his scientists who are advising him,” he did not take the bait, depicting his quarantine policy as common-sense prudence.

In fact, some Democratic governors, and most of the public, have taken stances similar to Mr. Christie’s and Mr. LePage’s. But some commentary in support of the administration’s position has cast things in partisan — and, yes, condescending — terms.

Michael Hiltzik, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote[http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-did-the-atlantic-20141027-column.html#page=1] that “the Democratic message actually has empirical science behind it, and the Republican message doesn’t.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, without quite taking a position on quarantine, countered that “somehow liberals are trying to convert the Ebola debate into the new trial of Galileo, as if any dissent over the appropriate response is the Inquisition.”

Public health experts say that although they disagree with the majority view on quarantine, it makes sense, and politics and derision on either side are not helpful.

“I actually think it’s completely understandable that the public would have the reaction that they do, simply because this is uncharted water,” said Dr. Daniel J. Diekema, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa’s medical school, and the president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

“When we issue statements, we tend to think all we have to do is go out and state the facts, but that’s not always enough, and we need to be sensitive to people’s fears,” he said.

Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, an epidemiologist and dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, cited the newness of Ebola to Americans, adding, “It’s terribly lethal, it’s a dreaded thing, and that rightfully triggers a lot of concern.”

“We do have this thing coming down the pike that’s called an election, and there are people who try to use this in the context of an election,” she said. “I think there could be a change in tone after the election.”

Things to look for in Tuesday’s midterm elections:

Control of the Senate:

• The Republicans need to pick up six seats in order to gain the majority. They have about a 70 percent chance of doing so, according to the latest forecast from The Upshot[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/].

• They appear to be in strong position to win four seats held by Democrats — in Arkansas[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/arkansas-elections], Montana[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/montana-elections], South Dakota[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/south-dakota-elections] and West Virginia[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/west-virginia-elections].

• The task could be complicated if they lose Republican-held seats in Georgia[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/georgia-elections], Kansas[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/kansas-elections] and Kentucky[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/kentucky-elections] — three races that remain close.

• The other Senate races that will likely will determine the balance of power are in purple states currently held by Democrats — Alaska[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/alaska-elections], Colorado[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/colorado-elections], Iowa[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/iowa-elections], New Hampshire[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/new-hampshire-elections] and North Carolina[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/north-carolina-elections].

• In Louisiana[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/louisiana-elections], a three-way race could mean no candidate gets 50 percent, leading to a runoff, which would not be held until December.

The House:

• Republicans will almost certainly maintain control.

• The big question is how many seats they will pick up and whether a bigger majority will make Speaker John A. Boehner’s job easier or harder, as he tries to keep his caucus together[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/us/politics/midterm-elections-house-republicans.html].

Statehouses:

• Some of the most compelling races have been for governor.

• In Wisconsin, a win by Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, could help him emerge as a strong candidate for president in 2016[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/us/before-bigger-stage-walker-must-win-wisconsin.html].

• Former Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida is trying to reclaim his seat[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/a-florida-race-strains-wallets-and-allegiances.html], this time as a Democrat.

• In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback faces a backlash from voters[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/us/conservative-experiment-faces-revolt-in-reliably-red-kansas.html] and a potential Republican revolt.

What else to watch:

• The most talked-about ballot initiatives have to do with the legalization of marijuana and an increase in the minimum wage.

• There are also interesting down-ballot races, and The Times has provided a helpful guide for all 50 states[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/state-by-state].

The electorate:

• The mood of the national electorate is very uneasy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/us/politics/republican-strategy-midterm-elections.html], with the threat of Ebola and the rise of the Islamic State adding to an undercurrent of economic anxiety.

• President Obama’s unpopularity is hindering Democrats[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/politics/on-campaign-road-uneasy-democrats-show-obama-their-tail-lights.html], but Republicans are also viewed unfavorably.

• Though Republicans have sought to nationalize the election, the political environment varies from state to state, as demonstrated in a series of state portraits The Times published[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/us/series/states_in_play/index.html] on Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina.

* Louisiana’s Rogues Yield to National Issues[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/politics/national-concerns-drain-color-from-politics-in-louisiana.html]

* With Farms Fading and Urban Might Rising, Power Shifts in Iowa[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/politics/iowa-senate-election.html]

* Tracing the Line in Colorado, a State Split Left and Right[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/us/politics/in-colorado-ever-in-transition-a-fight-for-power.html]

* As Energy Boom Ends, a Political Identity Crisis in Alaska[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/as-energy-boom-ends-a-political-identity-crisis.html]

* North Carolina, in Political Flux, Battles for Its Identity[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/us/north-carolina-in-political-flux-battles-for-its-identity.html]

FRONT PAGE

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/cuomos-role-in-hurricane-sandy-inquiry-foretold-fate-of-his-ethics-panel.html] on Thursday about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s first use of the Moreland Act, establishing a commission to investigate electric companies’ shortcomings after Hurricane Sandy, misidentified the person who wrote an email regarding changes to a report on whether to privatize the Long Island Power Authority. Peter Bradford wrote to Mark Green, a fellow commissioner: “Outrageous. We were never polled as to that language.” Mr. Green did not write to Mr. Bradford.

NATIONAL

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/kaci-hickox-nurse-under-ebola-quarantine-takes-bike-ride-defying-maine-officials.html] on Friday about governors who are struggling to define public health policies on Ebola misstated the title of Dr. Alan J. Magill, who criticized Louisiana’s move to block doctors who had treated Ebola patients from attending a New Orleans conference. He is director for malaria at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Health Program, not director of the Global Health Program.

BUSINESS DAY

The High & Low Finance column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/business/inflation-deflation-is-new-risk.html] on Friday, about the risks of deflation, misstated the market forecast for the 10-year inflation rate. It is 1.9 percent, not 1.7 percent.

WEEKEND

An art review[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/arts/design/celebrating-helena-rubinstein-at-the-jewish-museum.html] on Friday about “Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power” at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, using information from the museum, referred incorrectly to the acquisition of a Helena Rubinstein ring by Andy Warhol, who drew her portrait in 1957. He bought it; it was not a gift from her. (The drawing and the ring are included in the exhibition.)

EDUCATION LIFE

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/greek-letters-at-a-price.html] on Page 20 this weekend about the time and cost commitment at some sororities misstates part of the name of the university where a former Chi Omega member, Laura Wright, teaches. It is Western Carolina University, not West Carolina University. The article also refers incorrectly to Nicole Davies. She pledged Alpha Chi Omega but was not initiated; it is not the case that she “de-sistered.” And she is a former, not current, peer adviser at American University. In addition, the article refers incorrectly to fund-raising events attended by Leah Jordan as a member of Alpha Omicron Pi. Her sorority raised money for arthritis; she did not participate in fund-raising events for autism. (Those were held by Alpha Xi Delta.)

T: TRAVEL

An article[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/orient-express-train-travel/] on Page 92 this weekend, written by two mystery novelists about a journey they took on the Orient Express, carries an erroneous byline for one of the writers. The writer publishes under the pen name Rebecca Chance, and that was the name that was intended to be used in the byline and for her first-person references in the article — not Lauren Henderson. (That is her legal name.)

•

A caption[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/picture-poem-alex-israel-terrance-hayes/] on Page 102 this weekend with the feature “A Picture and a Poem,” which pairs works from one artist and one poet, misstates the title of an artwork by Alex Israel. It is “Study for Self-Portrait (Psychic Neon)” — not “Study for a Self-Portrait (Psychic Neon).”

Elections on Tuesday! It's been quite a journey. Last spring, a woman in Iowa told voters to send her to the United States Senate because of her childhood experience on the farm, castrating hogs. And now she's the front-runner. Terrible to think of what campaign consultants will make of that in 2016.

Let's see how much you've been paying attention:

1. In Arizona, Scott Fistler will not be on the ballot. He was thrown out of the race for the Democratic congressional nomination in a largely Hispanic district after he employed the innovative technique of:

A) Claiming that he spent much of his young adulthood castrating goats.

B) Appearing in a campaign ad with his pet python.

C) Legally changing his name to Cesar Chavez.

D) Attempting to establish his district residency at a local Starbucks.

*****

2. And Eric Cantor is not on the ballot! After a stunning primary defeat, the House majority leader resigned from Congress in order to serve his country in a new way as an:

A) Anti-poverty worker in an Appalachian food bank.

B) Assistant principal in a high school for troubled teenagers.

C) Volunteer in a West African Ebola clinic.
