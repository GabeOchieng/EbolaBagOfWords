FORT KENT, Me. -- In a victory for a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa, a judge in Maine on Friday rejected arguments by the state that her movements should be firmly restricted, praising her ''compassion'' even as he acknowledged the public's fears about the virus.

The order by Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere, the chief judge for the Maine District Courts, requires the nurse, Kaci Hickox, to submit to daily monitoring for symptoms, to coordinate her travel with public health officials and to notify them immediately if symptoms appear. But the judge rejected tighter restrictions because Ms. Hickox ''currently does not show symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious.''

''We need to remember as we go through this matter,'' the judge wrote, ''that we owe her and all professionals who give of themselves in this way a debt of gratitude.''

The order seemed likely to end the three-day standoff between Ms. Hickox and Maine, and lawyers said it could influence courts in other states where health care workers returning from West Africa face quarantines or travel restrictions. Ms. Hickox has asserted that automatic quarantines will discourage health care workers from traveling to Ebola-stricken countries, while Maine and other states contend that such restrictions are necessary to protect public health.

''This decision isn't binding on other states, but it will certainly influence them,'' said Steven Hyman, one Ms. Hickox's lawyers. ''The judge made a reasonable decision about setting smart limitations.''

There may be another hearing on Tuesday, but Mr. Hyman said he did not expect the judge to change his ruling.

In a statement, Gov. Paul R. LePage, who had pushed for restricting Ms. Hickox's movements during the virus's 21-day incubation period, called the decision ''unfortunate,'' but said the state ''will abide by the law.''

''My duty to protect the health of the individual, as well as the health and safety of 1.3 million Mainers, is my highest priority,'' said Mr. LePage, a Republican in a tight re-election race. ''Despite our best effort to work collaboratively with this individual, she has refused to cooperate with us.''

Ms. Hickox, 33, returned last Friday from a month treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and was isolated in a tent at a New Jersey hospital after she registered a low-grade fever on a forehead scanner, though she had not previously registered a fever and has not since. She was allowed to come to Maine on Monday, and has been staying in Fort Kent, an outpost of about 4,000 on the Canadian border, with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur.

For some residents here, the news that Ms. Hickox would not be required to submit to a quarantine was cold comfort. Indeed, the police chief, Tom Pelletier, said the station had received dozens of calls from people around the country this week wanting Ms. Hickox to be arrested.

''If she respects the people around her, she should do it on her own,'' said Lucienne Hebert, 58, a lifelong resident. ''I don't appreciate outsiders coming in here and causing this much chaos.''

Maine had pushed for Ms. Hickox to abide by what it considers an ''in home'' quarantine, based on guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under those guidelines, anyone who has had direct exposure to Ebola should, during the 21-day incubation period, be monitored daily by health officials, coordinate travel with the authorities, stay away from public places and gatherings, not go to work, and maintain a three-foot distance from others.

Maine law allows the state to go to court to quarantine someone when needed ''to avoid a clear and immediate public health threat.'' But that power is subject to limits, and according to numerous federal and state court decisions, the state must show that it made ''an individualized assessment that a person poses a risk,'' as well as demonstrate to a court that the decision was based on a sound scientific evaluation, legal experts said.

When depriving a person of liberty, the state must also use the least restrictive alternative to achieve public safety.

Given that Ebola does not spread through casual contact and that infected individuals are only contagious if they are symptomatic, Maine needed to show why a quarantine was necessary instead of less restrictive measures, such as the twice-daily monitoring recommended by the C.D.C.

On Thursday, Judge LaVerdiere issued, at the state's behest, a one-day order imposing several restrictions on Ms. Hickox while he weighed the arguments. But Friday morning, the judge lifted those restrictions. The state, he said, had not proved ''by clear and convincing evidence that limiting respondent's movements to the degree requested'' was needed to protect the public.

''We would not be here today unless respondent generously, kindly and with compassion lent her skills to aid, comfort and care for individuals stricken with a terrible disease,'' the judge said of Ms. Hickox. But he also cautioned her to avoid spreading alarm in the community.

''The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,'' the judge said. ''The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational. However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. She should guide herself accordingly.''

Speaking to reporters outside the house she shares with her boyfriend here, Ms. Hickox said she was ''satisfied'' and ''humbled'' by the judge's ruling, adding that she was ''sensitive'' to his advice to be mindful of the public's anxieties about Ebola.

''I know that Ebola is a scary disease,'' she said. ''I have seen it face to face. And I know we are nowhere near winning this battle.''

States across the country, including New York, New Jersey, California and Florida, have been scrambling to enact safeguards against the spread of the virus that go beyond what the C.D.C. and many medical experts have said are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.

New Jersey, where Ms. Hickox was quarantined for three days after arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport, released quarantine protocols Friday that allow travelers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa but have showed no symptoms to spend their quarantines at home, if they live in New Jersey, or at ''suitable housing locations'' if they live elsewhere and cannot safely be taken there. They also said the state would ''provide assistance to quarantined individuals'' for any lost income.

About 100 travelers from West Africa are having their health monitored in New Jersey, but none are under quarantine because they had no contact with Ebola patients, state officials said.

Wendy E. Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University who specializes in public health, said the ruling, though not binding outside Maine, ''will likely make other states stop and pause and be very careful to act only when there is a real risk of infection.''

The American Nurses Association, which has warned that quarantines could discourage American health workers from going to West Africa, applauded the ruling.

Ms. Hickox did not say whether she planned to head into town before Nov. 10, when her 21-day incubation period ends. But she said she was trying to respect the community, a notion her boyfriend, Mr. Wilbur, echoed to reporters outside their house on Friday.

''I don't really want to put the people of Fort Kent out more than we already have,'' he said.

Seesaw October Ends With New Highs

For investors, there was no shortage of excitement in October.

Stocks started the month modestly below a nominal high, only to cascade to their worst slump in two years. But after flirting with a correction, or a 10 percent drop, the market rebounded and closed at new highs on the last day of the month.

All told, stocks ended October solidly higher, up 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average capped the rally by rising 195.10 points, or 1.1 percent, to end at 17,390.52 on Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.40 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,018.05, and the Nasdaq added 64.60 points, or 1.4 percent, to 4,630.74. Both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 were at record highs.

It's a remarkable turn given the month's volatility, which at times approached levels from the 2008 financial crisis. Then again, the month has an unfortunate history for unsettling moves, with the stock market crashes of 1929 and 1987 both happening in October.

This October, the market's seesaw path was driven by fears that Europe's economy was slipping back into a recession, worries about plunging oil prices and concerns of possible weakness in the United States economy. Oh, and don't forget Ebola. Those anxieties sent the market, for the most part, straight down for two weeks.

The nadir came on Oct. 15, when the S.&P. 500 came with a hair's breadth of going into a correction. Investors had suspected such a drop. The last one occurred in late 2011, and typically corrections happen every 18 months or so.

But just after the market came close to going into a correction, it bounced right back. Strong corporate earnings were the primary driver of the rebound as well as signs that central banks in Japan and Europe were going to do all they could to stop their economies from dragging everyone else down with them.

''I don't think it's a surprise that we came close to a correction,'' said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ''We've been expecting one for a while. I think the bigger surprise has been how we rip-roared all the way back up.''

He added, ''When you hit someone over their head with a hammer, you don't expect them to get up immediately.''

Companies have been, for the most part, reporting strong quarterly results the last two weeks. Corporate profits are up 7.3 percent from a year ago, according to FactSet, compared with the 4.5 percent investors had expected at the beginning of the month.

And any worries about the U.S. economy earlier in the month evaporated as the data rolled in, starting with Thursday's data showing the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace last quarter.

On Friday, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment rose to 86.9 from 84.6 in September. That's the highest since July 2007, five months before the Great Recession began, and it suggests consumers have largely dismissed concerns about slowing global growth. Instead, greater hiring and lower gas prices are boosting their outlook.

''Market volatility, geopolitical tensions, and worries about the global economy weren't able to sour consumers' moods this month,'' said Greg Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics.

Still, consumer spending slipped 0.2 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported Friday, the weakest performance since an identical decline in January. Income edged up 0.2 percent in September in the smallest monthly gain since a flat reading last December.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected consumer spending to accelerate to a 2.5 percent rate in the current October-December quarter, faster than the 1.8 percent spending gain in the third quarter.

''The next couple of months will see spending pick up strongly as people start to spend their windfall from falling gas prices,'' Mr. Shepherdson said.

Friday's advances in the market were driven by the Bank of Japan, which surprised investors by announcing it would increase its bond and asset purchases by 10 trillion yen to 20 trillion yen ($90.7 billion to $181.3 billion) to about 80 trillion yen ($725 billion) annually.

Japan's move comes only two days after the Federal Reserve brought an end to its own bond-buying program. That form of stimulus is called quantitative easing, also known among investors as Q.E.

''The Japanese central bank has taken the Q.E. baton from the Fed, and equity traders couldn't be happier,'' said David Madden, market analyst at IG.

Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.3 percent. France's CAC 40 jumped 2.2 percent and Germany's DAX climbed 2.3 percent.

Shares of Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment company, were down slightly in after-hours trading. The company said its losses ballooned to 136 billion yen ($1.2 billion) last quarter.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer maker, was up almost 1 percent after it reported a 5.5-percent increase in earnings for the third quarter. Net profit at the brewer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona was $2.5 billion, compared with $2.37 billion in the same period a year earlier.

Shares of Madison Square Garden, which is mulling splitting into two separate companies, were up more than 2 percent, closing at a nominal high of $75.76. The company said that its fiscal first-quarter net income rose to $108.1 million, or $1.38 per share as it recorded a gain from selling its music television network Fuse.

In other markets, the price of U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 58 cents to $80.54 a barrel in New York as increasing production from OPEC members added to already high global supplies of oil. Brent crude, used to price oil in international markets, dipped 38 cents to $85.86 in London.

In other energy futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline fell 2.6 cents to close at $2.169 a gallon, heating oil fell was flat at $2.515 a gallon and natural gas rose 4.6 cents to close at $3.873 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.31 percent Thursday.

In metals trading, the price of gold fell $27 to $1,171.60 an ounce. Silver fell 31 cents to $16.11 an ounce and copper fell 2 cents to $3.05 a pound.

Things to look for in Tuesday's midterm elections:

Control of the Senate:

The Republicans need to pick up six seats in order to gain the majority. They have about a 70 percent chance of doing so, according to the latest forecast from The Upshot.

They appear to be in strong position to win four seats held by Democrats -- in Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

The task could be complicated if they lose Republican-held seats in Georgia, Kansas and Kentucky -- three races that remain close.

The other Senate races that will likely will determine the balance of power are in purple states currently held by Democrats -- Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina.

In Louisiana, a three-way race could mean no candidate gets 50 percent, leading to a runoff, which would not be held until December.

The House:

Republicans will almost certainly maintain control.

The big question is how many seats they will pick up and whether a bigger majority will make Speaker John A. Boehner's job easier or harder, as he tries to keep his caucus together.

Statehouses:

Some of the most compelling races have been for governor.

In Wisconsin, a win by Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, could help him emerge as a strong candidate for president in 2016.

Former Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida is trying to reclaim his seat, this time as a Democrat.

In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback faces a backlash from voters and a potential Republican revolt.

What else to watch:

The most talked-about ballot initiatives have to do with the legalization of marijuana and an increase in the minimum wage.

There are also interesting down-ballot races, and The Times has provided a helpful guide for all 50 states.

The electorate:

The mood of the national electorate is very uneasy, with the threat of Ebola and the rise of the Islamic State adding to an undercurrent of economic anxiety.

President Obama's unpopularity is hindering Democrats, but Republicans are also viewed unfavorably.

Though Republicans have sought to nationalize the election, the political environment varies from state to state, as demonstrated in a series of state portraits The Times published on Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana and North Carolina.

Alarmed by Ebola, Public Isn't Calmed by 'Experts Say'

When public health leaders and government officials make the case against isolating more people returning from the Ebola hot zones in West Africa, or against imposing more travel restrictions from that region, time and again they cite science and experts. It isn't working very well.

Polls show the overwhelming majority of Americans favor quarantine in cases like that of Kaci Hickox, the nurse who was held against her will in a Newark hospital on the orders of one governor and has fended off the efforts of another governor to sharply restrict her movements. Some prominent conservative commentators dismiss the assurances of scientists, Obama administration officials and the news media as unreliable, elitist blather.

Sean Hannity said on his radio show, ''I'm not covering what the Centers for Disease Control says -- I don't trust them.'' On his show, Rush Limbaugh talked sarcastically about ''how we just have to trust the scientists of the world.''

When a doctor in New York was found to have Ebola, Michelle Malkin said on Twitter, ''Now we get to watch smug NYC journos who were lecturing everyone else not to freak out about Ebola ... freak out about Ebola.'' And when Democrats said Republican budget cuts were to blame for the lack of Ebola preparedness, the blogger Eric Erickson dismissed the way health research dollars are spent.

Such comments would find a ready audience even in a nation not dreading a lethal outbreak, and one reason is that the science of handling Ebola -- what protective gear to wear, how to dispose of waste -- has shifted.

Even defenders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the agency has hurt the case for trusting scientists, by making overly broad assurances early on, or changing guidelines on handling the disease, indicating that the earlier ones were not strict enough.

This comes on top of a broader mistrust of elites. ''Skepticism about science and expertise and authority has a pretty big constituency out there,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. It is not enough for policy makers to be right on the science, he said; they must also find a way to reassure ''people who are all too ready to interpret expert opinion as elitist and condescending.''

That sort of view runs across the political spectrum, he said, on issues like the safety of vaccinations, prescription drugs or fluoridated water, and studies have shown that attempts to correct misinformation often end up reinforcing it, instead. But in recent years, that mistrust has been most visible on the right, where many people dismiss scientific consensus on global warming and evolution.

On Ebola, Republican politicians have found new lines of attack against the Obama administration, stoking fears of the disease. But even if, as Democrats claim, those attacks are politically motivated, the Republicans making them have often made the case in the more appealing way.

Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine, a Republican, said of his attempts to isolate Ms. Hickox, ''I'm just asking her to be reasonable,'' and it seems that many in Maine agree with him.

When Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, challenged Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, to ''bring out his scientists who are advising him,'' he did not take the bait, depicting his quarantine policy as common-sense prudence.

In fact, some Democratic governors, and most of the public, have taken stances similar to Mr. Christie's and Mr. LePage's. But some commentary in support of the administration's position has cast things in partisan -- and, yes, condescending -- terms.

Michael Hiltzik, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote that ''the Democratic message actually has empirical science behind it, and the Republican message doesn't.'' The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, without quite taking a position on quarantine, countered that ''somehow liberals are trying to convert the Ebola debate into the new trial of Galileo, as if any dissent over the appropriate response is the Inquisition.''

Public health experts say that although they disagree with the majority view on quarantine, it makes sense, and politics and derision on either side are not helpful.

''I actually think it's completely understandable that the public would have the reaction that they do, simply because this is uncharted water,'' said Dr. Daniel J. Diekema, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa's medical school, and the president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

''When we issue statements, we tend to think all we have to do is go out and state the facts, but that's not always enough, and we need to be sensitive to people's fears,'' he said.

Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, an epidemiologist and dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, cited the newness of Ebola to Americans, adding, ''It's terribly lethal, it's a dreaded thing, and that rightfully triggers a lot of concern.''

''We do have this thing coming down the pike that's called an election, and there are people who try to use this in the context of an election,'' she said. ''I think there could be a change in tone after the election.''

Many support the efforts of Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine to isolate a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CRAIG DILGER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

U.S. Success With Ebola Care Points to Africa's Staffing Gap

Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary who contracted Ebola in Liberia this August, was first treated there. Each nurse on the ward cared for 15 or 20 patients, and none could work for more than an hour at a time because the protective gear was so suffocatingly hot. They never drew his blood for lab tests. There was no lab.

''A nurse makes rounds maybe once every eight hours,'' Dr. Sacra said. A doctor came by once a day. ''The staff is so few.''

After he was evacuated to Nebraska Medical Center, a nurse stayed in his room all the time, and dozens of people were involved in his care. He had daily blood tests to monitor his electrolytes, blood count, liver and kidneys, and doctors used the results to adjust what went into his intravenous lines.

The stark difference in the care available in West Africa and the United States is reflected in the outcomes, as well. In West Africa, 70 percent of people with Ebola are dying, while seven of the first eight Ebola patients treated in the United States have walked out of the hospital in good health. Only one died: Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian, whose treatment was delayed when a Dallas hospital initially misdiagnosed his illness.

The survival gap can and should be narrowed, experts say, and they agreed that the single most important missing element is enough trained health workers to provide the kind of meticulous intensive care that saved Dr. Sacra and the others treated here. West Africa is starved of doctors, nurses, hospitals and equipment, so more outside help is urgently needed, they said.

''There is no reason we can't turn this around,'' said Dr. Paul Farmer, a Harvard professor and co-founder of the aid group Partners in Health, which is setting up treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone for 500 patients each. ''You need the four S's,'' he said. ''Staff, stuff, space, systems.''

Doctors say the key to surviving Ebola, and what has saved the patients in the United States, has been a higher level of ''supportive care'' to treat deadly symptoms like severe fluid loss and organ failure. That means the patients received intravenous fluids and salts to replace what they lost through vomiting and diarrhea, a fluid loss that can reach five to 10 quarts a day during the worst phase. Without the fluids, blood pressure can crash, and the patient can quickly go into shock and die.

Most of the patients in the United States also received experimental drugs or plasma transfusions, but doctors say rehydration played a major role in saving them.

''It's not rocket science,'' said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an infectious disease expert from Tulane University who has treated Ebola patients in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Fluid replacement is done routinely for all sorts of illnesses in the United States, he said. But he added, ''It's much more challenging in Africa.''

The greatest need, he said, is for a larger staff. ''Biggest impediment to this outbreak,'' he said. ''We need people to do the work.''

Dr. Bausch and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both veterans of multiple Ebola outbreaks, said they could not be sure yet, but thought this new strain of Ebola was causing more severe and copious diarrhea than earlier strains, increasing the need to monitor and replace fluids and electrolytes.

Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, who directed the care of patients evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, said his medical team was surprised at the amount of fluid and potassium lost, and alerted doctors at treatment centers in Africa that patients there might need more replenishment than expected.

Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist for Doctors Without Borders, echoed the need for more pairs of hands: ''If somebody said, what would I love to be able to bring to bear? Dialysis machines? Ventilators? Infusion pumps? No, I would want more person-hours of skilled nursing for patients.''

Ebola wards need an unusually high level of staffing, Dr. Sprecher said. Not only does each patient require a lot of care, but the protective gear causes health workers to overheat so quickly and severely, especially in wards that lack air-conditioning in bare-bones facilities, that they cannot work for more than an hour without coming out to cool down. Extra workers are needed so that they can spell each other.

Doctors and nurses working in the Ebola zone are disturbed by the limited care they can provide and the high death rates. Indeed, if they become infected, they leave if they can: At least 10 volunteers from developed countries have been flown to Europe or the United States for treatment rather than remain in the West African hospitals where they worked.

One volunteer, Dr. Craig Spencer, who returned to the United States from treating Ebola patients in Guinea and fell ill on Oct. 23, is being treated for the virus in New York.

Like most of the aid workers treated in the United States, those evacuated to Europe have generally fared better than patients in Africa. Two of three sent to Germany survived, as did one in Britain. Two priests repatriated to Spain died, but a health worker infected while caring for one of them survived.

Although the level of intensive care is important, doctors also say it is not the whole story. Dr Ribner suggested that two nurses infected in Dallas may have recovered quickly because they are young, in their 20s.

''We know from a lot of data coming out of Africa that younger patients do much better,'' he told reporters on Tuesday. He also suggested that the gear they wore, though it obviously did not prevent infection, may have spared them a worse infection by minimizing the amount of the virus to which they were exposed.

''The higher the viral load that you get infected with, the more severe your disease is likely to be,'' Dr. Ribner said.

He also mentioned that some of the sickest patients in the United States were saved by ventilators and kidney dialysis. Those treatments are not available in the field hospitals in West Africa where Ebola is being treated.

Dr. Sprecher said that most patients in West Africa were not well nourished, and that Ebola quickly sapped what little reserves they had and then made them too sick to eat. He said Doctors Without Borders was considering different options for feeding. Nasal tubes have failed: Ebola patients tend to rip them out, he said. Intravenous nutrient solutions may be needed, he said, but they are not simple to administer, and the obstacle once again is staffing.

He said Doctors Without Borders was also trying to find ways to do the routine monitoring of electrolytes that can help fine-tune treatment for severe fluid loss. At present, the only lab work done on a typical patient is a single test to see whether the person has Ebola.

Short-staffed and overwhelmed with severely ill patients, the group has judged that drawing and handling blood posed too much of a risk to its workers from spills or being stuck with needles. In addition, there simply have not been enough medical workers to follow up on those blood tests by doing things like adjusting the electrolyte levels in intravenous fluids.

But now, Dr. Sprecher said, the possibility of testing patients' blood chemistry every other day was being investigated.

He said that over all, the death rate was about 60 percent at Doctors Without Borders' six treatment centers in West Africa, and dropping somewhat. A similar pattern of improving survival has occurred in other Ebola outbreaks, probably because early on, the first patients to seek treatment tend to be the sickest, and many are too far gone to be saved. Gradually, people show up in earlier stages of the disease, when their odds of surviving are higher.

But Dr. Sprecher said he did not expect big drops in the death rate. ''I think we could do better,'' he said. ''But this is not like cholera or dengue, where you can get it down to 1 percent. I could be wrong. There are people who have a lot of hope for supportive care, for doing it better. I'll be happy to be proven wrong.''

Dr. Farmer of Partners in Health said that too often, aid workers in Africa become ''socialized to scarcity''-- resigned to shortages of help and supplies, and to accepting that there is only so much they can do. He challenged that idea, arguing that the standard of care should be the same everywhere.

''Let's have a medical moon shot,'' he said.

For American health officials fretting over states going their own way on Ebola quarantines, consider this: North Korea, which in the best of times allows a limited number of people in or out, is rattled enough about the virus that it will reportedly quarantine anyone coming into the country from anywhere.

The country’s state-run news media reported on Thursday that all those returning from overseas trips would be quarantined for 20 days. And The Associated Press, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, said that diplomatic missions there were told that foreigners coming into the country would be quarantined under medical observation for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the disease. (It was unclear why there was a discrepancy in the quarantine periods.)

‘‘We are doubling our efforts to detect potential patients in time,’’ the North’s state-run Pyongyang Radio said on Thursday, reporting tightened quarantine efforts at ports, borders and airports. The North Korean broadcast was monitored by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.

It was unclear if people already temporarily in North Korea would have to remain there for the quarantine period even if their trips were to end sooner. According to tour operators, the country was worried enough about Ebola last week to bar tourists, who are a source of income for the impoverished country.

Foreigners from Ebola-affected areas are to be quarantined at one set of locations, while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations, including hotels, according to The A.P. The report said staff members of diplomatic missions and international organizations would be allowed to stay in their homes.

Doctors have upgraded the condition of New York City’s first Ebola patient to stable, health officials said on Saturday.

The patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, who treated patients with the virus in Guinea, had been in serious but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he was brought on Oct. 23 after developing a fever. His condition was upgraded “based on our patient’s clinical progress and response to treatment,” according to a statement by the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation.

Dr. Spencer, 33, has been receiving antiviral and blood-plasma therapies that have been successful in treating Ebola patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Details of his therapy are not known, but other patients have improved after receiving transfusions of blood products from Ebola patients who had recovered.

The statement said Dr. Spencer would remain in isolation and continue to receive full treatment.

Dr. Spencer’s hospitalization, which began two days after he said he had first begun to feel fatigued, triggered a hunt throughout the city for persons with whom he might have come in contact. He had spent those two days jogging in his Harlem neighborhood, dining out and bowling in Brooklyn, and taking subways and a taxi to reach his destinations.

The search turned up no one who might have been infected by contact with him, officials said, and he remains the only person in New York hospitalized with the disease. His diagnosis, however, led Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Christie of New Jersey to declare mandatory quarantines for anyone exposed to Ebola while in West Africa.

Mr. Christie later was criticized after New Jersey officials confined a 33-year-old nurse who had treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone but had shown no symptoms.

Mr. Christie has dismissed the nurse’s complaints about her treatment. Mr. Cuomo has relaxed New York’s procedures to allow for home quarantines.

The ‘Kind of, Sort of’ Era

I’VE sort of noticed something about the way we speak, and I wonder if you’ve sort of noticed it, too. Let me kind of explain. It’s about sort of, and its twin, kind of, and how these adverbial downtoners, as the British grammarian Sir Randolph Quirk calls them, have totally, completely, 100 percent taken over casual speech.

Kinda, sorta.

I’m not referring to their use to describe a class of something, such as a sort of mammal, but rather as hedge words, to lessen a statement’s force or meaning. For instance, here’s the University of Cambridge ecologist Peter Walsh speaking recently about Ebola: “What’s nasty about it is it sort of melts your blood vessels.”

And here’s Edward J. Snowden describing his background to Brian Williams of NBC: “I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word.”

And here’s the comedian Amy Poehler explaining how she and Tina Fey divvy up laugh lines: “It kind of figures itself out. We just have to kind of be democratic about it.”

It’s possible I’m experiencing what linguists call the frequency illusion — my brain is primed to recognize the phrases, so I’m hearing them all the time. Or maybe I’ve stumbled into another linguistic pitfall, the recency illusion, thinking that a word or phrase is recent when it has actually existed for a long time. In 1995, William Safire noted in The New York Times Magazine the widespread use of kinda-sorta in the courtroom of the O. J. Simpson trial. And as far back as 1909, the language stickler Ambrose Bierce complained that “Kind of followed by an adjective, as ‘kind of good,’ is almost too gross for censure.”

It may be too gross for censure, but “kind of” and “sort of” have shown staying power over the decades. If you put “sort of” into Google’s Ngram viewer[https://books-google-com.proxy.bc.edu/ngrams/graph?content=sort+of%2Ca+sort+of&year_start=1980&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Csort%20of%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ca%20sort%20of%3B%2Cc0], a database of millions of digitized books, you find steady usage levels through the 1980s and ’90s, and a small uptick starting in 2000. And that’s only written language, not informal speech. For anecdotal proof, listen to NPR for a few hours (though not conservative talk radio, where certainty is more the rule of law).

Gabriel Doyle, who has a Ph.D. in linguistics and writes the blog Motivated Grammar[https://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/], told me that “sort of”’ is a “de-precision device.” As Dr. Doyle put it: “The speaker is saying, ‘Don’t think of this as being overly accurate.’ ”

In other words, people throw “sort of” into their speech because they’re unsure. Our language is reflecting modern life.

We sort of have stable jobs until our company outsources or downsizes. We can sort of count on Social Security in retirement. We’re sort of done fighting a war in Iraq. It’s my nonscientific theory that “sort of” is, in part, a linguistic manifestation of the indefiniteness we feel, a noncommittal expression for a time of rapid technological change and instability across our social structures.

During our phone conversation, Dr. Doyle peppered his sentences with a lot of “sort ofs,” as in: “My approach on these things is sort of, what are the sort of factors that encourage people to use this?” He was conscious of doing so, and said his “sort of” rate increased when presenting new ideas or speaking to large crowds — say, at a conference.

“You don’t want to be overly confident in these high-stakes arenas,” he said.

In this sense, “sort of” addresses another modern concern, because not a week goes by that someone isn’t publicly embarrassed or shamed over ill-considered words they tweeted or were caught saying on video. Daily conversation has become a high-stakes arena, for celebrities as well as normal citizens.

The awareness that offhand utterances can live forever online and have serious consequences has made for overly cautious speech. So we hear the “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd say to a reporter that he “sort of laughed” after reading an article on Benghazi in a conservative newspaper. Or Joe Neumaier, a writer for The New York Daily News, who as a film critic is paid to offer sharp opinions about Hollywood, assert about Robin Williams that “you sort of don’t think of him as a sort of character actor.”

Using “sort of” to reduce the risk of making an error or causing offense is a tactic an editor friend calls “strategic softening.” (Note to Alec Baldwin: insert “sort of” in your next tirade and you won’t have to make a public apology.)

As much as it can create rhetorical wiggle room and be a tool for nuanced thinking about a complex world, the “fuzzy kinda-sorta,” as Mr. Safire called it back in 1995, can also make for wishy-washy and obsequious speech that lacks clarity, confidence and authority. Especially when used frequently and to qualify banal utterances and basic facts.

The other day I was listening to NPR and heard Nicolas Retsinas, a Harvard Business School professor, mention that his daughter had “kind of moved back to the East Coast” from Alaska.

I doubt Mr. Retsinas was aware of saying “kind of.” It’s become a verbal tic, a filler phrase. I’ve deployed both “sort of” and “kind of” myself, many times. In this very newspaper, I once described the view from a Detroit rooftop as possessing “a sort of grandeur.” Strunk and White would not approve.

Sometimes I think of epic declarative statements, and wonder how they might be rendered in today’s hedge-speak. “It was sort of the best of times, it was sort of the worst of times.” “I came, I saw, I kind of conquered.” “I sort of have a dream.”

Sound kind of weak? Definitely.

American Partisanship, From Sports to Disease

This is the time of year when this expatriate most acutely misses the American homeland, where nature is staging one of the most spectacular color shows on earth and the greatest of sports follow in exhilarating succession.

True, it was possible in Paris — or most anywhere else with Wi-Fi — to watch the relentless “Mad Bum” lead the San Francisco Giants to another World Series crown, and I did wake up the neighbors as Colt McCoy, in his first start with the Washington What’s-their-skins, led them to a stunning overtime upset of the Dallas Cowboys.

But it’s not the same without fiery foliage, a pumpkin waiting to be messily eviscerated and endless commercials for pickup trucks.

A fall fixture that is not so missed is the political messages covering lawns, billboards and bumpers every two years. With the midterm elections focused disproportionately on fringe voters, campaign ads are mostly ugly, and the competition, at least when viewed from abroad, is on the level of mud wrestling.

Still, this is a game Americans love to follow in minute detail, with all the constant handicapping of candidates, parsing of their platforms, fine-tuning of their images and staggering spending.

The trophy, of course, is not an outsize ring, but control of the legislature and several dozen states in the most powerful nation on earth, along with the legacy of its president.

Sadly, the storm of partisanship as the election approaches has also embraced the spreading fear of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], with politicians in some states seeking to burnish their images by enacting uselessly draconian measures against people who may have been exposed to the viral disease in West Africa.

‘Mad Bum’ Madness

Baseball is not a sport many Europeans understand, what with its languid pace, arcane pitches, cascade of statistics and ritual expectoration. That makes it fun to follow the occasional game in French, as I do, since announcers are forced to wrestle with words like “bullpen,” “bunt” or “curveball.” But it’s also a shame, since Madison Bumgarner is the kind of American hero Europeans should get to know.

The 25-year-old bearded left-hander, who lives in the off-season on a 140-acre farm in the Appalachian foothills of North Carolina, joined the pantheon of baseball immortals on Wednesday when he shut out the Kansas City Royals in the final five innings of the seventh and deciding game to give his Giants their third championship in five years. Only a day earlier, the Royals had slaughtered the Giants, 10-0.

In a game that cherishes legends, Mr. Bumgarner took his place alongside immortals like Christy Mathewson, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Randy Johnson. “Obviously, it hasn’t sunk in yet,” said the taciturn new god. “There’s not been near enough time to think about it.”

Midterm Stakes

There are plenty of prognoses, analyses and prophecies out there for Tuesday’s voting, but the basic picture is that Republicans stand to take control of the Senate away from the Democrats. All 435 members of the House of Representatives are up for re-election, but there is little chance that the Republicans will lose control there.

In the Senate, Democrats currently hold 53 seats, Republicans 45 and independents two, so Republicans need to pick up six seats to gain control. Democrats have fewer safe seats than Republicans do, and most tossup races involve either Democratic incumbents or seats vacated by retiring Democrats.

If Republicans control both houses of Congress, President Obama could spend the last two years of his presidency defending his signature health care reform[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] against inevitable onslaughts, and ruling largely by fiat. Mr. Obama has been one of the few constants in the campaigns, with some Democratic candidates distancing themselves from his policies.

But nothing is sure until the votes are in. Five of the key races are in Southern states where black voters potentially hold the key, and a lot of the Democratic effort has been spent on turning them out. Some of the races, moreover, are so close that they may require a runoff election, which could leave control of the Senate unclear until the new year.

Of the roughly $4 billion spent on congressional races, the bulk has gone for negative or attack advertising. That has been the trend in recent years, but it is also a reflection of the fact that center-of-the-road voters are more likely to give midterm elections a pass than the hard-core faithful. However it plays out, one thing is certain: The partisan wars of recent years are not over.

Ebola, Ignorance and Fear

Nine people have fallen ill with Ebola in the United States, of whom seven have recovered, one is in treatment and only one — a Liberian visitor — has died. Europe has also had nine cases: Three patients have died, one is in treatment and the rest have recovered.

Nonetheless, a report from the Pew Research Center found that 41 percent of Americans are worried that they or members of their family will be exposed to the virus. That is enough for politicians to barge in, so governors of several states, including New York and New Jersey, have sought to quarantine people arriving who have had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. That is far tougher than federal guidelines, which recommend that such people should keep a few feet from others, and submit to monitoring by local health officials.

Enter Kaci Hickox[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/nurse-who-spoke-out-about-quarantine-felt-a-calling-for-health-care-friends-say.html], a 33-year-old nurse who returned on Oct. 24 from a month working with the humanitarian medical group Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone, one of three countries where Ebola is rampant.

On arrival at Newark Liberty International Airport, she registered a low fever and was isolated in a tent at a hospital in New Jersey. After she threatened to sue, she was allowed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-to-be-allowed-to-finish-ebola-quarantine-at-home-christie-says.html] to travel home to Maine, where she promptly defied a state-ordered 21-day quarantine. On Friday, a judge ruled[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/us/ebola-maine-nurse-kaci-hickox.html] that officials had failed to prove the need for a quarantine, and ordered “direct active monitoring” of Ms. Hickox.

Ebola is considered dangerous only once a person develops symptoms. Ms. Hickox never has — and she tested negative after being quarantined. But the way she and other health workers who had been to West Africa were being stigmatized, she said in interviews, served only to deter others from going where they were desperately needed.

The Pitiful Whimper of 2014

IMAGINE a house ablaze. Now picture a team of firefighters pulling up to it. They behold the flames shooting through its roof. They feel its heat on their faces. And they get in position to fight it.

With squirt guns.

That house is America, and those rescuers are the candidates in these misbegotten midterms.

We’re living through a chapter of uncommonly durable and pronounced pessimism[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/opinion/frank-bruni-lost-in-america.html?ref=opinion&_r=0], when a majority of adults don’t think their kids will have as many opportunities as they did; when there’s waning faith in social mobility and a widening gap between rich and poor; when our standing in the world is diminished and our sense of insecurity has intensified accordingly; when the environment itself is turning on us and demanding the sorts of long-term adjustments we’ve seldom been good at.

And yet nothing about the discussion during these long months of campaigning has fully reflected that or been scaled to it. None of the candidates have spoken with the necessary urgency or requisite sweep. No one has stepped forward with originality, authenticity and a pledge to tear up the dreary political script of recent years and lead us into a future that we’re ceasing to believe in.

In Iowa, Joni Ernst and Bruce Braley talked of Harleys, hogs and chickens. In Florida, Charlie Crist and Rick Scott bickered over a fan. In Colorado, Mark Udall’s focus was more womb-centric than “The Handmaid’s Tale.” While I believe strongly in reproductive freedom and salute him for defending it, I also wish I could tell you, without intensive research, what sort of script he has for restoring this country’s confidence.

But I don’t know the answer — for him or for just about any of the other 2014 candidates. I know where they stand on the minimum wage and maybe on immigration reform, though there’s been a whole lot of waffling there. I know that they think the Islamic State is evil and Ebola scary.

But a visionary plan? A detailed route back to the optimism at the core of the American character? I didn’t catch those, so I’d be wary of any party leader or pundit who tells you that there’s a clear moral to the outcome of Tuesday’s voting, a bold lesson. After a sometimes breathtakingly cynical campaign bereft of big ideas, few Americans will actually be voting for anything or anyone, at least in the congressional contests.

The midterms have had too little real substance to have too much predictive relevance.

In The Los Angeles Times a month ago, the columnist Doyle McManus drew attention to a poll that “asked voters if they intended their choices to send a message to Washington.”

“Only 13 percent said they would be voting in support of Republican policies,” McManus wrote[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-midterm-elections-20141001-column.html]. “An even smaller number said they would be voting in favor of Democratic ideas. The largest group of all, 42 percent, said they didn’t have a bigger message in mind at all.”

Many of them won’t even like whichever politician they wind up voting for. In Senate race after Senate race, they’re choosing between the lesser of evils. At least as many voters have unfavorable as favorable views of both the Democratic and Republican candidates in Iowa, in North Carolina, in Georgia and in Kentucky, where Mitch McConnell, the Republican, marveled recently at a sinkhole that had opened up in the state’s moist earth. I think of that maw as nature’s response to the election, its attempt to wipe the slate clean, or rather swallow it whole and start from scratch.

It was in Kentucky that the Democratic aspirant, Alison Lundergan Grimes, provided the election’s defining moment, refusing to say whether she’d voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. With an eye toward whatever calibrations might constitute a winning formula, she tossed character, honesty and any kind of mature conversation with voters to the side.

Analysts of this election have cast it as a referendum on competence, a referendum on Obama, a referendum on an economic recovery that’s been slow and spotty. There’s some truth to each of those observations, and to the sum of them.

But if Republicans wrest control of the Senate, it will mostly reflect the particularities of the individual races and states themselves, and the larger takeaway, to the extent that there is one, will be the same as the takeaway from most of the last five elections. The turnover in the chamber will be a retort to the status quo, which is a Democratic Senate majority, along with a Democratic president.

FOR more than a decade, consistently, more Americans have said that the country is on the wrong track than have said it’s on the right one. This is remarkable.

And in almost every election during that span, the party in control of the White House, the Senate or the House of Representatives has changed. It’s been a nearly constant seesaw, with a sustained message from voters: What we have isn’t working. Give us different.

If you’re the candidate of continuity and sameness, whether a Republican or a Democrat, you’re quite likely vulnerable. That’s why Udall’s aides raised a stink when his opponent, Cory Gardner, ran a TV commercial underscoring the generations of politicians in the Udall family. Udall said it represented an out-of-bounds personal attack, which was ridiculous. What it did was weld Udall to the status quo, and that rightly spooked him.

Being welded to the status quo obviously spooks Hillary Clinton as well, and that’s why, if she runs for president, she’ll bang the “first woman ever” drum in a manner that she didn’t last time around. It’s a way to argue that putting another Democrat in the White House after Obama isn’t mere perpetuation.

The leaders of whichever party fares better than expected or at least better than the other in the midterms will talk a lot about 2016, claiming not just victory but a proven connection with the zeitgeist and what Americans really want.

Your correct response to this inevitable aria of self-congratulation will be laughter, or maybe tears, because what Americans crave and fantasize about is difference of a magnitude and a passion — you might even say an audacity — that was absent from this election cycle.

Here’s a wager for 2016, based not on 2014 but on our trudge through the doldrums and government sclerosis of so many years now: The spoils will go to the candidate who comes to the conflagration with more than a toy and a piddling amount of water.

Both Parties See Campaign Tilting to Republicans

WASHINGTON — Republicans entered the final weekend before the midterm elections clearly holding the better hand to control the Senate and poised to add to their House majority. But a decidedly sour electorate and a sizable number of undecided voters added a measure of suspense.

The final drama surrounded the Senate, which has been a Democratic bulwark for President Obama since his party lost its House majority in 2010. Republicans need to gain six seats to seize the Senate, and officials in both parties believe there is a path for them to win at least that many.

Yet the races for a number of seats that will decide the majority remained close, polls showed, prompting Republicans to pour additional money into get-out-the-vote efforts in Alaska, Georgia and Iowa. Democrats were doing the same in Colorado, where they were concerned because groups that tend to favor Republicans voted early in large numbers, and in Iowa.

While an air of mystery hung over no fewer than nine Senate races, the only question surrounding the House was how many seats Republicans would add. If they gain a dozen seats, it will give them an advantage not seen since 1948 and potentially consign the Democrats to minority status until congressional redistricting in the 2020s.

In a sign of a worsening climate, Democratic officials shifted money to incumbents in once-safe districts around Las Vegas and Santa Barbara, Calif. And over the weekend, they put more money toward television ads in districts held by Democrats in Iowa and Minnesota, including that of longtime Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota. Though there are fewer competitive House seats than in past elections because of gerrymandering, party strategists were still airing ads in 40 districts.

“It’s a grim environment,” said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Israel was spending the weekend pleading with members of his caucus to contribute to their imperiled colleagues to minimize losses. Trying to soften the blow, he noted that losses were expected: The party in control of the White House has lost an average of 29 seats in midterm elections in the last century.

Just two years after he won a second term by a commanding margin, Mr. Obama has kept his distance[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/us/politics/in-this-election-obamas-party-benches-him.html] from the most pivotal congressional races. On Saturday, he was to address a heavily African-American crowd in Detroit to bolster the Democratic nominee for governor of Michigan.

But Republicans conceded that voters were hardly embracing them. “It’s not as though people have all a sudden fallen in love with Republicans,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. “It’s just a loss of confidence in the administration. It’s national security, personal security and job security. People are on edge. And that’s not good if you’re the party in power.”

Other Republicans were similarly restrained, given the large number of undecided voters in key Senate races, growing questions about the reliability of polling[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/upshot/why-polls-tend-to-undercount-democrats.html], and respect for the Democrats’ ability to turn out voters.

“We have seen how money, big data and enhanced turnout operations can impact the actual result compared to a poll, but I believe the Democrats will largely lose the Romney states in play and lose the Senate,” said Bill McInturff, a longtime Republican pollster.

Democrats said they hoped the uncertainty would resolve in their favor. “In most elections, by two days beforehand, you can sort of tell what’s going to happen; you can feel the winds blowing,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “This one is real close, and there are countervailing forces on both sides.”

That was evident in the races for governor as well, with Republicans on the offensive in some liberal states but struggling to defend some of their incumbents in conservative-leaning states.

With only 27 percent of Americans saying the country is headed in the right direction, according to a CBS News poll[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-americans-think-of-congress-and-the-president/] released last week, voters are in an angst-ridden mood that is cutting against the Democrats. After a grinding campaign characterized by Republicans’ attacking Democrats for their ties to Mr. Obama and Democrats’ accusing Republicans of wanting to cut entitlements, the electorate does not appear enthused.

Keith Wilson, 59, a Republican from suburban Denver who said he had sometimes supported Democrats, has already sent in his ballot. He voted for the Republicans and said he viewed the election as a referendum on the White House.

“It’s a real nervous time that we’re having,” Mr. Wilson said, ticking off the country’s problems and skewering the president. “It’s like everything is a reaction, instead of pro-action.” But as he sat at a Denver cafe, he made it clear that his vote was no endorsement of the Republicans. “I took the best of the two evils,” he said.

Representative David E. Price, Democrat of North Carolina and a political scientist, said: “People aren’t yet feeling economically secure. And you pile onto that this incredible list of international crises and the concerted Republican effort to hang those problems around the president’s neck, and you have your explanation.”

In their closing ads, some Republicans sought to leverage this unease.

David Perdue, the Republican candidate for the open Senate seat in Georgia, sought to link his opponent, Michelle Nunn, to Mr. Obama by airing a commercial showing the two of them together below an image of people in hazmat suits. A narrator warned of “terrorism and Ebola coming at us from overseas.”

The Georgia race illustrates why Republicans’ prospects for taking over the Senate are good, but not certain. While Ms. Nunn has run a strong race, the seat — held by Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Republican who is retiring — is likely to be decided in a January runoff[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/upshot/senate-model-update-what-if-georgia-goes-to-a-runoff.html], as neither she nor Mr. Perdue is expected to receive the majority needed to win outright on Tuesday.

But as the two parties prepared for their final push, thousands of votes had already been cast. In Morrow, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, Alonzo Jackson said Friday afternoon that weeks of radio ads and a sense of history had helped him “commit.” He voted for Democrats.

In Louisiana, Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat, will almost certainly face Representative Bill Cassidy in a runoff in December. And in Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican, is facing the most difficult re-election campaign of his 18 years in the chamber. Trying to fend off Greg Orman, an independent, Mr. Roberts began airing a radio ad over the weekend that attacked his opponent but also bowed to his own low standing among Kansans.

“Pat Roberts isn’t perfect, but at least I know where he stands,” a woman said in the commercial.

Beyond these wild cards, control of the Senate rests mostly in the hands of Democratic incumbents in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, New Hampshire and North Carolina.

“It is a tough year, everyone knows that, but the fact that these candidates are still hanging in there is a tribute to their strength,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota.

Privately, though, Democrats were increasingly worried about Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Senator Mark Udall of Colorado. If they lose and Republicans win an open seat in Iowa or defeat Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, that will be enough for the Republicans to capture the majority, provided they hold their other seats and take, as they are expected to do, seats held by Democrats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

“If you’re an incumbent Democrat in a tied race with a challenger in the final weekend, that’s not a good place to be,” said Carl Forti, a Republican strategist.

And things do not seem to be getting better for Democrats.

“It is hard to say the situation has improved in the last couple of days,” acknowledged Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster.

Senate Democrats’ best hope may be their field organization. In the last week, volunteers and staff members have knocked on 1.1 million doors and made 2.6 million phone calls, according to party officials. More than 359,000 have already voted in Iowa, and Democrats project that 55 percent chose the Democratic nominee, Representative Bruce Braley. In Alaska, nearly 32,000 have cast ballots, and party strategists are also optimistic about the composition of that early vote.

House Democrats, however, have slipped among many independents and older voters in recent weeks.

For Man in Ebola Virus Cleanup, a History of Fraud

The chief safety officer of the hazardous-materials company that cleaned the apartment of New York City’s first Ebola patient was, in a past career as a mortgage negotiator, accused of fraud in 2009 by the attorney general at the time, Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per].

In recent days, the safety officer, Sal Pain, has been the public face of the company, Bio-Recovery Corporation, which cleaned both the apartment of the patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, as well as a bowling alley that he had visited the night before he was taken to the hospital.

An investigation in 2009 by Mr. Cuomo’s office found that two mortgage companies run by Mr. Pain had deceived property owners and violated New York’s consumer protection laws. Mr. Pain says he changed the spelling of his surname from Pane, the spelling that is on court papers filed by Mr. Cuomo’s office related to the charges.

As a result of the investigation, a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan in 2010 issued a permanent injunction[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/2010/People.Amerimod.pdf] against the illegal operations of Mr. Pain and his mortgage companies. He was also fined. The office of the current attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, discovered Mr. Pain’s past legal problems on Monday and alerted city officials.

City officials have said that they followed the standard vetting protocol for the cleanup contract given to Bio-Recovery Corporation, and that health officials had reviewed the company’s work and determined that it was successfully completed.

Mr. Pain, who acknowledged his past legal problems, said on Saturday that they had no bearing on his work as an employee for Bio-Recovery. The revelations were first reported by BuzzFeed.

Though Mr. Pain is listed as the operator of the company on Environmental Protection Agency records, he said he had no ownership stake in the company and that his role included technical and public relations responsibilities.

Officials with the city comptroller’s office said on Saturday that because the cleanup contract for Dr. Spencer’s apartment was handled on an emergency basis, it was reviewed only preliminarily before the work began. The comptroller’s office gave prior approval for a contract with Bio-Recovery Corporation, which was estimated at $500,000, as well as another cleaning service company and a rapid testing company.

Eric Sumberg, a spokesman for the comptroller’s office, said in a statement on Saturday: “This office has no tolerance for corruption. When we receive this contract for registration we will take all steps necessary to ensure that this vendor has the integrity to do business with the city.”

A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, Phil Walzak, said that city health officials inspected Dr. Spencer’s apartment after the cleanup, and also reviewed the company’s waste disposal practices. He said that all work was found to have been safely completed.

Though Bio-Recovery has done about 10 jobs for the city in the last six years, Mr. Walzak said, its work has been limited enough that it reported only basic business information to the city. Mr. Pain’s name is not in the city’s vetting system, Mr. Walzak said.

He wrote in an email that “Bio-Recovery has not received any further work from the City as we review this situation.”

Wistful but Having Fun, Obama Gives Last Push

DETROIT — The giant white letters spelling V-O-T-E were already hoisted and the audience was on its feet in the gold-and-green-painted gymnasium as Gary Peters[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/michigan-elections], the Democratic candidate for Senate, roused the room for President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per].

“A man who in our time of troubles, when we were hanging on the edge,” Mr. Peters said, “stood up and stood with us.”

Chants of “Obama! Obama!” rang out Saturday evening as the president bounded to the stage in front of the crowd of about 6,000 at Wayne State University, his blue shirt sleeves rolled above the elbows, and pumped his fist. “We’ve got folks fired up! We’ve got folks ready to go!”

The campaign cheer born during his first presidential run worked here, as Mr. Obama traveled the country on a final get-out-the-vote push ahead of the last election that will make a difference to his presidency  

But with Democrats battling on politically challenging terrain to keep their Senate majority, it has not been heard very much this year. Mr. Obama has been relegated to a sharply constrained campaign schedule through deep-blue pockets of the country, where his rallies are as much about framing his legacy as about electing Democrats.

“Thank you!” a man in the Detroit crowd shouted repeatedly as Mr. Obama recited the economic gains since he took office, including an automobile industry on the rebound following the rescue package his administration implemented.

In a poor section of Milwaukee where he won all but seven votes in 2012, Mr. Obama campaigned on Tuesday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/obama-begins-trip-to-back-democratic-candidates.html] for Mary Burke, who is challenging Scott Walker, the Republican governor. He told about 3,000 predominantly African-American voters that Republicans are “counting on you being cynical — they figure you won’t vote.”

“Don’t buy it,” Mr. Obama said, looking out on a crowd dotted with well-worn “Obama” hats from his first presidential campaign and commemorative T-shirts from his 2009 inauguration. “Cynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice.”

Ahead of elections that will help determine the contours of his last two years in office, Mr. Obama is staying far from states that will decide the Senate’s balance. Instead, he is blazing through Wisconsin, Maine, Rhode Island, Michigan, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, appearing with his party’s candidates for governor and working from afar to stoke voters’ enthusiasm for Democrats.

In place of rock concert-like rallies, there have been more subdued gatherings like one in Portland, Me., in a convention center on the outskirts of town, where smooth jazz lulled the audience and former Senator George Mitchell, 81, warmed up the crowd with an 18-minute soliloquy that traced the roots of the Democratic Party.

Still, the president is savoring the ride, even if his boisterous campaign cadence occasionally gives way to a twinge of nostalgia.

“I’m not on the ballot this time, and this is the last election cycle in which I’m involved as president,” Mr. Obama said in Portland on Thursday. “It makes me a little wistful, because I do like campaigning.”

“Four more years!” came a lone shout from the audience.

His supporters are getting sentimental, too. Aradonis Perry, 23, wearing a maroon sweater and lipstick to match and toting her 8-month-old son, Jaxson, on her torso, stood in line with her grandmother on a chilly afternoon in Milwaukee to grab what she thought might be her last chance to hear from the first president she ever voted for while he is still in office.

“I’m here because I have yet to hear him speak,” Ms. Perry said as she entered North Division High School, a sprawling brown brick building whose walls are adorned with murals depicting the Harlem Renaissance and quotations from prominent black leaders.

In the gymnasium, a man on a motorized scooter held a sign that read “Malia For President 2036.” Another attendee was also looking beyond Mr. Obama’s time in office to a less remote possibility; her button said “Hillary 2016.”

Freed from the confines of White House, where his days are consumed with strategy sessions about action against the Islamic State and Ebola, Mr. Obama is showing a scrappier side in this last-ditch push toward Election Day. He is shrugging off his jacket and dropping some consonants as he revels in the appreciation of core supporters.

“It don’t make no sense,” Mr. Obama said in Milwaukee of Republican opposition to pay equity legislation.

In Detroit, where he stumped for Mr. Peters and Mark Schauer, the Democrat who is challenging Gov. Rick Snyder, Mr. Obama said Republicans have “got a lot of nerve. They’re not there for you when you need them. I think you should vote for Mark and Gary instead!"

Still, there are dark spots for the president. In Milwaukee, Mr. Obama’s remarks were interrupted by a woman shouting criticism of his administration’s failure to overhaul immigration policies. As the crowd shouted her down with chants of “O-BAM-A!” the president stopped to address her complaint: “She should be protesting the Republicans who are blocking it in Congress.”

In Portland, where he campaigned for Mike Michaud, the Democrat challenging Gov. Paul LePage, the president lingered for several minutes greeting voters, smiling broadly as he leaned in for hugs, high fives and handshakes, his every move documented by raised cellphone cameras.

Back in his limousine on the way to a nighttime flight to his next stop, Mr. Obama caught his breath, turned to an aide and said with a grin: “That was fun.”

Braving Ebola: Forward With Faith at a Liberian Clinic

SUAKOKO, Liberia -- The patients arrive, at first fearful of the people in spacesuits whose faces they cannot see. They wait for test results, for the next medical rounds, for symptoms to appear or retreat. They watch for who recovers to sit in the courtyard, and who does not. They pray.

The workers offer medicine, meals, cookies and comfort. They try to make patients smile. Very, very carefully, they start IVs. They spray chlorine, over and over, and they dig graves. They pray.

These are the people of one Ebola clinic in rural Liberia. Run by the American charity International Medical Corps, the clinic rose in September out of a tropical forest. It now employs more than 170 workers, a mix of locals and foreigners, some of them volunteers. There are laborers trying to make money for their families, university students helping because Ebola has shut down their schools, and American doctors who, after years of studying outbreaks, are seeing Ebola's ravages in person for the first time. A mobile laboratory operated by the United States Navy has set up shop at a shuttered university. Now, test results come back in a matter of hours instead of several days.

Some workers will stay a few more weeks, or until the end of the year. Many of the Liberians vow to remain until the virus is gone, when they can go back to their old jobs or resume their former lives. They work toward a time after Ebola.

Interviews have been condensed, and in some cases edited from Liberian English.

OTIS BAH, 41, GRAVEDIGGER: Mr. Bah, who has a 20-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son, previously worked in private security. One of his closest friends was treated for Ebola at the clinic; he died, and Mr. Bah helped bury him. (A18); DANIEL KORHA, 36, LAUNDRY WORKER: Several members of Mr. Korha's family have died of Ebola. Previously, he was in a construction training course that was canceled because of the outbreak, and he helped build the clinic instead. (A18-A19); DR. STEVEN HATCH, 45, PHYSICIAN: At home, Dr. Hatch is an infectious-disease specialist in Worcester, Mass., and the father of 13-year-old twins.; GENESIS SACKIE, 30, SURVIVOR: Mr. Sackie, a teacher, contracted Ebola from his brother, who died. After his release, he was most looking forward to playing with his children. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY DANIEL BEREHULAK) (A19)

New York Ebola Patient's Condition Improves, Officials Say

Doctors have upgraded the condition of New York City's first Ebola patient, health officials said on Saturday.

In a statement on Saturday, the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation said that because the patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, had responded to treatment, it was ''updating his condition to 'stable' from 'serious but stable.' ''

Dr. Spencer, who treated Ebola patients in Guinea, was to remain in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he was taken on Oct. 23 after developing a fever, the statement said. Dr. Spencer, 33, has been receiving antiviral and blood-plasma therapies that have been successful in treating Ebola patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Details of his therapy are not known, but other patients have improved after getting transfusions of blood products from people who have recovered from Ebola.

The statement said Dr. Spencer, the only person with the virus to be hospitalized in New York, would continue to receive full treatment.

He was hospitalized two days after he had begun to feel fatigued, prompting a search for people with whom he might have had close contact. He had spent those days jogging in his Harlem neighborhood, dining out, bowling in Brooklyn, and taking the subway. While the search did not yield anyone who had been infected, Dr. Spencer's fiancée, Morgan Dixon, and two of his friends were placed under home quarantine. The city health department said Saturday that one of the friends, who was not identified, had had those restrictions lifted, but would be actively monitored and assessed twice a day.

Also on Saturday, a Dallas nurse who survived Ebola, was reunited with her dog, Bentley, after a three-week quarantine that showed him to be virus-free.

The nurse, Nina Pham, fell ill after caring for the first person to receive a diagnosis of Ebola in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on Oct. 8. Her separation from Bentley, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, gained national attention after Dallas authorities imposed the quarantine while, in the same time frame, Spanish officials euthanized the dog of another nurse who has since recovered from the disease.

''He's a great little guy,'' Cate McManus, the director of Dallas Animal Services, said of Bentley.

Joni Ernst, the Iowa state senator and Iraq War veteran, was standing in a barn in a purple flannel shirt and an unzipped vest. Beside her, various swine burrowed in the hog lot; two small pigs spooned; there was copious squealing. When Ernst, who grew up on a farm castrating hogs, opened her mouth to speak, she drew the inevitable connection between her upbringing and her current role as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate. ''When I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork,'' Ernst said, smiling. Title cards reinforced her credentials. (''Joni Ernst: Mother. Soldier. Conservative.'') ''I'm Joni Ernst, and I approve this message because Washington is full of big spenders. Let's make 'em squeal.''

The 30-second spot, titled ''Squeal,'' was part of a trilogy of ads for the candidate released earlier this year. In another, Ernst, enrobed in a biker jacket, rides a Harley-Davidson to a gun range. (''Joni Ernst: Set Sights on Obamacare''). In a third, titled ''Biscuits,'' the camera focuses on a man's hands as they add butter to flour and use molds to cut circles. ''When I was working fast food, I learned the key to a great biscuit is lots of fat,'' Ernst tells the camera. ''Problem is, Washington thinks the same thing about our budget.''

Ernst is not the only candidate to have brought such a Capra-esque advertising strategy to this year's midterm elections. Something Else Strategies, the media-consulting firm responsible for ''Squeal,'' also masterminded a widely noted spot for the Republican Mike McFadden, who is challenging Al Franken for his Senate seat in Minnesota. McFadden, a former college-football player who now coaches a youth team, recruited his players to appear in a ''Bad News Bears"-style spot in which they mess up handoffs (''Washington is fumbling our future'') and clobber each other (''Obamacare needs to be sacked'') before the coach rouses them to ''get out there and hit somebody.'' At that point, for no particular reason, one player hits him below the belt, leaving the coach to recite the ''I'm Mike McFadden, and I approve this message'' bit in a high-pitched squeal -- the universal signifier of a guy who has just been hit in his junk.

Critics of the McFadden ad questioned whether such a joke might fall beneath the dignity of a prospective United States senator. A McFadden spokesman earnestly responded that the hit, in fact, landed ''in the gut'' and that the candidate's falsetto resulted from having the wind knocked out of him. (To be fair, no one browbeat Bob Quast, an Independent Senate candidate in Iowa, after his ad warned potential home intruders that he would ''use my Glock to blow your balls off.'') But the critics were missing a crucial point. McFadden, a former investment banker with a law degree from Georgetown, was debasing not only his opponent but also, quite explicitly, himself. He's in good company. ''Somebody once said if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,'' John Barrow, the deep-drawling, flannel-shirted Democratic congressman from Georgia, recently told the camera as he threw a tennis ball to a golden retriever. ''Well, I wouldn't wish Washington on a dog.'' Left unsaid, of course, is why the Harvard Law graduate is running for the punishment of spending his sixth term in the capital. ''Barrow is great at filming campaign ads,'' says David Wasserman, who tracks House races for The Cook Political Report. ''He is especially great at bumpkinizing.''

As we have often been reminded, this was supposed to be a very important election cycle. The Republicans' hopes of retaking the Senate could easily hinge on squeaker races like Ernst's in Iowa. This, along with the possibility of padding their majority in the House, would be a significant development for the nation, just as the issues loom huge, complex and ISIS-Ebola scary. And yet countless candidates seem determined to tout their fitness for these enormous challenges by trying to out-bumpkin one another. This spring, Ernst's opponent, Bruce Braley, a four-term congressman, assured voters that he ''grew up doing farm jobs and working a grain elevator.''

There is, of course, a delicate art to bumpkinizing. Republicans, in particular, have been burned in recent Senate elections by nominating candidates -- Christine O'Donnell, for instance, or Todd Akin -- who turned out to be too bumpkin for their own good and imploded in winnable races. This time around, the strategy has been tweaked: If you want to come off as an amateur, it's helpful to be a pro of some sort. One of the year's more unlikely populist heroes, after all, is a cowboy poet from South Dakota named Larry Pressler. This Washington outsider, who is running for Senate as an Independent, also happens to be a former Republican senator and a lobbyist who has considered running for mayor of Washington.

Skilled politicians have a proud tradition of conveying utter contempt for their profession, especially when they're running to keep their jobs. This is, to some degree, rooted in our history. As they drafted the Constitution, the founding fathers envisioned that their new republic would be governed by a temporary leadership class of farmers, doctors and assorted commoners who would retain close ties to their communities. Self-styled feisty populists, like Andrew Jackson, tended to denigrate the well-bred qualities of their opponents. ''Andrew Jackson, who can fight'' was how the decorated general sold himself in the 1828 presidential campaign, compared with ''John Quincy Adams, who can write.'' Jackson, who in fact was a wealthy and experienced politician, won easily.

The historian Garry Wills has referred to this entrenched American tendency as ''the glorification of the amateur and contempt for the professional.'' This dynamic was heightened during the 1960s, and even more so after Watergate, when an increasingly antiestablishment electorate gravitated toward candidates who could prove that they had no link to the professional order. The 75 new Democrats who were elected to Congress in 1974 -- the so-called Watergate babies -- swept in largely on a promise to overturn ''traditional'' politics. The Republican House overthrow of 1994, in response to Bill Clinton's shaky first couple of years, was grounded in fashioning a class of 73 anti-Washington Washingtonians. Led by Newt Gingrich, nearly all of them were committed to term limits and to spending as little time in Washington as possible. (For the record, many of them are still there.)

The apotheosis of the modern bumpkin mode has been embodied by Sarah Palin, who nearly found herself one 72-year-old heartbeat from our highest national office. Palin, the starkest example yet of a proud unsophisticate taking the national stage, has remained visible and unapologetic. She also appears to have made little attempt to fill the knowledge gaps she demonstrated in 2008 or to shed her association with reality-TV-style family dramas, like the recent drunken brawl she apparently observed at an Anchorage birthday party. According to Alan Schroeder, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University and an expert on the celebrity aspects of politics, Palin has come to represent ''a new standard of the slim résumé.''

Palin may have had a rare talent, if somewhat limited appeal, but the outsider streak of this year's midterms comes in response to a unique and distinctly awful political landscape. Not only is President Obama's popularity in free fall, but whatever Everyman credibility he mustered during his ''Washington Outsider'' candidacy in 2008 has long since been dissipated through the regal isolation of his office and the suspicion that he is aloof and presumably ill equipped at castrating hogs. He is, in other words, politically toxic. Braley was willing to abide a visit on his behalf from Michelle Obama, but he undoubtedly benefited from the fact that the first lady repeatedly mispronounced his name as ''Bailey.''

[Video: Joni Ernst's "Squeal" video. Watch on YouTube.]

Candidates themselves don't deserve all the blame for their bumpkinizing. Much of that rests with the blizzards of money being blown from wealthy donors and super PACs to a growing oligarchy of media consultants, who typically live on the coasts and work for multiple candidates at once. In a D.C. twist, those bumpkins we see on our screens are often not even real bumpkins so much as some rich guy's idea of what a bumpkin should be. One telltale signal is how familiar the props are -- the livestock, the guns, the motorcycles, the dogs and, of course, the flannel. An ad for Rob Maness, a Louisiana Republican running for the Senate, features a trifecta: a gun, an airboat and an alligator.

In large part, this is what we have to show for the nearly $4 billion that is expected to be spent in this campaign, the most of any midterm election in history. ''When you have this much outside spending, way too much of the advertising has no soul,'' acknowledged Todd Harris, a partner at Something Else Strategies, who is based in Washington, far from his clients Ernst and McFadden. The people who are creating these spots, in other words, don't have much connection to the state they're working in. It's a good bet that few at Something Else Strategies have spent much time on hog farms. They are paid either way.

[Video: Mike McFadden's "Coach" video. Watch on YouTube.]

I was thinking about the 2014 midterms as I rewatched ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' the classic Frank Capra movie that celebrated its 75th anniversary last month. In a sense, Jefferson Smith, the plucked-from-nowhere senator played by Jimmy Stewart, came to represent the ideal of the pure-hearted Washington bumpkin. Mr. Smith is a naïve outsider with quirky habits (he trains pigeons!) and a determination to live up to the ideals embodied by the monuments he so admired. His capacity for umbrage at the corrupt ways of his colleagues and the press made him an admirable foil. Likewise, he willingly engaged in a filibuster for 24 hours -- just like the highflying outsiders of recent cycles, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

But Smith's antics are actually geared toward pending legislation. He does not care about getting attention, let alone harbor any ambition of running for president. In real life, Cruz and Paul have no background in legislating or have shown no interest in it, in part because it might taint them as Washington ''professionals'' in places like Iowa.

Meantime, as Election Day loomed, Joni Ernst returned to her roots. In late October, as she held onto a narrow margin, her campaign released a new ad featuring the candidate in another flannel shirt and vest, surrounded by still more snorting pigs. ''Dirty, noisy, and it stinks,'' Ernst complains. ''Not this lot -- I'm talking about the one in Washington.'' Her campaign issued a statement assuring everyone that the ad featured the same hogs that appeared in ''Squeal,'' ''although they're older and bigger now.'' It was also produced by the same media consultants, who are also older now and, presumably, richer too.

Mark Leibovich is the magazine's chief national correspondent and the author of the forthcoming book ''Citizens of the Green Room.''

Little Vision in Elections Full of Blame

WASHINGTON — The United States midterm elections have had almost everything, except a vision for governing.

The Republicans ran on hating Obamacare and accusations that President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] displayed a lack of leadership on the Islamic State’s terrorism and Ebola. Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, even tried to blame his opponent, the incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, for the possibility that terrorists infected with Ebola might come across the Mexican border.

Democrats leveled charges that hard-hearted Republicans would slice Granny’s Social Security[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and throw her off the Medicare[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rolls while denying younger women access to contraception. Republican critics refer to Senator Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, as Mark “Uterus” for his emphasis on women’s issues.

A national campaign that will cost about $4 billion, thanks to outside money unleashed by a Supreme Court decision, has featured little discussion of issues that the next Congress will face.

The absent agenda is tax reform, a new shape for the Affordable Care Act, or a long-term deficit measure dealing with entitlements and taxes or much-needed major infrastructure projects or whether and how to wage war against Islamic State.

An election in which neither party advances ideas usually augurs poorly for getting much done.

The probability is that Republicans will win a slight majority in the Senate and add about 10 seats to their House majority. That means constant clashes between a Republican-run Congress and a lame-duck Democratic president. (The outlook isn’t much different, except for appointments, if Democrats retain a slim Senate majority subject to the whim of the minority.) The president complains that congressional Republicans’ only interest is opposing him; the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said as much. Mr. Obama seems disengaged. Republicans dismiss arguments they are too negative; they seem to be in the driver’s seat now.

Yet there are incentives for each side to temper these attitudes.

Republicans don’t relish the prospect of losing the White House again in 2016; that would give Democrats control in 20 of the last 28 years.

Preventing that outcome is complicated by the Republicans’ image with voters. “Just say no” works in midterm elections for the opposition party; it usually doesn’t in presidential contests.

Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, observed last week that if Republicans become the majority party in both houses of Congress, they would have to govern, and he offered some specific suggestions. He also tossed out notions such as a major infrastructure bill paid for by drilling fees on public lands. That won’t fly, but alternatives might.

House Speaker John A. Boehner hopes he can pick up more than 10 seats, in part so he won’t have to cater as much to the Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] element in his caucus. He’ll have to roll the right wing on some issues and cut a few deals with Democrats.

To achieve anything substantive in the Senate will require bipartisan support, which would mean Mr. McConnell and his Democratic counterpart, Harry Reid, would have to start talking to each other.

As for the president, his final two years will be part of any legacy. His leverage is limited, and foreign policy crises will be central to that assessment.

Mr. Obama can ill afford to stay in a funk and ignore the domestic front. He should perhaps consider a political trade-off to keep the guts of his Affordable Care Act — while chipping away at some of the little stuff — in return for giving the Republicans more on corporate tax overhauls, trade, infrastructure and even an immigration bill that’s a bit to the right of the bipartisan measure passed by the Senate.

A substantive down payment on immigration changes would help Mr. Obama’s legacy, and Republicans can ill afford another presidential election as the anti-immigration party.

“It may be possible to get some things done,” said Tom Daschle, a former Senate Democratic leader. “It’s not probable, but possible.”

The statement said the patient, who “worked in the fight against Ebola,” was transferred to a military hospital near Paris, after being evacuated “by special aircraft.”

He was placed in isolation “under high security,” it added.

There are no other confirmed cases of Ebola in France, the ministry said.

A spokesman for the health ministry said the patient was “a foreign citizen” but would not disclose his identity.

In September, France evacuated from Liberia a French nurse who had contracted the virus, and has since recovered.

About 5,000 people have died during the current Ebola outbreak, mainly in the West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to recent figures provided by the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

One Day in an Elevator With the President, Then Out of a Job

ATLANTA — Kenneth Tate toiled for years as a construction worker and corrections officer, and he has no doubt that his last job — working as a $42,000-a-year private security guard at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] — was the best he ever had.

The high point was an afternoon seven weeks ago when he was assigned to accompany President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per], who was visiting the agency’s headquarters here for a briefing on the Ebola epidemic. It was not only that Mr. Tate’s bosses had entrusted him with staying close to such an important dignitary. It was that, as an African-American born in Chicago, he was going to meet the nation’s first black president, a man he deeply admired.

But by the time Mr. Obama’s visit was over, Mr. Tate was on the way to losing his job.

As Mr. Obama’s motorcade was preparing to leave the C.D.C., Mr. Tate tried to take a picture on his cellphone as a memento. Angry Secret Service[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/secret_service/index.html?inline=nyt-org] agents told him that he had gotten too close to the Beast, as the presidential limousine is known. When the agents relayed to Mr. Tate’s bosses what had happened, they reacted angrily.

“This was unjust and has been a nightmare,” Mr. Tate, 47, said in an interview last week. “I’ve tried to rationalize it. It won’t go away.”

But it took several weeks before the full consequences of the incident became clear. An investigation conducted shortly after Mr. Obama’s visit revealed that Mr. Tate was carrying a C.D.C.-issued firearm, a violation of Secret Service protocols — and a security lapse that the agency’s director at the time, Julia Pierson, never mentioned to the White House.

Then, on the same day that Ms. Pierson testified at a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill about how a fence jumper with a knife had gained entry to the White House, The Washington Examiner revealed that Mr. Obama had been on an elevator with a C.D.C. security guard who was carrying a gun in violation of Secret Service protocols.

The story added to a growing debate over whether the Secret Service was failing in its most basic duties. Some news media organizations, as well as Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, said — erroneously — that the security guard had been convicted of felonies. Mr. Tate had been arrested several times, including on charges of robbery and assault, but never convicted.

The next day, Ms. Pierson resigned. But in Mr. Tate’s view, he is the real victim.

“From the reports, I was some stranger that entered the elevator,” he said in an interview here at the office of his lawyer, Christopher Chestnut. “I mean, I was appointed.”

The Secret Service and the C.D.C. have not released a chronology of what occurred that day, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of Mr. Tate’s account. A Secret Service official, who was given a summary of Mr. Tate’s account, said it was largely consistent with what an agency investigation had found. He said the inspector general’s office of the Department of Homeland Security was investigating the incident.

But William R. Banks, the president of Professional Security Corporation, the private security firm that was Mr. Tate’s employer, said in an email that Mr. Tate’s description of the day’s events “are not correct,” though he declined to say what was inaccurate. He confirmed that Mr. Tate “did not have any felony or misdemeanor convictions.” The C.D.C. declined to comment.

According to Mr. Tate, the day Mr. Obama traveled to the C.D.C. started the way every workday did, with being issued a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun and two magazine clips. Mr. Tate said he had holstered the weapon on his belt under his suit jacket.

His supervisors then told him that he was going to operate the service elevator Mr. Obama was going to use. Everything appeared to be going right for Mr. Tate. The previous day he had taken off for his birthday and won $800 playing his birthday digits in the lottery. 

Around 2:25 p.m., the presidential motorcade arrived at the back entrance of the C.D.C. On the elevator ride, Mr. Tate said, the president struck up a conversation.

“He acknowledged me, said, ‘How you are doing?’ He said, ‘What’s your name?’ I told him my name, and he extended his hand, shook my hand, and I said it’s a pleasure to meet him. And I proceeded to escort him upstairs.”

“I was just proud,” Mr. Tate said. “That was a big accomplishment to me.” He said one of the Secret Service agents had told him that it was remarkable that Mr. Obama had talked to him, considering it had taken the president two years to acknowledge the agent. 

Also on the elevator, Mr. Tate said, was “one of the little ladies who is always speaking on the news.” The president’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was with him that day.

After Mr. Obama’s meetings, Mr. Tate took him back down to where the limousine was waiting. After the president got in, Mr. Tate tried to take a picture. He said he had thought nothing of it because he had taken photos of other dignitaries before — including one with Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.

When a Secret Service agent officer waved at him to get back, Mr. Tate said, he headed into the building.

An agent he passed on his way inside said someone was probably going to lose his job because no one was allowed so close to the limousine. Mr. Tate said he had no idea why the agents were so concerned since he did not believe he had disobeyed any of their instructions.

A few minutes later, he said, his bosses angrily pulled him aside. Secret Service agents then took him into a conference room to question him.

“I was upset. I’m nervous because I’m like, I don’t understand what’s going on,” he said. Mr. Tate said the images he had taken on his smartphone were of the limousine and the agents around it — similar to ones that news crews often take. He said the Secret Service had ordered him to delete them; he complied. After the Secret Service interview was completed, Mr. Tate’s bosses took away his C.D.C. badge. The next week he was given his letter of termination.

Mr. Tate said the C.D.C. and the contractor still had not provided him with an explanation about why he was fired. Making matters worse, his 27-year-old son — who had worked at the C.D.C. as a contractor for seven years — was unexpectedly dismissed two weeks after the incident for “downsizing” reasons, Mr. Tate said.

Now unemployed, he looks back with sadness on the day he met the president.

“It was something to tell my mom — if I meet him everything will be complete,” he said. “I didn’t know it was going to be my job.”

G.O.P. hopeful of midterm turnaround; On the eve of elections, conquest of Senate seems likely but far from certain

Republicans entered the final days before the midterm elections Tuesday clearly holding the better hand to control the Senate and poised to add to their House majority, increasing the chances that an even more deeply divided Washington would emerge.

But as voters prepare to select state, local and federal officials — including all members of the House of Representatives and about one-third of the 100 senators — a decidedly sour electorate and a sizable number of undecided voters added a measure of suspense.

‘‘People aren’t yet feeling economically secure,’’ said Representative David E. Price, Democrat of North Carolina and a political scientist. ‘‘And you pile onto that this incredible list of international crises and the concerted Republican effort to hang those problems around the president’s neck, and you have your explanation.’’

The final drama surrounds the Senate, which has been a Democratic bulwark for President Obama since his party lost its House majority in 2010. Republicans need to gain six seats to seize the Senate, and officials in both parties believe there is a path for them to win at least that many.

Yet several key races remained close, polls showed, prompting Republicans to pour additional money into get-out-the-vote efforts in Alaska, Georgia and Iowa. Democrats were doing the same in Colorado and Iowa.

While an air of mystery hung over several Senate races, the only question surrounding the House was how many seats Republicans would add. If they gain a dozen seats, it will give them an advantage not seen since 1948.

‘‘It’s a grim environment,’’ said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Trying to soften the blow, he noted that losses were expected: The party controlling the White House has lost an average of 29 seats in midterm elections in the last century.

Mr. Obama, whose poll ratings have sagged, has kept his distance from the most pivotal congressional races. On Saturday, he addressed a heavily African-American crowd at a Democratic event in Detroit; on Sunday, he was scheduled to speak in Democrat-friendly Connecticut.

Senate Republicans are confident. A party official called Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, on Saturday after running through voting projections to tell him that he would be the next majority leader.

But Republicans conceded that voters were hardly embracing them. ‘‘It’s not as though people have all a sudden fallen in love with Republicans,’’ said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. ‘‘It’s just a loss of confidence in the administration.’’

Other Republicans were restrained in their predictions, given the large number of undecided voters in key races, growing questions about the reliability of polling and respect for the Democrats’ ability to turn out voters.

‘‘We have seen how money, big data and enhanced turnout operations can impact the actual result compared to a poll,’’ said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. He added that he expected Democrats to lose in states won in 2012 by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, and so lose the Senate.

If Republicans in fact won control of both houses of Congress, their road forward would still be challenging. They would have to choose between pursuing ambitious legislative goals that Mr. Obama might veto — changes in tax law; rollbacks of environmental law; tweaks to the president’s signature Affordable Care Act — and smaller-bore initiatives that he might sign. Mr. Obama, too, would be forced to choose between seeking compromise with Republicans and following a path of confrontation.

Mr. Romney said Sunday that even with a Senate majority, Republicans would need some Democratic votes to reach the 60 needed to pass legislation. But he said he would fully expect passage through Congress of legislation on immigration and border security. He also said he expected Mr. Obama would win the authority he seeks to allow him to push trade pacts into law. ‘‘Republicans want him to have that authority’’ in order to boost the broader economy, Mr. Romney said on ‘‘Fox News Sunday.’’

Democrats said they hoped the uncertainty would resolve in their favor.

‘‘I think we’re going to hold the Senate,’’ Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said on ABC’s ‘‘This Week.’’ ‘‘We’ve focused on making sure that we bring our numbers up for voters who didn’t cast ballots in 2010 but voted for the president in 2008 and 2012.’’

But Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that predicting the outcome was unusually hard this year, noting, ‘‘There are countervailing forces on both sides.’’

That was evident in the races for governor as well, with Republicans on the offensive in some liberal states but struggling to defend some of their incumbents in conservative-leaning states.

With only 27 percent of Americans saying the country is headed in the right direction, according to a new CBS News poll, voters are in an angst-ridden mood.

Keith Wilson, 59, a Republican from suburban Denver who said he had sometimes supported Democrats, voted early — for the Republicans.

‘‘It’s a real nervous time,’’ Mr. Wilson said, ticking off the country’s problems and skewering the president. But as he sat at a Denver cafe, he made clear his lack of enthusiasm for Republicans, saying, ‘‘I took the best of the two evils.’’

In their closing ads, some Republicans tried to leverage the public’s unease.

David Perdue, the Republican candidate in Georgia, sought to link his opponent, Michelle Nunn, to Mr. Obama with a commercial showing them together below an image of people in hazmat suits. A narrator warned of ‘‘terrorism and Ebola coming at us from overseas.’’

That race is likely to be decided in a January runoff.

Senate Democrats’ best hope may be their field organization. In the last week, volunteers and staff members have knocked on 1.1 million doors, according to party officials.

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/ben-bradlee-funeral.html] on Thursday about the funeral of Benjamin C. Bradlee, a former editor of The Washington Post who led the coverage of the Watergate scandal, referred incorrectly to the presentation of a folded American flag to his widow, Sally Quinn. The flag was placed on the coffin before it arrived at the Washington National Cathedral and then was removed before the coffin was brought into the nave. That flag was folded and later presented to Ms. Quinn. The flag was not placed on the coffin after the coffin was wheeled outside, then folded and brought back into the cathedral to be presented to Ms. Quinn.

Public service announcements can be useful, particularly if their messages are presented by celebrities. But a catchy song, performed by a starry cast, can be even better. That, at any rate, is the reasoning behind ''Africa Stop Ebola,'' a new song packed with information about what people can do to help stop the spread of the Ebola virus, for which some of Africa's top musicians -- among them the reggae singer Tiken Jah Fakoly, the duo Amadou & Mariam and the rapper Didier Awadi -- have banded together.

The song, which was written by Kandia Kora and Sekou Kouyaté, both of whom are among the performers, is based on ideas and lyrics sketched out by Carlos Chirinos, a professor at New York University who specializes in music, radio and social change. It runs about five and a half minutes, and is packed with warnings (not to touch the bodies of the sick or the dead, to avoid shaking hands) and encouragements (trust doctors, wash your hands).

''We are trying to build the public's confidence in the public health sector,'' Mr. Chirinos said in a telephone interview from London. ''This is where the stature of the artists is so important. They are all recognized and respected in their countries, and we felt that people would listen to them. We are combating myths about Ebola not being real, or that it is something that can be cured by a church, or a traditional healer. There have been cases where health teams have turned up at a village and were turned away, or were stoned -- some people have been killed. So we're trying to send a message, that the only way to stop Ebola is to trust in the health services. And also, that there is hope -- that the crisis can be overcome.''

The first performer to sign up for the project was Mr. Fakoly, who helped round up the other performers, and made sure that they remained on message. (Some of the rappers, in particular, Mr. Chirinos, said, wanted to riff on the subject and move farther afield). It was partly in deference to Mr. Fakoly that Mr. Kora and Mr. Kouyaté wrote the song in a reggae style, although another reason, Mr. Chirinos said, was that ''reggae is truly pan-African,'' and they wanted music that would have an appeal throughout the continent.

Language was another consideration. Mr. Kora, Mr. Fakoly, Amadou & Mariam, Mr. Awadi and the Malian rapper Mokobé all sing their verses in French. But African languages are heard as well. Salif Keita and Mory Kanté sing in Malinké, and Mr. Kanté also sings in Susu, as does Konko Malela. Sia Tolno sings in Kissi; Barbara Kanam sings in Lingala; and Oumou Sangaré sings in Bambara.

The song, which was recorded in studios in Paris and Mali, with final production in London, has been distributed to radio stations throughout Africa.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Blacks, Obama and the Election

President Obama's name won't be on any ballots Tuesday, but he will most certainly be on them in spirit -- a fact that many Republicans are trumpeting and some Democrats are hoping to downplay.

The president is not particularly popular at the moment.

According to Gallup's Frank Newport:

''President Obama's job approval rating is 42 percent. If that holds up until the day before the election, it will be the second-lowest job approval rating for a president before a midterm election going back to 1982 when Ronald Reagan, of course, was president of the U.S. What was the lowest of all? That was George W. Bush's, whose job approval rating was 38 percent back in 2006.''

On a host of issues, foreign and domestic, large and small -- the rise and spread of the Islamic State, the Russian aggression into Ukraine, the federal response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa and the panic here, the crisis of children from Central America crossing our Southern border, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, Obamacare and, of course, Benghazi -- conservatives have attacked. They have used each as yet another plank to construct their government-as-House-of-Horrors argument about a Washington that is mismanaged and out of touch, overreaching but outmatched.

And in their propaganda, this idea of an ineffectual, and ultimately dangerous, government has a face: Obama's. Republicans aren't running on issues as much as running against an individual and an idea; they are running against Obama and the very idea of federal government, except as defined by the most narrow of functions.

Others believe that there is also something else at play, implicitly or explicitly: race. Last week NBC's Chuck Todd asked Senator Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat locked in a tight re-election race, why President Obama has a hard time in her state. One of the reasons she gave was this: ''I'll be very, very honest with you. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans.''

This is the great immeasurable when it comes to this man. Race is a construct that, unfortunately, is woven through the fabric of America. Of course, it has some bearing on our politics, but it's nearly impossible to calculate the degree of the effect for a particular politician. And there can be benefit as well as detriment -- pride and prejudice as counterweights.

As Obama himself told The New Yorker in January: ''There's no doubt that there's some folks who just really dislike me because they don't like the idea of a black President.''

He continued: ''Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I'm a black President.''

As Gallup pointed out last week: ''We find very little change in the support given to Obama among his strongest demographic subgroup: black Americans.'' The report continued, ''In fact, if anything, the trend is for relatively higher support among blacks'' when measuring the gap between black support for Obama and the national average.

The president is now playing to those black folks in a last-ditch effort to help Democrats maintain Senate control, even as much of the betting money is on the real possibility that Republicans will wrest control away.

According to a New York Times analysis of voter data earlier this month: ''African-Americans could help swing elections in Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and possibly Arkansas,'' but, the article says, ''only if they turn out at higher-than-forecast rates.''

So, the president has been making direct appeals to this group on black radio stations across the country. Obama's appeals appear to be working, at least as measured by the composition of early-voting tallies. As The New York Times's Nate Cohn pointed out last week in The Upshot:

''The turnout among black voters is particularly encouraging for Democrats, who need strong black turnout to compete in racially polarized states like Georgia and North Carolina. In those two states, black voters so far represent 30 percent of the voters who did not participate in 2010. By comparison, 24 percent of all those who voted in those states in 2010 were black.''

Black support is particularly important this cycle since support among Hispanic voters is showing signs of weakening. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released last week ''showed that, among Latinos, 50 percent say it doesn't matter who wins the Senate come November. And among those who do think it will matter, twice as many say it would be a good thing (30 percent) if the G.O.P. took over as say it would be a bad thing (15 percent).''

It's not clear whether President Obama can energize enough black voters to save Democratic control of the Senate, but he seems ever more reliant on this group to give him ''the benefit of the doubt'' and ride to his rescue.

An article on Thursday about a legal showdown over whether Maine could impose a quarantine on Kaci Hickox, a nurse who cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, misstated part of the name of the federal organization that established monitoring guidelines for the disease. It is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not the Centers for Disease Control and Protection.

Midterm Memories: Squealing Pigs, Fangate and Cowboy Poetry

Good Monday morning from Washington. With less than 24 hours before the first polls open on the East Coast, Republicans’ chances of winning the Senateare at 69 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/]. Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to New Hampshire for the first time in six years in what seemed like an audition for 2016, Senator Mark Udall got a sliver of good news from the latest mail-in returns in Colorado, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey remains a favorite caricature on “Saturday Night Live.”

Every election season creates stars, ends aspirations and leads to cringeworthy moments endlessly replayed in memory and, sometimes, on TV. Here are some of them.

Start with Representative Bruce Braley, the Senate candidate in Iowa who is this fall’s biggest disappointment for the Democrats. Mr. Braley was considered a sure bet in a state that President Obama carried twice. But then he decided to get snarky about farmers. That’s a sure way to harvest political trouble, especially as his Republican opponent, Joni Ernst, emerged as a star. She has ridden her résumé of mother, soldier and state senator — and an ad about castrating pigs[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Y24MFOfFU] — to a lead.

Shelley Moore Capito’s star power is about to make her the first Republican senator elected from West Virginia since the 1950s. She has family history (her father is former three-term governor [http://www.charlestondailymail.com/News/201304150180]who later went to prison on corruption charges), experience as a popular state representative and congresswoman, and the coal industry on her side in a race that has never been in doubt.

In North Carolina, the Republican candidate for Senate, Thom Tillis, got caught in a legislative brawl over education. And Kay Hagan, the Democratic incumbent, has been a surprise by displaying a toughness and a confidence she does not often show in the Senate.

Gov. Rick Scott of Florida got into a silly debate dispute with his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, over the use of an electric fan[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/16/about-last-night-scott-looks-to-cool-fan-fiasco/]. He has been forced to spend nearly $13 million of his own money for a last-ditch television buy.

And now for something completely different: Larry Pressler, the 72-year-old former Republican senator running a low-budget campaign as an independent[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/politics/senate-contest-in-south-dakota-is-free-for-all.html] in South Dakota. He marched in homecoming parades and read cowboy poetry. But with help from national Republicans, former Gov. Mike Rounds has pulled well ahead in polls. It looks like Mr. Pressler will be riding off into the sunset.

Do the Math: The Probabilities Are Lining Up for a Republican Senate

Nate Silver’s election forecast model was such a phenomenon two years ago[http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/fivethirtyeights-2012-forecast/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias] that it has elevated a class of political prognosticators, who make projections based strictly on the numbers, including a new one of our own[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A6%22%7D].

In the final days of the midterm campaigns, the models are all signaling that a Republican takeover of the Senate is likely.

The most bullish comes from The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dre/politics/election-lab-2014], which says that if you flipped a coin 10 times, it would come up Republican in nine of them. The model least favorable to the party comes from the Princeton professor Sam Wang[http://election.princeton.edu.proxy.bc.edu/], but even that puts the probability of Republican control at 62 percent.

The New York Times’s Senate forecasting model puts the likelihood of a Republican takeover at 69 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A6%22%7D], while Mr. Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.com[http://fivethirtyeight.com/] has it slightly higher, at 73 percent.

At the Huffington Post, Mark Blumenthal’s Pollster.com[http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster] has Republicans with a 75 percent change of wining a Senate majority.

The forecasters have taken pains to say they are dealing in probabilities and not making outright predictions. After all, they say, they are not saying the coin would come up Republican 10 times out of 10. They add another caveat: The polling quality is poor in numerous states.

Clinton’s Visit to New Hampshire Has Air of a Warm-Up

Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed quite at home in New Hampshire on Sunday, first during a rally in Nashua for Senator Jeanne Shaheen, then at unscheduled stops in Manchester and Dover. She indulged in the kind of intimate retail politics that voters there crave.

At the Shaheen rally, Mrs. Clinton reveled in being in “the grandmother’s club” and tossed in ad-libs about C-Span as an antidote for insomnia. She plunged into the crowd to shake hands as Tom Petty’s “American Girl,” a staple from her 2008 campaign, blared over the sound system.

It had the air of a warm-up act.

She also made a point of thanking the state’s voters for lifting her up during what she called “the darkest days” of her 2008 bid.

The state rescued Bill Clinton during his faltering presidential primary campaign in 1992 and threw her a lifeline in 2008. After coming in an embarrassing third in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton pulled out a surprise victory in New Hampshire, made all the more dramatic by an 11th-hour show of emotion[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqGl-pDnYMQ] when discussing her campaign.

On Sunday, she recalled that experience in what appeared to be her first public mention of it in years.

“You gave me my voice back,” she told the Nashua crowd. “You taught me so much about grit and determination. And I will never forget that. So my being here today is because I want to thank the people of New Hampshire.”

Tallies Take Turn in Udall’s Favor, but Maybe Not Enough of One

Senator Mark Udall of Colorado has not had much good news over the last few weeks. But his campaign showed signs of life over the weekend when registered Democrats led by about one percentage point among the 80,000 ballots received on Saturday.

The results represented the acceleration of a trend: Over the last two weeks, the Colorado voters sending in returns have become steadily younger, less Republican and less likely to have voted in 2010.

But despite the new tallies, registered Republicans still led registered Democrats by an eight-point margin over all among the over 1.3 million votes that have been counted. That’s an even larger advantage than the Republicans’ six-point lead in 2010.

Mr. Udall, who is thought to have an edge among unaffiliated voters, might need to reduce the Republican lead to four or five points to have a chance against his Republican opponent, Representative Cory Gardner. For that to happen, he might need another 800,000 ballots to split nearly evenly between registered Democrats and Republicans.

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama is finished campaigning and back at the White House, where he will gather with advisers and hold a private meeting with Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. heads to Boston for the funeral service for Thomas M. Menino, the city’s former mayor, at Most Precious Blood Church.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is campaigning for candidates in Connecticut, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

Senator Rand Paul will fly to seven airfields[http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/30/rand-paul-mcconnell/18187665/] across Kentucky with Senator Mitch McConnell for a final round of campaign rallies.

As David Perdue and Michelle Nunn make last-minute pitches for a Georgia Senate seat, polls show Ms. Nunn is slipping[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/upshot/michelle-nunns-hopes-in-georgia-are-fading-in-final-stretch.html?src=twr&abt=0002&abg=0].

Live From New York, Christie Wins the ‘Saturday Night’ Vote

Of all the ways to tabulate dominion in the 2016 presidential field — swing states visited, dollars raised — perhaps the most underexamined is the “Saturday Night Live” treatment.

Who gets it? And how often?

On that score, it’s hard to compete with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has logged at least four appearances, real or mock, in the past year alone, catapulting him into Sarah Palin territory.

The skits, thick with Italian accents and jokes about weight, have at times proved oddly prescient. “We don’t get mad in New Jersey, we get even,” Bobby Moynihan, who plays Mr. Christie on the show (and grew up in Westchester County, N.Y.), bellowed during an episode in November 2013, a few months before the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge blew up into scandal.

The Christie send-up this weekend[http://www.hulu.com/watch/707962] seemed to encapsulate the national mood about his response in the Ebola crisis. There he was, comparing the tent where he had forced a nurse to carry out her quarantine to “a luxury condo,” by Jersey standards anyway. The nurse emerged as reckless and a little unmoored, cavalierly joking that she had volunteered at a kissing booth to prove she had no symptoms.

The Mr. Christie in the skit also dismissed potential presidential rivals Jeb Bush and Senator Rand Paul as privileged dilettantes who lacked “the stones” to carry out his quarantine.

“Rand and Jeb,” Mr. Moynihan’s Mr. Christie says with disdain. “Christopher. Now that’s a first name.”

Immigration and Obama’s Swoon

My Sunday column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-how-obama-lost-america.html] considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obama’s long year of low approval ratings[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html], which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow. The big four I considered were structural forces (the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s), the essential mediocrity of our “recovered” economy, the continued unpopularity of Obamacare, and foreign policy (where the president’s approval ratings have fallen hard) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administration’s basic competence.

Obviously there are many more factors one could consider, but since I write about the issue[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/caesarism-delayed/]frequently[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-immigration-reforms-open-invitation-to-children-.html?_r=0] I thought I should explain why I didn’t include immigration, another area where the president’s approval numbers have plummeted[http://www.gallup.com/poll/171755/approval-obama-handling-immigration-falls.aspx] as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year.

My reasoning, basically, was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever: I just don’t see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes, white or Hispanic or otherwise, no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment. It’s true that recent events (the child migrant surge, the White House’s strange handling[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/caesarism-delayed/] of its promised amnesty, the climate of Ebola-related anxiety) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago, and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment[http://www.gallup.com/poll/177404/hispanics-approval-obama-down.aspx] with the president. But I still feel like immigration is ultimately more a subplot within the broader categories my column proposed — one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence, one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock — than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the president’s weakened position.

If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities[http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm], immigration is (of course) swamped by the economy, but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues, which I think played a much larger role in undercutting the public’s approval of the president. Likewise, if you look at this feature[http://graphics.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/house-midterm-elections-facebook/] that maps midterm-election conversations on social media, you’ll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already “overwhelmingly represented by Republicans,” rather than dominating the conversation in swing states. Again, that doesn’t mean it’s an inconsequential issue, but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the president’s (un) popularity and his party’s midterm fate.

I could be wrong, of course. If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval_foreign_policy-2821.html] for a day and elevate immigration’s significance a little higher, it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the president’s 2008/2012 majority, and how the Democratic Party’s diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry. That is, up until recently, immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters — because what he was promising to activists (the DREAM Act) was pretty popular and didn’t conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border, because there’s broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters aren’t exactly detail-oriented, and because the G.O.P.’s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue. But once the border started to look less secure (in part, perhaps, because of DREAM-created incentives) and activists started demanding something much bigger (the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer, than walked back), Obama’s two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle … effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies, emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking, and opening space between the so-called “coalition of the ascendant”[http://www.nationaljournal.com.proxy.bc.edu/politics/obama-wins-by-marrying-the-new-democratic-coalition-with-the-old-20121107] and the older, whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in, say, Iowa.

I think this analysis has some merit (not surprisingly, since I just spun it); I just don’t think it proves immigration’s major salience in knocking down the president’s approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle. But we’ll get an interesting test in New Hampshire, where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue; if he pulls out an upset, my estimation of immigration’s impact on Obama’s swoon and 2014’s outcomes will go up. And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obama’s struggles, the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era, in ways that I’m sure I’ll have reason to discuss again.

Health
Emotion Is Not the Best Medicine, Ebola Case Further Shows

Breast cancer, tick bites, gluten, G.M.O.s, artificial sweeteners, shark attacks — and now Ebola.

The news is replete with seemingly endless tales of health threats. Who could blame you for deciding to remain indoors, alone in bed, indefinitely?

That would hardly be a life worth living. But many people do respond to health risks, however small, in ways that take joy out of their lives, all the while falsely believing that they are protecting themselves.

I once wrote that there are as many cancer-causing mutagens in two raw mushrooms as in a serving of peanut butter. It was supposed to be reassuring, but a reader lamented, “Now I can’t eat mushrooms!”

What health risks do you worry about, and how do those concerns affect your behavior? Do you become anxious after learning of a new or increasing threat, no matter how remote?

Or do you ignore the risk of developing a common and possibly life-threatening ailment like heart disease or the flu, resisting protective measures and persisting in behaviors even if they increase your risk?

In an ideal world, people would base medical decisions on an unbiased evaluation of available evidence. But people are often irrational, and many, perhaps most, of their actions are driven more by emotion than facts.

Fear-mongering, intentional or otherwise, is epidemic now that every health threat — real, potential or imagined — can instantly go viral on the Internet. Widely disseminated graphic images of people dying of Ebola, for instance, have greatly enhanced the public’s fear.

But even without instant communication, panic can ensue.

“A child’s risk of getting cancer from asbestos insulation in a school building is about one third the chance of being struck by lightning,” Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum wrote last month[http://libgen.org/scimag7/10.1056/NEJMms1409003.pdf] in The New England Journal of Medicine. “Nevertheless, in 1993, frightened New York City parents agitated for asbestos removal from schools.”

Although many experts endorsed containment, not removal, as a saner and safer solution, fear prevailed. Billions of dollars were spent on asbestos removal that should have been spent on education. And removal probably increased — not decreased — children’s exposure to airborne asbestos.

“Many medical decisions involve considerable uncertainty and complex trade-offs,” wrote Dr. Rosenbaum, a national correspondent for the journal. And while it is widely believed that better educating and informing prospective patients will keep them from acting irrationally, she cited studies that clearly show otherwise.

Sometimes, in fact, more information can heighten people’s concerns and prompt them to act in ways unsupported by evidence.

For example, one study used solid data and graphic images[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/early/2014/02/25/peds.2013-2365] to reassure parents that vaccinating children against measles can be lifesaving and is not linked to autism. The effort “not only failed to increase vaccination intent, but also cemented some parents’ conviction that there is a link between vaccines and autism,” Dr. Rosenbaum wrote.

“People did not respond as expected,” Dr. Rosenbaum said in an interview. “Many got even more freaked out.”

Research by Dan Kahan, who heads the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale University, indicates that people pick and choose evidence that reinforces their sense of who they are[http://ssrn.com/abstract=995634] and the groups they belong to. That partly explains the persistent belief among some parents in a link between vaccines and autism or in the risks of genetically modified foods.

“We don’t process negative events, only positive ones. Anyone who doesn’t get Ebola falls beneath the radar,” Dr. Rosenbaum said. “No one wants to hear, ‘Calm down.’ ”

As shown with Ebola, people are more fearful of things they can’t control, however remote the risk may be.

In her book “Communicating Health Risks to the Public: A Global Perspective,” Dawn Hillier wrote of genetically modified foods: “The public views G.M. foods as riskier to health than natural carcinogens, because they believe they have no control over their exposure to the G.M. foods they consume.”

“I think one of the biggest problems in the face of fear is how unforgiving we are,” Dr. Rosenbaum said. “When we’re scared, we have this zero-tolerance policy. How many times has the C.D.C. had to deal with an Ebola scare in the U.S.? Never. So it’s not going to go perfectly.

“We have to forgive little bumps along the way. We can’t ask people not to be scared, but we can ask them to forgive.”

In another journal article[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1314638] that preceded the Ebola outbreak, she wrote, “The big, the dramatic and the memorable occupy far more of our worry budget than the things that kill with far greater frequency: strokes, diabetes, heart disease.”

In the interview, she said, “Even though you’re far more likely to die of cardiovascular disease, you’re inclined to fear Ebola more.”

Current efforts to have patients participate in medical decisions must “go way beyond conveying information,” she added. “People interpret information according to their preconceived notions.” Their sense of risk is often determined less by facts than by their feelings and emotions, she said.

Emotions also strongly influence people’s desire to be screened for various cancers.

As Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice pointed out last year in JAMA Internal Medicine[http://archinte.jamanetwork.com.proxy.bc.edu/article.aspx?articleid=1754986], patients have been taught to think there are no harms in cancer screening: “It’s always good to know. It is just about gathering information. Of course you want it. It is a brain-dead decision.”

But all screening tests have benefits and risks that should be considered before deciding to undergo them. The most serious risks are overdiagnosis of a condition that turns out not to exist, and overtreatment for conditions that would never have compromised the patient’s survival.

Yet even knowing this, many — perhaps most — people still opt for screening.

In an editorial last April in JAMA[http://jama.jamanetwork.com.proxy.bc.edu/article.aspx?articleid=1853137], Dr. Joann G. Elmore and Dr. Barnett S. Kramer emphasized the need for physicians to discuss with patients their values and personal philosophies: “Does the patient think that less is more, prefer to minimize his or her interactions with the medical care system, or want to do anything that might yield some benefit, even if it comes at a cost or with potential risks?”

This is the first of two columns on perceptions of health risks. Next week: screening for breast cancer.

Health
The Capacity to Treat, and to Spread

Most infectious diseases reinforce that appealing “them and us” schism that so often deludes health care professionals. They, our patients, have it, their contacts out in the world are at risk for getting it, and we, their caregivers, are safely removed from the whole thing. Not Ebola: We have met the patients, and they are us.

Many well-meaning commentators have tried to draw parallels between Ebola and the other infamous infections of the last few decades, but these analogies are not particularly valid. AIDS destroyed communities but proved minimally infective in health care settings, particularly once proper precautions were identified. Likewise tuberculosis: Doctors and nurses do contract it in the line of duty, but a vast majority of cases come from elsewhere.

Not true of Ebola, the health care virus extraordinaire. It appears minimally transmissible among humans save in settings when friends, relatives or licensed professionals care for the ill.

This pattern forces a completely new examination of health care workers’ rights and responsibilities to infected patients and to the community at large. The old generalities simply do not apply.

And in fact, those old generalities never helped much, anyway. Back in 1986, with the AIDS epidemic a mere five years old, I devoted most of an academic year to a study[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/3309386] of the history and philosophy of doctors’ responsibilities to contagious patients. The project took so long mostly because, oddly, very little had been written about the subject, stretching back over centuries of medical practice.

Those were the days when AIDS patients were shunned in hospitals and offices by frightened doctors who just didn’t want to get involved. Those of us who did get involved were convinced that we were maintaining a proud, centuries-old professional tradition.

It turns out we were completely mistaken: There never was a coherent professional tradition of caring for contagious patients. From antiquity on, when plague descended, some doctors helped out and others quickly disappeared. “If you are asked to treat a patient with no chance of recovery,” wrote a 14th-century Italian surgeon to his students during the years of bubonic plague, “say that you will be leaving town shortly and cannot take the case.”

In the wake of AIDS, some professional organizations rewrote their behavior codes[http://www.ama-assn.org.proxy.bc.edu/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion9131.page] to specify that it is unethical to avoid possibly contagious patients. Nonetheless, the medical profession in its vast and varied splendor still contains those who run toward contagion and those who run away, and that is probably just the way it will always be.

But it should be understood that those who choose to run toward Ebola are running toward an entirely different set of obligations and constraints. Their choice is a laudable moral decision incorporating two mundane but inescapable facts: In the case of Ebola, caretaking is a job of the highest risk, and doctors and nurses are innately terrible at even the basics of infection control.

This second truth has been proved over and over in modern hospitals, where some infectious organisms are transmitted like wildfire from patient to patient by hospital staff members. The antibiotic-resistant staph called MRSA[http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/mrsa-infection/overview.html] and the diarrhea-causing microbe C. difficile[http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/stool-c-difficile-toxin/news-and-features.html] are among them.

It has taken us decades to understand the spread of these bacteria in hospitals, and to intervene with relentless policing of hand washing and use of protective clothing. For doctors and nurses, the press of other things always seems far more urgent and important than the scrubbing of the hands and orderly removal and disposal of contaminated clothing.

Still, our world has slowly evolved. No one dances through rounds in the intensive care unit anymore without a lot of hand sanitizing. We finally understand that when it comes to care-related infections, we are as much the problem as we are the solution, and all the washing and drying and dressing and undressing are simply a part of the job.

The same understanding is essential for Ebola care. Caretakers always have responsibilities to their own patients, but this infection loads them with significant responsibilities to the wider community.

The big one, obviously, is not to spread the infection. A close second is to do our best to tamp down the hysteria surrounding it.

How best to do that? Here we all appear to disagree. Ultimately, the ethicists and philosophers will have to parse out the theory, and politicians will have to sort out the specifics of quarantine. Scientists will weigh in with their careful risk assessments, always using those careful words “negligible,” “minimal” and “infinitesimal” that annoy patients so much.

But it seems to me that health care workers will do themselves a big favor by taking ownership of the situation and acknowledging that choosing to be part of the solution to this infection, sadly, turns us into part of the problem. Wouldn’t it be sensible and politic for us all gracefully to accept the fact that a terminal three weeks of limited liberty is necessarily a part of this particular job?

Portraits of Those Braving Ebola

Hours from the nearest city, in a clearing in the Liberian jungle, a small army of doctors, nurses, sprayers and gravediggers is battling the Ebola virus at a clinic run by an American medical charity. Weeks of sustained, hard-hitting coverage by the photographer Daniel Berehulak[http://www.danielberehulak.com] chronicled in detail the urgent, grim and unrelenting work. But after more than two months, how could he find a new way to tell the story?

David Furst was wondering exactly that a few weeks ago, too.

“I wondered what was possible,” said Mr. Furst, The New York Times’s international picture editor. “You want people to understand and to care. There is only so much people can take. The pictures Daniel put out were heart-wrenching, with this great synergy of beautiful composition, exquisite photography and this terrible content. It tears you apart.”

Mr. Furst’s “aha” moment came randomly one night, when he spotted a poster-size ad that showed two people, one in profile. The directness of the image caught his eye and his imagination. Perhaps readers could encounter the people inside the Liberian clinic one-on-one, in a style where the viewer’s gaze fell directly on the subject, from doctors to survivors. When he proposed it to Mr. Berehulak, the photographer quickly agreed.

The result is “Braving Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/31/world/africa/photos-of-workers-and-survivors-braving-ebola-at-a-clinic-in-liberia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news],” in which a cross-section of the many souls whose lives have been touched by the disease — whether as medical professionals, support staff or patients and family — tell their stories. The images — studio portraits against a white background — have a certain power, conveying by turns faith, determination, exhaustion and, yes, joy.

“Having people open up and be honest with me with feelings and emotions was a huge privilege,” Mr. Berehulak said. “I hope I was able to capture some of the anguish, some of the hope, some of the struggles that all these people were going through.”

Although he and his editor had quickly agreed on the approach, it took more time to sort out the logistics of building a studio in the middle of the jungle. “Portrait projects of this scale tend to be conceived ahead of time with assistants, lighting technicians, lights, backgrounds and people to help you corral subjects,” Mr. Furst said. “We had none of that.”

Mr. Berehulak found an empty office he could turn into a makeshift studio. Lights were bought at a hardware store in Monrovia, a five-hour drive away. For a seamless background that would allow him to make full-length portraits, he returned to Monrovia and bought “the biggest white sheets in all of Liberia,” which he then taped together.

Some workmen from the clinic helped him set up the studio, where lights were hung from the rafters and on stands, and scraps of timber stretched out the sheets. After some tests, Mr. Berehulak discovered that even more lights were needed, so another run was made to Monrovia.

Not much cajoling was needed to get people to pose. They were eager — and proud — to tell their stories, and it showed in their faces. Mr. Berehulak also interviewed them, and they were able to recount moments big and small of their recent experiences.

“I think they were very, very proud of the job they were doing, and everyone seemed to think there was a national responsibility to fight Ebola,” Mr. Berehulak said. “Doing what they could to fight Ebola and get it out of Liberia.”

The project was challenging on many levels, not least of which was that he carried it out while still photographing the continuing stories at the clinic for the daily newspaper. And while he took every precaution to protect himself, Mr. Berehulak was sometimes beset by stress and depression.

Yet he also found the project life-affirming, and life-changing.

“There are incredible, brave people doing incredibly brave things every day,” he said. “There are certain jobs that people deem to be more important than others. But at the Ebola treatment unit, whether the person was a waste handler, doctor or nurse, the role everyone played was as important as each other. Everyone played a crucial and vital role.”

The Times reported on Oct. 11 that:

The American military has had trainers in Liberia for years to help reinvent the country’s army. Now, President Obama’s decision to send American troops to build Ebola treatment units has added another layer to these already complex ties.

On Thursday afternoon, four Marine V-22 Ospreys landed at Liberia’s international airport in a thunder of noise. General Williams, the American commander here, was making plans to buzz Monrovia with the $70 million aircraft, counting on the visual and audio impact to tell Liberians that they are not alone in the Ebola fight.

A Tepid Thumbs Up Is the Best Many Can Muster for Cuomo

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] gets strong marks for his aggressive response to the Ebola virus. But some voters are unsettled by what they view as his back-room, bullying style and by a federal investigation into an anti-corruption commission he established.

Few New Yorkers say the governor inspires them in the way that the mere mention of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/mario_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per], still does. At least, they say, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not embarrassed the office, unlike his immediate predecessors.

New Yorkers have had four years to size up the policies, personality and governing tendencies of Mr. Cuomo, a 56-year-old former state attorney general and Clinton administration housing secretary. And by all measures, they appear ready to give him a comfortable re-election victory on Tuesday over his Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive.

Still, New Yorkers’ relationship with their governor is hardly warm or enthusiastic, despite broad agreement with his policies, according to more than three dozen interviews conducted over the past week in New York City and on Long Island.

Maybe a collective shrug, or a begrudging thumbs up, would be a more apt description. “I don’t like Cuomo — I just think he’s an opportunist, and I haven’t seen him take a stand that’s risky at all,” said Steve Fromhart, a 47-year-old freelance writer, as he dropped off his children at school in Park Slope, Brooklyn. “But I guess I’ll vote for him. It’s a sad state of affairs.”

While several people said they were unlikely to vote at all, only a handful who said they had backed Mr. Cuomo in 2010 said they would vote for someone else this time.

Fortunately for Mr. Cuomo, most of those interviewed knew nothing about Mr. Astorino. One even thought he was a she. A few people did hold an unfavorable view of Mr. Astorino, however, thanks to an attack ad[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/nyregion/cuomos-ad-faults-astorino-on-health-care-for-older-adults.html] featuring him joking that Medicaid[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] recipients could live on soup if their dentures were no longer covered.

Then again, a good number of people who spoke at length about Mr. Cuomo (as opposed to the dozens more who said they were indifferent, or uninformed) also struggled to identify any of his specific policies or actions.

On Sunday, both the governor and Mr. Astorino spent much of their time north of the city. Mr. Cuomo visited Baptist churches in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon in Westchester County before holding a rally in West Haverstraw, in Rockland County. He chronicled his efforts to reform state government, criticized Mr. Astorino as intolerant and urged voters to turn out as if the race were close. “People shouldn’t get complacent,” he said.

Mr. Astorino wooed black and Hispanic voters at churches in New Rochelle and the Bronx, where he urged congregants to vote based on values, rather than party, and accused Mr. Cuomo of attacking his faith. “When he attacks me for being a Christian, he is attacking all of you,” Mr. Astorino said at Heavenly Vision Christian Center in the Bronx, where he spoke in Spanish to the largely Latino congregation.

In conversations with voters last week, though, one thing that people seemed to agree on, from Rockville Centre in Nassau County to Pelham Parkway in the Bronx to Chelsea in Manhattan, was that the Cuomo name remained golden.

In Forest Hills, Queens, Alita Kleiner, 66, a retired legal secretary, and Bruce Brenner, 71, a retired city employee, said that even though they were Republicans, they liked Mr. Cuomo’s father as a forceful, yet open-minded leader. And while both criticized the younger Mr. Cuomo for ignoring his liberal challenger in the Democratic primary, Zephyr Teachout, during the Labor Day parade[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/nyregion/cuomo-finally-and-briefly-hits-campaign-trail-on-eve-of-democratic-primary.html] in September, they said one rude act did not detract from his overall performance.

“Cuomo has the experience, he has the family background — reminds me of the Kennedy family,” Mr. Brenner said. “Astorino, I don’t like. I don’t think he’d be right for New York. We’re Republicans, but we’re not ultraconservative.”

“His brother is good on TV,” Ms. Kleiner added, referring to Chris Cuomo, the CNN news anchor.

The governor benefited, too, from having succeeded David A. Paterson (labeled “hapless” by one person) and, before him, Eliot Spitzer (whose fall from grace still stings for many).

“I think he’s the best,” said Om Verma, 51, an immigration paralegal in Hollis, Queens, Mr. Cuomo’s childhood neighborhood. “He’s smart, he’s educated, and his father is great.” He added, shaking his head, “If you compare to other governors, well, you saw what that guy was doing in Washington, D.C.”

Mr. Cuomo’s brash style, though, polarizes many New Yorkers. “Initially, I had a good impression of him — he’s a Democrat, I’m a Democrat,” said Jamie Pagirsky, 22, a recent graduate of the State University of New York at New Paltz who lives in Rockville Centre. “But over time, that changed.”

Mr. Pagirsky said that his view of the governor had been sharply affected when Mr. Cuomo spoke on campus last fall, and a friend, Jaklin Levine-Pritzker, wore a T-shirt saying “NY Says No to Fracking.” A gruff and beefy Cuomo aide tried to eject her from the lecture, then demanded[http://oracle.newpaltz.edu/gov-cuomo-comes-to-campus/] that she turn her T-shirt inside out, because of fears that she would be too disruptive, according to Mr. Pagirsky and Ms. Levine-Pritzker, who confirmed his account. She ultimately was allowed to stay, but the incident irked her classmates. And when she told Mr. Pagirsky about it, the image stuck with him.

“We were all in disbelief — Is this real? Is this happening to my close friend? Is this how his administration operates?" he said. “This is supposed to be a healthy democracy, and this was completely obstructing that process. After that incident, I was just completely turned off by him.”

Many of those interviewed also cited the Moreland Commission, the anti-corruption group set up by Mr. Cuomo that is now the subject of an inquiry[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html] by federal prosecutors.

Julia Beardwood, a branding and marketing executive from Park Slope, said Mr. Cuomo had been a “disappointment” because “the whole corruption issue seems to be something he dealt with inappropriately.”

Ms. Beardwood said she also did not like the governor’s reluctance to embrace the prekindergarten expansion that was the signature issue of her former neighbor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. As a result, she said, she voted for Ms. Teachout in the primary because she seemed “more honest and less political.”

Still, she said she would vote for Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday “because I don’t have a better option.”

“In the long run,” she added, “I hope that he will see the light.”

Such criticisms were not universal, especially among New Yorkers who said they admired the bluntness of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, both Republicans.

Lisa Catanzarite, 38, a home health care worker from Gravesend, Brooklyn, said she liked what she called Mr. Cuomo’s “iron fist” persona, and rolled her eyes when asked about the Moreland Commission. “Find me a clean politician,” she deadpanned.

Ms. Catanzarite was one of dozens interviewed who praised Mr. Cuomo’s decision, with Mr. Christie, to impose tougher quarantines on people returning to New York and New Jersey after coming into contact with Ebola patients. Many people said they felt the governor should not have backtracked in the face of pressure from medical professionals and the White House.

Maureen Anzalone, 63, a health care eligibility liaison in Pelham Parkway, shared that opinion, and even invoked Kaci Hickox, the nurse placed under quarantine in Newark.

“He gave in a little to the nurse about the Ebola hoopla — she should’ve bitten the bullet,” said Ms. Anzalone, 63, speaking about a block from the campaign headquarters of State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democrat. “But I’m mostly satisfied. I think he’s a little rough around the edges, like, in a ‘Don’t mess with me’ kind of way.”

With Ebola dominating recent headlines, no other topic came up as much during the interviews. A few voters mentioned education, with people split over Mr. Cuomo’s aggressive support for charter schools[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/charter_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Some mentioned small businesses and the economy.

One retired Hollis resident, Barry Lowe, who used to run a window-display business in Manhattan, also criticized Mr. Cuomo’s trip to Israel this summer. Mr. Lowe said the governor should have been more evenhanded in the way he addressed the long-running conflict there. “He didn’t act as if the Palestinians[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] were going through terrible times,” he said.

“I was going to vote for him, but I’m not going to now,” said Mr. Lowe, 70.

Only a handful of people mentioned one of Mr. Cuomo’s hallmark achievements: the legalization of same-sex marriage[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/same_sex_marriage/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

In Chelsea, the political base of one of Mr. Cuomo’s most ardent supporters, Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, Eddie Jacobs, a 48-year-old financial services salesman, said he did not care for the governor’s Ebola response (an overreaction, Mr. Jacobs said) or handling of the Moreland Commission (an overreach).

But he recalled an event, hosted by Empire State Pride Agenda, at which Mr. Cuomo promised to legalize same-sex marriage[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/same_sex_marriage/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — and noted that the governor had succeeded. “I have a very warm spot in my heart because Cuomo pushed through gay marriage,” he said. “That’s good enough for me.”

One thing that was clearly working for Mr. Cuomo, the interviews showed, was his campaign advertising. Several voters mentioned that they liked his television commercials, particularly a recent one[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/nyregion/cuomos-family-aiding-push-for-female-voters.html] featuring his daughters and longtime girlfriend, Sandra Lee, in which the governor pledged to fight for women’s issues.

To Fred Carbo, owner of Fortunata’s Fine Foods, in Rockville Centre, the ad encapsulated much of what he had come to appreciate about Mr. Cuomo.

He said he liked Mr. Cuomo’s commitment to help women fight for a fair wage. A resident of Howard Beach, Queens, who had a food business in Breezy Point that was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], Mr. Carbo said he was also reminded, with the second anniversary of the storm, of what he said was the “good job” the Cuomo administration had done helping him and his neighbors recover.

And now, as the owner of a business in Nassau County, just down the block from the campaign headquarters of State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican, Mr. Carbo said he was reminded of the governor’s efforts to cap property taxes. “I think he’s tried his best,” Mr. Carbo said. “How do you please everybody? You can’t."

Correction: November 7, 2014, Friday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Monday with an article about some New Yorkers’ less-than-enthusiastic support for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo misspelled, in some editions, the surname of a retired city employee in Forest Hills, Queens, who said he supported the governor. As the article correctly noted, he is Bruce Brenner, not Breener.

Ebola Cure Delayed by Drug Industry’s Drive for Profit, W.H.O. Leader Says

The leader of the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] criticized the drug industry on Monday, saying that the drive for profit was one reason no cure had yet been found for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

In a speech[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/dg/speeches/2014/regional-committee-africa/en/] at a regional conference in Cotonou, Benin, Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the organization, also decried the glaring absence of effective public health systems in the worst-affected countries.

At least 13,567 people are known to have contracted the Ebola virus in the latest outbreak, and 4,951 have died, according to the latest data[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137424/1/roadmapsitrep_31Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1] on the W.H.O. website, which was updated on Friday. All but a few of the cases have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Dr. Chan said her organization had long warned of the consequences of greed in drug development and of neglect in public health.

In the midst of the Ebola crisis, she said, these “two W.H.O. arguments that have fallen on deaf ears for decades are now out there with consequences that all the world can see, every day, on prime-time TV news.”

The Ebola virus was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire, in 1976. But because it was confined to impoverished African countries, Dr. Chan said, there was no incentive to develop a vaccine until this year, when Ebola became a broader threat.

“A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay,” she said. “W.H.O. has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see for themselves.”

Dr. Chan reiterated her contention that the Ebola crisis “is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times.”

Efforts to find a cure have been stepped up in recent months as the disease has spread, with a small outbreak in Nigeria and isolated cases in Mali, Senegal, Spain and the United States. At an emergency meeting in September, the United Nations Security Council declared the Ebola crisis a threat to international security.

Officials at the W.H.O. and at other public health authorities reported on Oct. 24[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/business/ebola-vaccine-trials-planned-for-december.html] that they hoped to begin trials of vaccines as early as December, and that it should be known by April whether they are effective.

Researchers have been testing two experimental vaccines in healthy volunteers in the United States and in other countries outside the main outbreak region in West Africa. One has been developed by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline, and the other by the Canadian government and NewLink Genetics.

Testing on humans of at least five other vaccines could begin in early 2015, W.H.O. officials have said.

Doctors, nurses and other health workers have been especially susceptible to infection because of the way the disease spreads through contact with fluids. In Sierra Leone on Monday, the authorities reported that a fifth local physician had died of the disease, news agencies reported.

The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, speaking on Monday at a news conference in Vienna[http://www.un.org.proxy.bc.edu/sg/offthecuff/index.asp?nid=3711], warned against what he called overly strict international restraints on the movement of health workers who are fighting Ebola.

Some countries and some states in the United States have quarantined health professionals returning from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, have gone further[http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/571491/20141103/ebola-update-canada-visa-ban-africa-nations.htm#.VFeyacmnFBk], temporarily halting the issuance of visas to citizens of the worst-affected countries.

The best way to stop this virus is to stop this virus at its source, rather than limiting for work, or restricting the movement of people or trade.” Mr. Ban said. He called Ebola health workers “extraordinary people who are giving of themselves — they are risking their own lives.”

Soldiers Faulted in Deadly Crackdown During Ebola Protests in Liberia

MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberian security forces fired with “complete disregard for human life” into crowds of civilians protesting a blanket Ebola quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html?_r=0] over the summer, killing one teenager and seriously injuring another young man, according to the first independent investigation of the deadly clashes.

The findings directly contradict repeated assertions by the security forces, including the American-trained Liberian Army, that soldiers fired shots only into the air to enforce the quarantine of residents, which had been imposed against [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html]the advice[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html] of international Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] experts and the government’s own health officials.

A 15-year-old boy bled to death after suffering bullet wounds to both legs during the protest. The investigation — conducted by the Liberian Independent National Commission on Human Rights, but not yet made public — concluded that unless “it was a magic bullet,” a round “shot in the air cannot fall from above and shatter somebody’s legs.”

Liberian and foreign critics say that the mishandling of the quarantine is one of several missteps that have deepened public distrust[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/world/africa/ebola-liberia.html] of the government, a rift that has helped fuel the spread of Ebola since the outbreak began months ago.

Tens of millions of dollars from international donors to help bolster Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s health system and other sectors in recent years remain unaccounted for, according to Liberian officials and diplomats here, weakening government services that then quickly buckled under the strain of the Ebola outbreak. In one case last year, $13 million from the European Union earmarked for maternal disappeared for months until reports appeared in the local news media.

Now, in the middle of the Ebola crisis, diplomats here say, critical supplies of health care equipment and food from overseas are often disappearing at the county level. As a result, clinics are often short of gloves, protective suits and other supplies, according to Liberian and foreign officials. Some Liberian health officials say they have had to buy protective suits on the black market at inflated prices to do their jobs.

Fearing the misuse of donations, some foreign governments and international organizations have resisted directing money into a government trust fund to fight Ebola, diplomats and local officials say, despite appeals from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per], a Nobel Peace Prize winner whose legacy is being tested[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/liberias-ebola-crisis-puts-president-in-harsh-light.html] by the crisis. Instead, donors often give directly to the international charities fighting the virus here.

“The intensification of the spread of Ebola is a failure of governance,” said Tiawan Gongloe, a human rights lawyer who served as Ms. Johnson Sirleaf’s labor minister and solicitor general. “The way President Sirleaf has governed over the years has caused people not to have trust in government. So when government says left, they go right. They don’t believe that government means well for them.”

Lewis Brown, the government’s information minister, said that accusations of corruption against the government were exaggerated. All international donations have gone toward improving the country’s health care system, he said, but he argued that they were no match against the worst recorded Ebola outbreak in history.

The new report on the shootings in August, which has been submitted to Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, is based on interviews with 40 people, including witnesses and officials present during the disturbances. Both defense and police officials refused to cooperate in the investigation, according to the commission, which was originally created as part of a peace agreement to end Liberia’s 14-year civil war.

The inquiry comes as larger questions about the rule of law in Liberia are being raised, especially in the face of the Ebola crisis. Human rights groups and other critics have expressed growing dissatisfaction with government corruption and the human rights record of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf in recent years.

Human rights groups have expressed fears of an overreach of authority after Ms. Johnson Sirleaf declared a state of emergency in August, which has allowed her to restrict people’s movements, impose curfews and shut down businesses. Last month, lawmakers rejected her request for more emergency powers.

Christiana Tah, who resigned as justice minister last month, said political interference had undermined Ms. Johnson Sirleaf’s second term, which began in 2012. In an interview, Ms. Tah said that the executive branch had increasingly stripped the Justice Ministry of its authority over the country’s security forces, including the police.

Ms. Tah said that progress after the civil war in strengthening the rule of law was being rolled back.

“It’s like you’re building a sand castle,” she said. “When we were little kids, we lived by the beach and we built a sand castle, and someone, just as you put that little star at the top, someone comes and kicks the whole thing down.”

Mr. Brown, the information minister, said that the country’s current record on human rights must be measured against that of the past.

“At no point have we strengthened human rights protection” more than “we have today,” he said.

In the early months of the Ebola outbreak, many Liberians said they believed that the government was exaggerating the scale of the epidemic, or making it up altogether, to collect money from international donors. Many did not take necessary precautions against Ebola as a result.

In this atmosphere of deep skepticism, residents of West Point, a vast slum in the capital, Monrovia, vandalized an Ebola holding center that the government had opened in their neighborhood without warning in mid-August. A few days later, residents reacted with fury when the government imposed the quarantine, throwing rocks at soldiers and police.

Shakie Kamara, a teenager who was caught in the riot, was shot in both legs after going to buy tea and bread for his aunt. He bled to death several hours later after receiving minimal treatment at two major hospitals that had been buffeted by the Ebola outbreak.

A board of inquiry, established by the president and made up only of officials from the security forces, issued a report a few weeks later that absolved the security forces in the West Point shootings. It said that soldiers had fired only into the air, though it acknowledged that Shakie most likely died of gunshots. Despite promises to do so, the president has not released the report to the public.

The injuries of another resident, Titus Nuah, 22, who suffered bullet wounds to the abdomen, were “as a result of a ricochet from warning shots fired” by soldiers, the report from security officials found, without explaining how shots fired in the air could ricochet in such a way.

In a separate interview, Mr. Nuah said that a “soldier man fired straight” at him during the disturbances.

Human rights groups have said that a thorough investigation was impossible given the makeup of the board. Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Ziankahn, the Liberian Army’s chief of staff, said in an interview that disciplinary boards were now looking into the West Point episode and that their reports should be completed in two to three months.

“I’m embarrassed by what happened in West Point, and every good leader should be embarrassed by such things,” he said. “But that’s not just the end of the Armed Forces of Liberia. Those are just one of the bends in our rails.”

In West Point, a group of young people has been organizing protests demanding justice for Shakie. About 30 members of the group recently gathered in the Capitol Building, waving thin pieces of cardboard with handwritten slogans that declared Shakie’s life as valuable as anyone else’s.

“The president promised us justice, but we haven’t seen anything yet,” said the group’s leader, Abraham Keita, 16.

Shortly after the shooting, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf visited Shakie’s uncle and aunt in West Point. A presidential aide handed the couple $2,000 in an envelope containing new $20 bills, they said, adding that they later divided the money among a dozen relatives.

That was a good start, they said, but added that the family wanted $2 million in compensation. Eva Nah, Shakie’s aunt, said the damages would directly improve their lives, and that seeking justice seemed like a fantasy.

“I don’t got money to fight the government,” she said outside the family home in West Point.

Mr. Keita, the leader of the young activists, was listening to the conversation. “The family should be seeking justice because there is something called precedent,” he said.

Shakie’s uncle, Emmanuel Aballo, grew visibly annoyed. “You people want justice,” he said, "but to the family, whether we get justice, that boy will not come back out of the ground. The family, we only need damages. We don’t need that other thing.”

Pests in the Apartment, but No Ants in the Pants

The devastation of the climate, the ravages of capitalism, the marginal status of theater — that’s a lot to cram into a single South Brooklyn apartment. “Buzz,”[http://buzztheplay.com/] the debut play by the novelist[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/books/review/28MCINER.html?pagewanted=all] and critic Benjamin Kunkel, takes place in the loft where Tom (Trevor Kluckman) struggles to write a play, while his girlfriend, Sasha (Jeri Silverman), awaits the birth of their baby.

This absurdist, allegorical show begins promisingly, as we enter an actual loft space and watch several figures in Hazmat suits undrape the furniture. Their presence conjures thoughts of Ebola and bedbugs (which terrifies New Yorkers more?), but they are merely the exterminators Sasha has hired to purge the apartment of droning flies. Once Tom, and then Sasha, enter — both, puzzlingly, in their underwear, as is the rest of the cast — and begin to speak, interest ebbs.

Mr. Kunkel, a wry and gifted critic and a founding editor of the serious-minded magazine n+1[https://nplusonemag.com/], joins the storied pantheon of good and great prose writers without much flair for drama. For every Chekhov, there’s a Henry James, who gave us the famously bad “Guy Domville,” or a Virginia Woolf, who wrote the lavishly unfunny comedy “Freshwater,” and lots more like them.

Mr. Kunkel’s lines read pretty well on the page, but live, under Lian Walden’s direction, they sound false and flat and a little pompous. Some of this is intentional — this is a play that frequently admits its own unreality, and Tom is admittedly pretentious. “Do you mind if I’m sententious for a second?” he says to an interviewer. Usually, he doesn’t ask.

Broadly, Mr. Kunkel’s pesky flies represent all the things we put from our minds — climate change, war abroad, inequality at home — in order to enjoy our reasonably comfortable theatergoing lives. And, of course, this disjunction (the severity of these crises, the poverty of both collective and individual responses) is worth exploring. But the dialogue doesn’t compel, and the world of the play doesn’t purposefully cohere or intentionally fracture. Jejune experiments with form diminish Mr. Kunkel’s thoughtful content.

Instead of redress, we get only undress.

“Buzz” continues through Nov. 22 at Tom and Sasha’s Loft, 255 Douglass Street, at Third Avenue, Gowanus, Brooklyn; buzztheplay.com.

Fighting an Epidemic With Hands Tied

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of government and civilian workers of all stripes, and thousands of military personnel, have braved the terrifying prospect of infection to respond to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] emergency in West Africa. And thousands more will be needed for an effort that is expected to go well into 2015.

But will they go? Beyond the obvious dangers to health care workers — more than 270, mostly African, have died so far this year — a host of obstacles stand in the way of anyone who may want to help stem a catastrophe.

Foremost among them, perhaps, is that with no central agency in charge, volunteers often cannot be placed when and where they are most needed.

The affected African countries have crippling weaknesses in their health systems. Doctors Without Borders, a nonprofit humanitarian group, led the initial response, but it is not big or powerful enough to do the entire job. The World Health Organization failed to heed the group’s cries for earlier help. The United States has lately taken the lead, but it, too, responded late.

The Ebola emergency contrasts sharply with previous disasters — hurricanes, cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], tsunamis, earthquakes — in which experienced volunteers quickly joined relief efforts.

“Ebola is scary,” said Dr. Susan L. F. McLellan, an infectious disease specialist at Tulane University in New Orleans, who cared for patients in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] for nearly three weeks in August and has battled previous outbreaks of other diseases in Africa and Haiti.

But it is made scarier, she said, by an epidemic of misinformation that leads many to refuse to be part of teams that would care for a potential Ebola patient even in the United States.

Misinformation has “put huge blockades in our ability to respond, and is part of why the United States is not recruiting that many volunteers,” Dr. McLellan said.

Many change their minds after “talking to someone who provided hours of clinical care a day, had her skin exposed, sat with Sierra Leoneans, ate food they prepared, and not only lived to tell the tale but also saved some lives,” Dr. McLellan said.

Politicians have added further difficulties by forcing workers returning from West Africa into isolation or quarantine. Volunteers who do not become ill until they return — as happened to Dr. Craig Spencer in New York City — face public criticism instead of praise for their altruism. And friends and fellow employees are shunning even the doctors, nurses and workers who are caring for him[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/bellevue-workers-worn-out-from-treating-ebola-patient-face-stigma-outside-hospital.html].

Louisiana officials have told scientists returning from West Africa, including many experts on Ebola, not to attend a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in New Orleans this week.

To be sure, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent more workers to the Ebola-stricken countries than for any other emergency in its 68-year history, and the Pentagon is sending at least 4,000 troops to provide hospital beds and organizational support. But other countries have refused to send health workers. When Australia offered to donate $2 million to Doctors Without Borders instead of committing experienced doctors and nurses, the group turned down the money, saying it needed the people more.

“Countries like Australia with the capacity to make a real difference on the ground,” it said, “are looking at each other to take responsibility and are refusing to send their own personnel to help.”

Misinformation aside, Ebola poses a legitimate fear of the unknown. Many workers going to infected areas do not know how great a danger they face, said Dr. William H. Foege, an epidemiologist and former director of the C.D.C. A vast majority of volunteers have no experience with Ebola or other so-called hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg and Lassa, so they face a lethal disease they have never dealt with and for which there is no vaccine or proven therapy.

The decision to volunteer to go to West Africa requires finding a proper balance among valor, emotions, personal sacrifice, scientific evidence and common sense. Beyond conquering the fear of becoming another Ebola victim, prospective volunteers must overcome a formidable list of hurdles, some of them rarely discussed.

Dr. Peter Piot[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/health/there-before-ebola-had-a-name.html], dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has assured full salary for staff who go to West Africa, and 250 individuals from his and other institutions have volunteered. But even though his school has solved insurance and safety issues, only eight have gone so far because of a lack of available positions, he said. He is hoping more can go later.

Recruiting organizations screen applicants because they want only qualified workers, not individuals simply seeking adventure, and need to devise orderly schedules to avoid having too many people with too little to do.

Because each stint usually requires several months, potential volunteers must seek colleagues who are willing to work extra shifts in a hospital or clinic or teach their classes throughout their absence.

Moreover, working in poor countries with rudimentary health facilities is vastly different from working in high-tech hospitals in rich countries. So most volunteers must go to a training site to take courses in how to work with Ebola. That takes time, and the travel can be costly.

In the United States, many volunteers come from hospitals, medical schools[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medical_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and universities. But administrators of many of these institutions, worried about liability, are reluctant to let employees go to West Africa — in part because they are heeding the C.D.C.’s warnings against nonessential travel to Ebola areas.

Critics say even well-meaning administrators have put up new hurdles that discourage volunteers. For example, academic and hospital officials want to know where their employees are going, why, and who will reimburse the employer for the lost time. Faculty and staff who go may not get paid.

Volunteers are urged to be sure their life insurance policies are paid up. Also, there can be uncertainties about whether their health insurance[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] will pay for evacuation and medical care if they develop Ebola.

Health workers who understand administrators’ concerns still contend that some are exercising undue caution for public-relations reasons to assure employees, students and parents that their institution is safe from Ebola.

“We have not seen this kind of caution before,” said Dr. Michael H. Merson, the founding director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University.

Many people ask why foreigners should respond to an epidemic far from home, even if imported cases may significantly threaten people in their own country. The tradition of doctors’ and nurses’ accepting personal risks in caring for patients seems to be a casualty in the growing commercialism of medicine and academia.

In the mid-1960s, I served in the C.D.C.’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, which responds to outbreaks, but only if invited by domestic state and foreign governments. Back then, and in recent decades, I have heard many leaders advocate creation of a similar international group, a kind of SWAT team ready to respond immediately to an emergency anywhere.

But the proposals have fallen on deaf ears — for lack of funds, disagreements over where such teams should be located, and because the potential need for new or amended laws to allow them to enter countries where they may not be welcome. The terror of Ebola may change that situation.

A nurse who fought efforts by Maine to quarantine her at home after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa reached an agreement[http://courts.maine.gov/news_reference/high_profile/hickox/order.pdf] on Monday with the state that largely leaves her free to travel. The agreement requires the nurse, Kaci Hickox, 33, to be monitored daily for Ebola symptoms and to coordinate travel with public health officials until next Monday, the end of the 21-day incubation period after her last possible exposure to Ebola. The agreement extends a temporary order issued Friday by Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere, the chief judge for Maine District Courts, who had rejected a request by Gov. Paul LePage’s administration that Ms. Hickox stay off public transportation, avoid public gatherings and stay three feet away from other people. Ms. Hickox arrived in New Jersey from Sierra Leone on Oct.

24 and was quarantined in New Jersey before being released to Maine early last week.

Question:

Can I get Ebola from a toilet seat?

Answer:

In general, the disease risk of toilet seats is overrated, but you probably can get Ebola from a toilet seat.

The risk is not so much the seat itself as the whole bathroom. But not just any bathroom. The risk would come from a bathroom that an Ebola victim in an infectious phase has recently used.

The field hospitals run by Doctors Without Borders in Africa are laid out so that patients who definitely have Ebola never share toilet facilities with staff members or with patients who are only ''possible'' cases.

Ebola victims often lose control of their bowels and excrete copious amounts of diarrhea. They also vomit heavily. Those liquids are highly infectious. Touching them and then touching one's eye or mouth or inside the nose could transmit the disease. Urine also carries some risk, but viral loads in urine are not nearly as high as those in vomit and feces.

For workers in Ebola field hospitals, one of the riskiest acts is touching their boots or shoe covers. The Doctors Without Borders disrobing protocol calls from them to slosh their feet in a bath of chlorinated water and then remove their boots with a bootjack, so as to never touch them with their hands.

In modern buildings, toilets that flush loudly and powerfully are a risk in themselves. The flushing create a mist of droplets that splash onto the face and hands or may contaminate stall surfaces.

As Ebola Rages, a Look at What Might Have Been

As the Ebola crisis unfolded in West Africa over the spring and summer, public health experts began calling for speedy international intervention to stop the spread of the disease.

The crucial factor in containing Ebola, these experts say, is to keep infected patients isolated to reduce transmission. If that does not happen, the number of cases shoots up rapidly.

These charts are based on an epidemiological model created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using figures from Liberia and Sierra Leone, two of the countries hit hardest by the epidemic. In the third, Guinea, case counts have been unreliable.

Large-scale intervention did not begin until late August and early September, and the C.D.C. model suggests that was too late to stop the epidemic from killing tens of thousands of people -- and perhaps many more -- by the end of the year. Had successful interventions been started much earlier, the total number of cases would have remained below 5,000.

''In this case, lack of speed kills,'' said Martin Meltzer, the lead author of the C.D.C.'s paper.

At the end of August, the World Health Organization set out an ''Ebola Response Roadmap,'' with a goal of isolating 70 percent of patients within two months after the start of intervention. The C.D.C. model uses a less ambitious timeline of five months. (Isolation means being treated safely in a hospital, Ebola treatment unit, or home or community setting; it also requires that the dead be given a safe burial.) For intervention that began in August, the predicted current rate of safe treatment in isolation is between 40 and 50 percent.

Because the situation in the three affected countries has been difficult to assess, the model, which was first published on Sept. 26, continues to be updated as new information is gathered. The C.D.C. estimates that the true number of cases may be more than twice the reported counts.

CHARTS: The C.D.C.'s prediction, based on a so-called compartmental model, assumes an average incubation time of six days and an infectious period of six days. To estimate future cases, the percentage of patients in different stages of treatment was adjusted in 30-day periods to simulate different interventions. The New York Times adapted the model and intervention scenarios for both Liberia and Sierra Leone to start at different dates, and combined the estimated cases from both models. The jump in recent reported cases is a result of a recounting. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) (CHARTS BY ALBERT SUN AND HANNAH FAIRFIELD/ THE NEW YORK TIMES)

On Election Day, Keeping an Eye on the Early Races

Good Election Day morning from Washington. With only hours left in the campaign, the Republicans’ chances of taking the Senate have inched up to 70 percent[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/], a number of races are ending in a snarl, and the totals in New Hampshire and North Carolina are likely to be a guide to the results. Get the popcorn ready for a night of twists and turns as the votes are tallied.

After all the money, attack ads, debates, rallies, missteps, surprises and that rare discussion of policy, it’s time to count votes and (perhaps) put an end to the suspense.

But how to decipher the results of 36 races in the Senate, 435 in the House and 36 for governor?

Here’s some guidance: In the early going, keep a watch on North Carolina, where the polls close at 7:30 p.m., and New Hampshire, where they shut down a half-hour later.

If Senator Kay Hagan loses in North Carolina, the Democrats’ firewall against a Republican majority will be crumbling, and if New Hampshire goes in Scott P. Brown’s favor, then it is probably all over and Republicans are likely to be in for a very good night. Democrats held leads in recent polls in both of those states, and victories there would put Republicans well on their way to the net gain of six seats they need to rule the Senate — with much better terrain yet to come.

If Democrats win both, things get a little trickier. Races will have to play out across the country, with a particular emphasis on Colorado and Kansas (polls closing at 9 p.m. Eastern time) and Iowa (10 p.m.). A Republican victory in all three probably means minority status for Democrats and a celebration for Republicans.

For the diehards, Alaska’s polls are open until 1 a.m. Eastern time, but the vote count could take days. It’s also possible that the Senate’s makeup will depend on runoffs in one or more states.

Republicans will keep their majority in the House, but a handful of Democratic seats could flip in New York and New Hampshire. A string of such early victories in the Northeast could push Republicans toward their largest majority since the 1920s.

A Miserable Night for President Obama? Reagan Had One Just Like It

Tuesday’s elections could win President Obama a mention right beside Ronald Reagan in the history books.

But only if things go as badly as so many polls suggest.

Mr. Obama could end the night with the rarest kind of midterm setback: one that costs his party more seats in the Senate than in the House.

That’s happened only once before in modern history. That was in 1986, when the Republicans lost eight seats, leaving Mr. Reagan saddled with a Democratic Senate for his last two years in office. (Those years included, among other things, the rancorous hearings that led to the rejection of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court.)

It’s a rare statistical trick to suffer bigger losses in the Senate than in the House: All 435 House seats are on the ballot, but just 36 of the 100 Senate seats are being decided on Tuesday.

But that’s by the design of the Constitution’s framers. By giving senators six-year terms and staggering the elections, they hoped that the relative stability in the Senate would temper what Alexander Hamilton called “the amazing violence and turbulence of the democratic spirit.”

That was before cable TV. And better gerrymandering.

The two parties have become so good at redrawing of House district lines that The Cook Political Report lists just 22 races as toss-ups.

Senate seats can’t be gerrymandered. And while regional differences persist, political polarization has substantially nationalized Senate contests. This year, 10 of them — seven in states the president lost in 2012 — are toss-ups. If Republicans sweep, Mr. Obama is likely to have a historic night like no other modern president except Mr. Reagan.

– John Harwood

Best Offense Can Be Good Defense, Especially Before a Big Vote

With Democrats bracing for big losses, some party leaders were sending a not-so-subtle message ahead of Tuesday’s election: “It wasn’t me.”

There was Representative Nancy Pelosi’s team, announcing that the House Democratic leader had raised more than $100 million for the party this election cycle. (Pelosi aides helpfully pointed out that her fund-raising total since joining the leadership ranks was now nearly a half-billion dollars.)

The Clintons have also been keeping busy, and they have not been shy about it.

Former President Bill Clinton’s staff released his complete campaign schedule last week, which showed that he remained a prolific political surrogate, headlining more than 20 fund-raisers and get-out-the-vote rallies.

Not to be outdone by her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton, through her office, later released a comprehensive list of her “midterm engagements” since September. They included nearly 30 fund-raisers across the country.

Mrs. Clinton’s intentions in 2016 may remain cloudy, but her ability to draw crowds and donations is abundantly clear.

As Carter Campaigns, a Cry Goes Up, ‘Oh, Look, It’s John Lewis’

Shay Blackwell wanted to make sure she was 100 percent sure the guy in the blue blazer and cowboy boots was really running for governor of Georgia.

“What’s your name again?” she asked.

So Jason Carter told her.

Mr. Carter, a 39-year-old state senator, may be the grandson of Jimmy Carter, and he may be running a competitive campaign against Gov. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent. But Mr. Carter is not quite a household name yet in Georgia, and that demi-celebrity status trailed him on Monday as he cast for last-minute votes at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market, a barnlike building in central Atlanta full of lunch counters, butchers and produce vendors.

“Excuse me, who is that?” asked Don Yu, the owner of D&J Market, a butcher shop. “That’s Jimmy Carter’s grandson? Ahhh! O.K.”

Mr. Carter was joined by Representative John Lewis, the Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, who had no trouble being recognized. (“Oh, look, it’s John Lewis!” Ms. Blackwell exclaimed after meeting Mr. Carter.)

And while some people approached Mr. Carter for a selfie or an introduction, many others acted as though he was just another distraction, along with the neck bones and pig’s feet.

“I hope y’all will remember to vote tomorrow,” he said to Mr. Yu.

“I liked your granddaddy,” Mr. Yu replied.

What We’re Watching Today

Voters will be casting their ballots across the United States. Find your polling place[https://www-google-com.proxy.bc.edu/search?q=where+do+i+vote].

President Obama is spending Election Day at the White House, where he will hold meetings with Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. He will also meet with his public health team to discuss the response to the Ebola outbreak.

Secretary of State John Kerry gives a speech on relations between the United States and China at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies at 9:30 a.m.

John Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner who has been working to rehabilitate the agency, will talk about his progress at a 10:45 a.m. speech in Washington.

Implied Insults, Mangled Metaphors and Other Closing Day Quotes

So much for ending the campaign season on a high-minded note.

The final hours were marked by insults and crocodile tears, and the apologies and strained explanations that usually follow them.

What, for example, did Greg Orman actually mean when he lumped former Senator Bob Dole into what he said was a “clown car” of surrogates[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/11/03/in-email-to-dole-orman-explains-the-difference-between-a-clown-and-clown-car/], stumping the state on behalf of Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican? Whatever it was, Mr. Dole, now 91, didn’t like it and wasn’t afraid to say so. That led Mr. Orman, running as an independent, to write a personal note explaining that he did not intend to insinuate that Mr. Dole was a clown.

In New Hampshire, the state’s Republican chairwoman, Jennifer Horn, got a little carried away as she rallied fellow conservatives[http://nhjournal.com/republicans-ride-their-victory-bus-to-manchester-rally/] against the Democrats: “This is our time,” she said. “We need to crush it and push their heads under over and over and over again until they cannot breathe anymore.”

Perhaps she was taking the “wave election” metaphor too far. Democrats accused her of inciting violence.

The most unusual war of words involved retiring Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa. He drew cries of sexism when he said that Joni Ernst, the Republican who hopes to take his seat, resembled the pop star Taylor Swift.

Ms. Ernst protested. He apologized. Ms. Swift could not be reached for comment.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Power in the balance.

It’s Election Day, and the magic number for Republicans is six.

That’s what they need to take control of the Senate[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/]. But possible runoffs in two states[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/us/senate-control-may-be-decided-by-runoff-votes-in-louisiana-and-georgia.html] could delay the final result.

• Running up the score.

In the House, the Republicans have 233 of 435 seats[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/upshot/election-results-2014-the-house.html], and they are trying to reach their post-World War II high of 246.

• Ruling the statehouses.

They rode into office on the Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] wave in 2010, but the governors of Florida[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/a-florida-race-strains-wallets-and-allegiances.html], Kansas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/us/conservative-experiment-faces-revolt-in-reliably-red-kansas.html], Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/us/before-bigger-stage-walker-must-win-wisconsin.html] all face difficult re-elections today.

Here’s a state-by-state look[http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/state-by-state], and where you can vote[http://www.vote411.org/ballot#.VFiK-Icl5hk].

• Ukraine’s shaky truce is in jeopardy.

The Ukrainian president is holding[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29891556] a crisis meeting of his security chiefs today.

He said that a rebel-held vote in the country’s breakaway regions jeopardized “the entire peace process.”

• Strong words on Ebola.

The World Bank president said today[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/04/health-ebola-asia-idUSL4N0SU23520141104] that Asian countries had not contributed enough to the global fight against the deadly virus.

A day earlier, the leader of the World Health Organizationsaid[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/world/africa/ebola-cure-delayed-by-drug-industrys-drive-for-profit-who-leader-says.html] the drug industry’s drive for profit was one reason that no vaccine had been found yet.

In the U.S., a nurse who fought efforts by Maine to quarantine her at home reached an agreement[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/us/maine-nurse-reaches-agreement-on-travel.html] with the state that leaves her largely free to travel.

• Court watch.

The Supreme Courthears arguments today[http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/argument-preview-how-much-control-do-agencies-have-over-what-whistleblowers-may-disclose/] in a case about how much government whistle-blowers can disclose, with a focus on national security leakers.

And the government is looking[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/11/04/us/politics/ap-us-nsa-surveillance-court.html] for a favorable ruling at a federal appeals court in Washington, after a lower court found that the National Security Agency’s telephone surveillance program was illegal.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are flat. European shares are lower.

Markets closed mostly mixed in Asia but surged nearly 3 percent in Japan.

• Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, reported[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/technology/alibaba-earnings-first-report-since-ipo.html] today a jump in profit in its first earnings announcement since its initial public offering in September.

• You can now a buy a Disney film from Apple and watch it on your Google device, and vice versa, for the first time[http://www.cnet.com/news/google-partnership-with-disney-streams-its-catalog-to-android/].

• The European Unionsharply lowered[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/business/international/european-union-growth-economy.html] growth forecasts as member states showed weak economic performance.

• Accusations made against a managing director at the investment bank Jefferies as part of a divorce filing have become[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/sex-and-drug-claims-at-investment-bank-draw-risky-retort/] the talk of Wall Street.

• The new chief of Britain’s electronic spy agency has accused[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/4a35c0b2-636e-11e4-9a79-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3I5XI2Vz0] U.S. technology companies of creating “the command and control networks of choice for terrorists.”

NOTEWORTHY

• Millionaires go shopping, for millionaires.

As of 12:01 a.m. today, all 30 Major League Baseball teams can start making offers to the 136 available free agents.

Pitchers are the center of attention. The Detroit Tigers’ Max Scherzer, who turned down a six-year, $144 million offer from his team last spring, could get $175 million. The Oakland Athletics’ Jon Lester and the Kansas City Royals’ James Shields are also expected to command more than $100 million.

• She loves us, she loves us not.

Taylor Swift, whose “1989” is on pace to become the biggest-selling album of 2014 (by far), said she’d be going[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/taylor-swift-announces-world-tour-and-pulls-her-music-from-spotify/] on a world tour starting on May 20.

But her label ordered Spotify, the subscription streaming service with 40 million users worldwide, to remove all of her songs, in an effort drive up sales.

• Branching out.

Bruce Springsteen wrote a picture book for grown-ups based on his song “Outlaw Pete.” It’s published today, with Frank Caruso illustrating the tale of the title criminal, who starts out in diapers.

• An election alternative.

If politicians are not your idea of superheroes, maybe you’ll want to check out “Marvel: 75 Years, From Pulp to Pop!”

Tonight’s special takes a look at the 75-year history of Marvel, the global force in comic books, TV shows, video games, animation and blockbuster films. (9 p.m. Eastern, ABC)

BACK STORY

Why is America’s Election Day always on a Tuesday?

The answer has to do with horses and buggies.

In 1845, Congress decided to standardize elections and pick one day for everyone in the nation to vote.

Sunday was out: Many people spent the day at church. But Monday was also a problem. It might take as much as a full day of travel for rural residents to reach their polling locations.

Congress settled on Tuesday as the earliest day in the week that most citizens would be able to make it into town.

Now that travel time isn’t an obstacle, some activist groups — Why Tuesday?[http://www.whytuesday.org/] is one — have lobbied for weekend voting as a way to increase turnout.

But researchers say it’s not that simple. A 2012 government study[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-69] documented a host of obstacles to weekend voting, and concluded that alternative voting times and methods rarely had a major effect on turnout.

When Spell-Check Can’t Help

Here’s another batch of word mix-ups, both familiar and novel.

Some are pure homophone errors, including a rather embarrassing “no” for “know.” Other examples show confusion between similar words with related, but not identical, meanings. Add them all to your better-check-twice list.

•••

“When you lose and that becomes consistent with what you’ve been known for, it does mean something to illicit hope, put your team in position where fans feel that success is what should happen, and that’s big,” Farmer said.

“Illicit” is an adjective meaning unlawful or improper. We wanted the verb “elicit,” meaning evoke or draw forth.

•••

If European leaders were expecting him to be humbled, they had another thing coming. Not only did he exude his usual confidence, but Mr. Putin even told an off-color joke about the anatomical difference between a grandpa and a grandma at a late afternoon news conference.

It should be “another think” — that is, “If you think such-and-such, you have another think coming.”

This colloquial expression is frequently rendered incorrectly. In his Modern American Usage, the normally buttoned-down Bryan A. Garner speculates on a surprising culprit: “The heavy-metal band Judas Priest may share some blame for the widespread acceptance of the variant wording,” he declares, thanks to this song[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtuoFv4dcwM] from 1982.

•••

One demonstrated that supermarkets could sell better ingredients; the other opened the door to non-junkie fast food.

The adjective formed from “junk” is “junky.” “Junkie” is slang for an addict.

•••

Snapchat says it is not adverse to working with partners and hopes to do more of that, but it does not invite them to reverse-engineer its service in order to find and exploit its flaws.

Make it “averse” (as we later did, but not before a sharp-eyed reader noted it). These adjectives are frequently confused. “Adverse,” meaning unfavorable, usually describes things — for example, “adverse conditions.” “Averse,” meaning opposed, usually describes people (or in this case, a company).

•••

[Online summary] The 2014 Major League Baseball postseason demonstrates more than ever the dominance of cable in televised sports and the affect it has had on both viewers and viewership numbers.

One of the most persistent mix-ups. “Affect” is usually a verb, meaning “have an influence on”; here we wanted the noun “effect.”

•••

A second thundered against his party as no-nothings who didn’t understand his state.

Ouch. “Know-nothings,” of course.

•••

It was her truest confidante, her son, Zach, and she told him only because she was furious with him.

As we’ve noted often, and as the stylebook points out, the male form is “confidant.”

•••

Onstage, he knelt to serenade me. Were it not for his vice grip, I would have bolted. To steady myself, I focused on his warm brown eyes; I’d never been so intimate with a man.

There was a slight hint of vice in this essay, but for the tool that holds things tightly, the preferred spelling is “vise.”

 In a Word

This week’s grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.

•••

But the C.D.C. do not have the power to police internal public health matters, so it is up to the states to carry out the policy, and it is far from clear that they will fall in line.

We wanted “does,” the singular form. From the stylebook:

C.D.C. for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As an abbreviation, treat it as a singular; otherwise, the name is plural.

•••

The board also released the results of its review of another Saudi detainee, Mohammad al Rahman al Shumrani, whom it determined should remain in indefinite wartime detention.

Make it “who,” the subject of “should remain.” Picture the attribution phrase “it determined” as parenthetical: “Mohammed Mohammad al Rahman al Shumrani, who (it determined) should remain in indefinite wartime detention.”

•••

The federal government on Monday tried to take charge of an increasingly acrimonious national debate over how to treat people in contact with Ebola patients by announcing guidelines that stopped short of tough measures in New York and New Jersey and were carefully devised, officials said, not to harm the effort to recruit badly needed medical workers to West Africa.

This 60-word lede stuffs too much into one sentence.

•••

The Ottawa attack heightened fears that Canada, a strong ally of the United States in its campaign against the Islamic State militant group convulsing the Middle East, had been targeted in a reprisal, either as part of an organized plot or a lone-wolf assault by a radicalized Canadian.

What comes after “or” should be parallel to what comes after “either.” Make it “either as part of an organized plot or as a lone-wolf assault by a radicalized Canadian.”

•••

In the past year, the dancer Misty Copeland has published her memoir, “Life in Motion,” a children’s book, “Firebird,” and has starred in a popular video for Under Armour about rising above adversity.

The three elements do not form a parallel series. The simplest fix is to add “and” before “a children’s book.”

•••

Among the reasons that Budler, who is nicknamed the Hexecutioner, has shot to relative fame in South Africa is because he has won a lot — he is 26-1 with nine knockouts — and because he has the ability to deliver devastating punches, which is not necessarily the norm in his division.

Another tangled and overstuffed sentence. Also, “because” is redundant after “reason.” The stylebook says this:

reason (n). Both because and why are built into the meaning of reason. So avoid the reason is because and the reason why. Write The reason is that the mayor got more votes and She found out the reason the mayor won. Usually a phrase like reason why the decision was made can be shortened to reason for the decision.

•••

Still, prosecutors asked the Hirsch’s first lawyer, Joseph Potashnik, to waive the CARFA timeline.

Referring to members of the Hirsch family, the plural possessive is “the Hirsches’ first lawyer” (later fixed).

•••

That was likely an electronic hiccup in the gearbox. Restarting the car solved the problem, and it never reappeared, fortunately letting a friend and I continue with a rollicking top-down exploration of the Hudson Valley.

As the object of “letting,” this should have been in the objective case: “a friend and me.”

•••

To start things off right at Thiago Castanho’s laboratory of Amazonian culinary revelations, take a sip of his signature cocktail, which blends cachaça, made from sugarcane, and jambu, an herb with analgesic properties whose flowers look like yellow and pink eyeballs.

Our preferred dictionary prefers two words: “sugar cane.”

•••

The social network now has over 1.3 billion users — a fifth of the planet’s population and has become a force in publishing because of its News Feed, which has been increasingly fine-tuned to feature high-quality content, the kind media companies produce.

We need a second dash, after “population.”

•••

As for George W., he has not been especially close to Jeb, who is seven years younger. By all accounts, the former president is closer to their younger brother, Marvin, who visited him in the White House or at Camp David regularly.

It would have been nice here to tell readers how old the three brothers are; we never say.

•••

The Fed also may update its plans for short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since late 2008, to emphasize that the timing of a first increase depends on the strength of the economy.

Better to put the adverb between the parts of the verb: “may also update.”

•••

While its revenue and ratings still lag far behind billion-dollar behemoths like the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball, M.L.S., which opens its postseason this week, has minted its own crop of multimillionaire players, has established attendance records and is set for an infusion of television money starting next year.

Block that metaphor. Minting refers to the stamping or fabrication of metal objects, rather far removed from the agricultural reference to crops. Better to cut this unnecessary phrase altogether: “has its own multimillionaire players,” etc.

•••

I intended to ride this train off the grid for almost the next five hours with a mission: to liberate a book proposal that I have resolutely avoided finishing.

The phrase “off the grid” has become overused and tired, and combined with “ride this train” results in an unintended image of the car going off the tracks. Sequence of tenses would also seem to call for “had,” not “have.”

•••

What fist annoyed him was the fact that the referee, Phil Dowd, missed two United defenders grabbing two Chelsea players in the penalty box.

Our ragged edges were showing here with the spell-check-resistant typo. And “the fact that” is almost always an unnecessary phrase.

•••

Stirring excitement that a new generation of Kennedys was entering the family business, Mr. Kennedy entered the race for the open seat in April.

This sentence could have been rephrased in a way that was less repetitive and padded.

•••

The incident occurred just more than a month after a man got over the fence and through the door of the White House, sparking an investigation of the Secret Service and the resignation of the director.

The more natural idiom is “just over a month.”

•••

This autumn, Mr. Uwayesu enrolled as a freshman at Harvard University on a full-scholarship, studying math, economics and human rights, and aiming for an advanced science degree.

Where did that hyphen come from?

•••

Early on, the scientists were able only to retrieve tiny snippets of ancient genes.

For the proper emphasis, place “only” where it belongs: “able to retrieve only tiny snippets.”

•••

[Web headline] Pieds-à-Terre Owners Dominate Some New York Buildings

No need for the plural in this modifier (we would say “apartment owners,” not “apartments owners”).

•••

[Picture caption] The motorcycle that Peter Fonda might have rode in the movie “Easy Rider” sold at auction Saturday for $1.35 million.

Ugh. “Might have ridden,” of course.

•••

Eighteen months later, twice as many subjects in the plant-caring, decision-making group were still alive than in the control group.

Should be “twice as many … as.”

•••

The minute you use one of them, the more sense it makes to begin using several others.

This doesn’t track. This construction is intended to have two comparatives, e.g., “The more often you use one of them, the more sense it makes …”

•••

When not prowling the newsroom like a restless coach, encouraging his handpicked reporters and editors, he sat behind a glass office wall that afforded him a view of them and they a view of him.

We wanted the objective case, “them,” parallel with “him.” (This was fixed in time for late print editions.)

•••

Correction: October 23, 2014

An article on Tuesday about Apple’s earnings misstated Apple’s revenue for its 2014 fiscal year in some copies. It was $182.8 billion, not $182.8 million.

Are we double-checking all million and billion references? Given Apple’s size, it should have been obvious that this was wrong.

•••

The police have said little to explain what could have led Mr. Vann to kill seven women, perhaps all within the past year, and remain undetected until last Friday.

This doesn’t really track. ​Maybe “… and how he managed to remain undetected until last Friday”?​

On Election’s Eve, G.O.P. Is Confident, but Voters Are Sour

WASHINGTON — The most expensive midterm campaign in American history stumbled into Election Day on Tuesday with voters’ interest at record lows and their divisions deep over what they want their government to do in President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s final two years.

Republicans entered the final hours confident they will gain at least six seats and take control of the Senate, but polls showed several races too close to call. Likely runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana, along with late vote counts in Alaska, Colorado and Iowa, will mean Senate control may remain in doubt beyond Tuesday night.

The same could be true for governors’ races in Colorado, New Hampshire, Georgia and Florida.

The uncertainty about the outcome is a fitting match for the mood of the nation. A slowly but steadily improving economy — with six months of strong growth, gasoline below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years and substantial deficit reduction — has not translated into broader optimism. Voters are more inclined toward blame than credit. Instead, they are seemingly worn down by economic struggles and late waves of panic, chiefly about the threats posed by the Islamic State and the possible spread of Ebola.

Polls show voter interest in the election substantially lower than four years ago. The real intensity has been generated by the deluge of broadcast television ads — more than 1.5 million have aired during this election cycle, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising. .

And candidates in both parties have done little to inspire the electorate. Unlike midterms in 1994 and 2006, when the party out of power made strong gains, Republican candidates did not carry a defined platform into this election, nor did they campaign on many policy specifics. Democrats spent months playing down if not denying their support for the president’s agenda.

Mostly, both sides trucked in umbrage and outrage. In Iowa on Monday, the Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst jumped on the comments of the retiring Democratic senator she hopes to replace, Tom Harkin, who said he did not care “if she’s as good looking as Taylor Swift.”

“I am offended,” she said as she barnstormed through Iowa on the last full day of campaigning. “To be compared to Taylor Swift, I guess that’s O.K., though; I mean she’s a very successful woman. But if my name were John Ernst and I were a guy he wouldn’t be saying those things about me.”

For their part, Democrats in New Hampshire pronounced themselves appalled after the state’s Republican chairwoman, Jennifer Horn, announced in Manchester: “This is our time, we need to crush it. We need to grab it, run with it, push their heads under over and over again until they cannot breathe anymore, until the elections are over on Tuesday night and we’ve won it all.”

In Kansas, another extremely close race, Greg Orman, an independent, knocked on doors in the Kansas City suburbs just miles from where Senator Pat Roberts, the embattled Republican incumbent, rallied his voters.

But the closing day of the campaign was dominated by a debate over whether Mr. Orman had called the state’s venerated former senator, Bob Dole, a clown when he called a Roberts campaign rally featuring the 91-year-old elder statesman and other Republican luminaries “a Washington establishment clown car.”

Tuesday will be a test between the Democrats’ well-honed voter targeting and turnout machine and a Republican ground game playing catch-up. The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that 58 percent of Republicans in late October said they were interested in the campaign, statistically identical to the 57 percent of Democrats.

At the same time in advance of the Republican wave in 2010, 70 percent were interested. In 2006, before the Democratic wave, two-thirds of Democrats professed interest, well above today’s level.

At a Republican rally at an aircraft hangar near the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, the enthusiasm for the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney seemed as loud or louder than for any of the homegrown candidates and dignitaries, including Gov. Sean Parnell and Dan Sullivan, who hopes to oust Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, on Tuesday.

Pat Fleming, 75, a retired medical radiology technologist, held a Dan Sullivan for Senate sign to her chest, but asked about the outlook for Tuesday, she mostly talked about somebody else.

“Whatever it takes to get rid of Harry Reid,” she said, referring to the Senate majority leader from Nevada, who is deeply unpopular in Alaska.

The appeal of something new is weighing down incumbents from both parties. When Mr. Orman arrived with his wife in a suburb of Kansas City on Monday afternoon, one woman pulled into her driveway, hopped out of her car and walked to Mr. Orman saying, “Hey, you’re not Pat Roberts.”

For all the money and nail-biting races this year, the outcome is not likely to result in a drastic change of policy. Mr. Obama will still be in office to defend his health care law[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and other accomplishments against Republican efforts to reverse them. And Republican leaders in Congress will have to wrestle with political crosscurrents that could affect their ability to confront the president or to work with him.

At least three Republicans — Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida — are considering runs for their party’s 2016 presidential nomination. They will be tempted to move to the right to appeal to Republican presidential base voters.

Mr. Cruz, in an interview with The Washington Post, said this weekend that a Republican-led Senate should hold Mr. Obama accountable for his policies, and argued that his colleagues should aggressively pursue a repeal of the president’s signature health care law.

Politically, Democrats are banking on that sort of agenda for their own comeback.

“If Republicans take the Senate and expand their margins in the House, no one in their right mind would believe that Ted Cruz and the Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] House Republicans will say, ‘Now is the time for us to compromise,' ” said Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “They’re going to double down.”

At the same time, many more Republicans elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 but standing for re-election in Democratic or swing states in 2016 will probably want to tack to the center. Freshman Republican senators from New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio and Missouri could have very different political imperatives than their counterparts running for the White House.

“Quite frankly, going into 2016, the Republicans have to make a decision whether they’re in control or not in control,” Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in an interview with CNN on Monday. “Are they going to begin to allow things to happen? Or are they going to continue to be obstructionists? And I think they’re going to choose to get things done.”

Democrats will face their own soul-searching after controlling a Senate that for two years has defined dysfunction.

“The moderate and middle of the Democratic Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has really been challenged” by this campaign, said Senator Joe Manchin III, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia.

Elections 2014: Only the Polarized Are Actually Polarized

According to the conventional wisdom, American politics and politicians are more polarized now than they have been since the Civil War, reflecting a growing chasm between Democrats and Republicans. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong? There’s no question that politicians are more divided; just look at their voting records. But what if the polarization of politicians reflects a common mistake about Americans — a widely held but false belief that Democratic and Republican voters are more divided than they actually are?

Yes, Democratic and Republican voters are more divided today than at any time in recent memory. Polls show that, compared with just a few decades ago, Democrats and Republicans disagree more about the role of government in providing basic services. Democrats and Republicans dislike one another more, and have fewer social connections with one another. Democrats and Republicans even distrust the opposing side to protect basic health and welfare, illustrated in the deep divisions over what to do about Ebola and terrorism.

But here’s the thing: As strong as political polarization is, it’s not as big as people think. Democratic and Republican voters are far less polarized than people believe them to be.

We analyzed[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2186601] national election-season survey data, dating from the early 1970s, that asked representative samples of Americans for their stances on partisan issues. For instance, people reported how much they thought that government should provide in increased services such as health and education, even if it meant increased government spending, or that government should reduce services in order to reduce spending. Not surprisingly, Democrats wanted government to spend more to do more, whereas Republicans wanted government to spend less and do less.

The survey also asked respondents to estimate the stances of other Democrats and Republicans. Over the years, people consistently overestimated how much Democrats supported increased government services and spending, and they overestimated how much Republicans supported reduced spending and services. In other words, people thought Democrats and Republicans were more polarized than they actually were.

The basic pattern of overestimating polarization between Democrats and Republicans occurred across a range of issues, on everything from spending on defense to providing aid to racial and ethnic minorities, to guaranteed government health care. Taken together, Americans estimated the difference between Democrats and Republicans to be twice as large as it actually was.

Americans’ exaggerated perception of polarization has kept pace with actual increases in polarization. It is true that polarization between the attitudes of Democrats and Republicans in the 2000s was much larger than it was in the 1970s. But people overestimated polarization by a factor of two in the 2000s, just as they overestimated polarization by a factor of two in the 1970s.

Of course, people differed in how much they exaggerated differences between Democrats and Republicans. Some people overestimated actual polarization by just 25 percent, while others did so by 300 percent. It turns out that the people who are themselves most politically polarized are the ones who most overestimate political polarization.

People who identify strongly with their political party (Democrats and Republicans for whom political identification is a central part of their personal identity) and people who hold the most extreme stances on issues (believing most strongly, for example, that government should increase services and spending) overestimate political polarization far more than people who are less personally polarized. In short, political ideologues believe (falsely) that Americans are more polarized than do political moderates.

That political ideologues perceive the greatest polarization results from a complex, pernicious political psychology. People whose identities are intertwined with political partisanship[http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.bc.edu/journals/psp/93/3/415/] have a vested interest in seeing differences between parties — and in seeing their own party as defending against their opponent’s “biased” partisanship. Partisan media abets such identity defense. Fox News and MSNBC engage their partisan viewers by fostering a sense that the opposing side is crazy.

Political ideologues who hold extreme stances believe that political issues are morally charged[http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.bc.edu/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&uid=2012-10798-001] and emotionally evocative, and elicit extensive cogitation. They assume that other Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, are equally engaged morally, emotionally and cognitively, which leads others to hold extreme partisan stances — albeit on opposite sides of partisan issues.

But why does it matter if people believe that their fellow Democrats and Republicans are more polarized than they actually are? People are entitled to their own views, even if those views are incorrect.

It matters because the very people who are most mistaken about political reality are the people who are most politically active. People who perceive the greatest polarization between Democrats and Republicans are more likely to vote, to make campaign contributions and to persuade other people. And, as we have seen, political ideologues are the people who perceive the greatest polarization.

When polarization perceivers are disproportionately engaged in political action, false beliefs about political polarization become self-fulfilling. Political ideologues elect polarized politicians.

It often seems as if political extremists dominate political discourse by shouting the loudest. Truth be told, political moderates often remain silent — particularly in midterm elections — voting less often and removing themselves from the conversation.

This is unfortunate because, as our research shows, political moderates have more realistic perceptions of the political divisions among ordinary Americans. We hope that recognizing that most people, particularly political extremists, overestimate polarization between Democratic and Republican voters serves as a call to action this election season.

Political polarization may not be as bad as we think. But that doesn’t mean it couldn’t get a whole lot worse.

What Does 2014 Tell Us About 2016?

The 2014 election will be a four-part test that will tell us more than who will win control of the Senate.

First, how much damage has been inflicted over the past six years on the Democratic Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s brand?

Second, has the political calculus shifted enough to give Democratic presidential candidates a shot at Georgia, breaking the Republican Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/republican_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s grip on the Deep South? Have two traditionally Democratic states in the Midwest, Michigan and Wisconsin, become viable targets for Republicans in 2016?

Third, after the investment of millions of dollars by the Republican National Committee and conservative organizations affiliated with the Koch brothers, has the Republican Party caught up with or surpassed Democrats in this year’s technology-intensive, data-driven voter turnout operations?

Fourth, have Republican candidates found ways to lessen the liabilities of hard right views on abortion, same sex marriage, contraception and other sex and reproduction linked issues?

A Pew poll[http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/23/as-midterms-near-gop-leads-on-key-issues-democrats-have-a-more-positive-image/] on Oct. 23 found that voters believe Republicans could do a better job than Democrats of dealing with the threat of terrorism (plus 17 points), the budget deficit (plus 15), the economy (plus 6) and immigration (plus 5). On health care, traditionally an issue that favors Democrats by double digit margins, the Democrats had only a 6 point edge.

The Republican advantage on national security and terrorism is of particular importance because of the growing political salience of the threat posed by the Islamic State militant organization, known as ISIS. An October Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/washwire/2014/10/15/isis-threat-top-concern-for-republican-voters-wsjnbc-poll/] that 29 percent of voters put the threat from the Islamic State at the top of all issue priorities; these voters support Republicans over Democrats by a two to one margin.

Similarly, Gallup found[http://www.gallup.com/poll/178760/americans-confidence-government-handle-ebola-drops.aspx] that 24 percent of the public worries about the Ebola virus, and confidence in the ability of the federal government to deal with the threat declined from 61 percent to 52 percent in a matter of two weeks, from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19. The drop in confidence was much sharper among Republicans and voters who lean Republican than it was among Democratic voters.

The current finding that voters prefer Republicans over Democrats on immigration differs[mailto:http://www.pollingreport.com/immigration.htm] from polls in 2013 and earlier, which showed a preference for Democrats on the issue. The shift suggests that the recent surge of immigrant children crossing the border illegally has moved a substantial proportion of voters toward the more hard-line policies advocated by Republicans.

Equally if not more critical, loyalty to the Democratic Party among two key constituencies — Hispanics[http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/10/29/latino-support-for-democrats-falls-but-democratic-advantage-remains/], according to the Pew Research Center, and young voters[http://www.iop.harvard.edu/likely-millennial-voters-grabs-upcoming-midterm-elections-harvard-youth-poll-finds?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=Fall2014Survey], according to Harvard’s Institute of Politics — has diminished. In addition, the level of support for the Democratic Party among whites, especially working class whites, continues to fall[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/democrats-lose-their-grip-on-voters-with-keys-to-the-house-1414722604?KEYWORDS=white+working+class], according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal June 2014 poll.

In 2010, Pew found that Hispanic support for Democrats over Republicans stood at 65-22. Going into the current election, support for Democrats over Republicans declined 14 points to 57-28.

The Harvard Institute of Politics “Millennial voter” survey found that among 18- to 29-year-olds who “definitely” will vote, 51 percent said they would prefer a Republican-run Congress; 47 percent said they favored Democratic control. This compares to a 55-43 margin in support of Democratic control of Congress in a 2010 I.O.P. survey of this age group.

The Gallup Poll[http://www.gallup.com/poll/168059/whites-solidly-republican-recent-years.aspx] has found a slow but steady reduction in Democratic support among whites over the past two decades and a parallel increase in support among white voters for the Republican Party. In the Clinton years, whites favored Republicans over Democrats by 4.1 percentage points; in the Bush years, the Republican advantage grew to 5.4 points; in the Obama years, the Republican Party has pulled ahead by 9.5 points.

Extensive polling has already demonstrated that some of the states considered reliable sources of Democratic or Republican Electoral College votes are shifting to a more competitive status.

In Georgia[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ga/georgia_senate_perdue_vs_nunn_vs_swafford-5253.html], two Democratic candidates, Michelle Nunn, who is the daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, and Jason Carter[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/ga/georgia_governor_deal_vs_carter_vs_hunt-5254.html], a grandson of Jimmy Carter, have mounted surprisingly strong bids for Senate and governor, respectively, against David Purdue, a Republican businessman, and Nathan Deal, the incumbent Republican governor.

Win or lose, Nunn and Carter’s respectable showing in a low turnout midterm election is virtually certain to turn Georgia into a Democratic presidential target in 2016. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Georgia was Bill Clinton in 1992 (who then lost Georgia to Bob Dole in 1996).

At the same time, if two Republican governors, Scott Walker in Wisconsin[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/wi/wisconsin_governor_walker_vs_burke-4099.html] and Rick Snyder in Michigan[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/mi/michigan_governor_snyder_vs_schauer-3506.html], win re-election, these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.

Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data, high-tech voter mobilization.

In the last two presidential elections, the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found, registering citizens likely to be supportive, and making sure every supporter casts a ballot, in person, by mail, or through early voting processes.

In the current contest, however, both the Republican National Committee[https://gop.com/rnc-launches-para-bellum-labs/] and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers[http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/karl-rove-koch-brothers-control-republican-data-90385.html] have invested millions in microtargeting innovation, and are attempting to level the playing field.

Estimates[http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/] of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary, but, if the 2016 election is close, new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.

As the election campaign comes to a close, polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to “war on women[http://www.usnews.com.proxy.bc.edu/debate-club/is-there-a-republican-war-on-women]” accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.

Senate candidates in Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women’s reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/gop-senate-hopefuls-favor-over-the-counter-birth-control/2014/09/02/1916bef2-32c0-11e4-a723-fa3895a25d02_story.html] “morning after” contraceptive pills.

Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill, he has repudiated his past support[http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25395470/senate-bombshell-cory-gardner-says-cant-support-personhood] for a “personhood” constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions. Initially considered the underdog, Gardner has pulled ahead of Udall in most polls[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/co/colorado_senate_gardner_vs_udall-3845.html] leading up to Election Day.

If Republicans find an effective means to combat Democratic charges that the Republican Party is anti-women, Democrats will lose one of their most effective political weapons.

The 2014 election suggests that the intermittently[http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/magazine/110222/the-ecstasy-and-agonies-permanent-democratic-majority] heralded new Democratic majority[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/11/has-the-emerging-democratic-majority-emerged.html] in presidential elections is not inevitable, that the strong allegiance of core Democratic constituencies is not assured, and that the state-by-state Electoral College map is changing.

Taken together, the current contest and the 2010 election demonstrate the strength of the Republican Party in low-turnout, midterm years. Perhaps the most significant development in 2014 is the ability of Republican candidates to break with hard right conservative orthodoxy – even candidates whose own roots are in the hard right. This capacity, insofar as it is carried over into 2016, has the potential to break the pro-Democratic tilt of presidential elections and to force a major strategic re-evaluation by politicians and operatives in both parties.

The World Is Yours, the World Is Mine

History is often held hostage by the highest bidder — whoever gets to tell the story ends up defining what happened. What happened in 2014? What mattered in 2014? It depends whom you ask. Historical narratives recount political, economic or social events, but rarely tell stories of the everyday. The mundane nuances of life are often ignored precisely because they are so personal. But private stories are usually the ones that we connect with most; they capture our attention and remain in our memory. Modes of storytelling like painting and rap allow us to engage with those personal stories, becoming the vehicles through which history passes.

A major story of 2014 has been the Ebola outbreak, which has spread from West Africa to Europe and the United States. The Ebola narrative has also become the story of how we don’t want to be connected in what is supposedly a hyperconnected and globalized world. We have tried to screen for symptoms and enforce quarantines. However, the interface between human and microbe is complex. Our bodies cannot thrive without some microbes — they are an essential part of our personal ecosystems. They are always present, often lying dormant, just as narratives lie dormant until someone culls them from history’s rubble. I have chosen to respond to these events from 2014 in my work, “The World Is Yours, the World Is Mine,” (2014).

The World Is Yours, the World Is Mine

Africa is the glowing gold-and-green heart of the painting, a central stage on which many of the world’s issues play out. The amalgam of diverse societies and cultures, its swirling ink recalls topographical maps or satellite imagery of the land; swaths of red and blue seeping ink surround it, suggesting anatomical drawings and medical documentation. The mythological three-headed figure cradles, and at the same time claws at, the heart. The medical, anatomical and diagrammatic aspects of the painting are meant to signify the terrain of the body as a site or landscape comprised of multiple, disparate components that, in the end, are all related to one another — just as disparate elements can come together to shape a collective narrative that is told, retold, reshaped and distorted over time.

The central quasi-mythological figure has three heads, all of them New Yorkers. The figure on the left is Langston Hughes, the poet, novelist and leading voice of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s who told of the everyday lives of working-class African-Americans. In the center is death, a white skeleton figure with its organs spilling out of its chest. And on the right is the hip-hop artist Nas, known for his vivid observations and storytelling. Hughes and Nas have distinct relationships with lyric verse in their storytelling: Hughes through poetry and Nas through rap.

My painting explores multiple modes of storytelling from the vantage point of New York City, a place of integration and turmoil that is still coming to terms with its underrepresented narratives, including its African-American history. Many issues arise: not just questions of wealth and class, but of trade, global economics, crime, capitalism, race and personal identity.

My interest in juxtaposing hip-hop and Indo-Persian miniature painting, the primary medium through which I have told stories, is in taking these two disparate narrative forms and letting the dissonance find a detour. The process of juxtaposing is an exercise in reflection and discovery for me. It not only allows space for anticipation and reinterpretation, but can also spark new relationships.

I came across Nasir Jones’ music in 1994 and felt an instinctive affinity for how he was using personal narrative to disrupt poetic languages and histories: In my own work I often take apart classical and historical forms and reinvent them to create new associations. The year 2014 marked the 20th anniversary of the release of Nas’ debut album, “Illmatic,” which delved into his past, creating a lyrical portrait of life in New York’s public housing projects. The record heralded the resurgence of the city’s declining hip-hop scene and helped pave the way for a new generation of rappers. Since then, hip-hop has become mainstream and Nas has attained the status of public intellectual, popular icon, urban griot and contemporary shaman.

Much in the way that hip-hop’s place in popular culture was diminishing by the time Nas took it up in the early 1990s, Indo-Persian miniature painting fell from relevance in Pakistani culture. The practice shifted so dramatically after the fall of the Mughal Empire and the rise of colonial rule in South Asia during the 19th century that when I began engaging with the miniature in my work in the late 1980s and early ’90s at the National College of Arts in Lahore, it was regarded as tourist kitsch and derided as a craft technique. For years, the form had been ignored by many Pakistani artists. I found it ripe with potential — to change its status and its narrative and to deconstruct its stereotypes. What others saw as enslavement to tradition, I recognized as a path to expanding the medium from within, embracing the complexities of craft and rigor in order to open up possibilities for dialogue.

Style is how we engage with popular media. In my case, I began developing a distinct visual vocabulary as I interacted with the medium of the miniature. My work over the past 20 years has both borrowed and departed from traditional modes of miniature painting. One of these elements, the hair of Gopis — the female consorts of the Hindu god Krishna — appears in this painting, circling around the central axis. Over the past 15 years, I have been experimenting by divorcing their signature hairstyles from the rest of their bodies as a means of identifying them. The Gopi hair, in its many transformed and recontextualized iterations, takes on the appearance of bats, particles or elements of a moving mass. In this painting, the Gopis swirl around Africa and move outward. In their clusters around the central glowing orb of Africa, the Gopis coalesce and overlap, suggesting a symbol that became ubiquitous in 2014: the biohazard sign.

My process is driven by my interest in exploring and rediscovering cultural and political boundaries, and using that space to create new frameworks for dialogue and visual narrative. Contemporaneity is about remaining relevant by challenging the status quo, not by clinging to past successes. This is at odds with the standards set up in the worlds of commercial art and music, which are more interested in branding and often hold an artist hostage to one idea or form. In my work, deconstruction is not limited to the miniature-painting format; it extends to the reimagining of historical content and entrenched symbols. It is important to open the discourse, to challenge and re-examine our histories.

A Swan Song Season Begins on the Jersey Shore

Back in 2009 and 2010, when Nicole Polizzi [http://snookinicole.com/]was getting flattened in a bar fight and arrested for disorderly conduct on “Jersey Shore,” she didn’t look like the future star of one of television’s most comforting depictions of middle-class domesticity. But here she is, pregnant with her second child, learning to bake, living in her prospective mother-in-law’s basement. Our little Snooki has grown up.

That process has been documented on MTV[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/mtv_networks/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s “Snooki & Jwoww,”[http://www.mtv.com/shows/snooki_jwoww/] the “Jersey Shore” spinoff starring Ms. Polizzi and Jennifer Farley. Their show begins its fourth and final season on Wednesday night, closing the book on the “Shore” franchise. It’s almost time to say a final goodbye to, in Snooki’s immortal words, gorilla juicehead heaven.

Ms. Polizzi, now 26, and Ms. Farley, 28, still go down the shore for the summer, but the days of their Seaside Heights bacchanals are a distant memory. In the new season, they live in neighboring suburban mansions at some distance from the beach. Each is engaged — Snooki to the earnest Jionni LaValle, Jwoww to the sardonic Roger Matthews — and pregnant.

Childbearing provides plenty of openings for nipple and vagina jokes, and Ms. Polizzi and Ms. Farley are as comically crass as ever. But now they spend their time sitting around their houses, kvetching and playing with Ms. Polizzi’s 2-year-old son. The lifebloods of “Jersey Shore,” cheap hookups and binge drinking, are out of the picture — one of the running gags is Ms. Farley’s alleged lack of interest in sex, or at least in certain varieties of it.

You can still be offended by “Snooki & Jwoww,” if obscenity and explicit anatomical descriptions bother you. There are also a few problematic minutes when Mr. LaValle and Mr. Matthews, who play nice when they’re around their fiancées, attend a childbirth class together and immediately resort to homophobic, locker room humor.

But the real problem, as you might guess, is that watching Snooki and Jwoww without Long Island iced tea and bar fights is often about as exciting as watching someone put together a playroom, which is one of the things we’re treated to in the hourlong season premiere.

On the other hand, there’s something oddly reassuring about the show. Some of us might worry about Ebola and the Islamic State, but down the shore, two regular guys and their pregnant girlfriends are talking about what a great summer they’re going to have, sitting around the backyard barbecue pit. And, while they’re at it, discussing how they’ll feel if their children eventually have sex with each other.

Nicole Polizzi, left, and Jenni Farley are the stars of “Snooki & Jwoww,” an MTV series beginning its final season Wednesday. | Scott Gries/MTV

Ebola Researchers Rush to Find a Fast Diagnostic Test

Searching for a new way to attack Ebola, companies and academic researchers are now racing to develop faster and easier tests for determining whether someone has the disease.

Such tests might require only a finger prick of blood rather than a test tube of it, and provide the answer on the spot, without having to send the sample to a laboratory.

They could be essential in West Africa, where it can take days for a sample to travel to one of the relatively few testing laboratories, leaving those suspected of having the disease in dangerous limbo.

Rapid tests might also be used to screen travelers at airports, providing a more definitive answer than taking their temperatures.

“There’s a great deal of interest in a technology that can screen large numbers of people from a finger prick in only a few minutes,” said Cary Gunn, chief executive of Genalyte, a company in San Diego that says its approach can do just that. “You can imagine testing an entire planeload of passengers and screening through them cost-effectively.”

The World Health Organization is encouraging development of rapid tests[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/diagnostics_laboratory/141002_revised_invitation_to_mx_of_ebola_virus_diagnostics.pdf?ua=1], as is the federal government. On Oct. 25, the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for use of a one-hour test developed by BioFire Defense.

“It would have taken years to get this product approved through the traditional process,” said Kirk Ririe, chief executive of the company, which is based Salt Lake City and owned by the French diagnostics firm BioMérieux.

Companies are hoping to get their tests into the field in Africa in the next few months, but it is not clear how many will be in time to make a difference in the outbreak. And some health specialists caution that while one company after another is announcing an Ebola test, there is little information about their accuracy.

“It’s a wild, wild West a little bit in development,” said Dr. Mark Perkins, chief scientific officer of FIND, or the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a nonprofit organization working with the World Health Organization to assess Ebola tests. “Eight Ebola products on the market with no one knowing how they work is not helpful.”

The need for better testing is most acute in West Africa, which has too few testing labs. Dr. Perkins said testing capacity needed to be more than doubled to about 12,000 tests a week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and labs placed closer to where people with symptoms are coming for care.

Samples now sometimes have to be transported for hours or days over rutted roads to a laboratory. People suspected of having Ebola must wait in holding rooms until the results come back. If they do not have Ebola when they enter the room, they might have it by the time they leave.

“People are waiting four to five days,” for test results, said Dr. J. Daniel Kelly, who is working in Sierra Leone for the aid group Wellbody Alliance. “They are watching people around them die. Horrible experience. You are locked in there at night.”

Even in the United States, delays can occur, with samples being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta or some state public health laboratories.

It took about two days for the confirmation that Thomas Eric Duncan was infected after his second visit to a Dallas hospital.

With flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] season coming, hospitals might benefit from having a quick way to rule out Ebola for certain patients as their emergency rooms fill with people with fevers and other symptoms that overlap with those of Ebola.

The standard testing technique for Ebola is known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR. It amplifies the genetic material of the virus, allowing even tiny quantities to be detected. It is very accurate if done correctly.

But PCR generally requires a tube of blood and is performed by trained personnel on a sophisticated machine. A test can take two to six hours or more and cost about $100.

BioFire’s FilmArray test, the one authorized for emergency use by the F.D.A., is a PCR test that can be done in one hour.

More than 300 hospitals already have one of BioFire’s $39,000 machines, which they have been using to test for other diseases. Now they can test for Ebola on site, though positive findings are supposed to be confirmed by the C.D.C.

A BioFire machine is in a special isolation ward used to treat Ebola patients at Emory University Hospital, and an instrument was delivered to Bellevue Hospital Center in New York after Dr. Craig Spencer was admitted for treatment.

Still, some say that in Africa, reducing PCR testing time by a couple of hours is not that important.

“The bottleneck is not the speed of the technology,” but the transport time and lack of testing capacity, said Rob Powell, director of research and development at Primerdesign, a British company. It is developing a PCR test using materials that do not require refrigeration, so that it can get “to more far-flung places,” he said.

What would be most valuable in Africa, some health specialists say, is a test that takes a few minutes, as the person awaits results, and costs a few dollars at most.

Various companies and organizations are working to develop such tests, including France’s Atomic Energy Commission, the Institut Pasteur, the German company Senova and the American companies Corgenix, NanoBioSym, Nanomix and others.

“We have been working since March, shoulders against the wheel, to be ready to roll these out in quantities that would make a difference in the outbreak,” said Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.

The test he is working on, which is being manufactured by Corgenix, is similar to a home pregnancy test[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/hcg-blood-test-quantitative/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. It uses antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that bind to one of the proteins of the Ebola virus. A finger prick blood sample is put on a test strip, which is then put into a tube containing a solution. After about 15 minutes, a line appears if the virus is present.

Because they do not amplify the viral genes as PCR does, such rapid tests are not expected to be as sensitive in detecting the virus.

Using inaccurate tests would be a “perilous endeavor,” said Brian Bird, a veterinary medical officer at the CDC.

If a test falsely says someone has Ebola, that person would be put into an Ebola treatment center, where they might actually catch the disease. Even worse would be missing an infection, allowing a person to return to the community and possibly infect others.

Airport screening is also tricky. A rapid test would presumably be more accurate, albeit slower, than thermometers, because body temperature can be elevated for any number of reasons or suppressed by fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-relieving medicines.

But the main problem with screening is not that thermometers are inaccurate. Rather it is that people typically do not develop fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or other symptoms until six days or more after being infected. So they can pass through airport screening, as Mr. Duncan and Dr. Spencer did.

Yet health specialists say the rapid tests probably will not reliably detect the virus until the person has symptoms, because viral levels in the blood will be too low. Even the PCR test has trouble detecting infection much before symptoms appear.

Still, Dr. Garry of Tulane said even detecting the virus in people with mild symptoms might help. He said his test probably would have picked up the infection in Amber Vinson, the Dallas nurse who flew from Cleveland back to Dallas with a slight temperature and was later found to have Ebola.

Republicans, Meet Science

Just days before the midterm elections, we got the latest alarm: The globe is heating up like a griddle, and we’re just lolling here like eggs.

This happened on Sunday, when a United Nations panel issued what The Times called its “starkest warning yet.” But while the report made headlines, it didn’t make the campaign. Like other big issues being shelved for some later, scarier day, climate change wasn’t high on the agenda, especially for Republicans.

They seemed poised on Tuesday to fare better in the voting than the Democrats will and to wind up with increased muscle on Capitol Hill. However else they use it, I fervently hope that they start showing more respect for science.

The refusal to accept or respond adequately to climate change is the most obvious example of their disregard — and one of the most enraging ones. In a recent story[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/why-republicans-keep-telling-everyone-theyre-not-scientists.html] in The Times, Coral Davenport described the maddening tendency of top Republicans, including Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, to deflect questions about greenhouse gases and volatile weather patterns with some version of the cop-out: “Well, I’m not a scientist.”

No, they’re not. But there are estimable ones all around Washington and the rest of the sizzling globe, and they’re happy to share their wisdom. The United Nations panel did precisely that, cautioning that a continued failure to reduce emissions of those gases would yield “food shortages, refugee crises, the flooding of major cities and entire island nations, mass extinctions of plants and animals, and a climate so drastically altered it might become dangerous for people to work or play outside during the hottest times of the year,” as The Times’s Justin Gilliswrote[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/world/europe/global-warming-un-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change.html], laying out the stakes. They couldn’t be graver.

President Obama used his executive authority earlier this year on a plan to cut emissions some. But Congress has been largely useless, with a relationship to science that toggles between benign neglect and outright contempt. And many Americans have a similarly curious attitude, distinguished by woefully insufficient gratitude for the ways in which science has advanced our country and elevated our lives.

On the one hand, we’re enthralled by the idea and occasional romance of science. We certainly love it in our popular entertainment. The most watched comedy on television is “The Big Bang Theory,” which showcases physicists. Their social fumbling is lampooned, but their brainpower is revered.

The biggest event of the fall movie season is the space extravaganza “Interstellar,” which opens this week and is so chockablock with sophisticated physics and rife with cosmological argot that Time magazine assigned a cover story not to a Hollywood reporter but to the senior editor who supervises science coverage.

And Bill Nye, “the Science Guy,” has become a veritable cultural icon.

But look at the title of his new book on evolution, also out this week. It’s called “Undeniable,” because, yes, there are many Americans who still deny what Darwin and other scientists long ago proved. They elect mysticism over empiricism.

And you can’t chalk that up to religious fervor alone. Plenty of Americans without any strong religious beliefs opt not to vaccinate their children, ignoring the ironclad scientific arguments in favor of doing so. Plenty reject the virtues of pasteurization and feed their children raw milk. Plenty spend lavishly on herbal supplements and alternative medicine, defying physicians and deciding when myth suits them better than actual fact.

But that kind of fickle approach to science is most troubling in the people who make our laws. As several bloggers and journalists have noted, some Republicans say they’re not qualified to address global warming even as they opine readily and expansively on Ebola. They fault the appointed “Ebola czar” for not being a doctor, then reject what actual doctors tell us about the disease.

If they had proper regard for science, politicians in both parties would fight harder against the devastating cuts to federal research that have happened under sequestration, endangering medical progress and jeopardizing our global leadership. And lawmakers trying to prove their fiscal prudence wouldn’t irresponsibly smear all scientific inquiry by cherry-picking and theatrically denouncing the most arcane, seemingly frivolous studies the government has funded.

If science held the sway it should, the onetime Senate candidate Todd Akin wouldn’t have bought into and mentioned his ludicrous theory that “legitimate rape” precluded pregnancy, and the Republican flamethrower Ted Cruz might have to surrender his florid homophobia, which is reliant on his fantasy that same-sex attractions are some whimsical “personal choices.”

And with the right fealty to science, this next Congress would be forced to accept the overwhelming consensus on climate change and take action. It’s time to wise up and stop wasting all the knowledge we have.

Groups seek transparency in choosing U.N. chief

There is no job description for the world’s top civil servant, except to solve its messiest problems. There are no campaign rules, or list of qualifications, except what is left unsaid: He (and it’s always been a he) must be palatable to the world powers.

Now, as jockeying begins for the selection of the next United Nations secretary-general, to be chosen in 2016, new momentum is building to open up the process. A coalition of nongovernmental organizations, supported by some former United Nations diplomats, is calling for a formal application process, including transparent selection criteria, an official shortlist of contenders, and a chance for all member states to evaluate the candidates.

The effort reflects growing frustration with the dominance of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, who bargain for influence over every important office within the system, most importantly the post of Secretary-General. The choice is made largely in secret, in Council meetings held privately and tough negotiations among officials in Washington, Moscow and Beijing.

The coalition of civil society groups, which calls itself 1for7billion.org, described the process as ‘‘significantly outdated.’’ ‘‘It falls far short of modern recruitment practices for high-level international appointments, as well as of the UN’s own standards and ideals,’’ the group said in a letter that it was sending on Wednesday to heads of all 193 member states. The group, which has created a website, added in its letter: ‘‘A more open and inclusive selection process engaging all U.N. Member States will also help to revitalize the U.N. and enhance its global authority.’’

Its chance of success remains unclear. The Council is run by its permanent members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — and efforts to expand the roster have been stalled for years. Previous calls to open the selection process have failed. The new campaign is hoping to gain by raising a fuss on social media. It comes at a time when the United Nations is trying to tackle a raft of new crises that transcend national borders, from climate change and Islamist extremism to Ebola and an unprecedented surge of refugees.

‘‘This has been for a very long time a concentrated decision-making process. We think its time to open it up,’’ said Juan Carlos Mendoza Garcia, the ambassador of Costa Rica, which has long agitated on this issue.

The current secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, finishes his second term at the end of 2016. His successor is to start in 2017. Exactly when the appointment will be announced is also unclear. There is no set timeline, which leads to intense last-minute power struggles.

David Malone, a Canadian diplomat who has written books about the Security Council and now serves as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo, said the selection process creates frustration among emerging powers and does not necessarily promote the strongest candidate.

‘‘While several secretaries-general have turned out to be accomplished,’’ said Mr. Malone, who is not part of the campaign, ‘‘the risk with opaque processes in the Council is that they will produce a low common denominator outcome ultimately taking into account only the convenience and views of key members of the Permanent Five.’’

The United Nations Charter does not specify exactly how its boss should be selected. In practice, for most of its 70-year history, the Security Council has submitted the name of its preferred candidate, who is simply ratified by the broader membership of the General Assembly. The Council’s decisions take place privately. And veterans of the organization say the world powers have been especially keen to control who gets the job since the tenure of the Dag Hammarskjold, a famously independent Swedish diplomat who led the organization during the height of the Cold War from 1953 to his death in 1961.

Regional blocs have insisted on rotations, pushing for their diplomats to take a turn to run the organization. That too is not written in the charter, but there is a growing chorus among diplomats here that the job should go to someone from Eastern or Central Europe. Gaining consensus around such a candidate is likely to be difficult considering the deep divide between Washington and Moscow, over crises including in Ukraine. There are also calls to select a woman; no female candidate has been seriously considered in the history of the organization.

‘‘The selection process is not, at present, a serious search for the person, male or female, most qualified for this enormous job,’’ said Sir Brian Urquhart, a veteran United Nations diplomat who established who established its first peacekeeping mission in 1956, under Mr. Hammarskjold. ‘‘The process is haphazard, with no open search procedure, no vetting of candidates, no interviews, and a list virtually restricted to those who have declared themselves.’’

In New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen Beats Scott Brown to Keep Senate Seat

MANCHESTER, N.H. — Senator Jeanne Shaheen barely fended off an aggressive challenge for her United States Senate seat Tuesday from Scott Brown[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per], a Republican and former senator from Massachusetts.

The Associated Press, television networks and The New York Times called the race for Ms. Shaheen, a Democrat, with only a third of the votes counted. The numbers seesawed late Tuesday night, but Ms. Shaheen pulled out a victory by a few thousand votes, and Mr. Brown called Ms. Shaheen shortly before midnight to concede.

Mr. Brown, 55, has had a meteoric career in elective politics. As a state senator, he stunned the political world in 2010 when he beat Martha Coakley, a Democrat, to capture the Massachusetts Senate seat held for almost half a century by Edward M. Kennedy. But just as suddenly, he was eclipsed in 2012 by Elizabeth Warren, and his career seemed stalled.

In April, he jumped into the Senate race in New Hampshire, attempting to become the third person ever, and the first in more than a century, to represent more than one state in the Senate.

But Ms. Shaheen, 67, a former governor who was first elected to the New Hampshire state senate in 1990, had developed deep bonds with voters that proved a challenge for Mr. Brown to overcome.

 Ms. Shaheen, who is originally from Missouri, avoided using the word “carpetbagger” to describe Mr. Brown, but that was the subtext of her message. “The question is not where he’s from; the question is what he’s for,” she often said, supplying this answer: “He’s not for New Hampshire.” And, she would say, “New Hampshire is not a consolation prize.”

The two ran very different campaigns. She focused on local issues like jobs, utility bills and student loans[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/student_loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and campaigned under the banner of “putting New Hampshire first.” Mr. Brown, like other Republicans across the country, sought to nationalize the election by stoking resentment toward President Obama, whose job approval ratings here are at a record low.

Mr. Brown cast Ms. Shaheen as a lap dog to Mr. Obama and indicted her — repeatedly — for her record of voting with him “99 percent of the time.”

 He argued that Mr. Obama’s lax leadership, particularly with regard to the Mexican border, had left the United States vulnerable to diseases like Ebola and polio, and to terrorists who wanted to “plant their flag at the White House.” Ms. Shaheen, he said, was a “rubber stamp” for the president’s policies.

  “I think it’s naïve to think that people aren’t going to be walking through here who have those types of diseases and/or other types of intent, criminal or terrorist, and yet we do nothing to secure our border,” Mr. Brown said in a radio interview. “I voted to secure it; Senator Shaheen has not.”

 Ms. Shaheen dismissed Mr. Brown as fear mongering and said that finding solutions to complex problems required serious people to be thoughtful, suggesting that Mr. Brown was neither.

She also borrowed from the playbook laid out by Ms. Warren in 2012, tarring Mr. Brown with having voted for tax breaks for oil companies and in return receiving hefty campaign donations from oil interests and Wall Street.

 While polls showed that Mr. Obama was indeed a drag on Ms. Shaheen, voters viewed Mr. Brown more negatively than they viewed her. And, like Ms. Warren, she benefited from a substantial gender gap.

  This fueled one of Ms. Shaheen’s rallying cries toward the end of the campaign, that Mr. Brown would in fact become a historic figure, if not the one he anticipated: “We will make him the only person to run for the Senate from two states to be defeated by two women.”

Negativity Wins the Senate

Republicans would like the country to believe that they took control of the Senate on Tuesday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/midterm-elections.html] by advocating a strong, appealing agenda of job creation, tax reform and spending cuts. But, in reality, they did nothing of the sort.

Even the voters who supported Republican candidates would have a hard time explaining what their choices are going to do. That’s because virtually every Republican candidate campaigned on only one thing: what they called the failure of President Obama. In speech after speech, ad after ad, they relentlessly linked their Democratic opponent to the president and vowed that they would put an end to everything they say the public hates about his administration. On Tuesday morning, the Republican National Committee released a series of get-out-the-vote images[https://twitter.com/GOP/status/529603980721410048] showing Mr. Obama and Democratic Senate candidates[https://twitter.com/GOP/status/529607750251462656] next to this message: “If you’re not a voter, you can’t stop Obama.”

The most important promises that winning Republicans made were negative in nature. They will repeal health care reform. They will roll back new regulations on banks and Wall Street. They will stop the Obama administration’s plans to curb coal emissions and reform immigration and invest in education.

Campaigning on pure negativity isn’t surprising for a party that has governed that way since Mr. Obama was first sworn in. By creating an environment where every initiative is opposed and nothing gets done, Republicans helped engineer the president’s image as weak and ineffectual. Mitch McConnell, who will be the Senate’s new majority leader[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-wins-sixth-term-in-us-senate.html], vowed in 2009 to create “an inventory of losses”[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-hopes-in-need-of-hope-today/2014/11/02/033b25ec-61ef-11e4-8b9e-2ccdac31a031_story.html] to damage Mr. Obama for precisely the results achieved on Tuesday.

Mr. McConnell was assisted in this goal by the president’s own second-term stumbles — most notably the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act last year, an indecisive foreign policy, and revelations of domestic surveillance and improper veterans care. Republicans were also able to exploit nativist fears about immigrant children crossing at the southern border and some initial troubles in responding to the first domestic cases of Ebola.

In some races, missteps by the Democrats helped Republicans. In Iowa, Representative Bruce Braley may have cost himself the race by making a belittling comment about farmers. In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes didn’t establish a reputation for candor when she refused to discuss her previous votes for president.

Virtually all Democratic candidates distanced themselves from Mr. Obama and refused to make the case that there has been substantial progress on jobs and economic growth under this administration.

But Republicans also had little to say about reviving the economy, and their idea of creating jobs seems to be limited to building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, cutting taxes further and crying “repeal Obamacare” at every opportunity.

In theory, full control of Congress might give Republicans an incentive to reach compromise with Mr. Obama because they will need to show that they can govern rather than obstruct. They might, for example, be able to find agreement on a free-trade agreement with Pacific nations.

But their caucuses in the Senate and the House will be more conservative than before, and many winning candidates will feel obliged to live up to their promises of obstruction. Mr. McConnell has already committed himself to opposing a minimum-wage increase, fighting regulations on carbon emissions and repealing the health law.

“Just because we have a two-party system doesn’t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict,” Mr. McConnell said in his victory speech. As the new Senate leader, he must now prove those are not empty words.

De Blasio Still Faces Uphill Battle in Trying to Connect With Cuomo

For the most dysfunctional couple in New York politics, it was a chance for a feel-good moment after a feel-bad year.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] was ready to declare victory at an election night rally in Midtown Manhattan. Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per] had been invited to attend. But two hours before the polls were to close, there was still no confirmation that the mayor would address the crowd.

It would typically not be a question that a Democratic mayor would pay respects to a Democratic governor. But Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have spent the year clashing over taxes, education and even the response to the Ebola virus. The mayor helped Mr. Cuomo win the endorsement of the liberal Working Families Party; the governor then tried to undermine the party’s influence.

In the end, Mr. de Blasio came onstage to deliver a speech that offered “sincere appreciation” to Mr. Cuomo — for signing legislation that City Hall supported. Unmentioned was the governor’s quashing of the mayor’s signature proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy, or their heated dispute over charter schools[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/charter_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

After a year of slights, resentments and seemingly earnest claims of rapprochement, the tension between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio is not likely to change with the results from Tuesday, public officials and political experts say.

Mr. Cuomo is comfortably ensconced in office for another four years, with the tremendous power that affords over the city, and Mr. de Blasio’s efforts to secure Democratic control of the State Senate — which would offer liberal leverage against the centrist Mr. Cuomo — appeared to be falling short, based on early returns. The governor, a master of political calculation, is loath to cede ground to a mayor who still needs his permission to pursue top priorities like creating more affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.

In praising Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday for “the kind of leadership the people of this state want,” Mr. de Blasio was sticking with his long-term strategy of offering favors and political cover to the governor, despite his active undermining of City Hall. That strategy has been second-guessed by some high-ranking Democrats who wonder if the best response to a bully is a proverbial swift punch in the nose.

“De Blasio has chosen to take kidney punch after kidney punch from Cuomo in pursuit of a larger political relationship,” said Richard Brodsky, a former Westchester County assemblyman. “Cuomo respects strength. And if history is any guide, he will do business with people he believes are strong.”

Still, Mr. Cuomo’s re-election was far from smooth. The governor was vilified by liberals and embarrassed in the Democratic primary by an obscure challenger, and he watched his national reputation eroded by revelations of questionable ethics and a rushed Ebola response that was criticized[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/two-governors-shifts-on-ebola-are-criticized-as-politics-not-science.html] by the White House.

More troubling for Mr. Cuomo, perhaps, is that his botched coronation has punctured his carefully cultivated aura of invincibility. A leader who rules by fear, Mr. Cuomo will begin his second term facing a newly emboldened press corps and a Legislature that has seen his political vulnerabilities laid bare.

“People are not going to feel the kind of loyalty to the governor that they have felt before,” said Kenneth Sherrill, who taught politics for decades at Hunter College. “Nobody’s going to want to cross him, but I don’t think they’re going to want to help him, either.”

Ultimately, the balance of power between mayor and governor will remain unsettled until control of the State Senate is set. Mr. de Blasio cold-called[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/de-blasio-fights-for-a-democratic-state-senate-with-calls-cash-and-ads.html] A-list donors and solicited five-figure contributions to aid the Senate Democrats, but by late on Tuesday, Republicans were close to winning outright control of the chamber. The mayor conceded earlier this week, “We’re going to work with whatever the results are.”

There is also the simple fact that as long as the five boroughs are in thrall to the Legislature for revenues, tensions between state and city are unavoidable.

“Constitutionally, that relationship is designed to be difficult, if not torturous,” said Richard Norton Smith, a historian and longtime chronicler of New York politics. “The greatest city in the world does not like to be humbled, having to constantly bend its knee to Albany.”

The Cuomo-de Blasio relationship has a ways to go before it reaches the historical nadir of same-party squabbles in New York. In his biography[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nelson-rockefeller-new-yorks-establishment-republican-as-a-symbol-of-a-bygone-era] of former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, Mr. Smith recalls an episode from 1971 where President Richard M. Nixon offered to help Mr. Rockefeller cope with his great rival, Mayor John V. Lindsay.

President Nixon’s suggestion: a wiretap.

Republicans First Had to Wrestle With Their Own Poor Discipline

WASHINGTON — It was late spring, and Republican leaders knew that if they wanted to win the Senate, they needed to crush the enemy: not Democrats, but the rebels within their own party.

And Chris McDaniel, a Senate candidate from Mississippi who had a history of making sexist and racially insensitive remarks[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/us/chris-mcdaniel-thad-cochran-mississippi-primary.html], was a problem.

Candidates like Scott Brown, running for the Senate in New Hampshire, called the National Republican Senatorial Committee to complain that if Mr. McDaniel was not stopped, he could drag the whole party down. Strategists inside the committee’s headquarters on Capitol Hill were envisioning nightmares of Democrats caricaturing all their candidates as “mini-McDaniels.”

The committee’s executive director, Rob Collins, dragged complacent donors into the effort, playing recordings for them of some of Mr. McDaniel’s most incendiary remarks and persuading them to underwrite a massive get-out-the-vote effort to defeat him.

In June, the party establishment — just barely — vanquished Mr. McDaniel[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/us/politics/thad-cochran-chris-mcdaniel-mississippi-senate-primary.html], reaching a turning point in their dogged campaign to purge the party of extremists and regain power in the Senate.

Republicans’ impressive showing Tuesday night — marking the first time the party will have a majority in both the House and Senate since 2006 — was the result of methodical plotting, careful candidate vetting and abundant preparation to ensure that the party’s candidates would avoid repeating the same devastating mistakes that cost them dearly in 2010 and 2012.

“You get your best players on the field in November, avoid doing something that makes us look like we are not adult enough to govern, and hope the wave is big,” said Senator Mitch McConnell[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mitch_mcconnell/index.html?inline=nyt-per] in an interview in March, not long after Republicans scored a major coup by getting Cory Gardner, a congressman from Colorado and one of the party’s strongest candidates this election, into the race.

In interviews, more than two dozen lawmakers and strategists described the meticulous efforts.

Little was left to chance: Republican operatives sent fake campaign trackers — interns and staff members brandishing video cameras to record every utterance and move — to trail their own candidates. In media training sessions, candidates were forced to sit through a reel of the most self-destructive moments of 2012, when Todd Akin [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/us/politics/todd-akin-provokes-ire-with-legitimate-rape-comment.html]and Richard Mourdock’s[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/indiana-senate-candidate-draws-fire-for-rape-comments/] comments on rape and pregnancy helped sink the party.

Other factors affected the outcome, of course. The election was unfolding during perhaps the best political climate Republicans had seen since the 1980s. Upheaval on the domestic and international stage — a crash of the health care website[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/tension-and-woes-before-health-website-crash.html], beheadings in the Middle East, a surge of migrant children[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/us/us-plans-to-step-up-detention-and-deportation-of-migrants.html] along the Mexican border and a raging virus[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] in Africa — all helped tip the scales in Republicans’ favor. Democrats battled to keep the most competitive races from slipping away from them until the very last minute, an almost impossible task given President Obama’s low approval ratings and the cascade of bad news that was unimaginable when the party was riding high a year ago, after Republicans stumbled through a government shutdown.

“There wasn’t a moment this cycle where we thought, ‘Oh, we can’t lose,’ ” said Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Conversely, there wasn’t a moment in this cycle where we thought we couldn’t win," he added, insisting that their plan was the right one. “Election outcomes tend to declare everyone either a genius or a failure, but there’s no question in my mind that this was the right strategy.”

Democratic Discontent

Tensions between the Democratic Senate candidates and the president kept bubbling up throughout the campaign. It did not help that the Democrats defending their seats felt that Mr. Obama had refused to come to terms with how damaged his political brand had become in their states, and how perilous his embrace was.

When he delivered a speech last month[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/politics/in-illinois-speech-obama-trumpets-economic-successes.html] at Northwestern University and declared that his policies were “on the ballot” alongside the candidates who were trying desperately to distance themselves from him, it infuriated Democrats. The White House had shared the general outline of that speech with Senate Democrats beforehand, but never mentioned that line despite its obvious political consequences. (By the end of the campaign, the quote of the president saying his policies were on the ballot had appeared in television ads[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TDRgcJ0tQA&feature=youtu.be] in nearly every competitive Senate race, from North Carolina to Arkansas to Colorado.)

Every week seemed to get worse. By the end, Democrats had watched the president’s favorable ratings tumble, especially among white voters in the Southern states they needed to win. In Georgia, for example, their internal numbers showed the president’s favorability among whites at 21 percent. 

Further marring the relationship between the White House and Senate Democrats was the issue of fund-raising. Obama administration officials resisted getting too involved in helping the “super PAC[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/campaign_finance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]” that former aides to Harry Reid, the majority leader, had set up to try to defend the party’s Senate seats.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/us/politics/democrats-plan-big-ad-campaign-in-challenge-to-koch-brothers.html] (Mr. Obama’s aides say he dislikes the work of PACs on principle.) In a tense meeting between supporters of Mr. Reid’s and White House staff over the summer, Mr. Reid’s allies sardonically reminded the president’s staff that they were not so reticent about working on behalf of the super PAC supporting Mr. Obama in 2012.

Mr. Obama even balked at dipping into the Democratic National Committee’s coffers to help Senate Democrats. Mr. Reid was so exasperated by what he saw as the president’s foot-dragging that during a phone call with Mr. Obama to discuss unrelated issues, he ended the conversation by saying, “Thank you very much Mr. President, but all we want is our money,” two people familiar with the conversation recalled.

There were policy conflicts as well. Democrats were incensed that the administration was so openly discussing taking unilateral action to pardon many undocumented immigrants, which they worried would inflame the issue and drive independent voters away. After hearing personally from several Democratic senators who were upset, the White House asked the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in late summer for its polling data.

What they turned over was alarming. In Iowa, a state that was slipping out of Democrats’ grasp, only 39 percent of people backed the president’s plan. By September, when Mr. Obama decided to delay his executive action[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/obama-said-to-delay-executive-action-on-immigration.html] until after the elections, the damage had already been done. With problems in the Middle East boiling over and the Ebola virus reaching the United States, voters’ confidence in the president’s leadership had plummeted.

Republican Revival

Even though the geography and historic trends favored Republicans this year, it was hard to find optimism among party loyalists and donors as 2014 began, given how badly 2010 and 2012 had gone.

“Most Republican activists were discouraged by lack of success in past election cycles,” acknowledged Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “The number of people you had to talk to who needed to be convinced that it made any sense to support the cause was huge. We started with a very challenging environment in which people were just disillusioned.”

But after a string a Democratic retirements — among them, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/tom-harkin-of-iowa-wont-seek-re-election-to-senate.html] — and the recruitment of strong candidates like Mr. Gardner in Colorado and Mr. Brown in New Hampshire, the party began to rebuild credibility.

Party leaders managed to elbow aside insurgents like Mr. McDaniel and Liz Cheney[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/us/politics/liz-cheney-to-quit-wyoming-senate-race.html], the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who planned to challenge Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming on the grounds that he was insufficiently conservative.

Of course, the aggressive effort of the party’s establishment set off resentment. Republican senators recalled how an angry Mr. Cheney would call them to complain when someone disparaged his daughter.

And there were moments when Republicans’ gains felt like they could be slipping away. Mr. McConnell was rattled late last month when the Democrats went into Kentucky with a surprise last-minute ad buy against him. He took the threat so seriously, one adviser said, that as he rode around the state in the back of a campaign S.U.V. he started scouring his own Federal Election Commission reports in search of donors who had not yet given the maximum legal amount.

But in the end, the disciplined approach worked: no Republican imploded with the kind of fatal campaign gaffe that crushed the party’s hopes in the last two elections. Every establish candidate prevailed in the primaries. Republicans credited this to their rigorous training program. The fake trackers would even surprise candidates at the curb outside the airport when they flew into Washington to meet with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials, who then forced candidates to sit down and watch themselves on film.

“We don’t teach them what to believe,” said Mr. Collins, the committee’s executive director. “We just teach them how to talk, how to say things once the camera is on them.”

Mr. Collins found it hard to persuade members of his party that this campaign could lead not only to them winning some seats, but to retaking the majority.

There was the time he gave an upbeat address to a room full of Republican senators at Palm Beach’s majestic Breakers resort in February 2013, right after President Obama took the oath of office for a second time and Democrats were basking in their comfortable majority. But the senators, like Rob Portman of Ohio and Mr. Moran of Kansas, both of whom would become deeply involved in Republicans’ 2014 campaign, told Mr. Collins afterward that he might want to tone it down.

“Our general approach had been to underpromise and overperform,” Mr. Portman said in an interview a few days before Election Day.

Then there was a meeting of Republican leadership in the Capitol a few weeks later where Mr. Collins heard the same reticence. What he did not tell them at the time was that he had just printed 10,000 copies of a glossy magazine-size pamphlet that said on its crimson cover “Majority.”

He had the period added for emphasis.

A deep-pocketed challenger, Bruce Rauner, unseats Gov. Pat Quinn.

In a state where registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans and President Obama’s approval rating has stayed near the 50 percent mark, Bruce Rauner, a wealthy Republican businessman, managed to push out the Democratic governor, Pat Quinn, in a close and nasty contest.

The governor had campaigned relentlessly around raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour from $8.25, but he engendered animosity among public-sector unions with last year’s overhaul of the state’s critically underfunded pension system. Mr. Rauner, who had boasted of his business savvy, spent $26 million of his own money on the race. In the final weeks of the campaign, he focused on Ebola, urging a travel ban on visitors from the three West African nations where the disease has raged. Mr. Rauner also pounded away at the political corruption that has plagued previous Democratic politicians in the state as well as failings in the state’s child welfare services.

Mr. Quinn, who was elected in 2010, needed to draw African-Americans to the polls on Election Day to put him over the top and so was one of the few Democratic candidates to openly embrace President Obama. But the African-American share of the vote declined compared with four years ago, according to exit polls.

Senator Richard J. Durbin is re-elected, defeating Jim Oberweis.

Jim Oberweis, the Republican challenger, was never really able to gain any traction against Senator Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat who first won this seat in 1996 and is the second-highest-ranked Democrat in the Senate. The Chicago Tribune had endorsed Mr. Durbin, saying that although the newspaper often disagreed with him on the issues, “we would rather have Illinois represented by a highly capable partisan than by a less capable partisan.”

Changes are ahead for the state’s House delegation.

Two Democratic congressional incumbents from Illinois lost their seats. In the closely watched 12th Congressional District race, in the southwest part of the state, Mike Bost, a Republican state representative from Murphysboro, defeated Bill Enyart, a freshman Democrat, making him the first Republican to represent St. Clair County in more than 70 years. In the 10th Congressional District, encompassing Chicago’s northeast suburbs, Bob Dold, a Republican, managed to turn out Representative Brad Schneider[http://elections.chicagotribune.com/candidates/brad-schneider/], the Democrat who beat him in a tight race last time around.

But in another rematch, in the 17th Congressional District, the Republican candidate lost. Bobby Schilling, a Republican who opposes the Affordable Care Act, failed to retake the seat he once held from Representative Cheri Bustos, the freshman Democrat.

And in the 11th Congressional District, Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat, fended off a challenge from Darlene Senger, a three-term Republican state lawmaker.

FRONT PAGE

Because of an editing error, an article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/us/politics/midterm-election-polls-point-to-a-late-night.html] on Tuesday about the final hours of campaigning for the midterm elections referred incorrectly to the 1.5 million television advertisements aired during the midterm election cycle. The number includes all broadcast television advertisements, including those by candidates — not just advertisements by outside groups.

INTERNATIONAL

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-sentenced.html] on Oct. 22 about the five-year sentence handed down to the South African track star Oscar Pistorius in the death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, erroneously attributed a distinction to Mr. Pistorius. He was the first double-amputee runner to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics; he was not the first disabled athlete to do so. (Single-amputee athletes competed in the Olympics in the early 1900s, and since then blind, deaf and other amputee athletes, including the South African swimmer Natalie du Toit in 2008, have also done so.)

NEW YORK

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/bellevue-back-on-front-line-in-another-crisis.html] on Oct. 25 about the challenges faced by Bellevue Hospital Center in handling New York City’s first Ebola case misstated, in some editions, the title of Dr. Eric Manheimer, a former Bellevue official who wrote a book about the hospital. He was the medical director, not the chief medical officer.

BUSINESS DAY

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/inquiry-of-honda-centers-on-failure-to-report-deaths-from-airbags.html] on Tuesday about a federal investigation of Honda Motor’s reporting of deaths and injuries from defective airbags misidentified, in some copies, the company that said it would start an audit of its reporting procedures. It is Honda — not Takata, the airbag supplier. The article also misstated, in some copies, the name of the Florida law enforcement unit that investigated an accident involving a 2001 Accord last month. It is the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, not the Orlando Sheriff’s Office.

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/business/nik-wallendas-risk-for-discovery-channel-points-to-tvs-audience-troubles.html] on Saturday about the Discovery Channel’s broadcast of Nik Wallenda’s high-wire walk between two Chicago skyscrapers described the reach of the televised event incorrectly. It was beamed to more than 220 countries and territories, not to that many countries alone. (There are 195 countries in the world, or 196 if Taiwan is included as an independent country).

WEEKEND

A listing of credits[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/movies/life-of-riley-alain-resnaiss-swan-song.html] on Oct. 24 with a review of “Life of Riley,” the final film by Alain Resnais, who died in March, omitted a writer. Besides Laurent Herbiet and Alex Reval (a pseudonym for Mr. Resnais), who wrote the screenplay based on the play by Alan Ayckbourn, Jean-Marie Besset also wrote the dialogue.

OBITUARIES

An obituary[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/media/tom-magliozzi-one-half-of-the-jovial-brothers-on-car-talk-dies-at-77.html] on Tuesday about Tom Magliozzi, one of the two brothers who hosted the NPR show “Car Talk,” contained several errors.

The do-it-yourself car repair shop founded by Mr. Magliozzi and his brother, Ray, was initially called Hackers Haven, not Hackers Heaven. The “Car Talk” shows were recorded; they were not broadcast live. The astronaut John M. Grunsfeld called “Car Talk” in 1997 from the Russian space station Mir, not from the International Space Station. Mr. Magliozzi’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was in economics, politics and engineering, not in chemical engineering.

And because of an editing error, the obituary misstated part of the history of “Car Talk.” It became a national show in 1987 — not 1977, which is the year it began as a local show in Boston.

An obituary[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/us/brittany-maynard-death-with-dignity-ally-dies-at-29.html] on Tuesday about Brittany Maynard, who became a public face for the “death with dignity” movement in the United States after she was found to have terminal brain cancer, referred incorrectly to a woman who asked Ms. Maynard to reconsider her decision to end her own life. That woman is dying from breast cancer that has metastasized — not from “the same cancer” as Ms. Maynard.

Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, expanded their hold on the House, and defended some of the most closely contested governors' races, in a repudiation of President Obama that will reorder the political map in his final years in office.

Propelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president, Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a shrewd Republican tactician, cruised to re-election and stood poised to achieve a goal he has pursued for years -- Senate majority leader.

An election that started as trench warfare, state by state and district by district, crested into a sweeping Republican victory. Contests that were expected to be close were not, and races expected to go Democratic broke narrowly for the Republicans. The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety, leaving voters in a punishing mood, particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West, where political polarization deepened.

The biggest surprises of the night came in North Carolina, where the Republican, Thom Tillis, came from behind to beat Senator Kay Hagan, and in Virginia. There, Senator Mark Warner, a former Democratic governor of the state, was thought to be one of the safest incumbents in his party, and instead found himself clinging to the narrowest of leads against a former Republican Party chairman, Ed Gillespie.

Those contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government, embodied by Mr. Obama.

House seats where Democrats had fought off Republican encroachment for years were finally toppled. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was easily re-elected in Wisconsin, a state that voted twice for Mr. Obama. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, once considered endangered, finished the night on top. And states that had seemingly been trending Democratic, like Colorado and Iowa, fell into Republican hands.

With at least a nine-seat gain and most likely more, House Republicans will have close to 245 seats, the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration.

''Barack Obama has our country in a ditch, and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him,'' said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''The punishment is going to be broad, and it's going to be pretty serious.''

The breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign. And it left Mr. Obama with a decision to make: Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest, such as tax reform and trade, or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comeback?

''Just because we have a two-party system doesn't mean we have to be in perpetual conflict,'' vowed Mr. McConnell, in a victory speech.

White House officials accepted the overture and said Mr. Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on Friday.

For Republicans, the victories piled up, winning not only Senate Democratic seats they were expected to take -- Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas -- but also in states that were supposed to be close. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican, crushed Senator Mark Udall in Colorado. In Georgia, the Democrat Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, was widely expected to force David Perdue, a Republican businessman, into a runoff for the Senate seat of Saxby Chambliss, a retiring Republican. Instead, Mr. Perdue won more than half the vote to take the race outright.

Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, also fended off the independent challenger Greg Orman, who just weeks ago appeared headed to victory.

And for Democrats, it could get worse. Votes were still being tallied in Alaska, where Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, was trying to hold back the wave. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was able to force her strongest Republican foe, Representative Bill Cassidy, into a Dec. 6 runoff. But the combined vote of the top two Republicans in the race easily eclipsed hers.

''I think it's a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country, and the competency of the current administration,'' said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''Most people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families, and I think that's something that both parties need to listen to.''

One bright spot for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, fended off Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, according to projections by The Associated Press. In Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a Democrat and political novice, easily defeated the Republican governor, Tom Corbett.

And in the panhandle of Florida, Gwen Graham, daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor, defeated Representative Steve Southerland, a Tea Party favorite.

But those high notes were swamped by the lows for the president's party. In Arkansas, Representative Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran, defeated Senator Mark Pryor, despite the efforts of former President Bill Clinton.

In Colorado, Mr. Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague, Senator Michael Bennet, to an unexpected victory in 2010. He was not even close, and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraception.

And in West Virginia, Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, to become that state's first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956. In Iowa, Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that state's congressional delegation.

Two years after handing Democrats broad victories, voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia. Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it. Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted, according to surveys. Among those who voted for a Democrat, only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party. Republican voters were more conflicted; among those who voted Republican, one of four viewed the party unfavorably.

Mr. Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans, something for which he has shown little inclination, and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of ''no.''

Even though a record $4 billion poured into the election -- from the campaigns, parties and outside groups for advertising and other candidate support -- the money did little to stir enthusiasm as the campaign set a more dubious mark for its low levels of voter interest.

For their part, Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr. Obama -- young voters, women and minorities -- to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections. Decisions like Mr. Obama's delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituencies.

Even the president conceded the steep climb his allies faced.

''This is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,'' Mr. Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday. ''There are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt Republican.''

Democratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his party's political standing in Congress in the post-World War II era. It was a stunning reversal for the president, who was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national vote.

''The top issue is not jobs and the economy; it's ending gridlock in Washington,'' said Mr. Portman. ''Second, there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola. I don't think those goals are inconsistent.''

With the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage, Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012, when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the party's brand and elevated candidates who could not win.

From the beginning, party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged. The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee.

The establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi; cleared the Republican field for Mr. Gardner in Colorado; and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Alaska.

Democrats tried to distance themselves from the president's health care law and economic policies, despite signs that both may be working. In Colorado, Mr. Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, Senator Michael Bennet, to victory in 2010, speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception. That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post, which castigated him for an ''obnoxious, one-issue campaign.''

Lost was Mr. Udall's work in the Senate opposing Mr. Obama's policies on security surveillance and privacy.

In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, considered a strong challenger to Mr. McConnell, lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr. Obama, and ran a risk-averse campaign.

But mainly, Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska, in a year when disengaged, frustrated voters and Mr. Obama's low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone.

Note: We have published two additional lessons about the Ebola virus in West Africa[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/learning-from-disaster-exploring-the-ebola-epidemic/] and the United States[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/detection-prevention-and-treatment-researching-issues-around-ebola-in-the-united-states/].

Overview | What mathematical principles describe the spread of disease? How can we mathematically model an epidemic?

In this lesson, students explore the fundamental mathematical concepts underlying the spread of contagious diseases. Using a simple exponential model, students compare and contrast the effects of different transmission rates on a population and develop an understanding of the nature and characteristics of exponential growth. Students can then compare their projections with actual Ebola data from West Africa, to create context for analyzing the strengths and limitations of this simplified model.

Materials | Computers with Internet access; graphing utilities

Warm-Up: Have students get up to speed on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa by reading The New York Times’s Ebola Facts page. Students can quickly learn about where Ebola comes from[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html#origination], what the symptoms are, and how contagious the virus is.

After they have a sense of what Ebola is, have students focus on some of the quantitative aspects of the outbreak: How many new cases are being reported? How many people have been infected in West Africa? How many people could become infected?

Ask students to think about why it is important to understand how a disease spreads, and how that knowledge can be used to help treat victims and respond to an epidemic.

Related: In “As Ebola Spreads, So Have Several Fallacies,” Carl Zimmer compares Ebola with a far more common virus: the flu.

Unlike Ebola, the influenza virus is truly airborne. And if recent history is any guide, it will kill thousands in the coming months.

Flu viruses and Ebola viruses take different routes to the same biological goal: to get into new hosts and replicate. Scientists have learned a great deal about the devious ways in which they manage to do it.

Yet misconceptions about how they travel continue to circulate, including the persistent notion that Ebola, like influenza, is airborne. The uncertainty only grows when possible new cases are identified

Read the entire article with your class, then answer the questions below.

Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

* How can the flu transmitted?

* How can Ebola be transmitted?

* What makes a virus an “airborne” virus?

* What kinds of symptoms do flu and Ebola victims share?

* What kinds of symptoms do flu victims suffer than Ebola victims generally do not?

Activity

In this activity, students will explore the behavior of exponential functions by using them to model the spread of disease. It is important to note that, while meaningful in this context, the exponential growth model offers a very simplified view of a very complex phenomenon. Students are asked to consider some of the limitations of this model at the end of the initial activity.

Begin by asking students to consider how a rumor might spread among a population. Suppose on Day 1 a single person tells someone else a rumor, and suppose that on every subsequent day, each person who knows the rumor tells exactly one other person the rumor. Have students ponder, discuss and answer questions like: “How many days until 50 people have heard the rumor? 100 people? The whole school? The whole country?”

In the situation with the rumor, the number of people who have heard the rumor doubles every day; this is because, each day, every person who knows the rumor tells it to a new person. In other words, there is a 100 percent transmission rate: 100 percent of those who know the rumor spread it to someone else. A transmission rate this high means that the number of people who know the rumor will grow very quickly. In fact, in this simplified exponential model, one person could spread the rumor to the entire population of the United States in less than a month!

Mathematically, the spread of disease can be modeled in a manner similar to the spread of a rumor. Although a number of simplifying assumptions must be made, the simple exponential model captures the basic impact of transmission rates on the dispersion of a disease among a population. Students can explore the consequences of transmission rate using multiplication, algebra, graphing utilities and elementary statistics.

One way to explore the exponential model is through simple multiplication. In the rumor example, the number of people who know the rumor doubles every day, and so repeated multiplication by 2 is used to calculate how many people know the rumor. For example, after four days, the total number of people who know the rumor has doubled four times, and so is 1 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.

If the transmission rate were, say, 50 percent instead of 100 percent, then repeated multiplication by 1.5 would be used. This would mean that, each day, 50% of those infected would infect someone else. In general, if the rate of transmission as a percent is r %, then the number used in repeated multiplication would be 1 + r/100. For example, if the transmission rate is 6 percent, use 1 + 6/100 = 1.06; if r = 50%, use 1 + 50/100 = 1.5.

This repeated multiplication can be expressed using exponential functions. In the initial rumor example, the function would be y = 2^x, or two raised to the power of x. Here, y represents the number of people infected and x represents the number of days that have passed since day zero. If the transmission rate is 50 percent, the function would be y = (1.5)^x, and in general for a transmission rate of r %, the function would be y = (1+ r/100)^x. Students with more knowledge of exponentials can use the familiar function y = Pe^(rt).

Have students use calculators and graphing utilities to explore the consequences of different transmission rates. For various values of r, like 50, 10, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01 percents and so on, have students investigate questions like “How long until 100 people are infected? 1,000 people? 10,000 people?” Have students graph a variety of exponential models with different transmission rates using calculators or graphing utilities like Desmos[http://www.desmos.com/], the free online graphing calculator, and ask them to compare and contrast how the populations are affected based on the graphs.

One important characteristic of exponential growth is doubling time. For a fixed rate of growth, the amount of time it takes for the infected population to double in size will be constant. That is, the amount of time it takes for the number of cases to increase from 100 to 200 is the same as the amount of time it takes for the number of cases to go from 1,000 to 2,000. Have students find the doubling times for each of the above rates. Doubling time is a useful tool in quickly estimating growth in a population.

Have students present their graphs and calculations, and discuss their findings. Have them compare their graphs with the graphs of actual data on infections from West African countries to see if their models seem reasonable, and ask students to ponder what impact lowering the transmission rate[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/health/visuals-ebola-model.html] can have on a population.

Facilitate a conversation with students about the strengths and weakness of this particular model. For example, one strength of this model is its relative simplicity: It’s easy to work with, while still capturing an essential characteristic of the spread of disease, namely that each infected person each day has some chance of infecting other people.

However, there are many limitations to this model. Typically, a person can only transmit a disease for a fixed period of time, but in this simple model, one person continues to infect others indefinitely. Also, in this simple model the rate of transmission never changes; in actuality, rates of transmission may go down as knowledge of the epidemic spreads or as governments take measures to stem an outbreak, as this interactive graph[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/health/visuals-ebola-model.html] demonstrates.

Going Further

Compare Projections: Students can compare their projections with actual data from The Times[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] or other sources[https://blog.datamarket.com/2014/10/15/ebola-data-on-datamarket/]. A simple comparison could involve data points and graphs, while more sophisticated math students could use graphing utilities to run regressions on the real world data to estimate the actual transmission rates of Ebola in various locations.

Use the Logistic Growth Model: The logistic growth model is a more complicated, but more realistic, model for the spread of disease. Have students investigate how this model differs from the simple exponential growth model. Students with stronger mathematical backgrounds can use computing technologies to run logistic regressions on the actual data.

Compare Contagious Diseases: Have students compare Ebola with other known viruses and diseases in this chart[http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases] that maps a disease’s deadliness against its contagiousness, as measure by its “reproduction number.” Students can further investigate how a disease’s reproduction number is determined and applied in studying outbreaks.

Gamify Epidemic Prevention: Students can play this fun graph theory-based game that illustrates how disease can spread through a network. And they can read about how scientists are using other networks, like cellphones and social networks, to analyze and study the spread of Ebola.

Has the World Forgotten the Central African Republic?

A “forgotten crisis.” That’s how the Council on Foreign Relationsdefines[http://blogs.cfr.org/campbell/2014/10/22/central-african-republic-forgotten-crisis/] the state of affairs in the Central African Republic — a landlocked stretch of scrubland and dry forest wedged between Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“The Ebola crisis in West Africa has distracted international attention from developments in other parts of Africa, notably in the Central African Republic,” writes Thomas Zuber, a master’s candidate in international political economy at Fordham University and an intern for the Council on Foreign Relations Africa studies program. “Since October 7, violence has escalated in C.A.R.’s capital, Bangui,” he reports. “The most recent renewal of hostilities has already displaced 65,000 people. On Oct. 9, a U.N. convoy was attacked on the outskirts of Bangui. The mission repelled an attack on the interim president’s house on October 11.

“These developments serve as reminders of the obstacles facing Minusca,” the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, Mr. Zuber explains: sustained conflict between the Muslim Seleka (“Alliance”) rebels and the mainly Christian “anti-balaka” (“anti-machete”), a weak interim government “and one of the worst food crises in the country’s history.”

Amanda Taub, writing for Vox[http://www.vox.com/2014/10/29/7078285/car-human-rights-explainer], calls the situation in the Central African Republic “one of the world’s least-understood crises.” And the fighting is unlikely to stop, thanks to a government that is “weak or entirely powerless.” Military involvement, she says, “has become a way for fighters to gain everything from material goods to political power. And because the state and peacekeepers lack the strength to protect civilians, violence against Muslim and Christian communities begets reprisals, which beget more violence.”

“In other words,” she says, “until peace has more to offer, the fighting won’t stop.”

Sectarian conflict in the Central African Republic is especially notable because, until recently, its Christians and Muslims generally coexisted in peace. The Seleka was formed in 2012 “by disaffected Muslim military and political leaders,” Ms. Taub reports, “who felt they’d been sidelined for their religion. They easily conquered the capital, installing Seleka leader Michel Djotodia in power. But the campaign quickly bled into sectarian killings, with rebels slaughtering civilians from communities that did not bend to them, often by rule-by-terror methods such as burning them alive.”

The anti-balaka formed in response — a mixture of “old regime security forces” and young Christian men looking for vengeance. “The anti-balaka mission almost immediately expanded to include launching reprisal killings against Muslim civilians, and eventually expelling Muslims entirely,” Ms. Taub says.

A reason the world seems to have forgotten the Central African Republic is its general inaccessibility, says Madeleine Logan, blogging for Unicef[http://blogs.unicef.org/2014/10/10/going-where-nobody-else-can-in-central-african-republic/]. “Just to give you an example: One-and-a-half weeks ago, a convoy from Unicef headquarters in Bangui headed off to set up a new field office in the far east of the country,” she recalls, “a town called Zemio over 1,000 kilometers from the capital. The roads are in bad condition, and they are dangerous. Our drivers would take four days to get there overland, and required a military escort.”

Obstacles added up to a two-week delay, she says. “This is what we’re up against. There are tracts of Central African Republic where there is no humanitarian presence, because they are too dangerous or too remote. But these are exactly the places where Unicef needs to be if we are to live up to our mission to help the most disadvantaged children: those who are hardest to reach.”

“Take a look at the World section of nearly any mainstream news outlet and the main story will be Iraq, Syria, Ukraine or Gaza,” writes Nathalie Baptiste for a joint report by The Nation and Foreign Policy in Focus[http://fpif.org/car-forgotten-crisis-heart-africa/]. “At a time of so many global calamities, it’s easy for smaller countries in which the United States lacks a vested interest to fall by the wayside. And that’s exactly what’s happened in the Central African Republic.”

Despite a refugee crisis to rival Syria’s, “the international community hasn’t done nearly enough to alleviate suffering in C.A.R.,” she says. “In 2013, C.A.R. was the fifth most underfunded U.N. appeal and appeared in Echo’s ‘Forgotten Crisis Assessment’ in both 2012[http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/policies/strategy/fca_2011_2012.pdf] and 2013[http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/policies/strategy/fca_2012_2013.pdf].

“Not only has the international community failed C.A.R., the media’s scant coverage of the crisis means that the average Westerner is wholly unaware of what’s happening in the country. Unlike for Gaza, there have been no marches or protests in support of humanitarian aid for the civilians in the Central African Republic,” she explains.

This needs to change, she says. Echoes of Darfur and Rwanda are loud, clear and present, and as “President Obama’s foray into Iraq has been billed as a humanitarian intervention,” there is no logical reason to ignore the strife caused by fighting between the Seleka and anti-balaka. There should be “millions of dollars in aid money and assistance for the country in the heart of Africa that is on the brink of collapse,” Ms. Baptiste insists. But if recent history is any indication of how events will play out, the human rights advocacy community isn’t holding its breath.

Resurgent Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, expanded their hold on the House[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/republicans-maintain-control-of-house-and-party-leaders-face-new-questions.html], and defended some of the most closely contested governors’ races, in a repudiation of President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] that will reorder the political map in his final years in office[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/president-obama-left-fighting-for-his-own-relevancy.html].

Propelled by economic dissatisfaction and anger toward the president, Republicans grabbed Democratic Senate seats in North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Montana and South Dakota to gain their first Senate majority since 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mitch_mcconnell/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Kentucky, a shrewd Republican tactician, cruised to re-election[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-wins-sixth-term-in-us-senate.html] and stood poised to achieve a goal he has pursued for years — Senate majority leader.

An election that started as trench warfare, state by state and district by district, crested into a sweeping Republican victory. Contests that were expected to be close were not, and races expected to go Democratic broke narrowly for the Republicans. The uneven character of the economic recovery added to a sense of anxiety, leaving voters in a punishing mood, particularly for Democrats in Southern states and the Mountain West, where political polarization deepened.

The biggest surprises of the night came in North Carolina, where the Republican, Thom Tillis[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/us/politics/north-carolina-senate-campaigns-play-to-dislikes-in-effort-to-stoke-interest.html], came from behind to beat Senator Kay Hagan, and in Virginia. There, Senator Mark Warner, a former Democratic governor of the state, was thought to be one of the safest incumbents in his party, and instead found himself clinging to the narrowest of leads against a former Republican Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/republican_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org] chairman, Ed Gillespie.

Those contests were measures of how difficult the terrain was for Democrats in an election where Republicans put together their strategy as a referendum on the competence of government, embodied by Mr. Obama.

House seats where Democrats had fought off Republican encroachment for years were finally toppled. Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was easily re-elected in Wisconsin[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/walker-wins-reelection-in-wisconsin-and-hope-of-a-higher-office.html], a state that voted twice for Mr. Obama. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott, once considered endangered, finished the night on top[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/scott-fends-off-crist-in-testy-florida-governors-race.html]. And states that had seemingly been trending Democratic, like Colorado and Iowa, fell into Republican hands.

With at least a nine-seat gain and most likely more, House Republicans will have close to 245 seats, the largest Republican majority since the Truman administration.

“Barack Obama has our country in a ditch, and many of his lieutenants running for the Senate were right there with him,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. “The punishment is going to be broad, and it’s going to be pretty serious.”

The breadth of the Republican victories also reset the political landscape ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign. And it left Mr. Obama with a decision to make: Will he move toward Republicans in his final years in areas of common interest, such as tax reform and trade, or will he dig in and hope Republican overreach will give his party a lane for a comeback?

“Just because we have a two-party system doesn’t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict,” vowed Mr. McConnell, in a victory speech.

White House officials accepted the overture and said Mr. Obama had invited the bipartisan leadership of Congress to the White House on Friday.

For Republicans, the victories piled up, winning not only Senate Democratic seats they were expected to take — Montana, West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas — but also in states that were supposed to be close. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican, crushed Senator Mark Udall in Colorado[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/udall-loses-senate-seat-to-gardner-a-republican.html]. In Georgia, the Democrat Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn, was widely expected to force David Perdue, a Republican businessman, into a runoff for the Senate seat of Saxby Chambliss, a retiring Republican. Instead, Mr. Perdue won more than half the vote to take the race outright[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/perdue-wins-senate-seat-and-deal-is-re-elected-as-governor.html].

Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, also fended off the independent challenger Greg Orman[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/republicans-brownback-and-roberts-fend-off-challengers-in-kansas.html], who just weeks ago appeared headed to victory[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/us/politics/national-gop-moves-to-take-over-campaign-of-kansas-senator.html].

And for Democrats, it could get worse. Votes were still being tallied in Alaska, where Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, was trying to hold back the wave. Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was able to force her strongest Republican foe, Representative Bill Cassidy, into a Dec. 6 runoff[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/in-louisiana-challenger-pushes-landrieu-to-runoff.html]. But the combined vote of the top two Republicans in the race easily eclipsed hers.

“I think it’s a message from the American people about their concern about the direction of the country, and the competency of the current administration,” said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Most people have voted to end the dysfunction and to get back to legislating on issues that will help them and their families, and I think that’s something that both parties need to listen to.”

One bright spot for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, fended off Scott Brown[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/emphasizing-sense-of-place-shaheen-beats-brown-to-keep-senate-seat.html], the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, according to projections by The Associated Press. In Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a Democrat and political novice, easily defeated the Republican governor, Tom Corbett.

And in the panhandle of Florida, Gwen Graham, daughter of a former Democratic senator and governor, defeated Representative Steve Southerland, a Tea Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tea_party_movement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] favorite.

But those high notes were swamped by the lows for the president’s party. In Arkansas, Representative Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican and an Iraq War veteran, defeated Senator Mark Pryor, despite the efforts of former President Bill Clinton.

In Colorado, Mr. Udall tried to replicate the storied ground game that helped propel his Democratic colleague, Senator Michael Bennet, to an unexpected victory in 2010. He was not even close, and drew further criticism for running a campaign that some felt was too focused on abortion rights and contraception.

And in West Virginia, Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, won the Senate seat long held by Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat, to become that state’s first female senator and the first Republican elected to the Senate from West Virginia since 1956. In Iowa, Joni Ernst also made history by becoming the first woman to be elected in that state’s congressional delegation.

Two years after handing Democrats broad victories, voters again seemed to be reaching for a way to end Washington inertia. Yet the results on Tuesday may serve only to reinforce it. Voters appeared unsure of just what they wanted, according to surveys. Among those who voted for a Democrat, only one out of eight expressed an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Republican voters were more conflicted; among those who voted Republican, one of four viewed the party unfavorably.

Mr. Obama is left with the prospect of finding a new path to work with Republicans, something for which he has shown little inclination, and Republicans must find a way to demonstrate they are more than the party of “no.”

Even though a record $4 billion poured into the election[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/22/at-nearly-4-billion-the-most-expensive-midterms-ever/] — from the campaigns, parties and outside groups for advertising and other candidate support — the money did little to stir enthusiasm as the campaign set a more dubious mark for its low levels of voter interest.

For their part, Democrats were hindered by their inability to persuade members of the coalition that delivered the White House to Mr. Obama — young voters, women and minorities — to turn out at levels seen in presidential elections. Decisions like Mr. Obama’s delay of executive action on behalf of illegal immigrants also angered crucial constituencies.

Even the president conceded the steep climb his allies faced.

“This is possibly the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,” Mr. Obama told a Connecticut public radio station on Tuesday. “There are a lot of states that are being contested where they just tend to tilt Republican.”

Democratic midterm losses during the Obama presidency now rival those of both Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1994 as the most destructive to his party’s political standing in Congress in the post-World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] era. It was a stunning reversal for the president, who was the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win a majority of the national vote.

“The top issue is not jobs and the economy; it’s ending gridlock in Washington,” said Mr. Portman. “Second, there is a desire to hold the administration accountable for incompetence on issues like ISIS and Ebola. I don’t think those goals are inconsistent.”

With the political climate and the electoral map playing to their decided advantage, Republicans were determined not to relive the elections of 2010 and 2012, when infighting between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents damaged the party’s brand and elevated candidates who could not win.

From the beginning, party officials decided to take sides when fierce primary challenges emerged. The party establishment crushed challengers to Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, and to Senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee.

The establishment also sent reinforcements to help Senator Thad Cochran eke out a runoff victory against a Tea Party firebrand in Mississippi; cleared the Republican field for Mr. Gardner in Colorado; and backed winning primary candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Alaska.

Democrats tried to distance themselves from the president’s health care law[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and economic policies, despite signs that both may be working. In Colorado, Mr. Udall relied on the playbook that propelled his Colorado colleague and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, Senator Michael Bennet, to victory in 2010, speaking almost exclusively about abortion rights and contraception. That cost him the endorsement of The Denver Post, which castigated him for an “obnoxious, one-issue campaign.”

Lost was Mr. Udall’s work in the Senate opposing Mr. Obama’s policies on security surveillance and privacy.

In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes, considered a strong challenger to Mr. McConnell, lost some support when she refused to say whether she voted for Mr. Obama, and ran a risk-averse campaign.

But mainly, Democrats were working off a map heavily tilted toward Republicans in states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska, in a year when disengaged, frustrated voters and Mr. Obama’s low approval ratings were inevitably going to be a millstone.

Correction: November 4, 2014, Tuesday

An earlier version of a slide show that appeared with this article on the home page and politics section of NYTimes.com misstated the office of Jeanne Shaheen. She is in the Senate, not the House. An earlier version of this article also misstated the location of a town where one woman voted. It was Salem, N.H., not Salem, Mass.

A President Left Fighting to Keep His Relevance

WASHINGTON -- Two things were clear long before the votes were counted on Tuesday night: President Obama would face a Congress with more Republicans for his final two years in office, and the results would be seen as a repudiation of his leadership.

But that was not the way Mr. Obama saw it. The electoral map was stacked against him, he argued, making Democrats underdogs from the start. And his own party kept him off the trail, meaning he never really got the chance to make his case. ''You're in the Final Four,'' as one aide put it, ''and you're on the bench with a walking boot and you don't get to play.''

The Republican capture of the Senate culminated a season of discontent for the president -- and may yet open a period of even deeper frustration. Sagging in the polls and unwelcome in most competitive races across the country, Mr. Obama bristled as the last campaign that would influence his presidency played out while he sat largely on the sidelines. He privately complained that it should not be a judgment on him. ''He doesn't feel repudiated,'' the aide said Tuesday night.

But in a hyperactive, deeply polarized time in history, Mr. Obama now faces a daunting challenge in reasserting his relevance in a capital that will soon enough shift its attention to the battle to succeed him. If the hope-and-change phase of his presidency is long over, he wants at least to produce a period of progress and consolidation to complete his time in the White House.

He will kick off that effort on Wednesday when aides expect him to hold a news conference seeking bipartisan accommodation on issues of mutual interest, and he plans to host Republican and Democratic leaders at the White House on Friday. At the same time, aides said, Mr. Obama is eager to throw off the constraints of a campaign that he did not direct and begin to defend his record in a more robust way.

''He's going to be aggressive. He's ready to go,'' said another senior official, who like others did not want to be identified discussing plans before the election results were tabulated. ''We've got a lot of important stuff to get done in the lame duck. He'll talk about that tomorrow. We've got a lot of important stuff to get done in the last two years. He's anxious to get going on that.''

To Republicans, it sounded as if Mr. Obama was hardly chastened or heeding the message of the election, evidently more anxious to find excuses than to rethink the way he has governed. Absent a change in attitude from the president and a genuine outreach on issues that matter to them, Republicans said, the next two years could simply usher in even more political squabbling.

''There's a huge opportunity to get things done if his frame of mind is in the right place, and it's not clear it is,'' said Sara Taylor Fagen, who was President George W. Bush's political director when he lost Congress in 2006. ''He's never shown an interest or willingness to work with members of Congress. Talk to Democrats -- they don't feel he ever made an effort to court them. It's not clear he'll make an effort to court Republicans.''

Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, said both parties needed to find a way to get past their mutual suspicions to forge a new working relationship. ''He feels burned, and we feel burned too,'' Mr. Kinzinger said. ''For four years, it's been a lot of mistrust on both sides.''

Just two years after Mr. Obama's re-election, the midterm results underscored just how far he has fallen in the public mind. Nearly six out of 10 voters on Tuesday expressed negative feelings about his administration, according to exit polls. For every two voters who said they had cast ballots to support Mr. Obama, three said they were voting to express their opposition to him.

The electorate was deeply pessimistic about the country, with seven out of 10 describing the economy as not so good or poor and eight out of 10 expressing worry about the direction of the economy in the next year.

Numbers like that discouraged Mr. Obama's aides, who said they had not done a good job getting out the president's record, noting that the deficit has fallen by half, unemployment is now below 6 percent, the price of gasoline has fallen sharply and the economy is growing at a decent rate.

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. talked about that at a lunch last week, according to an administration official, and the vice president later gave voice to it in a CNN interview aired on Monday. ''We have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we're looking to do,'' Mr. Biden said.

But Mr. Obama was focused on the odds against him. His staff researched it and told him that no president in more than a half-century had as many Senate seats open in states lost by the president. ''This is probably the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower,'' Mr. Obama told WNPR radio in Connecticut on Tuesday.

In those red states, Mr. Obama was politically toxic and deferred to candidates who asked him to stay away. In the last days of the campaign, he visited just five states, compared with 10 states visited by Mr. Bush in similar circumstances in 2006. ''The White House concluded that it should be the responsibility of those individuals who have their names at the top of the ballot to drive the strategy,'' said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.

Mr. Obama understood in some cases but privately resented others. ''We think that was a mistake,'' one aide said. Mr. Obama's irritation became clear when he said publicly that even if he was not on the ballot, his policies were, a comment that Republicans gleefully wrapped around the necks of their Democratic opponents. So Mr. Obama held his tongue, but privately kept quizzing his political director, David Simas, about the latest information on early voting.

He had long ago given up hope that he would be able to push through some of his favorite priorities before leaving office. He told a former aide several weeks ago that he knew he would never be able to expand pre-kindergarten as he once hoped, and regretted it. But he hopes for possible deals on corporate taxes, trade and infrastructure. And he will try to use the lame-duck session of the departing Democratic Senate to push through as many nominations as possible.

Whether Republicans are open to dealing with him in the new year remains uncertain. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives will resist. But Speaker John A. Boehner will have one of the largest House Republican caucuses in modern times, giving him more room to maneuver because he can afford to lose some dissenters if he makes common cause with Mr. Obama.

Anita Dunn, a former White House adviser to Mr. Obama, noted that voters on Tuesday were just as negative about Republican leaders as they were about Mr. Obama. In the end, she said, voters were eager not for more failure but for progress by both parties. ''The message for anybody who's in power is that voters are looking for a change in how they approach getting things done,'' Ms. Dunn said.

Mr. Obama’s day on Tuesday was spent in almost defiant disinterest in the elections that would steer his fate. He had lunch again with Mr. Biden, then met with Christine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, and later with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. He also convened a meeting on the latest developments on the Ebola outbreak.

Aides said he was briefed from time to time about the elections, but beyond calling four radio stations, he made no public comments on them and headed back to the residential quarters for the evening to watch the results, updated by David Simas, his political director.

Mr. Obama is not the first second-term president to lose seats in his last midterm election, nor is he the first to find plenty of explanations for why that was not a judgment on his tenure. There is something about this point in a presidency that brings trouble — the last four two-term presidents all faced arguably the greatest crisis of their own creation about this time.

Richard Nixon resigned just three months before his second midterm. Ronald Reagan became caught up in the Iran-contra scandal, which was revealed in the days after his. Bill Clinton was impeached barely six weeks later. And George W. Bush faced a war that he was on the verge of losing. And yet Mr. Reagan, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush also rose to the occasion during the remainder of their terms, surpassing their problems to score important achievements in their final years.

Anita Dunn, a former White House adviser to Mr. Obama, noted that voters on Tuesday were just as negative about Republican leaders as they were about Mr. Obama. In the end, she said, voters were eager not for more failure but for progress by both parties. “The message for anybody who’s in power is that voters are looking for a change in how they approach getting things done.”

Ebola sounds like the stuff of nightmares. Bird flu and SARS also send shivers down my spine. But I’ll tell you what scares me most: artificial intelligence.

The first three, with enough resources, humans can stop. The last, which humans are creating, could soon become unstoppable.

Before we get into what could possibly go wrong, let me first explain what artificial intelligence is. Actually, skip that. I’ll let someone else explain it: Grab an iPhone and ask Siri about the weather or stocks. Or tell her “I’m drunk.” Her answers are artificially intelligent.

Right now these artificially intelligent machines are pretty cute and innocent, but as they are given more power in society, these machines may not take long to spiral out of control[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/weekinreview/24markoff.html].

In the beginning, the glitches will be small but eventful. Maybe a rogue computer momentarily derails the stock market, causing billions in damage. Or a driverless car freezes on the highway because a software update goes awry.

But the upheavals can escalate quickly and become scarier and even cataclysmic. Imagine how a medical robot, originally programmed to rid cancer, could conclude that the best way to obliterate cancer is to exterminate humans who are genetically prone to the disease.

Nick Bostrom[http://www.nickbostrom.com/], author of the book “Superintelligence,” lays out a number of petrifying doomsday settings[http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html]. One envisions self-replicating nanobots, which are microscopic robots designed to make copies of themselves. In a positive situation, these bots could fight diseases in the human body or eat radioactive material on the planet. But, Mr. Bostrom says, a “person of malicious intent in possession of this technology might cause the extinction of intelligent life on Earth.”

Artificial-intelligence proponents argue that these things would never happen and that programmers are going to build safeguards[http://www.computerworld.com/article/2840815/ai-researchers-say-elon-musks-fears-not-completely-crazy.html]. But let’s be realistic: It took nearly a half-century for programmers to stop computers from crashing every time you wanted to check your email. What makes them think they can manage armies of quasi-intelligent robots?

I’m not alone in my fear. Silicon Valley’s resident futurist, Elon Musk, recently said artificial intelligence is “potentially more dangerous than nukes.” And Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest people on earth, wrote that successful A. I. “would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last.” There is a long list of computer experts and science fiction writers[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction] also fearful of a rogue robot-infested future.

Two main problems with artificial intelligence lead people like Mr. Musk and Mr. Hawking to worry. The first, more near-future fear, is that we are starting to create machines that can make decisions like humans, but these machines don’t have morality[http://ethicbots.na.infn.it/meetings/kom/veruggio.pdf] and likely never will.

The second, which is a longer way off, is that once we build systems that are as intelligent as humans, these intelligent machines will be able to build smarter machines, often referred to as superintelligence. That, experts say, is when things could really spiral out of control as the rate of growth and expansion of machines would increase exponentially. We can’t build safeguards into something that we haven’t built ourselves.

“We humans steer the future not because we’re the strongest beings on the planet, or the fastest, but because we are the smartest,” said James Barrat[http://www.jamesbarrat.com/], author of “Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.” “So when there is something smarter than us on the planet, it will rule over us on the planet.”

What makes it harder to comprehend is that we don’t actually know[http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/˜eroberts/cs91/projects/ethics-of-ai/sec7_1.html] what superintelligent machines will look or act like. “Can a submarine swim? Yes, but it doesn’t swim like a fish,” Mr. Barrat said. “Does an airplane fly? Yes, but not like a bird. Artificial intelligence won’t be like us, but it will be the ultimate intellectual version of us.”

Perhaps the scariest setting is how these technologies will be used by the military. It’s not hard to imagine countries engaged in an arms race to build machines that can kill[http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/].

Bonnie Docherty[http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10217/Docherty], a lecturer on law at Harvard University and a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that the race to build autonomous weapons with artificial intelligence — which is already underway — is reminiscent of the early days of the race to build nuclear weapons[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and that treaties should be put in place now before we get to a point where machines are killing people on the battlefield.

“If this type of technology is not stopped now, it will lead to an arms race,” said Ms. Docherty, who has written several reports on the dangers of killer robots. “If one state develops it, then another state will develop it. And machines that lack morality and mortally should not be given power to kill.”

So how do we ensure that all these doomsday situations don’t come to fruition? In some instances, we likely won’t be able to stop them.

But we can hinder some of the potential chaos by following the lead
