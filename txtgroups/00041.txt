The city’s leader agreed to the talks but said he will not leave office[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html].

• On Ebola’s trail.

As the authorities in Dallas continue their efforts today to track down those who could have been exposed to the virus, the apartment where the Liberian man fell ill has not yet been cleaned[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html].

An NBC News cameraman helping to cover the outbreak in Liberia tested positive[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/ebola-strikes-american-cameraman-in-liberia.html] for the virus, and is being flown back to the U.S., where he and his crew will be placed in quarantine for 21 days.

• Texas abortion clinics close.

Thirteen abortion clinics were forced to close overnight[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/appeals-court-ruling-closes-13-abortion-clinics-in-texas.html] after a federal appellate court allowed Texas to enforce its abortion law.

No losses appear to have resulted in the computer breach that originated overseas in June, one of the biggest data hacks ever.

NOTEWORTHY

• Popular reads.

The activist Naomi Klein’s “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate” enters the Sunday Book Review’s hardcover nonfiction list[http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html] at No. 5, and Ken Follett starts a new run in hardcover fiction with “Edge of Eternity” at No. 1.

• An addition to the Washington Mall.

Fifteen years after Congress first authorized a memorial for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a federal planning commission gave preliminary approval[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/02/us-usa-eisenhower-memorial-idUSKCN0HR2JE20141002] to Frank Gehry’s revised design.

• The art of spinning yarns.

The National Storytelling Festival[http://www.storytellingcenter.net/news/national-storytelling-festival-preview/] begins today in Jonesborough, Tenn., where writers, poets and performers gather to tell tales and discuss their craft.

The festival, in its 42nd year, also includes sessions on ghost stories and a midnight cabaret.

• Religious touchstones.

Yom Kippur, the most solemn Jewish holiday, starts at sundown.

And more than two million Muslims are converging for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

• Happy bailout day.

Six years ago today, President George W. Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 into law in response to the financial crisis.

The law created the Troubled Asset Relief Program to buy failing bank assets and supply cash directly to banks.

• Baseball milestone.

On this day 40 years ago, Frank Robinson was named manager of the Cleveland Indians, making him the first black man to hold such a role in Major League Baseball. He’s now 79.

BACK STORY

“A trippy, twisty tale.”

That’s how Cara Buckley, who covers the Oscars race for The Times, describes “Inherent Vice,” the highly anticipated film making its premiere at the New York Film Festival on Saturday.

The film won’t reach theaters until later this year, but Ms. Buckley says it’s a wild card in an Oscar season that “as of now has plenty of contenders but no clear front-runner in any major category.”

What are some other films that she considers to be best-picture candidates?

“Gone Girl,” debuting today nationwide, and “Boyhood,” which came out over the summer, are films you can see now in theaters. (More than a dozen other films open today[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/intheaters.html].)

“The Imitation Game,” “The Theory of Everything,” “Foxcatcher” and “Birdman” have all drawn early praise ahead of their releases.

And she says critics are holding out for Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which comes out in November, and “Unbroken,” the Angelina Jolie film opening on Christmas Day.

Joseph Burgess and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.

White House Faces New Pressure on Ebola

Good Friday morning from Washington, where offices will be clearing out early for the start of the Nationals’ playoff run, Mitt Romney reveals a family man-crush, and the president is keeping in close touch with health officials in Texas.

The intense yet chaotic response in Dallas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=second-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] to America’s first diagnosed case of Ebola has put pressure on President Obama to do more to seal off the country[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpHeadline&module=second-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] from the deadly virus.

A spokesman for Mr. Obama vowed to halt Ebola “in its tracks” as signs of public anxiety mounted: minute-by-minute cable news coverage, a widening quarantine and reports of nervous Dallas parents keeping children home from school.

Republicans called for drastic action. Thom Tillis, the Republican candidate for Senate in North Carolina, demanded that Mr. Obama ban travel to and from the West African countries where the virus is spreading rapidly.

Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, never shy in a crisis, accused the president of an “unclear approach to addressing the threat of the Ebola virus” and pressed the Federal Aviation Administration for a plan to prevent people infected with the virus from arriving in the United States by plane, as in the Dallas case.

In the West Wing, administration officials are sticking with the strategy of playing down concerns and urging calm. Mr. Obama himself made only a glancing reference to Ebola in an economic-themed speech he gave Thursday in Chicago.

In an interview with First Draft, Mr. Obama’s top health official said any plan to screen airline passengers for Ebola wouldn’t work. “Who’s going to get screened?” asked Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control. “If you have a positive, where are you going to bring them to?”

The answer, he said, is the concerted effort to contain the virus in Africa, and Mr. Obama announced a surge of resources to the afflicted region two weeks ago. It appears no similar surge is likely in the United States — at least for now.

– Michael D. Shear

 

Question for the F.C.C.: Is ‘Redskins’ a Dirty Word?

Not since Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction has the Federal Communications Commission paid so much attention to football.

After giving the National Football League a verbal lashing on Tuesday when the commission unanimously voted to repeal its sports blackout rule, the F.C.C.’s chairman said the agency was looking at a petition to withdraw the broadcast license of the Washington-area radio station WWXX-FM when it comes up for renewal.

That request was made by John F. Banzhaf III, a George Washington University law professor. Mr. Banzhaf told the F.C.C. that the use of the word “Redskins” in the station’s broadcasts of the Washington football team’s games was racist, profane and “akin to broadcasting obscenity.”

Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, told Broadcasting & Cable last month that he personally thought the name was offensive and should be changed, but that it should be done through public pressure rather than government action.

This new anti-Redskins attempt seems like a long shot, in part because there are plenty of offensive and racist words that are not banned on the airwaves. Even the famed “seven words you can never say on television” that were made famous by the comedian George Carlin was put together by him and not the government.

By the way, the owner of WWXX-FM? Dan Snyder, the Redskins’ owner.

– Edward Wyatt

Republicans Intensify Their On-Air Campaign

Republicans have come surging back in the ad wars after a weak September, when Democrats seemed to dominate the airwaves.

Heading into the final month before Election Day, Republican outside groups are helping even the score with big media buys. As of Tuesday, in seven of the nine top Senate races, Republican groups have bought more advertising time than Democratic groups for the final six weeks of the race, according to a Republican firm that tracks media purchases.

Republicans lead the spending in Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Democrats are spending more in just two states, Alaska and Colorado.

– Ashley Parker

Perry Still Yearns for a Spot Deep in the Heart of Iowa

Not many Midwestern legislative candidates can call on the sitting governor of Texas for a campaign appearance. But not many of them are an Iowan named Grassley.

Gov. Rick Perry will make another pilgrimage to the Hawkeye State today to raise money for State Representative Patrick Grassley, the grandson of Senator Charles E. Grassley.

It is a two-fer for Mr. Perry: He gets to both press the flesh and make connections in the first presidential caucus state and do a favor for Mr. Grassley.

Mr. Perry has been eager to clear his schedule for nearly everyone running for office in Iowa. In the last year, Mr. Perry has made more than 20 campaign stops there, many for state legislative candidates and county Republican organizations, according to Robert Haus, one of the governor’s strategists.

Some in Texas say they are feeling neglected. “He’s been leaving Texas behind and focusing on 2016 for a while now,” said Lisa Paul, a spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party.

– Alan Rappeport

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama travels to Princeton, Ind., to discuss the economy as part of Manufacturing Day.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey heads to Iowa[http://www.northjersey.com/news/christie-to-campaign-for-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-friday-1.1099435] to campaign for Gov. Terry Branstad in Cedar Rapids.

The Labor Department releases its monthly employment report[http://www.bls.gov.proxy.bc.edu/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm] at 8:30 a.m.

Tom Brady and the Romney Family’s Wannabe Bromance

In this Sunday’s New York Times Magazine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/magazine/mitt-isnt-ready-to-call-it-quits-just-yet.html?_r=0], one-time presidential nominee Mitt Romney shared a story about being confused for Secretary of State John Kerry, and revealed that he often tells people who recognize him that he is instead New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

But there is more to the story of how deep the Romney family affection goes for the handsome future Hall of Famer. How deep? Mr. Romney tells another story, at the expense of one of his five sons:

“One of my sons – I won’t tell you which one, he won’t be happy with me – but one of my sons is married to a very beautiful woman,” Mr. Romney said. At their wedding, the unidentified son gave a toast to his bride. “He said, ‘I will always be true to you, unless Tom Brady asks me to marry him,’ ” Mr. Romney said, before discharging the kind of belly laugh rarely heard from him when he was running for president. “We Massachusetts folks have a man-crush on Tom Brady.’’

Returning to politics: Mr. Romney said he believes Mr. Brady is a Republican, though he admits he has nothing to base this on. “Maybe that’s just me projecting what I hope he is,” he allowed.

– Mark Leibovich

What We’re Reading Elsewhere

Jelani Cobb writes in The New Yorker that the Secret Service controversy has given voice to unspoken fears[http://www.newyorker.com.proxy.bc.edu/news/daily-comment/barack-obamas-safety] that President Obama is at greater risk of assassination than most presidents.

Former President George W. Bush tells Fox News the President Obama doesn’t call him as often as he used to call President Clinton. “It doesn’t hurt my feelings,”[http://foxnewsinsider.com/2014/10/02/exclusive-george-w-bush-says-some-us-forces-should-have-stayed-iraq] he said.

Charles Krauthammer, in National Review Online, outlines “what a G.O.P. Senate could do.”[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/389451/if-gop-retakes-senate-charles-krauthammer]

In Rolling Stone, Jeb Lund says that the Florida governor’s race illustrates everything that is wrong with American politics[http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-florida-farce-rick-scott-vs-charlie-crist-20140929].

The Nation has posted an audiotape from a Koch brothers meeting in June aimed at molding conservative candidates[http://www.thenation.com/article/181837/exclusive-audio-how-koch-brothers-are-molding-next-scott-walkers].

The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., reports that State Senator Chris McDaniel is still challenging[http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/10/02/high-court-mulls-mcdaniel-appeal/16601115/] the results of his primary loss to Senator Thad Cochran and is seeking to postpone the Nov. 4 election.

Occasionally in the debates about Christianity’s weakened position within American culture[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/ghosts-chuck-colson-richard-john-neuhaus-first-things/], you’ll hear traditionalists and conservatives analogize the Christian situation, now or soon, to the environment the faith faced in its earliest centuries, as an embattled minority in a hostile pagan empire.

I’m not a particular fan of this analogy, for various reasons: Not only because the lions-and-catacombs imagery risks trivializing the concept of persecution[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/on-persecution/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0#more-19543] at a time when Christians outside the United States face actual Diocletian-style consequences[http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041841/the-war-on-christians/] for their beliefs (and don’t always receive[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/a-last-word-on-the-cruz-affair/] the charity they deserve from their American co-believers), but also because describing contemporary American culture as pagan in the style of the ancient world strikes me as a category error, which underplays the extent to which middlebrow American spirituality[http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/10/desperately-seeking-oprah.html] is still infused with Christian-ish sentiments and assumptions and ideas, and underplays, as well, just how radically different[http://www.nybooks.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/archives/2013/dec/19/rome-sex-freedom/] a thoroughly repaganized society would be from the one we (happily) inhabit today.

All of that said, I wouldn’t want to say that there are never echoes of the ancient world in contemporary religious debates. Consider, as a for instance, this piece in Slate[http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/10/missionary_doctors_treating_ebola_in_africa_why_people_are_suspicious_of.html] from the science writer Brian Palmer, which passively-aggressively complains about the fact that so many of the doctors fighting Ebola on the ground in Africa are … Christians … and worse still, Christian missionaries … and not that there’s anything wrong with that, but actually maybe there is something wrong with that (“I’m not altogether proud of this bias—I’m just trying to be honest”), or at least Palmer wants us to know that he’s a little troubled by its implications (“some missionaries are incapable of separating their religious work from their medical work … I suspect that many others have the same visceral discomfort with the mingling of religion and health care …“) even as, broad-minded guy that he is, he concedes that “until we’re finally ready to invest heavily in secular medicine for Africa,” the missionaries may deserve our grudging support.

The first time I read the piece, I was filled with a stuttering sort of rage, but reading it again it doesn’t actually merit that kind of click-bait outrage. Palmer seems less hostile to Christian missionaries and their work than he is confused by what they’re doing: He clearly has a set of ideological frames through which he sees the world, a set of assumptions (the separation of medicine and religion should be absolute, proselytization is wicked/backward/ignorant, helping people is what governments and secular groups are supposed to do) that simply don’t fit with what’s happening on the ground in Africa and who’s actually there, which in turns leaves him both unsettled and subtly resentful at all these Christian missionary doctors for unsettling him.

Palmer’s worldview, of course, is not the worldview of the classical world, which was far more inegalitarian and cruel than the still-Christian-influenced secular humanism of our own era. But there is still a parallel, at once amusing and illuminating, between his tone in the Slate piece and the tone of some of the surviving comments on Christianity from Roman authorities, which so often married incomprehension, hostility and (eventually) resentment at being, well, shown up by these strange cultists and their zeal. In particular, there’s a little bit of Pliny the younger in Palmer’s essay — the 2nd-century governor of Pontus writing in bureaucratic bafflement[http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/pliny.html] to his emperor (in a tone that W.H. Auden borrowed, I suspect, for his King Herod in “For The Time Being”[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/22/us/beliefs-729090.html]) — and a whole lot of Julian the Apostate, the 4th century emperor who tried and failed to restore paganism, and whose letters[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_letters_1_trans.htm] include various complaints about how “all men see that our people lack aid” from pagan sources, even as “the impious Galilaeans support not only their own poor but ours as well.” 

Adapted to a globalized and (somewhat) more secularized age, that feels like Palmer’s real complaint as well: Not that the missionaries are necessarily doing something wrong (he won’t actually come out and say that), but that they’re doing something right in a way that makes his team, Team Secularism, look somewhat less impressive by comparison. Which isn’t really a reaction that Christians should be offended by. It’s one that should be welcomed, worn as a badge of honor, and joyfully provoked.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

“The paradox of the first lady is that she’s most politically effective when she is not overtly political.”

That’s our reporter Jodi Kantor on Michelle Obama’s unique position in politics as she takes to the campaign trail rallying voters[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/as-michelle-obama-campaigns-some-democrats-fear-her-last-name-is-a-liability.html] on behalf of candidates for governor.

She has a certain credibility with voters, Ms. Kantor says, because she has stuck to her “mom in chief” role in public, shying away from contentious political subjects to instead discuss issues like childhood obesity.

“She can in effect say to audiences, Believe me, I’m just looking at this as a mom, I’m here because I care about our children’s future,” says Ms. Kantor, who wrote a book about the first couple[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/books/the-obamas-by-jodi-kantor-review.html].

It is unclear whether Mrs. Obama’s appearances will be enough to turn the tide of a governor’s race.

“But in closely fought contests,” Ms. Kantor says, “everything counts.”

• End game.

It doesn’t have to end in bloodshed.

Even though some have drawn parallels between Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html] and those in Tiananmen Square in 1989, there are still nonviolent ways out.

“Some kind of compromise might still occur,” says our Hong Kong bureau chief, Keith Bradsher.

Beijing’s leaders won’t accede to the protesters’ demands for Hong Kong’s top executive to resign, but they might agree to tweak the voting process for his successor, Mr. Bradsher says.

And they might “open a longer-running political dialogue,” he says.

But the government may be able to wait the students out. Hong Kong residents are getting frustrated with the disruptions to the city, and small businesses are suffering.

“The crowds are already a little smaller than early this week,” Mr. Bradsher says, “and eventually many protesters may feel a need to return to classes or jobs.”

• Can “Homeland” get its groove back?

The spy drama starring Claire Danes started as a critical darling, only to fall off.

As the show returns Sunday to Showtime for its fourth season, critics[http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/homeland-showtime-season-4-claire-danes/] have expressed a measure of hope[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/arts/television/homeland-begins-its-new-season-on-sunday.html]. The headline on one review[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/10/homeland_season_4_review_showtime_series_premiering_sunday_is_good_again.html]: “‘Homeland’ Is Good Again.”

But reclaiming its former beloved status among television tastemakers would be defying the odds, says Mike Hale, our TV critic.

He pointed to some acclaimed shows that lost their luster: “‘Lost’ is probably the No. 1 example; more recently, ‘True Blood’ and ‘The Killing,’ which got about a half-season of critical love.”

“None of those shows got their aura back,” Mr. Hale says.

“I think that’s partly because there’s a lot of inertia and groupthink among critics,” he says, “and partly because shows actually do tend to decline over their life spans.”

White House Details Ebola Response Plan in Briefing

Under mounting pressure over their handling of the Ebola crisis, White House officials tried Friday to ease public fears that an outbreak could spread throughout the United States.

A 4:30 p.m. briefing featured administration officials, including Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism; Sylvia Mathews Burwell, secretary of health and human services; and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.

“We are using a whole of government response and approach to control this epidemic at its source,” Ms. Monaco said. “I am confident and President Obama is confident that this epidemic will be stopped.”

The United States is expanding Ebola treatment units in West Africa, screening travelers coming to the United States from countries where Ebola is prevalent, and accelerating efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to find a vaccine.

American hospitals have shown a capacity to treat some cases of Ebola, and Ms. Burwell said that the public health system in the United States was equipped to isolate patients and control the epidemic. Countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and New Guinea do not have that capacity, she said.

There is currently a patient infected with Ebola at a hospital in Dallas, and there is a patient with symptoms at a hospital in Washington.

Dr. Fauci tried to assuage concerns that Ebola could be spread like a cold or flu, explaining that it could only be spread through contact with bodily fluids of someone who is infected and symptomatic.

“We have considerable experience dealing with Ebola and controlling outbreaks,” Dr. Fauci said. “The system that’s in place, with our health care infrastructure, would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.”

‘The Knick’ Recap: Desperate for One More Fix

Season 1, Episode 8, “Working Late a Lot”

For two-thirds of a season on “The Knick” we’ve been waiting for Dr. John Thackery’s cocaine addiction to bring him down — not for any moralistic reasons, but just because it seemed like it was destiny. The moment arrived, more or less, on Friday night in the episode “Working Late a Lot.”

War in the Philippines (between the United States and Filipino revolutionaries) disrupted the hospital’s supply of its favorite anesthetic. When Barrow went to Captain Robertson yet again, requesting a few thousand dollars for an emergency cocaine purchase, the captain pointed out that it was his ships that were being sunk. Thackery, cut off, started to fray at the edges — sweating and distracted at a surgical conference, angrily yelling during a consultation — and people started to notice. He received temporary relief when Nurse Lucy brought him three vials she had found at the hospital, reserving one for their personal use later. But before an operation to remove an abscess from a man’s jaw, Thackery was so desperate that he drank a solution of strychnine. This did not appear to be what the doctor ordered — barely able to talk to the viewing gallery, he walked out mid-surgery, forcing Algernon Edwards to take over. (Even though the patient had made it clear he did not want to be operated on by a black doctor.)

The episode ended with Thackery back on Mott Street, where the drug was available but more expensive than usual. He asked Ying Ying for three bowls instead of one, told her to dose him again if he woke up and — in the clearest sign that his condition was worse than usual — declined to have sex with her. Then he lay down and had a vision of finding his mentor Christiansen’s dead body. A bad day all around.

Thackery was having sex with Lucy, however, frequently and loudly. He wasn’t paying much attention to her otherwise, leaving his bed to go to his office and work and not even noticing when she walked in to keep him company. Having sex even more frequently, perhaps, and definitely more secretly, were Algernon and Cornelia Robertson. She even took a cab to his hotel in the black ghetto at 26th Street and Sixth Avenue, turning down a ride home from his father in the process. There they lolled about naked and discussed the many excuses she was using to sneak out of the mansion at night (hence the episode’s title). Despite the nudity, their relationship was still presented pretty chastely — their only onscreen contact was a tender embrace, from which the scene cut to Lucy heaving and moaning beneath Thackery.

Perhaps more dangerous to the Knick than Thackery’s addiction to cocaine was Bertie Chickering’s increasingly open infatuation with Lucy, which could obviously cause some big problems in Thackery and Bertie’s acolyte-and-mentor relationship. Bertie’s kindly milquetoast status was underlined when he suggested a date at the Metropolitan Museum and assured Lucy that there would be no naked French-Polynesian women on display, as there had been the year before. Bertie’s doctor father, meanwhile, continued his campaign to get Bertie away from Thackery’s influence.

Elsewhere: Typhoid Mary Mallon, triumphantly healthy on the witness stand, won her release from quarantine on North Brother Island despite Bertie’s testimony that she was, indeed, a carrier of the disease. She immediately applied for another job as a cook, under an assumed name. (It was a scene that might have sent a shiver down the spine of anyone currently concerned about Ebola.) Everett Gallinger and Sister Harriett brought the foundling baby Grace home to Everett’s bereaved wife, Eleanor, and it seemed as if she might accept the new addition to the family. Later, though, Gallinger came home to find the baby crying and unattended while Eleanor knitted a cap for their dead daughter, Lillian. Herman Barrow went to both the Captain and the Monsignor to ask for money for the Knick. Both claimed that they were overextended as Herman noticed their luxurious lifestyles. A new character, Dr. Levi Zinberg of Mt. Sinai Hospital (Michael Nathanson), was introduced as a competitor for Thackery and an excuse for Thackery and Gallinger to demonstrate that they’re anti-Semitic as well as racist.

So just how low will Thackery sink in the season’s final two episodes? Will Lucy stick by him? Will Bertie leave? Will Cornelia and Algernon be exposed? Let us know what you thought of “Working Late a Lot” in the comments.

Ebola, Fear and a Changing Texas

DALLAS — There is a little Ethiopian cafe here on Park Lane, down the street from where the man city officials call Patient Zero was staying. I walked in and asked the workers standing behind the counter if they knew anything about the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, a Liberian citizen who was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Next to the cash register was a bottle of hand sanitizer.

They did not know him. But they called over a customer. The customer, a middle-aged woman, walked over. I don’t think she heard my question, but she heard one word within it: “Ebola.” With a worried look on her face, she stretched her arm in front of me, pumped the sanitizer a couple times and rubbed it on her hands.

Covering Ebola in Texas is like this — fleeting moments of fear, often stirred by misinformation.

Perhaps if I was sick and infectious with Ebola and had sneezed on my hand, and then I shook her hand, and then she used that same hand to touch her eye, mouth or nose, then maybe, just maybe, she would have had something to worry about. But I didn’t even shake her hand. Ebola carries a kind of scarlet letter even in the United States, particularly in a working-class community of African immigrants, and no amount of news conferences, posters or statements by health officials reminding people that the disease is not spread through casual contact but through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person can fully shake that perception.

The people at the cafe wanted to make something clear, and it had very little to do with Ebola: This was an Ethiopian cafe, and Mr. Duncan was from Liberia. It was as if the two countries were on different planets. Their comments revealed something about covering this story that has been largely ignored in the news media coverage.

Ebola has opened a window into the melting-pot world of Texas immigrants. Outside the apartment complex where Mr. Duncan was staying, a small mob of reporters and cameramen huddled at the gates and desperately called over a man walking to his car. Did he know Mr. Duncan and the others in the apartment? Was he Liberian?

The answer to both questions was “no.” He was Burmese.

The fact that all of these people and places are in Texas — the Texas of Gov. Rick Perry, the Texas of rodeos and barbecue and concealed-handgun permits — shows how un-Texas Texas can be.

There are an estimated 10,000 Liberians in a four-county region that includes Dallas County. The area has always been dominated by a conservative Christian tenor, yet it has also quietly become home to 200,000 Muslims. Some of those stepping into the Dallas Central Mosque for prayers have been known to do so in cowboy boots. Last year, I drove to the affluent Dallas suburb of Plano to interview Mohamed Elibiary, a member of the North Texas Islamic Council who was born in Egypt and grew up in Dallas. He greeted me at his front door, wearing a Dallas Cowboys football jersey, jeans and black Converse sneakers.

In recent days, a doctored photo has created a buzz on social media and has been posted, forwarded, tweeted and retweeted. It shows Big Tex, the 55-foot mechanical cowboy that towers over the state fairgrounds in Dallas and serves as the city’s Howdy Doody-style mascot. He is wearing one of those light-blue sanitary masks over his nose and mouth.

In the corner it reads, “Welcome to Dallas!”

The Texas State Fair is Awesome!!! Poor Big Tex is sporting the mask this year though! #EbolaOutbreakinDallas http://t.co/OAjafgtSvY[http://t.co/OAjafgtSvY]

Ask Well: How Does Ebola Spread? How Long Can the Virus Survive?

Question:

Can I get Ebola from public transportation? As in, if a passenger coughed into their hand and then held onto the pole, and then another passenger held onto that pole and inadvertently wiped their eye?

Answer:

Updated on Oct. 23. | My original answer was simply no. A more nuanced answer is that it is extremely unlikely to spread through public transit.

Many readers have argued that the original answer was inconsistent with some statements[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas.html] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization. In fact, some C.D.C. and W.H.O. statements are inconsistent with each other and shifting as more questions are raised. The W.H.O. on Monday issued a new Ebola situation assessment[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/06-october-2014/en/] entitled “What We Know About Transmission of the Ebola Virus Among Humans.”

Starting off my answer with a blanket “No” was wrong. But I would consider it irresponsible to have responded “Yes.” Implying that Ebola is caught as easily as flu or colds would be untrue and inflammatory[http://www.newyorker.com.proxy.bc.edu/humor/borowitz-report/man-infected-ebola-misinformation-casual-contact-cable-news].

It is extremely unlikely for the Ebola virus to spread through public transit for several reasons.

Not all viruses build up to infectious doses in all bodily fluids. Usually, Ebola does not at first make victims cough or sneeze, although someone who also had the flu could, in theory, spray vomitus or blood. Once Ebola invades the lungs, the body will cough to clear them. But passengers that deathly ill are not likely to be on public transit.

According to the recent W.H.O. statement, high levels of Ebola virus in saliva are rare except in the sickest victims, and whole virus has never been found in sweat. The fluids known to build up high viral loads are blood, feces and vomit.

How much virus is needed to cause illness is not exactly known. Viruses differ that way. In any group that shares needles, hepatitis C will spread more readily than H.I.V. because smaller doses infect.

No one has tested Ebola transmission on subways. But no case of transmission to a human from a dry surface has ever been confirmed. The C.D.C. has said there is “no epidemiological evidence” for transmission from hospital surfaces,[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/hcp/environmental-infection-control-in-hospitals.html] including bed rails and door knobs – which are as close as a hospital room gets to having a subway pole and a bus handle. A 2007 study[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/196/Supplement_2/S142.full] cited by C.D.C. experts shows that swabs of 31 surfaces — including bed frames, a spit bowl and a used stethoscope — in a very dangerous environment, an active Ebola ward in Uganda — did not have virus in a single sample.

So how might Ebola be passed on a subway? If someone ejected bloody mucus or vomitus onto a subway pole, and the next passenger were to touch it while it was still wet and then, for some unimaginable reason, were to put those wet fingers into an eye or mouth instead of wiping them in disgust — then yes, it could happen. Similarly, if an extremely ill passenger with high viral saliva loads were to sneeze large, wet droplets directly into the mouth or eyes of another passenger, the infection might be passed. But the influenza route — sneeze to hand to pole to hand to eye — has never been known to happen and is considered extremely unlikely.

Africa is full of overcrowded public transport — buses, minivans and some trains. There are no known instances of transmission in those environments. On July 20, a dying Liberian-American flew to Nigeria and was vomiting on the plane. All 200 people aboard were monitored; none fell ill.

Dr. Craig Spencer, the patient with Ebola currently in isolation in Bellevue Hospital, did ride the subways since arriving in New York on Oct. 14.  He rode the A, L and No. 1 trains, according to Dr. Mary Bassett, the New York City health commissioner. Dr. Bassett said Dr. Spencer had been taking his temperature twice a day since he left Guinea.  Until Thursday morning, his temperature was normal and he was not experiencing any of the early symptoms of Ebola disease, such as nausea or diarrhea.  Ebola experts say the disease cannot be transmitted before the appearance of symptoms.

Question:

How long does the Ebola virus live on contaminated surfaces, such as bed sheets, door knobs, etc.?

Answer:

It’s different in every set of circumstances. The Ebola virus eventually dries out in the air and dies. It’s not like anthrax, which forms a hard capsule around itself and can survive for months or a year. Ebola is a virus that is meant to live inside blood or fluid in your cells. It’s not meant to live in the open air, so it dies. A sheet that has wet blood in it is more dangerous than one with dried blood, because by then it would have dried out. There’s not one answer, but it is considered to be fairly safe after about 24 hours, certainly in environments that are cleaned regularly like hospitals.

Question:

Can a blood test show if a person has the Ebola virus before they are symptomatic?

Answer:

With blood tests that we have now, no. There are two different types of tests, but neither is perfect. For more about blood tests for Ebola, see Ebola Testing for All New Arrivals?[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/ask-well-ebola-testing-for-all-new-arrivals/]

Question:

Many viruses (such as herpes) can be transmitted before a person shows symptoms. Why is that not the case for Ebola?

Answer:

The basic answer is that all viruses are different. In the case of Ebola, you have to get a basic all-over body infection with infected blood and vomit coming out of you before you can pass the disease on to anybody else.

WHO is Thomas E. Duncan?

From WHERE did he travel [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/us/retracing-the-steps-of-the-dallas-ebola-patient.html] before arriving in Texas?

WHEN was he admitted to the hospital [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/us/retracing-the-steps-of-the-dallas-ebola-patient.html] in Dallas?

HOW many school children came in contact with Mr. Duncan after he started showing Ebola symptoms?WHAT precautions are health workers taking with those children who might have been exposed to the Ebola virus?

WHAT kinds of decisions are parents and schoolchildren in the Dallas-Fort Worth area making?

DALLAS -- More than six months after an outbreak of Ebola began its rampage through West Africa, local and federal health officials have displayed an uneven and flawed response to the first case diagnosed in the United States.

In the latest indication, state and local authorities confirmed Thursday that a week after a Liberian man fell ill with Ebola in Dallas, and four days after he was placed in isolation at a hospital here, the apartment where he was staying with four other people had not been sanitized and the sheets and dirty towels he used while sick remained in the home. County officials visited the apartment without protection Wednesday night.

The officials said it had been difficult to find a contractor willing to enter the apartment to clean it and remove bedding and clothes, which they said had been bagged in plastic. They said they now had hired a firm that would do the work soon. The Texas health commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, told reporters during an afternoon news conference that officials had encountered ''a little bit of hesitancy'' in seeking a firm to clean the apartment.

The delay came amid reports that as many as 100 people could have had contact with the victim, Thomas E. Duncan. And it came a day after the hospital acknowledged it had misdiagnosed him when he first visited.

When Mr. Duncan, 42, was first taken to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25, he was examined and sent home with antibiotics by doctors who apparently did not suspect Ebola. A nurse had learned from Mr. Duncan that he had traveled from Liberia, one of three African countries where the virus is rampant, but that detail apparently was not communicated to the rest of his medical team, hospital officials said.

The woman with whom Mr. Duncan was staying told CNN that she had been with him the first time he sought treatment at the hospital and that she had twice emphatically told workers there he had been in Liberia.

The international air travel system has also proved to have porous screening procedures that rely heavily on the honesty of travelers and the diligence of airport workers. The chairman of the Liberian national airport authority, Binyah Kesselly, said Thursday that Mr. Duncan had been deceptive about his exposure to the virus when he flew out of Roberts International Airport in Monrovia on Sept. 19.

Mr. Kesselly said that Mr. Duncan, who was screened before boarding and did not have a fever, answered ''no'' to a question about whether he had had contact with any person who might have been stricken with Ebola in the past 21 days. That is the maximum period of incubation for Ebola.

In fact, four days earlier, Mr. Duncan helped take a young woman, who was critically ill with Ebola, to a hospital. After she was turned away, he carried her from a taxi back to her home, where she soon died, according to her relatives and neighbors.

In the United States, local and national health officials have also been unclear, and sometimes contradictory, about how many people in the Dallas area may have come into contact with Mr. Duncan while he was contagious (the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids like saliva, blood and vomit).

They said Wednesday that they believed 12 to 18 people had direct contact. On Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for Dallas County Health and Human Services said it was thought that 80 people had contact directly with Mr. Duncan or secondarily with his direct contacts. Then in an afternoon news conference, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that health workers were assessing 100 people -- including hospital workers and emergency medical technicians -- to determine whether they had been exposed. That number does not include secondary contacts, a spokesman for the agency said.

The woman who spoke to CNN said Mr. Duncan had been sweating profusely and suffering from diarrhea. He also vomited in the apartment complex parking lot, according to local health officials. Like all others exposed to Mr. Duncan, who is listed in serious condition, the woman has not shown Ebola symptoms.

The failure to sanitize his sheets and towels also revealed a broader problem in handling materials possible infected with the virus. Hospitals say they face a major challenge disposing of waste generated in the care of Ebola patients because two federal agencies have issued conflicting guidance on what they should do. As a result, hospitals say, waste may pile up and they cannot get rid of it.

Those who are discovered to have had direct contact with Mr. Duncan will be monitored for three weeks, receiving twice-a-day visits from health officials who will take their temperature and inquire about other symptoms. ''Our approach really is to cast a wide net,'' Dr. Frieden said.

The four family members who are living in the apartment -- the woman, one of her children and two nephews -- are among a handful who have been directed by the authorities to remain in isolation, after what officials said was a failure to comply with an order to stay home. Texas health officials hand-delivered orders to residents of the apartment at the Ivy, a complex north of downtown, requiring them not to leave their home and not to allow any visitors inside until their incubation periods have passed.

The orders, known as communicable disease control orders, are permitted under the state's health code. Violations could result in criminal prosecution or civil court proceedings. Police cars were stationed at the complex Thursday to keep reporters out and the family in. Officials said they were arranging to have food and other necessities delivered to the apartment.

President Obama called the mayor of Dallas, Mike Rawlings, on Thursday from Air Force One, officials said, pledging whatever federal resources were necessary to treat Mr. Duncan and make sure the disease does not spread.

State and federal officials sought to reassure local residents that they were doing all that was necessary to contain the virus. But the area remained somewhat on edge, and some parents kept children home from four schools where several students had been removed because of their contact with Mr. Duncan.

Mike Miles, the superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said that attendance at the schools had been about 86 percent, down from about the usual 96 percent. Attendance at other schools showed no change. Nurses and other health workers were making the rounds of classrooms to calm students and check for symptoms.

Students arriving Thursday at Emmett J. Conrad High School, down the block from the Ivy complex, said the removal of an exposed student earlier in the week had sent shocks through the classrooms and hallways.

''My mom, she recommended that I not touch a lot of kids at school,'' said Royale Hollis, 15, a freshman. ''I haven't been shaking hands, just bumping elbows.''

On Thursday, Mr. Duncan's nephew said that even after his uncle was rushed to the hospital three days after his initial visit, vomiting and gravely ill, he did not think there was enough urgency and he alerted the federal authorities.

''I called C.D.C. to get some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he was not getting the appropriate care,'' the nephew, Josephus Weeks, told the NBC program ''Today.''

Dr. Frieden said that the report was being examined but that he did not know if there was any record of the call.

He defended the lack of a more robust screening process at airports in the United States, saying the costs would not be worth the potential benefits.

''Like any intervention, there are upsides and downsides,'' he said. ''There are a lot of downsides. You slow travel, You end up costing people money. Who's going to get screened? Who's going to train them? If you have a positive, where are you going to bring them to?''

He added: ''The plain truth is we can't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa. What we can do is minimize that risk, as is being done now in Dallas.''

Countering Fear With Education Where West Africans Live in U.S.

In the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, home to tens of thousands of people of Liberian descent, a new group called the Minnesota African Task Force Against Ebola is blanketing neighborhoods with fliers. Their message: Stay away from West Africa for now.

''It is not helpful to travel when your travel will expose your community to harm and backlash,'' said Abdullah Kiatamba, a member of the task force. ''We're telling people that, except in extreme circumstances, you can be more helpful to your family in Africa by sending them support, money, than by being there.''

Across the nation, communities with large concentrations of West African immigrants are stepping up education campaigns about Ebola that were already underway before it became known that a Liberian man in Dallas had the virus. At the same time, the immigrants say they are bracing for a public backlash now that the virus has reached the United States. And they are trying to avoid stoking unnecessary fear among immigrant families who have little chance of contracting the virus.

But fear has already taken hold in places like Southwest Philadelphia, where some West African immigrants are avoiding hugging or shaking hands with those who have recently spent time in their homelands, and Brooklyn Park, Minn., where Kellita Whisnant, a Liberian immigrant, said her West African restaurant has seen business plummet since the Ebola outbreak intensified over the summer. She taped a poster about Ebola near the cash register to help dispel myths and changed the name of her restaurant from Mama Ti's African Kitchen to Mama Ti's Kitchen and Deli. But it has not seemed to help.

''Women are calling me and saying, 'Kelly, we're not going to be at the restaurant because my husband is leery about Ebola,' '' Ms. Whisnant said Wednesday. ''It hurts.''

In these communities and others, medical providers and state and county health officials started reaching out to West African immigrant groups over the summer, holding community meetings and circulating information about the disease. In Providence, R.I., the director of the State Health Department is meeting weekly with leaders of the state's large West African population to help them inform people and dispel myths.

''We've heard questions like, 'My family just got here, do they need to go to the hospital as soon as they land?' '' said the director, Dr. Michael Fine. ''The good thing is that people are not afraid to ask. But we need to help everyone realize that if someone's not sick, there's no reason to go.''

Hospitals and health clinics are continuing to refine protocols for identifying and treating possible Ebola victims, focusing now on avoiding the communication lapse that led the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to release the Ebola patient, Thomas E. Duncan, from its emergency room last week even though he had told a nurse he had been in Liberia.

In the Minneapolis area, emergency dispatchers now ask anyone calling with difficulty breathing, diarrhea or vomiting if they also have a fever. If so, they ask if the person has traveled internationally in the last month, and where.

Dr. John L. Hick, the medical director for emergency preparedness at Hennepin County Medical Center, said the hospital is also developing new protocols for testing blood and disposing of waste from patients suspected of having Ebola. And it is trying to calm medical personnel anxious about encountering patients with the virus, he said.

''We're trying to help everyone feel more comfortable that we've got the protective equipment, we've got the protocols in place,'' Dr. Hick said. ''People are much more interested now that the case in Dallas has actually made it real: 'Yes, we've got to get our game face on.' ''

Dr. Hick said that even before the Dallas case, hospital and other health officials in the Minneapolis region had been working with West African community groups to reach out to residents who might be traveling to, or having visitors from, their homelands.

''One of the key messages is that no one is going to get sick from somebody who isn't sick,'' he said. ''The corollary is that if you are sick, you have to let people know.''

The stigma around Ebola is such that some people may not want to admit they feel sick, said Mr. Kiatamba, who runs African Immigrant Services, a nonprofit group in Brooklyn Park.

''The fear is, 'If I tell them, they are going to call the newspaper on me and by the time they find out I don't have Ebola it will have been all over the news,' '' he said. ''But everybody's got to start talking to each other. This is getting serious. This thing is just a plane ride away.''

On Staten Island in New York, home to another large Liberian community, Telee Brown, a social worker, said he had canceled a trip to Liberia with his 2-year-old daughter. Mr. Brown, who leads a two-month-old Ebola committee for the Staten Island Liberian Community Association, has been visiting a daily farmer's market in a neighborhood nicknamed Little Liberia to urge people to wash and sanitize their hands more often.

''We're telling everybody,'' he said, ''because we don't know who's going to West Africa, and who is coming from West Africa.''

Amusa Ishola, 58, who owns the Targee African Market in the neighborhood, Park Hill, does not seem to need much urging to be more hygienic. For the last few weeks, Mr. Ishola, whose store sells dried fish, coconut milk and large bags of rice, has made it a habit to disinfect his hands after every customer.

Mr. Ishola said a recent customer had told him he had lost seven relatives to Ebola in Liberia. A few days later, the customer returned to say that number had spiked to 11.

''Prevention is better than kill,'' he said as he poured a milky fluid on his hands, then rubbed it up and down each finger, before swabbing his counter.

In Southwest Philadelphia, Elizabeth Barquoi, whose husband owns an international grocery store, said that West Africans wanting to leave Ebola-infected areas should first be quarantined for three weeks and tested for the disease every day.

''Surveillance should be more intensive,'' she said.

But Simone Chambliss, a Liberian immigrant in Brooklyn Park, said she thought it was crucial to keep allowing travel between West Africa and the United States. Otherwise, she said, ''All those people who are there would be doomed. We can't just close the door on them.''

Ken Prillaman, the fire chief and emergency management director in Brooklyn Park, said he had been constantly fighting the stigma cast over West African immigrants. He has had to calm a number of worried locals, he said, including parents reluctant to let their children play with children of West African descent.

''We had a mechanic worried because he works on a lot of cars for residents that are West African,'' Mr. Prillaman said. ''I actually had a group that was planning to do an event in Brooklyn Park, who called and said, 'Should we cancel because of the number of West Africans?' It's like, are you kidding me?''

Dr. Fine of the Rhode Island Department of Health said that one of the most important ways to keep more Ebola cases from emerging in the United States was to encourage West African immigrants to reach out to friends and relatives in their homelands and educate them. In Rhode Island, West African community leaders were urging people to call five relatives or friends in their homeland and give them advice about preventing the spread of Ebola. The United Way has even provided a van with phones for free calls, he said.

''If there are a million and a half infected people in West Africa by January,'' he said, ''the number of people trying to leave Liberia and come here may be much greater, and the risk of people traveling here and getting sick here goes way up.''

He added, ''The biggest challenge for all of us is to get West Africa enough resources now so we don't get to that place.''

Mideast Virus, Merits Caution, Not Alarm, W.H.O. Says

Despite their worries earlier this year, world health authorities say there is little reason to fear that the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which began Thursday, will spread the MERS virus widely around the world. But they are emphasizing that vigilance is still important.

The World Health Organization [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}]’s emergency committee on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome concluded on Wednesday that the outbreak, concentrated on the Arabian Peninsula, did not constitute an international health emergency.

Separately, the risk of Ebola [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] at the pilgrimage appeared low. Saudi Arabia has denied visas to all would-be pilgrims from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries suffering major outbreaks. An unrelated Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/world/africa/ebola-cases-double-in-democratic-republic-of-congo.html] is in an isolated rural area.

This past spring, Saudi Arabia had hundreds of MERS cases [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/world/middleeast/flawed-saudi-response-fueled-outbreak-of-mers-middle-east-virus.html]. But there were only 15 known cases from mid-August to late September, the W.H.O. said. None were in the three cities visited by virtually all pilgrims — Jeddah, Mecca and Medina.

Some pilgrims do take side trips, and there have been four recent cases in Riyadh.

Also, the first MERS case in Austria, detected on Monday, was in a 29-year-old Saudi woman who was reported to be from either Medina or Afif.

The emergency panel, which has met seven times, timed its announcement to coincide with the pilgrimage, known as the hajj [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/islam/hajj/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which draws up to three million Muslims each year. It called on the Saudis to increase pilgrims’ awareness of the disease.

The virus is believed to be widespread in camels. It can jump from person to person, but such cases are rare outside hospitals and dialysis [http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/dialysis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] centers.

Some scientists say that cases surge after camels give birth in late winter, creating a new crop of young, susceptible animals, who then infect a few humans. Most transmission last spring was tied to poor infection control in hospitals, and the outbreak led to tighter hospital regulations.

A few small clusters have occurred since then in hospitals, “but not the big numbers that were reported in the spring,” said Dr. Susan I. Gerber, team leader for respiratory viruses in the viral disease division of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}].

Anyone traveling to the area should still avoid contact with camels — especially sick ones — and with products like raw milk or undercooked meat, Dr. Gerber said. People with diabetes [http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], kidney failure [http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/acute-kidney-failure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or compromised immune systems should be especially careful.

“It’s hard to say exactly what the risk is, but MERS hasn’t disappeared,” she warned.

Ashoka Mukpo, NBC Cameraman With Ebola, to Return to U.S.

NBC News on Friday identified the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola in Liberia as 33-year-old Ashoka Mukpo, who had been working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the network’s top medical correspondent.

Mr. Mukpo is the fourth American known to have contracted the disease in Liberia.

Speaking on NBC’s "Today" show, the parents of Mr. Mukpo said their son was in good spirits. “Obviously he is scared and worried,” the father, Dr. Mitchell Levy said.

Mr. Mukpo’s mother, Diane Mukpo said her son would be flown back to the United States this weekend for treatment. “I think the enormous anxiety that I have as a mother or that we share as parents is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday,” Ms. Mukpo said.

As a precaution, NBC News ordered the production team working with the cameraman, which includes Dr. Snyderman, to return to the United States and enter quarantine for 21 days.

Mr. Mukpo had worked for NBC for just one day before becoming ill, NBC said. Dr. Snyderman said in an interview on the "Today" show Friday morning that she and her team had had very little contact with Mr. Mukpo.

Speaking from Liberia on Thursday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, Dr. Snyderman said: “The good news is this young man, our colleague, was admitted to the clinic very, very early. I spoke with him today. He’s in good spirits.”

In a note to the NBC News staff, the division president, Deborah Turness, said: “We are doing everything we can to get him the best care possible. He will be flown back to the United States for treatment at a medical center that is equipped to handle Ebola patients.”

“We are also taking all possible measures to protect our employees and the general public,” Ms. Turness told the staff. “In an abundance of caution, we will fly them back on a private charter flight, and then they will place themselves under quarantine in the United States for 21 days — which is at the most conservative end of the spectrum of medical guidance.”

NBC said Mr. Mukpo is also a writer and has worked in Liberia for the past three years on a number of projects.

At Crossroads, CNN Seeks to Reassert Itself

Jeff Zucker[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/jeff_zucker/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the president of CNN Worldwide, seemed to be having a blast Wednesday evening at a party for a new original series. Perched on the arm of a chair, he watched intently as a magician performed tricks with coins, cards and a Rubik’s cube.

At CNN, Mr. Zucker — the once-wunderkind TV news executive who turns 50 next year — could use some magic of his own.

Twenty months after taking over one of the most prominent news brands, Mr. Zucker is still trying to define CNN’s place in a world of unlimited, real-time information. He is laying off journalists and cutting expenses while trying to keep a once-leading cable network relevant in the digital age. The efforts largely remain a work in progress, underlining the stark challenges facing the news business.

So far this year, CNN ratings are hovering near 20-year lows. Average prime-time viewers are down about 6 percent to 176,000, compared with 2013, in the audience that attracts the most revenue for news channels, viewers between the ages of 25 and 54. Total day viewers this year are down 7.6 percent to 122,000, according to Nielsen.

“There is no evidence right now that any of that strategy is working,” said Kannan Venkateshwar, a media analyst at Barclays. “The bigger question is, in this kind of an ecosystem, where does CNN fit in?”’

Mr. Zucker declined to be quoted for this article, but other CNN executives said that their boss’s vision — mixing breaking news with original series, while investing heavily in digital operations — was showing early signs of success and gaining momentum. As evidence, they pointed to increases in viewers for both total day- and prime-time during the third quarter this year, compared with the same period in 2013. They also boasted that CNN now ranks in second place among cable news networks, overtaking MSNBC in viewers 18 to 54. (When Mr. Zucker started, the network was in third place.) Executives also highlighted CNN’s strength online, reaching about 123 million unique United States visitors in August. And despite its challenges, CNN earns hundreds of millions of dollars and is on track to have its most profitable year ever, network executives said, though analysts forecast a falling growth rate.

CNN is hardly alone in its ratings struggles, as the total audience for cable news has been on the decline for the last several years. This year, MSNBC has suffered a 12 percent drop in average prime-time viewers ages 25 to 54 to 184,000, compared with last year. At Fox News, which continues to dominate the category, that figure has fallen 1.3 percent to 298,000, according to Nielsen.The urgency for Mr. Zucker to fix CNN became more pressing after its parent, Time Warner, rejected a takeover effort by 21st Century Fox this summer. Time Warner must now prove to its shareholders that it can grow on its own and deliver profits. As a result, the company’s Turner Broadcasting System division, which includes CNN, is in the middle of job reductions and other cost-cutting initiatives.

Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said during a recent investor call that he was excited about the evolution at CNN “but there’s still a lot more to do.”

One change that Mr. Zucker has made is double down on breaking news, focusing coverage on just two or three major stories throughout a given day, rather than delivering an all-encompassing, scattershot report of the headlines as was common in the past. The rationale is that viewers are likely to catch other news on the web or on social media. Mr. Zucker leads daily news meetings, unlike past CNN chiefs who delegated the responsibility. Employees called Mr. Zucker a micromanager and said that he sent missives from his BlackBerry at all hours about everything, be it the length of story segments or the graphics that appear on screen.

On Thursday, that approach meant the Ebola outbreak and the Secret Service controversy dominated airtime. This year, CNN was mocked for committing near wall-to-wall coverage to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but Mr. Zucker has boasted that the network posted better ratings than its rivals during that stretch.

Mr. Zucker has also broadened the definition of news at CNN. Its original series are now central to his growth strategy. Ratings at the network have long tracked with the news cycle: Major events draw viewers, while fewer people tune in during slow periods. To smooth out its ratings — and attract new, younger audiences — CNN ramped up its investment in original nonfiction programming and documentaries.

Though plans for some series, like Anthony Bourdain’s travel and food show “Parts Unknown,” were hatched before Mr. Zucker arrived, none had made it to air. The program had a successful debut in 2013, but ratings for its recent season premiere dipped by a double-digit percentage compared with last year. (The show drew 219,000 viewers ages 25 to 54.) On Wednesday, CNN celebrated “Somebody’s Gotta Do It,” a new show hosted by Mike Rowe about people and their passions. Twelve original series are planned for 2015.

“The big picture goal is to really do very high-quality, nonfiction premium content that is complementary to what CNN does every day,” said Amy Entelis, senior vice president for talent and content development at CNN Worldwide. CNN’s push into original programming has its risks. Producing an hour of an original series is much costlier than producing an hour of news. And should a big story break, CNN has to pre-empt the shows for news coverage, possibly alienating viewers. Yet there are also potential rewards: Donna Speciale, president of ad sales for Turner Broadcasting, said that the original series and documentaries had helped increase ad rates and gained more than 60 new advertisers.

Overseeing a combination of original programming and news is not new to Mr. Zucker, a polarizing executive who nearly a quarter-century ago led NBC’s morning show, “Today,” on a dominant run as the most profitable and most watched program on television. In 2007, he became head of all of NBCUniversal. After Comcast took control of the company in 2011, Mr. Zucker left, with critics attributing the network’s fall to fourth place to his management missteps.

Weeks into his new role as president of CNN Worldwide in 2013, Mr. Zucker told some confidants that the job was much bigger than he had expected. The scope, and the challenges, of CNN’s round-the-clock, live global news operation were vast and daunting. Prime-time ratings at the domestic cable news network had plummeted to its lowest in two decades. The international arm covered dozens of countries. And while audiences were flocking to CNN on the Internet and on mobile, revenue lagged.

Like the rest of the news business, CNN has focused intently on expanding its digital operation. Despite broader layoffs, CNN has added about 50 employees in the last five months to its online division. “In many ways, digital is the entry point to the CNN brand now,” said Kenneth Estenson, senior vice president and general manager of CNN.com[http://CNN.com].

CNN now ranks as the third most trafficked news and information digital outlet in the United States, attracting 122.6 million unique visitors to its web and mobile properties in August, up 32 percent from the same period last year, according to comScore. Mr. Zucker continues to tinker with CNN’s programming. He has increased live news coverage on CNN by five hours a day, largely through the addition of an overnight feed of CNN International. After some initial experiments, the “New Day” morning show now focuses less on fluff and more on news. “Crossfire,” a once-popular current event debate program that Mr. Zucker revived with hosts like Newt Gingrich, has been pulled. He also ended Piers Morgan’s live talk show. And still on Mr. Zucker’s to-do list is determining the fate of HLN, a sister network.

Christopher Geraci, president of national broadcast at Omnicom’s OMD media buying group, said that while CNN remained a powerful brand, the competition for viewers and ad dollars grew fiercer every day. “It’s a tough marketplace for any news organization,” he said. “There’s a lot of news out there.”

One change that Jeff Zucker has made since taking over at CNN is to double down on breaking news, focusing coverage on just two or three major stories throughout the day. | Asa Mathat/D: All Things Digital | A scene from "Somebody's Gotta Do It," a new CNN show hosted by Mike Rowe about people and their passions. | CNN | Anthony Bourdain’s travel and food show, “Parts Unknown,” had a successful debut in 2013, but ratings for its recent season premiere dipped. | David S.

Now at their lowest levels since 2012, crude oil prices have been under pressure in recent months. The increase in global demand for oil this year is turning out to be slower because of weaker-than-anticipated growth in China and Europe, while oil supplies remain strong, leading to growing inventories.

Crude oil prices continued their decline during trading Thursday, with the American benchmark dropping below $90 a barrel in the early going and its main international equivalent falling as well. But oil prices were nudging higher on Friday in Asian trading.

The sudden drop on Thursday was seen as a response to Saudi Arabia’s signaling on Wednesday to the markets that it was more interested in maintaining market share than in defending prices. Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, stunned markets by announcing that it was cutting prices by about $1 a barrel to Asia as well as by 40 cents a barrel to the United States.

With oil prices already under pressure, ‘‘there has been a widespread perception or hope that the Saudis would pull back on production,’’ said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.

Instead, he said, the Saudis are ‘‘pricing aggressively to retain buyers,’’ potentially at the expense of their rivals in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, like Iran and Iraq.

West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, was trading around $88.60 a barrel early on Thursday, dropping below $90 for the first time since April 2013, before recovering to close at $91.01, up 28 cents. Brent crude, the main international benchmark, closed at $93.42, down 74 cents.

At midafternoon in Hong Kong on Friday, Brent had climbed to $93.82, and West Texas Intermediate to $91.55.

Some analysts expect downward pressure on prices to continue. Citigroup recently cut its forecast for 2015 prices for West Texas Intermediate by $10 a barrel, to $89.50 per barrel.

The main source of supply growth continues to be the United States, which, as a result of the shale oil boom, now rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia in oil output.

The International Energy Agency says America produced about 8.5 million barrels a day of crude oil in August, as well as roughly three million barrels a day in liquids from natural gas. By comparison, the agency says, Russia produced about 10.9 million barrels per day in liquids. Saudi Arabia is producing an estimated 9.8 million barrels a day of crude.

Exports of crude from the United States have risen to about 400,000 barrels a day, and analysts say that ConocoPhillips’s recent sale of a cargo of Alaskan crude to South Korea, a crucial market for Gulf producers, could be a breakthrough.

‘‘What we are seeing is pressure starting to mount on the Saudis as it hasn’t before,’’ said Seth Kleinman, an analyst in London for Citigroup.

While the United States remains a modest oil exporter, its surging output pushes other oil, particularly from West Africa, out of the American market, helping to lower prices. Net oil imports to the United States have fallen since 2007 by 8.7 million barrels a day.

The production surge in the United States has enabled the oil markets to shrug off potential disruptions in supply. The confrontation with Russia over Ukraine, political instability in countries like Syria and Iraq and even the Ebola outbreak in West Africa all have the potential to disrupt supply, but instead, oil prices have softened.

At times of falling prices, other producers look to the Saudis to throttle supply. But this time, OPEC leaders appear reluctant to do so. What they may be doing is jockeying ahead of a scheduled meeting in November to pressure countries like Iraq and Iran to share in the pain of any production cutbacks.

‘‘The Saudis are frustrated by the expectations of Iraq and Iran that it is all on the Saudis to balance the market,’’ Mr. Mallinson of Energy Aspects said.

Health Officials in Dallas Pinpoint 10 People Most at Risk for Ebola

Health officials in Texas said on Friday that they had identified 10 people who are most at risk of contracting Ebola after coming into contact with an infected African man now in isolation in a Dallas hospital

Among them, health officials said, are the four people who shared an apartment with the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, and medical workers who came into contact with him. Another 40 people are being monitored daily but are considered at relatively low risk, officials said. No one has developed any symptoms of the disease.

For those who have been exposed to the virus, there is nothing to do but wait.

“There really isn’t anything that can be done to prevent Ebola from developing if infection has occurred,” said Beth P. Bell, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While officials said the risk of the disease spreading widely were minimal, they warned that others might fall ill. “There certainly is a possibility that some of the people who have been in close contact with the patient might get sick with Ebola,” Dr. Bell said.

The first signs of the illness often appear within eight to 10 days, but can take as long as 21 days.

Mr. Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on Sept. 20. Ebola cannot be spread until a person is symptomatic, and Mr. Duncan told doctors he first felt ill on Sept. 24. As he became sicker, the amount of virus in his system increased, and so did the risk of contagion.

Anyone who came into contact with him between Sept. 24 and Sept. 28, when he was placed in isolation at the hospital, is considered at risk of infection.

The four people who shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan before he was hospitalized he remained in quarantine on Friday, and Texas officials apologized for both their failure to communicate and for not moving more quickly to have the apartment cleaned of possibly infectious materials.

After much delay, the cleanup began at the Ivy Apartments Friday afternoon as workers in yellow protective suits scoured the property, taking any item that might harbor the virus, which can survive outside the body for several hours on hard surfaces and for several days in pools of fluid. At least two of the contractor’s trucks were parked outside of Apartment 614, where Mr. Duncan had been staying. The green trucks were brightly painted and had advertising slogans on them, including “Cleaning Guys, Haz-Mat Clean-Up” and “The Annihilator.”

The top elected official in Dallas County, County Judge Clay Jenkins, said he visited the family on Thursday night to apologize for the handling of the situation. He said they were understandably scared and confused, and he said he hoped to find them more comfortable accommodations.

“I want to see them treated as I would want my own family treated,” Mr. Jenkins said.

The disease centers and the Department of Transportation have different protocols for handling medical waste associated with diseases such as Ebola, which led to a greater delay in getting the apartment cleaned.

Kasey Bonner, the coordinator for the Cleaning Guys, the company hired by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do the job, said its workers were not allowed to enter the apartment on Thursday night because the company did not have permission to transport hazardous material on Texas highways.

“We were contracted to clean and contain the affected material and anything that has come in contact with that patient,” Ms. Bonner said “There was no protocol put in place for handling Ebola on Texas highways.”

She said that the problem had been resolved and that they were in the process of cleaning the home.

The confusion was indicative of the myriad local, state and federal protocols and levels of preparedness that have raised questions about the ability of the nation’s health care infrastructure to handle an epidemic.

“There are many, many problems that have been revealed by this single case,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.

Among the mistakes was the failure in communication at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital when Mr. Duncan first arrived showing symptoms of Ebola on Sept. 25. While both Mr. Duncan and the person who brought him to the hospital told the nurse in the emergency room that he had been in Liberia, the center of the Ebola epidemic, that information was not relayed to the diagnostic team.

Without that crucial information, doctors sent Mr. Duncan home. He returned three days later, critically ill. He was then placed in isolation, where he remains in serious but stable condition.

In a statement released late Thursday, the hospital sought to explain early missteps and said it was going to integrate its electronic record keeping system to prevent such failures of communication.

“Protocols were followed by both the physician and the nurses,” the hospital said. “However, we have identified a flaw in the way the physician and nursing portions of our electronic health records interacted in this specific case. In our electronic health records, there are separate physician and nursing work flows.”

They promised to blend those work flows and said the system is being “modified to specifically reference Ebola-endemic regions in Africa.”

The effectiveness of the electronic record keeping system varies widely in hospitals and health care systems across the country, in part because the new systems are often layered on older systems and are not integrated. For instance, according to health experts, a hospital may create one electronic system for billing, another one for X-rays and lab tests and yet another for the diagnostic team. Some hospitals have been more aggressive than other in integrating these systems.

But Dr. Redlener said that anyone working in the hospital should have been aware that the information gathered by the nurse doing triage was not automatically relayed to the doctors. And, he said, given the numerous C.D.C. alerts about Ebola and the intense media coverage of the disease, hospital employees should have been especially alert to any symptomatic patient who had traveled recently from West Africa

“Right now,” he said, “with this unbelievable focus on Ebola, that someone would not get up and say, ‘I have a possible Ebola here’ — it is impossible for any hospital in the U.S. not to be acutely aware of Ebola and what needs to happen.”

Numerous reporters, prohibited from stepping inside the complex, gathered at the gates on a side road that offered a vantage point of the apartment from a distance. Television-station helicopters circled overhead.

An Inconvenient Protest for Both China and U.S.

WASHINGTON — President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] is scheduled to visit China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] next month, and with tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters on the streets of Hong Kong[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/hongkong/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], human rights could force itself onto the agenda between the United States and the Chinese in a way not seen in many years.

A major caveat, of course, is that the fervent crowds in Hong Kong could be long gone by Nov. 10, when Mr. Obama and 20 Pacific Rim leaders gather in Beijing for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. That would certainly be a relief to the Chinese host, President Xi Jinping[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html?inline=nyt-per], and perhaps to Mr. Obama, too.

Human rights have not been a major topic of discussion between the two countries since the aftermath of China’s bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square 25 years ago. With Washington eager to work with Beijing on a list of priorities — from climate change to curbing Iran’s nuclear program[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/nuclear_program/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — officials in both countries are eager to keep it that way.

“We have principles and values that we want to promote, but we’re not looking to inject the United States into the middle of this,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The White House is not reconsidering Mr. Obama’s visit, the official said, though it has been calibrating how best to signal its concern for the umbrella-wielding protesters in Hong Kong, especially after the police began roughing up the crowd last Sunday.

The United States knows that it has little leverage over China in the dispute over a proposed voting law in Hong Kong, which the Chinese government regards as a strictly internal matter. Chinese officials, including the foreign minister who visited Washington this week, have told their American counterparts, politely, to mind their own business.

The tensions in the American position are evident in how it responded to clashes Sunday, when the police tried to disperse the protesters with tear gas and pepper spray. The American consulate in Hong Kong issued a statement urging both sides to show restraint and making no reference to the desire of the crowds for more democracy.

“We do not take sides in the discussion of Hong Kong’s political development,” the statement said, “nor do we support any particular individuals or groups involved in it.”

Worried that the United States looked like it was bending over backward to avoid offense, the White House sent out the press secretary, Josh Earnest, to urge the Hong Kong authorities to show restraint and declare that the United States supported “a genuine choice of candidates that are representative of the people’s and the voters’ will.”

Asked whether the White House would like to see Hong Kong’s democratic aspirations transplanted to the Chinese mainland, Mr. Earnest said, “the short answer to that is yes.”

That response is sure to enrage Chinese officials, who view the Hong Kong protests as deeply threatening because they fear they could spread to other parts of the country. Some Chinese officials blame the United States for the unrest, saying it is whipping up the students. That may have influenced the consulate’s initial fence-sitting.

“The consulate statement was maladroit and unbalanced,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Obama’s senior director on China until 2011. “They had an understandable impulse, however, to say something that dismissed Chinese concerns that they are the black hand behind the protests.”

Human-rights activists said they were generally satisfied with the White House’s response, particularly, said Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, because it linked the lack of democracy in Hong Kong with the lack of democracy in China.

But other experts said the White House should have spoken out sooner, after China’s Parliament proposed the new voting law, which would require candidates for Hong Kong chief executive to be cleared by a nominating committee — effectively ruling out anyone the Chinese government deemed unacceptable. Critics also note that the United States has said little about Mr. Xi’s broader crackdown on civil liberties.

“China right now is undergoing the harshest political repression it has seen since 1989,” said David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George Washington University, citing the year of the Tiananmen Square massacre. “The situation has gone from bad to worse from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping, and the administration isn’t speaking out about that.”

There is no shortage of friction in the Chinese-American relationship, from China’s aggressive treatment of its neighbors in the East and South China Seas to accusations of Chinese military hacking of American companies. And tensions could flare over climate-change policy. Mr. Obama also needs to keep China in the fold to seal a nuclear deal with Iran.

Even if the protests subside, some China analysts said there was a good chance the demonstrators would seize the occasion of the summit meeting in Beijing to re-emerge with their grievances.

With so many sensitive items on the agenda, Chinese and American officials are both laboring to prevent Hong Kong from hijacking Mr. Obama’s visit. When China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, met with the United States national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, on Wednesday, the president dropped in to “underscore his commitment to building a stable and constructive U.S.-China relationship,” the White House said in a statement.

Mr. Obama raised the issue of Hong Kong, but the statement made clear that he did so only after a long list of other issues, including the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak and the military campaign against the Islamic State.

In a meeting with Mr. Wang at the State Department, Secretary of State John Kerry also mentioned Hong Kong, expressing “high hopes that the Hong Kong authorities will exercise restraint and respect for the protesters’ right to express their views peacefully.”

Mr. Wang, however, left no doubt that China did not welcome the scrutiny. “Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs,” he said, using time-tested language. “For any country, for any society, no one will allow those illegal acts that violate public order,” he said. “That’s the situation in the United States, and that’s the same situation in Hong Kong.”

Health
A Plan to Use Survivors’ Blood for Ebola Treatment in Africa

Correction Appended

With no proven drugs to treat Ebola and experimental ones in short supply, the health authorities are planning to turn instead to a treatment that is walking around in the outbreak zone in West Africa.

That would be the blood of people who have been sickened by the Ebola virus but have since recovered. Their blood should contain antibodies that might help other patients fight off the infection.

The World Health Organization is making it a priority to try such convalescent blood or plasma, as it is called, and is talking with the affected countries about how to do it.

This week, the organization issued guidance[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135591/1/WHO_HIS_SDS_2014.8_eng.pdf?ua=1] on how to collect the blood and administer transfusions.

“The concept that this treatment could be efficacious is biologically plausible, as convalescent plasma has been used successfully for the treatment of a variety of infectious agents,” the W.H.O. guidance document says.

Plausibility, however, is not proof that such treatments would work for Ebola and some virologists doubt it will. The results of studies in monkeys were discouraging, they note.

There will also be logistical problems carrying this out in West Africa, where blood banks are not well developed. One challenge will be to make sure that the donated blood, even if it helps patients recover from Ebola, does not give them H.I.V. or hepatitis.

“Major questions need to be answered about the safety and efficacy of convalescent therapies, and the feasibility of implementation in countries with shattered health systems and an acute shortage of medical staff,” the W.H.O. said in a separate statement released a week ago[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/26-september-2014/en/].

Still, with the epidemic spiraling out of control, there is a sense that some treatment needs to be offered, even if only to give sick people hope and a reason to go to medical centers, where they can be stopped from spreading the disease to others. And there are really no other good options.

“The attraction is, at least on the surface, it is something that could be implemented readily,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an expert on Ebola at Tulane University and an adviser to the health organization.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust are among the organizations championing convalescent plasma and working on how to put it into effect.

“Blood is donated in West Africa every day of the week for surgery and other things and could be safely tested for viruses,” said Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust.

Such therapies have already been used in the current outbreak. Dr. Kent Brantly, an American aid worker who contracted Ebola in Liberia, received a blood transfusion from a boy who had recovered. After Dr. Brantly survived his bout with the disease, some of his plasma was given to another American aid worker, Dr. Rick Sacra, who also recovered.

But it is not known whether the transfusions helped in those cases, since both men also received experimental drugs and excellent supportive care in American hospitals.

Authorities say this approach has been used in Africa, but to a limited extent. There have even been rumors of a black market for the blood of survivors. Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the W.H.O., said in a news conference last month that her organization would work to stamp out underground use of blood because such a therapy must be administered properly and safely.

The use of blood or plasma — either from recovered patients or from animals deliberately exposed to a pathogen — dates from the late 1800s, and for decades was a mainstay of treatment for infectious diseases. Emil von Behring[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1901/behring-article.html], a German physician scientist, won the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for pioneering the serum approach for diphtheria.

Convalescent therapies were used, apparently[http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=729754] with some success[http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=729754], in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. And such treatments are still used for rabies, snake bites, hepatitis A and B, and other diseases. But for some viral diseases, like hepatitis C and the human immunodeficiency virus, it has not been shown to work.

Many of the treatments used today are made by pooling the plasma of many donors and processing it to get high concentrations of the desired antibodies. That is probably not going to be feasible in Africa because of a lack of technology and the large-scale facilities to do it, according to executives in the plasma products industry.

The simplest approach would be to use whole blood donated by one person and transfused into another. That has some risk of side effects, like allergic reactions, though not much if the blood types of donor and recipient match.

A better approach, experts say, would be to transfuse only plasma, the clear part of the blood that contains the antibodies. Plasma can be obtained by letting the blood cells settle and drawing off the plasma.

Even better would be to use apheresis machines, which collect only the plasma from the donor. People can donate plasma alone much more frequently than they can donate whole blood, which can be an advantage if there are not many survivors willing to donate. Experts say it would be feasible to bring in such machines for use in the better-equipped treatment centers in West Africa.

One challenge could be testing donated blood to make sure it is truly free of Ebola virus, as well as of H.I.V., hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis.

Albert Farrugia, vice president for global access at the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association, a trade group, said there are ways to inactivate viruses in donated plasma that might be feasible to deploy in Africa. One such approach treats the plasma with solvents and detergents in a plastic bag.

Convalescent blood or plasma has been tried for Ebola since the virus first emerged in 1976. That year, a woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known then as Zaire, received plasma from a person who had recovered from the related Marburg virus, however, she still died, according to the health organization.

In November of that year, a researcher in Britain[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC1631428/] who was working with material from the African outbreak accidentally pricked himself and got sick. He received two transfusions of serum from survivors in Africa, as well as the antiviral drug interferon. He eventually recovered.

In the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/9988160], also in Congo, seven of eight people who received convalescent whole blood survived, a survival rate far better than the 20 percent for the outbreak as a whole. Still, the patients got a higher than usual standard of care that may have accounted, in part, for the better survival rate.

Testing in primates has not found serum to be effective against Ebola. After one of their negative studies, United States government researchers wrote in a 2007 paper[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/196/Supplement_2/S400.short]: “Given these discouraging results and the risks of transmitting infection, whole-blood transfusions, even under desperate epidemic conditions, seem unwarranted.”

But now there are desperate conditions and plans are moving ahead. One of the authors of that paper, Dr. Thomas W. Geisbert, now with the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, said that as long as the blood was adequately screened for viruses, the transfusions should do no harm, even if they do not help.

The W.H.O. says trying such therapies will have a benefit beyond Ebola by developing the capacity in West Africa to do transfusions in general. That could help in treating injuries, other disease like malaria and yellow fever, and complications of childbirth.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misquoted a statement by the World Health Organization.

For Journalists, a Stark Reminder of the Risk in Covering a Deadly Epidemic

Before John Moore, a photographer for Getty Images, goes into a hospital in Liberia for patients suspected of having Ebola, or enters the house of a victim with a burial team, he suits up.

He puts on anti-contamination coveralls, and two sets of gloves. He tapes the gap between the gloves and his sleeves in case he stretches his arms. He covers his face with a surgical mask and goggles. His boots are covered with disposable sleeves. It takes 10 minutes to put on the outfit, and longer to take off. Because he is sprayed with disinfectant, he must disrobe slowly and deliberately to avoid getting any liquid on himself.

The spray seeps through the protective clothing, so he smells perpetually of bleach. “But that’s preferable to the alternative,” he said by telephone on Friday from Monrovia, Liberia, where he had recently returned for a second reporting assignment.

The dangers for Mr. Moore and his peers were highlighted on Thursday, when NBC News announced that Ashoka Mukpo, 33, an American freelance journalist working as a cameraman for the network in Liberia, was diagnosed with Ebola — a disease which can cause its victims to hemorrhage to death, and for which there is no cure or reliable vaccine.

“Certainly another journalist coming down with this,” Mr. Moore said of Mr. Mukpo, “is very worrying for all of us.”

Mr. Mukpo is scheduled to arrive Monday in Omaha, Neb., where he will be treated at the Nebraska Medical Center, according to a spokesman for the hospital. Another Ebola patient, Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary from North Carolina-based charity, was treated there and later released.

Mr. Mukpo’s diagnosis is a stark reminder that the dozens of news organizations and freelance reporters covering the Ebola crisis must balance safety concerns as they document an outbreak that has infected at least 7,400 people, killing more than 3,400, in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone since March, according to the World Health Organization. Most of the news organizations are following a set of recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some, like National Public Radio, are also cautioning their correspondents not to enter isolation units or attend funerals, and to avoid gatherings or demonstrations.

NBC News said it was taking as many precautions as possible to protect both its staff and the general population after Mr. Mukpo fell ill. The network said that it was monitoring other members of its production team in Liberia and would fly them back to the United States on a private plane. The team, which included the medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman, was to be quarantined in the United States for 21 days, which is considered the incubation time for the virus.

On NBC’s “Today Show” on Friday morning, Dr. Snyderman said that once Mr. Mukpo developed symptoms, they spent two hours together. He had joined the team three days earlier.

“My suspicion is that he was infected before we came and met him and was symptomatic once we met him,” she said. “We shared a work space. We shared vehicles. We shared equipment. But everyone here is hyper-alert we have not been in close proximity. No one shakes hands. There’s no hugging so I do believe that our team, while we are being hypervigilant, we are at very, very, very, low risk of becoming ill.”

A reporter for The Washington Post, Lenny Bernstein[http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/10/01/reporting-on-ebola-first-rule-is-you-dont-touch-anyone/], in an article for the newspaper, wrote that he had felt worried when he accidentally touched a handrail on the way into a treatment center in Liberia. And despite all the precautions he had taken, he wrote, a friend had canceled an appointment to attend a football game upon his return home, for fear he might be incubating the virus. James Goldston, the president of ABC News, which also has a team on the ground in Liberia, said in a memo to the staff on Friday that it had hired a biohazard company to “fully decontaminate their equipment” once it arrived in the United States.

Newer media outlets, like Vice News, which had worked with Mr. Mukpo, are also covering the Ebola epidemic. Vice[https://news.vice.com/video/monrovia-in-chaos-the-fight-against-ebola-part-1], which published the first of a three-part series on Ebola on its website, said two of its journalists were covering the outbreak. They disposed of their clothing and nonessential gear and luggage before returning to the United States, Vice said. They also took their temperature twice a day in the field, wiped down cameras and lenses with chlorine wipes before returning, and used plastic covers on all equipment. The crew also avoided contact with people.

Mr. Moore said that wearing an outfit resembling a spacesuit, or “personal protective equipment,” distances reporters even more from the people they are covering.

“It’s deeply weird to try and connect with people who are in a very difficult moment in their lives,” Mr. Moore said.

U.S. struggles in Ebola mission in Liberia

In the furious battle against time and a rampaging Ebola epidemic, the gravel crusher joined a long list of enemies.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin A. Holsinger was standing on an acre of neatly cleared dirt, surrounded by coconut trees, bush and bright yellow earth-moving equipment — the construction site for the first of 18 Ebola treatment centers the American military plans to build in Liberia.

Suddenly, around noon on Tuesday, the local contractor announced that the crusher’s engine, needed to smash rocks, had broken. Ergo, no gravel to lay down.

‘‘I’m frustrated,’’ said Petty Officer Holsinger, a United States Navy Seabee, as Liberian soldiers gazed at him from across the field. ‘‘I want to get this done and start helping people.’’

Two weeks after President Obama announced that time was running out in the fight to stem the epidemic, the American treatment centers planned here in the center of West Africa’s Ebola crisis are still a long way off.

The beds for the first field hospital, flown in by the military from Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio, remained in a hangar at Liberia’s main international airport, wrapped in plastic alongside the tents, generators and the medical equipment needed to set up the facility. Military planners say it will probably be 10 more days before even this first 25-bed treatment center is up and running.

And that unit is meant to be used solely by health care workers who become infected — not for the hundreds of new Ebola cases that have sprung up in this country in recent weeks. They will have to be served by the other 17 centers further back in the pipeline.

‘‘The response here is a race against time,’’ said Nancy Lindborg, assistant administrator with the United States Agency for International Development, which is helping the effort.

The need could not be more clear. For every Ebola patient being treated in a hospital or other setting where infected people can be isolated, there are about four more battling the disease at home, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually guaranteeing that Ebola victims will pass the virus on.

Every 30-day delay it takes to vastly increase the number of people in treatment beds could triple the number of cases occurring each day at the epidemic’s peak, the C.D.C. warned.

Even the Ebola case that surfaced in Dallas this past week appears to stem from the lack of treatment beds here in Liberia’s capital, about 5,700 miles away.

Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian who took the virus with him to Dallas, helped carry home a neighbor who was gravely ill with the symptoms of Ebola on Sept. 15, holding her by the legs after a hospital turned her away because there were no beds, her family and neighbors said. She died the next day. A few days later, Mr. Duncan flew to the United States, Liberian officials say, his own symptoms not yet evident.

In the end, the biggest obstacle may come after the new centers are built.

The military is not filling the treatment centers with doctors and nurses, so U.S.A.I.D. and the Liberian government are trying to figure out how to run them once they are completed.

The African Union, nongovernmental organizations and other nations — including Cuba — have promised to send health care workers to the region, and American officials are hoping to patch together enough personnel to operate the centers effectively. That includes training as many as 500 volunteers a week, a goal that many find overly optimistic.

‘‘It will be a huge challenge,’’ said Dr. Timothy P. Flanigan, an infectious disease specialist at Brown University who has been in Liberia for the past month.

The process is also long because setting up an Ebola treatment unit is nothing like setting up a regular Army field hospital. Military field hospitals usually treat trauma patients. An Ebola treatment unit requires quarantine rooms, chlorine shower stalls and larger-than-average bathrooms — because many Ebola patients die in the bathroom, where they collapse after violent bouts of vomiting and diarrhea, and need to be removed.

On Wednesday, Michael Lumpkin, an assistant secretary of defense, was at a 300-bed Ebola treatment center under construction on the site of Liberia’s wrecked and never occupied Ministry of Defense, built by the dictator Samuel Doe before he was killed in 1990 by a warlord, Prince Johnson.

‘‘Those viewing rooms over there are for families so they can have their last moments with the bodies,’’ said Ben Hemingway, a regional adviser for the U.S.A.I.D., underscoring how different Ebola treatment units are from Army field hospitals. ‘‘Over there is where the bodies will be cremated.’’

Then Mr. Lumpkin arrived at the EL-WA — Eternal Love Winning Africa — treatment center managed by Doctors Without Borders that is widely viewed as the model for the American units the military is building.

In the triage area, health workers behind orange plastic fencing greeted an ambulance with two new suspected cases, barking instructions at the driver.

‘‘Soon as you open the door, move from there!’’ one triage worker yelled out. ‘‘Now wash your hands! Don’t take off the gloves till you wash the hands!’’

The driver scrubbed his gloved hands, took off his gloves, and then washed his hands again in the chlorine water streaming from a cooler — such chlorinated faucets are at the entrance to public buildings, hotels, supermarkets and a host of other places.

Finally done, he moved away from the open ambulance. A minute passed, and two skinny legs appeared, attached to a 9-year-old boy. Slowly, he made his way to a plastic chair in the triage area, still separated from the workers by 10 feet and the plastic barrier. He collapsed into the chair and stared at the workers, who were wearing plastic shower caps and gloves.

He looked small and frightened.

‘‘Small boy, wha’ your name?’’ the triage worker shouted.

The boy answered.

‘‘How many times you now toilet?’’

‘‘Plenty,’’ the boy whispered.

‘‘Anybody now die from your house?’’

‘‘Three,’’ the boy said.

Two feet away, Mr. Lumpkin surveyed the scene. Hours later, he was still grappling with it.

‘‘The complexity of managing and running’’ an Ebola treatment center, he said, ‘‘was not apparent to me until I saw it firsthand.’’

Texas Narrows Ebola Focus to 10 Considered to Be at Greatest Risk

DALLAS — Health officials’ handling of the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States continued to raise questions Friday, after the hospital that is treating the patient and that mistakenly sent him home when he first came to its emergency room acknowledged that both the nurses and the doctors in that initial visit had access to the fact that he had arrived from Liberia.

For reasons that remain unclear, nurses and doctors failed to act on that information, and released the patient under the erroneous belief that he had a low-grade fever from a viral infection, allowing him to put others at risk of contracting Ebola. Those exposed included several schoolchildren, and the exposure has the potential to spread a disease in Dallas that has already killed more than 3,000 people in Africa.

On Thursday, the hospital, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, released a statement essentially blaming a flaw in its electronic health records system for its decision to send the patient — Thomas E. Duncan, a Liberian national visiting his girlfriend and relatives in the United States — home the first time he visited its emergency room, saying there were separate “workflows” for doctors and nurses in the records so the doctors did not receive the information that he had come from Africa.

But on Friday evening, the hospital effectively retracted that portion of its statement, saying that “there was no flaw” in its electronic health records system. The hospital said “the patient’s travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record (E.H.R.), including within the physician’s workflow.”

The hospital had said previously that the patient’s condition during his first visit did not warrant admission and that he was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola.

The admission came on a day when health officials narrowed down to 10 the number of people considered most at risk of contracting Ebola after coming into contact with Mr. Duncan. They also moved the four people who had shared an apartment with him from their potentially contaminated quarters, as local and federal officials tried to assure the public that the disease was contained despite initial missteps here.

The four people, a girlfriend of Mr. Duncan and three of her relatives, had been under orders not to leave their home, and Texas officials apologized to them for not moving faster to have the apartment cleaned of potentially infectious materials.

The cleanup began Friday afternoon — more than a week after Mr. Duncan first went to the hospital — as television-news helicopters swirled in the skies above and workers in yellow protective suits scoured the apartment, whose entryway and balcony were covered with a tarp.

“I want to see them treated as I would want my own family treated,” said County Judge Clay Jenkins, the top elected official of Dallas County, who visited the family inside the apartment on Thursday night and again on Friday, when he drove them to an undisclosed location, where they will remain under quarantine.

Mr. Jenkins and other officials described their temporary home as a four-bedroom residence “away from other people” on a multi-acre property within the city limits, donated for them by an unnamed member of the Dallas faith community.

“I’m a married man with a little girl who will have her ninth birthday next week,” Mr. Jenkins told reporters. “I’m wearing the same shirt I was when I was in the car with that family.” He added: “If there were any risk, I would not expose myself or my family to that risk. But there is zero risk. These people are asymptomatic.”

On Thursday, a glitch had stopped the cleanup.

Kasey Bonner, the coordinator for the Cleaning Guys, the company hired to do the job, said its workers were not allowed to enter because the company did not have permission to transport hazardous material by road. “There was no protocol put in place for handling Ebola on Texas highways,” she said.

Mr. Jenkins said Friday evening that local officials continued to lack a state Department of Transportation permit to dispose of the materials taken from the apartment. The materials will be put in sealed plastic barrels on a trailer attached to a truck, and the truck will be stored.

“That sealed truck trailer with the sealed barrels inside of it will be guarded by deputies, until such time as the permitting can be achieved,” he said. “It causes no risk to the public.”

The confusion was indicative of the various local, state and federal protocols and levels of preparedness that have raised questions about the ability of the nation’s health care infrastructure to handle a potential epidemic.

In Washington on Friday, while military officials announced that the Army would more than double the number of soldiers it is sending to West Africa to help contain the Ebola virus there, senior White House officials tried to play down the series of missteps in the handling of the Ebola case in Dallas. They insisted that the public health system in the United States was working effectively and would prevent an epidemic of the deadly virus from taking root in this country.

White House aides defended the administration’s response, saying that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been working closely for months with state health officials, doctors and hospitals.

Around the country, anxiety spread Friday as two hospitals in the Washington area each reported a possible case of Ebola, and a television journalist working in Liberia prepared to return to the United States after being told that he had the virus. Besides the 10 people considered most at risk in Dallas, another 40 people are being monitored in the city but are considered at relatively low risk, officials said. No one has developed any symptoms. The first signs of the illness often appear within eight to 10 days, but can take as long as 21 days.

White House officials acknowledged the public’s growing nervousness, but said Americans had little to worry about.

“There’s a lot of fear,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s the unknown. It’s the cataclysmic nature of it — namely, it’s acute, it kills in a high percentage.”

But he said, “The system that’s in place, with our health care infrastructure, would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.”

In a briefing with reporters on Friday, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the total United States military presence in West Africa could rise to as high as 4,000, an increase from the 3,000 that Mr. Obama announced several weeks ago. Admiral Kirby also announced that the Army itself would more than double the number of soldiers it was sending to West Africa, to 3,200.

But the White House did not announce any new initiatives inside the United States to address concerns about the sometimes chaotic response in Dallas. In the last several months, officials said the C.D.C. had expanded facilities capable of testing for Ebola and had mailed detailed information six times to health professionals about how to treat and contain it. On Thursday, the federal government sent another set of guidelines on Ebola, they said.

But federal officials flatly rejected the idea of expanding the screening of passengers arriving from West Africa, and said they would not support calls for a ban on travel to the United States from countries being ravaged by the disease. They said such moves would be ineffective and, at worst, could prevent medical workers and other assistance from reaching Africa.

“We believe those types of steps actually impede the response,” Lisa Monaco, the president’s homeland security adviser, said of proposals to restrict air travel. “They impede and slow down the ability of the United States and other international partners to actually get expertise and capabilities and equipment into the affected areas.”

Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, the chairman of a health oversight committee in the House, said he was “deeply concerned” about the travel decision, and said his committee would hold a hearing in about two weeks to examine the federal government’s response to the outbreak.

Administration officials have spent the last several weeks repeatedly offering assurances that the American health system was well equipped to seamlessly handle the virus if it arrived on the country’s shores. President Obama has said several times that he has confidence in the C.D.C.

But images from Monrovia, Liberia and Dallas in the last few days have raised new questions about the adequacy of the American effort on both continents.

In Liberia, the help Mr. Obama promised several weeks ago has been slow to arrive, and logistical glitches have prevented the United States military from being able to quickly set up the hospitals and treatment centers needed to halt the virus. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, commander of the Africa Command, told reporters in Washington that the military was working quickly, but that it could take “several weeks” to get the hospitals built and the medical personnel trained.

And in Dallas, the misstep at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Mr. Duncan is in serious condition, came after the acknowledgment Thursday by other health officials that the apartment where he had stayed with a friend, Louise Troh, as well as three of her relatives, had not been sanitized, with the sheets and towels that he had used while sick and vomiting still there.

Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at Harvard University’s School of Public Health, said there appeared to be “literally multiple failures” that led to Mr. Duncan’s release on Sept. 25, only to be hospitalized three days later when his symptoms worsened. Among them, he said, are that the nurse who learned Mr. Duncan had just come from Liberia failed to tell a doctor directly.

“In a well-functioning emergency department, doctors and nurses talk to each other,” Dr. Jha said. “Also, why didn’t the physician think to ask the question separately? Anyone who comes in with a febrile illness, a travel history, that’s a fundamental part of understanding what might be going on.”

He added, “For me, the most disappointing thing isn’t that the system didn’t work, but in the aftermath, instead of helping every other hospital in the country understand where their system failed and learn from it, they have thrown out a whole lot of distractions.”

The criticism from the health experts contrasted sharply with the tone coming from federal officials, who said the most important thing they could do was to communicate with the public about the need to be careful and the need to remain calm.

Ms. Monaco said she was confident that the mistakes made at the hospital would not be repeated at other health facilities. She also noted that since March, when the first Ebola cases were reported in Africa, thousands of people from the affected region had flown to the United States, and there has been only one known case of Ebola.

“The United States is prepared to deal with this crisis, both at home and in the region,” Ms. Monaco said. “Every Ebola outbreak over the past 40 years has been stopped. We know how to do this, and we will do it again.”

As the Ebola epidemic intensifies across parts of West Africa, nations and aid agencies are pledging to respond with increasing force. But the disease has already raced far ahead of the promises, sweeping into areas that are not in the least prepared for it. Overflowing hospitals have turned away sick patients, and a dearth of trained medical personnel and proper equipment has compounded the spread of the brutal disease.

The following organizations are involved in trying to halt the outbreak and help those affected in a variety of ways.

Doctors Without Borders

This organization has treated more Ebola patients in this outbreak than any other entity. Here is a list of ways to contribute to the group's work.

International Medical Corps

The International Medical Corps, which conducts health care training, relief and development programs, is focused on responding to the outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia. It is seeking staff and volunteer workers as well as donations.

Unicef

Unicef, the United Nations children's agency, is focused on distributing equipment and educating families in West Africa about how to protect themselves. Donations for specific Ebola efforts can be made here.

Save the Children

Save the Children says that donations will go toward training teachers, health workers, nurses and local organizations on prevention measures. The organization is also distributing protective kits and essential medical equipment.

International Red Cross

The International Red Cross, which has a history in Liberia, says it plans to send additional staff members to Monrovia and other parts of the country to help with the outbreak. A related organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has more than 4,000 volunteers in West Africa focused on Ebola. It has reached about 40 percent of its funding goal for efforts in Liberia. Visitors can volunteer, apply for a job or donate here. The American Red Cross is supporting the efforts of their global partners as well.

World Food Program

The organization says it is working to prevent this public health crisis from becoming a food crisis by distributing food to patients and their families.

Samaritan's Purse

This Christian organization, which has a long history in Liberia, is focused on delivering supplies and equipment to be used in the fight against Ebola.

Partners in Health

Partners in Health says it is working closely with an organization in Liberia and another in Sierra Leone to combat the outbreak. The organization is looking for health care professionals to join its staff as well as volunteers for short- and long-term positions. It is also accepting donations, specifically for its Ebola programs.

Americares

The organization says that it will direct its resources toward sending emergency medical aid -- including masks, protective clothing and disposable gowns -- to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Ebola Crisis Brings an Abundance of Caution Into a Dallas Community

DALLAS -- On any other day, the United Parcel Service worker who delivers to the Ivy Apartments here would have made his rounds and handled his packages with his bare hands. But these are not ordinary times in this working-class immigrant community northeast of downtown.

On Friday afternoon, the deliveryman, parked across the street from the apartment complex, wore black athletic gloves, fearful of Ebola. The Ivy is where the man with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States had been staying since arriving from Liberia, and where four people close to him have been quarantined by health officials.

''I started wearing them as soon as I found out what happened over there,'' the U.P.S. deliveryman, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to talk to the news media, said of his gloves. ''I'm terrified, to be honest with you. People have to sign. I'm really scared for them to even touch my board.''

The Ebola crisis that has been unfolding in Dallas has had a subtle, but distinct impact on daily life near the apartment where the Liberian man whom city officials call Patient Zero was living -- the limiting, however unnecessary, of ''direct contact'' among strangers, neighbors, friends and classmates. People have gone about their daily affairs without widespread panic, but they have done so washing their hands more often than they typically would, using hand sanitizer at the mere mention of Ebola and being wary of casual contact that would not have merited a second thought in the past.

Some of the parents at the schools that several students who came into contact with the patient attended have been telling their children not to shake classmates' hands, or they have kept their children at home. One high school senior said he thought about wearing a medical mask to school but could not find one.

Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said when he encounters people who have recently been to Liberia, he asks how long they have been back. He declines to shake their hands if they have been back fewer than 21 days, the typical incubation period for the virus.

Nathan S. Kortu, the bishop of New Life Fellowship Church in nearby Euless, which hosted an emergency meeting of the Liberian community, planned to tell his congregation on Sunday that anyone hosting recent arrivals from Liberia at their homes should make them sleep in a separate bedroom for 21 days.

Maru Mekonen, 49, an Ethiopian who owns Maru Computer Services, a repair shop near the Ivy, used to shake hands with his customers when they stepped inside, particularly his Ethiopian customers.

''No more,'' Mr. Mekonen said. ''When my customers come, I used to just shake first and say, 'How are you?' Now I just say, 'Hey,' and stop.''

Fueling some of the fear is not only misinformation -- Ebola is not an airborne illness, it is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person -- but also the handling of the situation by local, state and federal officials.

Three days after the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, was given an Ebola diagnosis and eight days after he first went to the hospital feeling ill but was mistakenly sent home, a contractor on Friday began cleaning the apartment where Mr. Duncan had been staying.

The scene outside the apartment had become extraordinary in recent days: a quarantine in a fish bowl, as Apartment 614 was watched by dozens of reporters and fire and police officials on the streets outside.

The family was later moved from the apartment by the authorities. City and county officials suggested Friday that one of the reasons they moved the family was to minimize disruptions and anxiety for residents of the complex, a diverse place where seven languages are spoken.

Jennifer Staubach Gates, the member of the Dallas City Council who represents the area, said one of the perimeter apartments far from the family's unit ''had rocks thrown in it'' on Thursday night. ''There was three men that had been told, when they showed up for work this morning, that they couldn't work at this place of employment because they lived in this apartment complex,'' Ms. Gates said. ''They need to feel normal again, and they need to be respected, and they need to get back to life as normal.''

Health officials said on Friday that they had identified 10 people who are most at risk of contracting Ebola after coming into contact with Mr. Duncan. Among them are the four people who shared the apartment with Mr. Duncan, and medical workers who came into contact with him. An additional 40 people are being monitored daily, but are considered at relatively low risk, officials said.

No one has developed any symptoms of the disease, and Mr. Duncan remains at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in serious condition.

There is widespread confusion and a deep misunderstanding about how Ebola spreads on the streets surrounding the Ivy.

''I'm very worried, very worried,'' the U.P.S. worker said. ''Isn't it like hand-to-hand contact or something like that?''

The disease is contagious only if the infected person is experiencing active symptoms, but it is not spread through casual contact.

''If you sit next to someone on a bus, you're not exposed,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''This is not like flu. It's not like measles. It's not like the common cold. It's not as spreadable. It's not as infectious as those conditions. What's scary about it is that it's so serious, it's so severe, if you do become infected with it.''

Children on Friday walked past the Dallas apartment complex where a man who was sickened with Ebola was living. Some parents have chosen to keep their children out of schools in the area. (PHOTOGRAPH BY COOPER NEILL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

A Liberian man, who became infected with the Ebola virus in Monrovia and flew to the United States, this week became the first case in the West African outbreak diagnosed in this country. His presence has raised questions about contagion on planes and the most effective methods of preventing those infected from flying here. As policy makers debate how best to address the crisis, here's what's currently being done.

Are passengers being screened before they enter the United States?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been relying on authorities in West Africa to screen passengers for signs of Ebola.

As part of that process, the agency advises that airport workers in West Africa ask travelers if they have been exposed to Ebola in the last 21 days, have had a fever and have had any symptoms including severe headache, muscle ache, abdominal pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. The screener is expected to use a hand-held noncontact temperature monitor, a few inches from the traveler's forehead, to check for fever.

But the system has its limits, relying on the traveler to reveal whether he or she has been exposed. Liberian officials said on Thursday that they planned to prosecute Thomas E. Duncan, the infected man who flew to Dallas, for lying on an airport questionnaire about not having contact with a person infected with Ebola before his travel -- a pivotal component of the country's screening process.

Is any screening being done in the United States?

The Customs and Border Protection personnel are looking for overt signs of illnesses and questioning passengers at all United States ports of entry, according to the Department of Homeland Security. When a traveler appears ill or supplies information that would give cause to suspect infection, border patrol personnel will notify the C.D.C., and medical professionals from the agency will examine the individual and determine the next steps.

Marsha Catron, a homeland security spokeswoman, added that the C.D.C. and the border patrol would start providing a sheet to all travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea with medical information, should the traveler begin to develop symptoms of Ebola, which usually appear between two and 21 days of exposure. The sheet also includes instructions to be given to the traveler's doctor, with recommendations for treating and containing the sickness.

In an interview with The Times on Thursday, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., said he recognized that Americans were increasingly anxious about how the virus is able to arrive in the United States from affected countries in Africa. But he said a more aggressive screening of passengers as they arrive at United States airports was not a viable solution. ''We wish we had a situation where we could say the risk is zero,'' he said. ''But until we stop the outbreak in Africa, there is no way we can say that.''

Are airlines taking any measures?

United Airlines is contacting several hundred passengers who traveled with Mr. Duncan on his two flights from Liberia to Dallas on Sept. 20, according to several reports. As The Times reported on Wednesday, airlines have not taken any specific steps to deal with Ebola, according to representatives from several carriers. They follow general guidelines issued by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread.

Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian Ebola patient who died of the illness in Texas on Wednesday, contracted the virus in Monrovia but flew to Dallas while infected. Though the current outbreak has so far been concentrated in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/Ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html] the fact that Mr. Duncan managed to take three flights to his final destination in the United States revealed weaknesses in passenger screening procedures and raised fears that the virus could be spread via international travel. As a result, the authorities here and abroad and air carriers have refined what had been routine travel procedures. Here is what you can expect.

How are air travelers being screened in the United States?

Enhanced screening measures[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/us-to-begin-ebola-screenings-at-5-airports.html?emc=edit_na_20141008&nlid=57704672] will go in effect at five major hubs for passengers traveling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, federal officials said on Wednesday, including temperature checks and detailed questioning on arrival.

The screenings will start this weekend at Kennedy International in New York and will start next week at Washington Dulles International, O’Hare International, Hartsfield-Jackson International and Newark Liberty International. Passengers will also undergo detailed questioning upon their arrival.

Passengers at other points of entry will continue to be screened by customs agents, who examine travelers for visible signs of illness and distribute fact sheets to those who have traveled in West African nations affected by the outbreak. In addition, the T.S.A. is providing guidance to airlines on how to identify passengers who are ill.

Are passengers being screened elsewhere?

Britain announced Thursday that it would introduce measures at airports and an international rail terminal to screen passengers from countries affected by the deadly Ebola virus.

“Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals,” said a statement from Prime Minister David Cameron’s office, referring to the city’s international rail link with continental Europe.

The broader E.U. has no screening measures in place. Dr. Denis Coulombier, head of surveillance and response at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, said that in the wake of Mr. Duncan’s death, the agency — which coordinates the work of health agencies of the European Union’s 28 member states — was studying the possibility of screening those arriving in Europe from Ebola-affected countries.

An agency spokesman said it was currently reviewing its assessment of the Ebola risk in Europe and that revised guidelines could be provided to the region’s public health authorities as early as Friday.

People departing the West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak are screened before they fly[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/06/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa]. They must fill out a health questionnaire and undergo a visual assessment and a temperature check by a non-contact thermometer.

The efficacy of that system has been questioned, however, because Liberian officials say that Mr. Duncan slipped through the screening process in Monrovia after lying on his questionnaire[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/africa/dallas-ebola-patient-thomas-duncan-airport-screening.html], claiming that he had not been in contact with anybody sickened by Ebola when in fact he had helped transport an infected pregnant woman to a hospital and back[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?ref=africa].

Are there plans for a travel ban from West Africa?

A few officials have suggested banning [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/bobby_jindal_calls_for_restric.html]flights to and from affected countries[http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/bobby_jindal_calls_for_restric.html], but the Obama administration has so far dismissed the idea, saying that a ban could slow the flow of aid to those countries. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/media/releases/2014/t1004-ebola-confirmed-case.html] at a press conference Saturday that restricting travel to affected nations could drive traffic into other parts of Africa, making it even harder to contain and eliminate the virus.

Are carriers still operating flights to affected nations?

Some international airlines, including British Airways and Kenya Airways, have suspended flights since August. But others, including Royal Air Maroc and Brussels Airlines, have regularly scheduled departures to destinations in West Africa. Keep in mind that the C.D.C. has advised avoiding nonessential travel[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/ebola] to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

What are air carriers doing?

Airlines have not made any broad shifts to deal with Ebola, according to representatives from several carriers. They follow general guidelines issued by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread.

Could you get Ebola by sharing a flight with someone who is infected?

It’s possible but not likely. The disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/understanding-the-risks-of-ebola-and-what-direct-contact-means.html] — blood, vomit, urine, diarrhea — of a contagious person, and those people are unlikely to feel well enough to fly.

A Week Dominated by Hong Kong, Ebola and the Secret Service

Much of the news in this past week was about security and its failures — the untrammeled journey of a man infected with Ebola from Liberia to Europe to Texas; the lapses of the Secret Service in protecting the president; the vast but seemingly victimless data breach at JPMorgan Chase.

These competed with more heartening — or worrying, depending on one’s point of view — reports from Hong Kong, where tens of thousands of students and other demonstrators protested the Chinese Communist Party’s plan to screen candidates for top Hong Kong offices.

Under the agreement by which Britain turned Hong Kong over to China in 1997, there are to be free elections for the city’s chief executive in 2017. But late in August, China declared that the candidates would be vetted, essentially undermining the democratic process.

Protesters — dubbed “Occupy Central With Love and Peace” by participants and the “umbrella revolution” on social media for the ubiquitous umbrellas deployed against tear gas, pepper spray and the occasional downpour — poured out in vast numbers, occupying key intersections across the crowded city.

At week’s end, the protest began to lose momentum, partly from lack of a unified leadership or program, and partly under pressure from residents seeking to open blocked thoroughfares. The current chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, and his Beijing mentors were certain to see that as a victory.

But the very absence of a coherent organization put the lie to Beijing’s claim that the demonstrations were a conspiracy of anti-China forces. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has made clear that he will not allow Western-style democracy in Hong Kong — and certainly not in China, where news of the demonstrations was blocked. This one is not going away.

Ebola in America

The ability of the Ebola virus to leap continents in a single bound was demonstrated by Thomas E. Duncan, a Liberian who became infected in the country’s capital of Monrovia when he accompanied a 19-year-old woman dying of the disease to a hospital — and helped carry her back home when the hospital could find no place for her. She died soon after.

Four days after the mission of mercy, Mr. Duncan set off on Sept. 19 on flights to Brussels and on to the United States to visit friends in the large Liberian community in Dallas. He went through screening at the Monrovia airport to identify potentially infected travelers — his temperature was taken and he filled out a form saying he had not been in contact with any Ebola patients. He later said he thought that the woman he helped was having problems with her pregnancy.

In Dallas, Mr. Duncan developed the symptoms so feared back in his country: the fever, sore throat, joint pains and headaches of incipient Ebola. But when he went to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on the night of Sept. 25, and even after he told officials there that he had just arrived from West Africa, doctors sent him home. He was back in the hospital on Sunday, and this time the authorities went into high gear. An exhaustive search has begun to identify, and in some cases to quarantine, the 12 to 18 people who had been in close contact with Mr. Duncan in Dallas. Mr. Duncan is now in serious but stable condition.

Authorities in Monrovia said they will press charges against him for giving false information at the airport. They may fear that others who are potentially infected will also try to make it to Europe or to the United States, where chances of survival are incomparably better than in Monrovia.

Why pay so much attention to one case brought into the United States when so many people are becoming infected and dying in West Africa? The case of Mr. Duncan is important in that it demonstrates how easily a rampant virus can spread to distant corners of the world.

The United Nations, however, was quick to warn that isolating affected countries is not the answer, both because of the hardships and panic it would create and the need for aid workers to come and go.

Security Breach, Part I

Omar J. Gonzalez’s vault over the White House fence and his sprint deep into the presidential mansion raised some urgent questions about the competence of the Secret Service, an agency already battered by a series of well-publicized faux pas.

Before the feat of Mr. Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran, an armed security guard with an arrest record got into an elevator with President Obama at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and snapped some pictures. And back in 2011, the Obamas were said to have been furious when they learned that the service was not immediately aware that shots had been fired at the White House. Then there were the three agents sent home from the Netherlands after one got drunk the night before the president was to arrive. And the eight agents fired after allegedly soliciting prostitutes on an official trip to Colombia.

So on Tuesday, the director of the Secret Service, Julia Pierson, was thoroughly thrashed by congressmen of both parties at a House hearing. “It won’t happen again,” she pledged, but it was too late. On Wednesday, she resigned and Joseph Clancy, a former agent who had been known in the service as “Father Joe” for his no-nonsense demeanor, was named acting head.

One of his first tasks will be to get the Secret Service off the late-night talk shows. Example: Jimmy Fallon, host of NBC’s “Tonight Show,” says Ms. Pierson is going to miss working at the White House, “but knowing the Secret Service, she should be able to come back any time she wants.”

Security Breach, Part II

J. P. Morgan was not known for thinking small, even if it’s not entirely certain that he actually said, “If you have to ask the price, you can’t afford it.” The successor of the bank he founded, JPMorgan Chase, is the largest in the nation, and whoever sneaked into its computers compromised not a paltry million accounts, as was initially reported, but the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses.

The breach was discovered in July, but the updated tally was revealed in a securities filing on Thursday. It surpassed the huge recent data breaches at Target and Home Depot, and is a lot more noxious. Target and Home Depot involved credit cards; a bank has a lot more financial data.

The puzzling thing is that investigators have found no evidence of looted customer accounts, so the motive remains unclear.

Ebola’s Cultural Casualty: Hugs in Hands-On Liberia

MONROVIA, Liberia — It is hard enough to push away family and friends, shunning an embrace or even a shake of the hand to protect yourself from Ebola.

But imagine trying not to touch your 2-year-old daughter when she is feverish, vomiting blood and in pain.

Precious Diggs, a 33-year-old contractor for a rubber company, had heard all the warnings from the legions of public health workers here in Liberia. She had seen the signs that dot the road from Harbel, where she works, to the capital, Monrovia, some 35 miles away: “Ebola is Here and Real!” they say. “Stop the Denial!”

But when her toddler, Rebecca, started “toileting and vomiting,” there was no way her mother was not going to pick her up.

“Na mind, baby,” Ms. Diggs whispered in her baby’s ear. “I beg you, na mind.”

Here in the heart of the worst Ebola outbreak in history, the question of whether to touch a stranger has only one answer: you don’t. But even in more intimate circles, in families and among lifelong friends, Liberians are starting to pull away from one another, straining against generations of a culture in which closeness is expressed through physical contact.

Liberia — from the elite doyennes who spend their days sending houseboys to the market to fetch oranges for them, all the way to the young boys on Tubman Boulevard who run up to cars hawking plastic bags of ice — used to be a tactile place. Everybody kissed friends, strangers and cousins, regardless of whether people met every day or had not seen one another in 20 years.

In a version of the gentile affectations that freed American slaves brought with them two centuries ago when they came here, the double-cheek kiss, for decades, was the standard greeting. People often held hands while singing hymns at First United Methodist Church on Ashmun Street on Sundays, and after services sometimes took up to an hour to disperse, going systematically from cheek to cheek.

At parties in Monrovia, new arrivals went from person to person around a room, taking the hand of each seated guest as they bent down to kiss and chat. Sometimes it could take 15 to 20 minutes to make the rounds at a house party of just 10 people. When it was time to leave, the ritual began again.

That’s all gone now. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids: vomit, blood, feces, tears, saliva and sweat. Close contact has become taboo.

The Liberian government has decreed that taxis — which used to cram in six, seven, eight people, and in a recent case, four goats even — are allowed to take just three people in the back seat: fewer riders to touch one another.

Sylvester Vagn, 40, who was a corporate driver with a tech company before he was laid off a few months ago, said Thursday that even with only two people sharing the taxi with him, he still now jams his body against the door. Whichever arm is closest to his fellow passengers, he places it across his body and practically out the window.

“I sit so, with my head so,” he said, demonstrating how he leans his head as far away as possible. “And I bring jacket.”

Clara K. Mallah, 27, wears long sleeves, pulling them over her hands whenever her 3-year-old niece comes running up to her. Ms. Mallah, a national translator with an international organization in Monrovia, makes an exception only for her 52-year-old mother, a diabetic amputee who never leaves the house. Even so, Ms. Mallah has trepidation.

“If my mom could walk,” she said, “I wouldn’t touch her.”

Those close family ties expose the fragility of the belief that you can completely protect yourself from Ebola by keeping your hands to yourself. Can you really not touch an ailing mother?

Ephraim Dunbar couldn’t. When Mr. Dunbar, 37, got a phone call in late August that his mother had taken ill, he rushed to her house in Dolos Town, the enclave near Harbel where dozens of people have succumbed to Ebola. He found her in bed, vomiting blood.

His mind went immediately to the precautions against the virus. He did his best not to touch her. But as she grew worse, unable to keep anything down, he gave her milk, and tried to soothe her. His skin touched hers.

His mother died the next day.

Just after his mother’s funeral, Mr. Dunbar’s own forehead got hot with fever. For 15 days, he stayed at John F. Kennedy Hospital in Monrovia, fighting the disease. It was a fight he eventually won. But when he got out of the hospital, he found out that four of his sisters, his brother, his father, his aunt, his uncle and his two nephews, had died. His entire family, wiped out in days.

On Friday, Mr. Dunbar said he would do nothing different. “That’s my ma,” he said, “that she the one born me.”

Levy Zeopuegar’s Achilles’ heel was his oldest sister, Neconie — “one father, one mother,” he described her in the Liberian way of distinguishing the special bond of full siblings in a country where half brothers or half sisters are common.

When Neconie got sick, her brother chartered a private car to take her to the hospital and climbed in with her. When the driver pointed out that blood was pooling from her nose, Mr. Zeopuegar turned to her with a towel.

Neconie died. Her husband, also in the car, died. Mr. Zeopuegar almost died as well, spending 19 days in the Ebola treatment unit in Harbel. For days, he hiccupped blood, feeling each day was his last, until finally, one morning, he woke up and knew he would live.

“You have to understand,” he tried to explain. “This Ebola thing. You will see your son or daughter sick in bed and say, ‘I not touching her?’ That is impossible.”

And yet, that is what Liberians must do to combat the virus. On the streets of Monrovia, it sometimes seems impossible. Children still run around in local markets pushing and playing. People in wheelchairs still roll up to cars at red lights, palms outstretched. Boys still push their way through the densely crowded West Point neighborhood.

Many people say they have not felt the warmth of human skin in months. Many do not shake hands or kiss any more. No caressing. No hugging.

But some still do. Sister Barbara Brillant, dean of Mother Patern College of Health Sciences at St. Theresa’s Convent, last week was driving down the street when she saw a young couple holding hands.

“Stop holding hands!” she yelled out the car window.

“They looked at me like I was crazy,” Sister Barbara said later.

So when 2-year-old Rebecca got sick, Precious Diggs picked her baby up. Rebecca did not make it, and died days later.

She passed Ebola on to her mom.

Weeks later, Ms. Diggs was released from a treatment unit. She sat in front of the discharge tent with a row of eight people, all recovered from the disease, all waiting to walk out into new and starkly different lives.

100 Possible Ebola Cases Reported in U.S., but All Save 1 Are Ruled Out

DALLAS — In Washington, a patient who had traveled to Nigeria and who was suspected of having Ebola was placed in isolation at Howard University Hospital on Thursday. In New Haven, two Yale University graduate students plan to voluntarily sequester themselves when they return this weekend from Liberia, where they had helped the government develop a system to track the Ebola epidemic. And at Newark Liberty International Airport on Saturday, a sick man who had just arrived from Brussels was rushed to a hospital amid suspicions that he was showing Ebola-like symptoms.

With fears about Ebola widening across the United States, federal health officials said on Saturday that they were receiving an escalating number of reports of possible Ebola infection, particularly since a Liberian man tested positive for the deadly disease in Dallas last week, the first Ebola case diagnosed in this country. Since the disease began spreading rapidly across West Africa over the summer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, it has assessed more than 100 possible cases, but only the Dallas case has been confirmed.

But increased attention about the virus has jangled nerves in the public, particularly among West African immigrant communities and recent travelers to that region, and placed health care workers on a kind of high alert in hospitals and clinics across the country. “We expect that we will see more rumors, or concerns, or possibilities of cases,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the federal C.D.C., said on Saturday. “Until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are — rumors and concerns.”

In the more than 100 inquiries the C.D.C. has received about possible Ebola, about 15 people were actually tested for the virus, according to officials at the disease centers. In addition to doing their own testing on suspected cases, federal officials have helped more than a dozen laboratories around the United States do their own Ebola testing.

One of those cases was at Howard University Hospital in Washington, which issued a statement on Saturday saying that, after working with the District of Columbia Health Department and the federal disease centers, it had “ruled out” Ebola in a patient who was admitted on Thursday. The patient, who had traveled to Nigeria, had been placed in isolation “in an abundance of caution,” a statement by the university’s president, Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick, said.

In a sign of the seriousness of the virus, the Dallas hospital where the Liberian man, Thomas E. Duncan, has been recovering changed the status of his condition on Saturday from serious to critical.

Obama administration officials said they believe that screening of passengers in the affected countries in Africa, by taking their temperature and requesting information about their activities, is the best way to prevent the virus from spreading to the United States. But they said Jeh Johnson, the secretary of homeland security, is evaluating whether other measures, including more aggressive screening of arriving passengers at airports in the United States, might be necessary in the future.

The Obama administration said Saturday that it had issued an emergency permit allowing an Illinois company to transport large quantities of potentially Ebola-contaminated material from the apartment where Mr. Duncan had stayed, as well as from the hospital where he is being treated, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The permit ends days of delays in disposing of the waste.

Federal officials said on Saturday that they had narrowed the pool of people who were at a high risk of exposure because of contact with Mr. Duncan to nine, all of whom are being closely monitored.

Initially, officials had reached out to 114 people in the Dallas area who potentially had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan since he arrived in the city on Sept. 20. They have reduced that number to about 50 — the nine at high risk because they had definite contact with Mr. Duncan and about 40 others considered at lower risk.

“We don’t know that they had contact, but because we’re not certain that they did not have contact, we will be monitoring them as well,” said Dr. Frieden. Some of those people included patients who traveled in the ambulance that had carried Mr. Duncan to the hospital before it was taken out of service and cleaned.

The nine people who were at the highest risk include Mr. Duncan’s girlfriend and three of her relatives, who stayed with him in their Dallas apartment, as well as medical workers.

On Friday, local officials moved the four people who had been staying with Mr. Duncan. Amid criticism that health officials had delayed cleaning the apartment and that they had failed to properly care for the four people quarantined inside, workers in yellow protective suits began cleaning the unit on Friday.

The delay in cleaning the apartment was due in part to confusion and conflicting guidance over state and federal permitting. “This has been a paperwork nightmare,” Mayor Michael S. Rawlings of Dallas said.

That bottleneck was just one of several problems connected with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the country.

Texas Health Presbyterian sent Mr. Duncan home when he first came to its emergency room on Sept. 25 after health workers failed to consider the possibility that he had Ebola. On Friday, the hospital acknowledged that both the nurses and the doctors in that initial visit had access to the fact that he had arrived from Liberia but, for reasons that remain unclear, failed to act on that information.

Local officials on Friday evening were continuing to complain that they lacked a Department of Transportation permit to dispose of the materials taken from the apartment where Mr. Duncan stayed, an issue that had prevented the cleaning crew from starting its work earlier. But by Saturday morning, the department said it had issued “an emergency special permit” that appeared to clear the way for the disposal of the materials.

The permit authorizes an Illinois company, Stericycle, based in Lake Forest, to transport large quantities of Ebola-contaminated waste from Texas Health Presbyterian. Officials would not disclose where the waste will be disposed of.

The emergency permit specifies how the waste material should be handled and requires use of a particular disinfectant. The packaging requirements, though different from those in federal regulations, will provide “an equivalent level of safety,” the administration said.

Hospitals say they would face a major challenge disposing of waste generated in the care of Ebola patients because two federal agencies — the Transportation Department and the Department of Health and Human Services — have issued conflicting guidance on what they should do. As a result, hospitals say, waste may pile up.

Administration officials said they were drafting new guidance to clarify their recommendations.

Contaminated waste materials include medical equipment, bedsheets and “personal protective equipment” like gowns, masks, gloves, goggles and respirators. The material collected by the Cleaning Guys, the company hired to disinfect the apartment where Mr. Duncan had been staying, was being placed in sealed plastic barrels on a trailer attached to a truck, and the truck was being stored at an undisclosed location.

“There is a lot of waste material generated by even a single Ebola patient,” said Dr. Jeffrey S. Duchin, chairman of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “Hospitals are in a huge bind right now because they do not have a way to dispose of it.”

On Friday, Dallas County’s chief executive, County Judge Clay Jenkins, drove the family that had occupied the apartment to a new home at an undisclosed remote location.

Manny Fernandez reported from Dallas, and Robert Pear from Washington. Abby Goodnough contributed reporting from Washington, and Emma G. Fitzsimmons from New York.

A sick passenger traveling from Brussels to Newark Liberty International Airport was taken to a hospital in New Jersey on Saturday amid concern that he could have the Ebola virus, but tests subsequently showed that he had an unrelated illness, hospital officials said.

Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded to the plane when it landed shortly after noon and took the passenger, a 35-year-old man who had traveled from West Africa and vomited during the flight, to University Hospital in Newark ''as a precaution,'' said Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.

The man, whose name was not released, was traveling with his daughter on United Airlines Flight 998, a Boeing 777 that left Brussels at about 10 a.m. local time Saturday with 255 passengers and 14 crew members on board, according to United Airlines. The girl was also taken to the hospital, Ms. Dumas said.

On Saturday night, hospital officials said they had evaluated both patients and had found that the man's symptoms were ''consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola,'' the hospital said. Both the man and his daughter, who showed no symptoms, were released and would continue to be monitored, the hospital said.

The man was discharged from the hospital's emergency room ''feeling well'' after a ''full medical evaluation revealed no evidence or concern for Ebola,'' the C.D.C. said.

Officials from the C.D.C. and the Port Authority Police Department had allowed the other passengers to leave the plane at about 1:50 p.m., Ms. Dumas said. They then had to pass through customs.

The passengers, who were detained after their eight-hour flight, began to leave the airport at about 4:30 p.m. In tones that suggested a combination of frustration and exhaustion, some paused to talk to reporters gathered in the terminal about their experiences, while others left.

Paul Chard, 50, of Orlando, Fla., was among those on the flight. Mr. Chard said the plane had been sitting on the airport tarmac for more than an hour before he realized anything was amiss. At that point, he said, two C.D.C. officials wearing protective suits boarded the plane. A short time later, he said, they led away a man who was wearing a mask and gloves, followed by a child.

''That's when people started putting two and two together,'' Mr. Chard said.

Once the passengers left the plane, a C.D.C. official collected their contact information and travel itineraries, and handed out fliers describing how the Ebola virus can be spread and the steps to be taken by those who believe they may be experiencing symptoms. The agency advised passengers to take their temperatures daily for at least 21 days -- the length of time it usually takes for symptoms to appear -- and to bring the flier with them to a doctor if they developed a fever.

Mr. Chard, for one, said he planned to follow that advice.

''I'll keep an eye on myself for the next few days,'' he said. ''I'll make sure I'm O.K. I think it's human nature to worry.''

Ebola Patient in Dallas ‘Fighting for His Life,’ C.D.C. Director Says

DALLAS — The Ebola patient here is “fighting for his life,” but he remains the only confirmed victim of the disease in the United States, and public health officials remain confident about their ability to contain the disease, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.

While expressing such confidence about the American effort, the director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said on the CNN program “State of the Union” that in Africa, “the virus is spreading so fast that it’s hard to keep up.”

Dr. Frieden said that the condition of the patient in Dallas, a Liberian man named Thomas E. Duncan, was “quite critical,” having been changed on Saturday from serious.

Officials here continued to scramble to contain the spread of the disease, monitor those Mr. Duncan came into contact with and decontaminate the Dallas apartment where he had been staying with his girlfriend and three of her relatives.

On Sunday, the authorities said they had found a homeless man who was among those being monitored, according to The Associated Press. The man reportedly rode in the ambulance that took Mr. Duncan to the hospital, but later apparently went into hiding. Officials said the man had been monitored Saturday, and was asymptomatic.

Prosecutors here are considering whether to bring charges against Mr. Duncan following reports that he had contact with a woman who ended up dying of Ebola in Liberia and later lied about that contact before boarding a plane to the United States.

“We are actively having discussions as to whether or not we need to look into this as it relates to a criminal matter,” Dallas County’s district attorney, Craig Watkins, said on "Lone Star Politics" on NBC 5 on Sunday. “We’re working with all the different agencies to get to the bottom of it.” He did not elaborate on what those charges would be.

At the apartment where Mr. Duncan and the others had been staying, about 20 containers were filled with linens and other items. The containers were being stored “in an extremely safe and secure location, and guarded by Dallas County Sheriff’s deputies,” Sana Syed, a city spokeswoman, said.

The four others who had been living in the apartment – his girlfriend, one of her children and two young men – were moved to a temporary home Friday and remain under orders not to leave the premises. None of the four have reported any symptoms of Ebola, officials said.

Reached by telephone, Mr. Duncan’s girlfriend, Louise Troh, 54, declined to comment Saturday. Asked for details about her relationship with Mr. Duncan, she replied, “That’s my personal business. I have my privacy still. That’s not going to heal him.”

Last week, Liberian officials said that Mr. Duncan lied about his history of contact with Ebola on an airport questionnaire meant to screen out passengers who might be carrying the virus and is subject to prosecution when he returns to the country.

The chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority said that when Mr. Duncan flew out of Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Sept. 19, he answered “no” to a question about whether he had contact with any person infected with Ebola in the last 21 days, the maximum period of incubation for Ebola. In addition, Texas Health Presbyterian said Mr. Duncan was asked by nurses if he had been around anyone who had been ill when he first went to the emergency room there on Sept. 25, and Mr. Duncan told them he had not.

Both of those answers appeared to be contradicted by Mr. Duncan’s activities in the days before he left Liberia for the United States. In Monrovia, neighbors and the parents of Marthalene Williams, 19, a woman who died of Ebola, said Mr. Duncan had helped the family take her to and from a hospital on Sept. 15 shortly before she died. Some of the men and women who had direct contact with Ms. Williams, and who were also in contact with Mr. Duncan, have died in recent days, including Ms. Williams’ brother, Sonny Boy Williams, 21.

Mr. Duncan landed in Dallas on Sept. 20, and went to the emergency room feeling ill on Sept. 25. He returned to the hospital three days later on Sept. 28 after his condition worsened.

It was unclear how the threat of charges being filed against Mr. Duncan will be viewed by African immigrants in the Dallas area. Liberians have already been on edge about coming into contact with anyone who may have come into contact with Mr. Duncan. Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said some Liberian immigrants had told him they were concerned about being tested for Ebola because they feared being placed in isolation and having to skip work for the three-week incubation period.

“They’re afraid to lose their jobs,” he said. “People have to put food on the table.”

Mr. Watkins’ spokeswoman, Debbie Denmon, said that the district attorney’s office was proceeding cautiously.

“On a humanitarian note, it would be cruel and inhumane to go after a person on their death bed, but at the same time the Dallas County D.A.’s office would want to show that there are consequences to entering the country by falsifying documents and then knowingly putting the public at risk,” Ms. Denmon said in a statement.

Manny Fernandez reported from Dallas, and Brian Knowlton from Washington. Nori Onishi contributed reporting from Monrovia, Liberia, and Kevin Sack from Dallas.

Correction: October 5, 2014, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A previous version of this article misstated the name of a man in Liberia who recently died from Ebola. He is Sonny Boy Williams, not Sonny Boy Williamson.

With U.S. on alert, possible cases grow

In Washington, a patient who had traveled to Nigeria and who was suspected of having Ebola has been placed in isolation at Howard University Hospital. In New Haven, two Yale University graduate students planned to sequester themselves when they returned this weekend from Liberia, where they had helped the government develop a system to track the Ebola epidemic.

And at Newark Liberty International Airport on Saturday, a sick man who had just arrived from Brussels was rushed to a hospital amid concerns that he was showing Ebola-like symptoms — a fear dismissed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With fears about Ebola widening across the United States, federal health officials said on Saturday that they were receiving an escalating number of reports of possible Ebola infection, particularly after a Liberian man tested positive for the deadly disease in Dallas last week, the first Ebola case diagnosed in this country. Since the disease began spreading rapidly across West Africa this summer, the C.D.C. said, it has assessed more than 100 possible cases, but only the Dallas case has been confirmed.

But increased attention about the virus has jangled nerves around the United States, particularly among West African immigrant communities and recent travelers to that region, and placed health care workers on a kind of high alert.

On Sunday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Thomas R. Frieden, said the Ebola patient in Dallas, Thomas E. Duncan, was ‘‘fighting for his life.’’ Dr. Frieden said that Mr. Duncan remained the only confirmed victim of the disease in the United States and that public health officials were confident about their ability to contain the disease.

He also said Mr. Duncan’s condition was ‘‘quite critical’’ after being listed in serious condition on Saturday. He said medical specialists were working to support Mr. Duncan’s fluid and electrolyte levels, both crucial to recovery in a disease that causes bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea.

In the more than 100 inquiries the C.D.C. has received about possible Ebola, about 15 people were actually tested for the virus, officials at the disease centers said. In addition to doing their own testing on suspected cases, federal officials have helped more than a dozen laboratories around the United States do Ebola testing.

One of those cases was at Howard University Hospital, which said on Saturday that it had ‘‘ruled out’’ Ebola in a patient who was admitted on Thursday. The patient, who had traveled to Nigeria, had been placed in isolation ‘‘in an abundance of caution,’’ said a statement by the university’s president, Wayne A. I. Frederick.

The Newark airport case only added to the nervousness. After United Airlines Flight 998 from Brussels arrived in Newark shortly after noon, officials from the C.D.C. took a 35-year-old man who had been vomiting to University Hospital in Newark ‘‘as a precaution,’’ said Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The flight had 255 passengers and 14 crew members on board, the airline said.

Hospital officials later said that the man had symptoms ‘‘consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola.’’

Administration officials in Washington said they believed that screening of passengers in the affected countries in Africa, by taking their temperature and requesting information about their activities, was the best way to prevent the virus from spreading to the United States. But they said Jeh C. Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, is evaluating whether other measures, including more aggressive screening of arriving air passengers in the United States, might become necessary.

Meanwhile, health officials had narrowed the pool of people who were at a risk of exposure in Dallas because they had contact with Mr. Duncan to nine.

Officials at first reached out to 114 people in the Dallas area who potentially had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan after he arrived on Sept. 20. They have reduced that number to about 50 — the nine at high risk because they had definite contact with Mr. Duncan and about 40 others considered at lower risk.

Offering Help and Hope as Ebola Epidemic Unfolds

After the offering was taken and the service was coming to an end, the Rev. Roselyn Holder-Dimerson of the Temple of Faith Church on Staten Island asked her congregation to do together what they were no doubt already doing on their own.

“Let us pray now,” she said, “for Liberia and for all the other African countries affected by this Ebola disease.”

All across Little Liberia, a community of African expatriates in the Clifton section of Staten Island, praying people turned their minds on Sunday to their homeland, which has been struggling for months with an increasingly perilous Ebola epidemic. In large churches and in tiny storefront houses of worship, local Liberians this weekend sent their best wishes — and in many cases their money — home to their families, hoping that their prayers and donations could make up for a lack of cotton balls, rubber gloves and other medical supplies.

There are more than 50 Liberian families that worship at the Temple of Faith and each of them, said Walters Weah, the church’s administrator, knows someone overseas who has died from Ebola. Stories have reached Staten Island about stricken relatives lying for days — or sometimes weeks — at home without any attention from physicians or the government.

“We hear about sick people who call for help, and no one comes to pick them up until they’re dead,” Mr. Weah said. His church has launched an effort to buy an ambulance and ship it, at its own expense, to Liberia. But while the money has been forthcoming, there have been problems getting the aid to where it needs to be.

“Many of us have given up hope,” Mr. Weah reluctantly admitted. “The government has done very little to address the situation. Everyone here is worried, everyone is praying. The truth is that we don’t know what to do.”

One thing the community has managed to do is set up a handful of drop-off sites in the neighborhood for donation. It had also planned a concert and fund-raising event for Sunday night at the Christ Assembly Lutheran Church on Hudson Street. The organizers, the Liberian Community Association and the Staten Island Ministerial Alliance, hoped to raise as much as $50,000 for Ebola relief, Mr. Weah said.

There are five major Liberian churches on Staten Island, which is home to a substantial Liberian expatriate community. Some, like Temple of Faith, maintain informal, more familial relations with their homeland. Others, like the First Central Baptist Church on Wright Street, have sent official missions to Liberia in recent years, to build schools and affiliated churches.

“Through our sister church, we have already sent bleach, alcohol, medical swabs and almost $2,000 overseas,” the Rev. Demetrius S. Carolina Sr., the pastor at First Central Baptist, said. “It’s obviously a delicate social and economic situation over there and we, here on Staten Island, are united in trying to come together and lend support in as humanely way as we possibly can.”

On Thursday night, officials from the city’s health department met with leaders of the African community in the Bronx, and they plan to hold similar events in the other boroughs.

Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city’s health commissioner, said their immediate focus was to make sure that anyone who has recently traveled from West Africa and has fallen ill goes to the hospital. All will be treated, regardless of their immigration status or their ability to pay.

“These are the people who most directly affected,” Dr. Bassett said. “We want them to have the information they need.”

For the city’s West African communities, it has not been easy watching the epidemic from afar. Recently, one member of First Central Baptist got word that his wife, his daughter and his cousin had all died of Ebola in Liberia. Other church members have suffered similar losses in the last few months.

“Is what is going on in Liberia affecting us here on Staten Island?” Rev. Carolina asked. “The answer is, yes. Absolutely, yes.”

New York City Steps Up Preparations to Be Ready for Ebola Cases

One week after the first diagnosis of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] in a patient in the United States, every person who calls 911 in New York City and relates symptoms such as fever or vomiting is now being asked a new question:

Have you been to West Africa in the last three weeks? If so, did you come into contact with someone sick with the virus?

If the caller has traveled to one of the countries where the disease continues to spread, a series of protocols is supposed to kick in, starting with the emergency medical workers’ donning protective gear to limit their risk of infection.

Taking of a travel history by 911 dispatchers is one of a series of measures the city has been using in recent months to prepare for the arrival of the virus[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html], efforts that have been stepped up since last week, when a man traveling from Liberia was told he had the disease in Dallas.

New York officials are also reaching out to the city’s West Africans, encouraging anyone who may be sick and who has been exposed to Ebola in recent weeks to be checked out at a hospital.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Sunday that fear of the virus was not a bad thing.

“For health care workers, we want them to be scared,” Dr. Frieden said. That fear, he said, ensures a healthy respect for the virus that can be channeled into being “incredibly meticulous” about infection control.

New York City officials said they did not want to repeat mistakes made in Dallas, where the patient was at first sent home from a hospital even though he told health care workers that he had recently been in Liberia.

“Identifying potential Ebola cases is not easy or straightforward,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and a special adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio.

He said that while the city had done extraordinary work in preparing, it was possible the virus would still find its way here.

“But it won’t be because this city isn’t doing everything possible to keep any situation under control,” he said.

One vital message that needs to be communicated, he said, is letting New York’s West Africans know they can seek medical care regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay.

Since the city’s emergency rooms are one of the first lines of defense against the spread of the disease, hospitals have stepped up their own preparations.

In addition to increased training and education and emergency drills, test patients simulating someone who might have Ebola are being dispatched to assess the reaction of the staffs.

Dr. Ross Wilson, the chief medical officer at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, said that after each test, there is a full debriefing to evaluate performance.

“We are very reassured that most of our training is working very well,” Dr. Wilson said. One area that needed more work, he said, was ensuring that health care workers who do not frequently put on and remove protective gear know how to do it in the best and safest way.

As hospitals are preparing for the possibility of Ebola cases, the federal government is weighing whether to increase its screening efforts at international airports.

The Obama administration is considering sending more screeners to United States airports to check passengers arriving from West Africa for Ebola, a senior administration official said on Sunday.

Even as American officials publicly express confidence about their ability to contain the disease, they are privately weighing a set of more aggressive steps to prevent Ebola’s spread in the United States.

The news comes on the eve of a meeting President Obama is scheduled to hold at the White House with his national security team and other senior officials to receive an update about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the United States’ response.

As recently as Friday, senior officials publicly ruled out expanding the screening of passengers arriving from West Africa or imposing a travel ban, which they said would be ineffective or even harm international efforts to combat the spread of the virus by limiting the mobility of medical workers and others who could assist in the response.

Since August, as the disease spread in West Africa, the city’s hospitals and health care workers have been on high alert.

Over the last six weeks, on average, every day one person has gone to a city emergency room and been placed in isolation because of concern the patient might have Ebola. Last week alone, four people were placed in isolation in city hospitals.

Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city’s health commissioner, said that the health department had consulted with doctors in more than 80 cases and, of those, 11 raised serious concerns.

No one has been found to have the disease and, in all but one of the suspected cases, doctors were able to rule out Ebola without blood tests.

Since September, the city has been able to perform its own tests for Ebola. By not having to send samples to Atlanta, the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the city can get results within four to six hours, Dr. Bassett said.

“We have been dealing with this for a couple of months,” she said. “We are confident that we are ready.”

Emergency medical workers face some of the greatest challenges. Frank Dwyer, a spokesman for the New York Fire Department, said that the department decided last week to have its 911 dispatchers ask about travel, he said, because it helps make sure that emergency medical workers know when they are walking into a high-risk situation.

Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.

Help Nearby, but Delayed on the Docks

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- It has been sitting idly on the docks for nearly two months: a shipping container packed with protective gowns, gloves, stretchers, mattresses and other medical supplies needed to help fight Sierra Leone's exploding Ebola epidemic.

There are 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens, 100 cases of protective suits, 80 cases of face masks and other items -- in all, more than $140,000 worth of medical equipment locked inside a dented container at the port since Aug. 9.

Hundreds of people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone since then, and health workers have endured grave shortages of lifesaving supplies, putting them at even greater risk in a country reeling from the virus.

''We are still just hoping (!!!) -- which sounds like BEGGING -- that this container should be cleared,'' one government official wrote in a frantic email to his superiors, weeks after the container arrived.

In many ways, the delay reflects what some in the growing ranks of international officials pouring into this nation to fight Ebola describe as a chaotic, disorganized government response to the epidemic.

''It's a mess,'' said one foreign official working alongside the Sierra Leone government agency set up to deal with the crisis. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain vital relations with the government, said that nobody appeared to be in charge at the agency, known as the ''emergency operations center,'' and that different factions made decisions independently.

''It's the only body responsible,'' the official said. ''What is it doing?''

In the case of the shipping container, the desperately needed supplies seem to have been caught, at least in part, in a trap that is common the world over: politics, money and power.

The supplies were donated by individuals and institutions in the United States, according to Chernoh Alpha Bah, who organized the shipment. But Mr. Bah wears another hat, as well. He is an opposition politician from President Ernest Bai Koroma's hometown, Makeni -- a place that clearly showed the government's inability to contain Ebola.

A recent surge of cases there quickly overwhelmed health workers, with protective gear so lacking that some nurses have worked around the deadly virus in their street clothes.

More than 80 health care workers in Sierra Leone have died in the outbreak, and even in the capital, Freetown, some burial crews wear protective gowns with gaping holes in them, a clear indication of the urgent need for more supplies.

The government official who pleaded for the shipment to come in said that the political tensions may have contributed to the delay, to prevent the opposition from trumpeting the donations.

Mr. Bah said he thought the equipment would be welcomed by the struggling authorities, and he said he expected the shipping fee of $6,500 would be a small detail for Sierra Leone. According to the official, the government has already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola.

The shipping company, as a good-will gesture in a moment of crisis, had agreed to send the goods without being paid first, Mr. Bah said. But no more. Three other containers of similar value await shipment from the United States, he said, halted by the government's long refusal to pay.

''We will appreciate if the payment is made quickly so that the medical supplies will be sent directly to the affected or targeted areas,'' Mr. Bah wrote to the government on Aug. 16.

Instead, top government officials argued over the fee, said that the proper procedures had not been followed, and finally brushed aside the official urging that the supplies be let in, saying they wanted to hear nothing more about it.

''They are blaming us for shipping in without authorization,'' Mr. Bah said. ''It appears all they are interested in is cash donations. And all we have are supplies.''

At one point, a senior official close to the president, Sylvia Olayinka Blyden, acknowledged in an email that the items listed in Mr. Bah's container were ''very impressive.'' But she said ''future shipments'' should follow procedure. That was on Sept. 1, and she has since left her post. The goods are still inside the container on the dock here.

''He should have contacted the ministry and discussed it with the ministry,'' Yayah A. Conteh, an official at the health ministry, said of Mr. Bah, adding that the medical supplies would be cleared ''very soon.''

In times of crisis, when needs are great and officials are overburdened, trickles of uncoordinated donations can be a distraction, some aid workers say, requiring a lot of attention without solving the biggest problems.

But some Sierra Leoneans say that the government's resistance has discouraged other potential donors in the diaspora.

Ibrahim Kamara, a Sierra Leonean in Canada who has put together what he says is a $55,000 container of medical supplies, said that he was now encountering the same problems with the government -- an unwillingness to pay the $5,000 shipping fee.

''There is no positive response, no feedback, no anything,'' Mr. Kamara said. ''It's been over a month now.''

The emergency operations center was established to manage the urgent but confusing patchwork of agencies and international aid groups trying to battle the virus. The health ministry itself has been rocked by corruption and mismanagement scandals in recent years, further weakening efforts in a country that, even before the Ebola epidemic, suffered from some of the world's worst health statistics after a brutal 10-year civil war.

Twenty-nine of the country's top health officials were indicted last year in connection with the misappropriation of a half-million dollars in vaccination funds. The leaders were all acquitted. A free health care program set up by foreign donors has been damaged by corruption problems, with nurses illegally selling drugs and doctors charging for services. In 2010, a former health minister was convicted on corruption charges. This year, the health minister was pushed aside during the Ebola crisis amid questions over her competence.

At a recent meeting at the emergency operations center, local politicians discussed at length how they might be able to use the government's recent three-day national lockdown -- in which volunteers went door-to-door to educate people about Ebola -- for their own political benefit.

Meanwhile, reported cases of Ebola are doubling every 30 to 40 days, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 620 deaths have been recorded, with the real number almost certainly much higher.

The government official who pleaded for the supplies to be let in argued that the epidemic, ''like the war we experienced between 1991 and 2002,'' had exposed the extent of government corruption.

The more urgent the pleas, the official said, the more it ''elicited only disdain from some people in authority.''

New York Today: Changing Campus Rules for Consent

Good morning on this cool and cloudless Monday.

Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the State University of New York to overhaul the guidelines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/nyregion/cuomo-orders-suny-to-overhaul-its-sexual-assault-rules.html?_r=0] on sexual assault on all of its 64 campuses.

When the new rules kick in, students will be required to receive active consent before all sexual activity.

That is, only a yes will mean yes.

The shift ties into a national trend — around the country, colleges and universities are reconsidering their policies toward sexual assault as victims come out with their stories and advocates push for change[http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html].

We asked Ariel Kaminer[https://twitter.com/arielkaminer], who covers higher education for The Times, how the shift toward affirmative consent[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/us/active-consent-bill-signed-in-california.html?] might play out on campus.

For one, it sets a tougher standard for consent, making potential cases of sexual assault easier to prosecute.

“You can’t say, ‘She said yes last time,’ ‘We used to be involved,’ and you can’t say, ‘She said yes to one thing,’” Ms. Kaminer said. “That’s not enough. You have to have consent for every individual sexual act.”

That, she added, could reduce the number of sexual assault complaints.

“Ideally, these policies work to lessen the incidence of sexual assault.”

If nothing else, Ms. Kaminer said, the new rule is more appealing than the old no-means-no standard.

It conceives of women as equal sexual actors instead of as people who only have the option to be silent or to say no.

“It’s sexier,” she said.

Here’s what else you need to know.

The former church is now hidden by a row of inelegant storefronts, and it is largely refurbished inside, but look closely and you may spot a few vestiges of the past.

They include original chandeliers, stained glass windows, and the outlines of an altar, nearly concealed by a mural.

First Draft
White House Now Seems Open to New Steps on Ebola in U.S.

Inside the Obama administration, the thinking about how to stop an Ebola outbreak in the United States[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/us/ebola.html] appears to be changing as quickly as the virus can spread.

Just last week, senior officials were publicly and privately rejecting suggestions that they step up domestic measures to contain the virus in response to the arrival of an Ebola-afflicted patient in the United States.

But as President Obama prepares to meet at the White House on Monday with his national security team and the nation’s top public health official, they acknowledge that they are weighing new steps, including sending more screeners to American airports to check passengers arriving from West Africa for Ebola, a senior administration official said on Sunday.

The news came as the administration faced mounting pressure to do more to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States. Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday wrote to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection agency, calling for enhanced surveillance and containment, “for the safety and security of the American people.”

Mr. Schumer called for a more comprehensive health screening, with temperature checks and an in-depth “health declaration form,” at American airports and ports that receive passengers arriving from Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, including on connecting flights.

“They’re doing a pretty good job in Africa, but it can be done best here,” Mr. Schumer said, calling his proposal a middle ground between a ban and doing nothing to change American procedures. “It’s going to give the public a degree of assurance, as well as minimize the amount of people who come into contact” with Ebola.

Mr. Schumer said the Obama administration, which was initially resistant to his ideas, had come to recognize in the past couple of days that additional measures were needed — both to quell public fears and to ensure that the virus does not spread.

Mr. Obama will have a chance to speak publicly on the issue Monday afternoon, when he is scheduled to make a brief appearance in front of the White House press pool in the Oval Office after his meeting with Dr. Frieden and other officials.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

Developing: • The Supreme Court on same-sex marriage.

In a major surprise, the justices today denied review[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/denying-review-justices-clear-way-for-gay-marriage-in-5-states.html] in all five pending same-sex marriage cases.

The move clears the way for such marriages to proceed in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

The decision suggests that the court is not going to intercede in the issue until a federal appeals court upholds a state ban.

• Almost normal in Hong Kong.

The eight-lane highway leading to the financial district is still paralyzed today, but crowds of protesters have dwindled[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/06/world/asia/ap-as-hong-kong-democracy-protest.html] to a few hundred as pro-democracy demonstrations entered their second week.

• The political homestretch.

With just four weeks until Election Day, Republicans are maintaining their momentum, according to the latest data[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/upshot/republicans-maintain-edge-in-senate-races-poll-finds.html].

They lead by at least four percentage points in enough races to finish with 50 Senate seats — only one short of the 51 seats they need to overcome Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s tiebreaking vote.

• Fighting for his life.

The first person found to have Ebola in the U.S. remains[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/06/world/africa/06reuters-health-ebola-usa.html] in critical condition in a Dallas hospital, but there are no more doses of the experimental medicine ZMapp.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is expected to announce today a new initiative to respond to pandemic disease.

• At the White House.

President Obama meets his national security team and senior staff in the afternoon to receive an update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

Also today, financial regulators will join Mr. Obama for a discussion on the economy and Wall Street reform.

• The best wake-up call.

John O’Keefe, a British-American scientist, and the Norwegians May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser today won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discoveries of cells that make up a positioning system in the brain.

• Promises not met.

Most wealthy nations failed to meet their development aid pledges in 2013, and only a third of the money went to the poorest countries, says a report today from the anti-poverty group co-founded by the Irish singer Bono[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/05/world/europe/05reuters-foundation-aid-oecd.html].

• Still missing, six months on.

The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/world/asia/search-resumes-for-missing-malaysia-jet.html] today in a desolate stretch of the Indian Ocean, more than six months after it disappeared with 239 people aboard.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are turning negative. European stocks closed mostly higher, and Asian indexes ended mixed.

• Hewlett-Packard said today it will split into two entities:[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/technology/hewlett-packard-is-said-to-be-planning-a-reorganization.html] one focused on personal computers and printers, and the other on business hardware and software, according to the individuals close to the plan.

The division, resulting in two companies with more than $50 billion each in revenue, is meant to make them more agile.

• Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet L. Yellen will update the health of the American financial system at the Financial Stability Oversight Council meeting today.

• Square , the mobile-payments start-up, raised $150 million in venture financing, valuing the company at $6 billion[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/square-raises-150-million-at-a-6-billion-valuation/], sources said.

• Attitudes toward saving are measured in the Consumer Federation of America’s personal savings index[http://americasaves.org/in-the-newsroom/press-releases] released today.

OVER THE WEEKEND

• Jean-Claude Duvalier, a former president of Haiti known as Baby Doc who brutally ruled the country, died[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/americas/jean-claude-duvalier-haitis-baby-doc-dies-at-63.html] at age 63.

• Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, failed to win a majority of the vote in her re-election bid, opening the way[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/world/americas/brazil-presidential-elections.html] for a runoff.

• Pope Francis opened[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29495835] a two-week gathering of more than 200 senior Roman Catholic bishops to debate abortion, contraception, homosexuality and divorce.

• Paul Revere, the keyboardist who founded the 1960s band Paul Revere & the Raiders[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/arts/music/paul-revere-organist-and-namesake-of-the-raiders-dies-at-76.html], died at age 76.

• “Gone Girl” led the weekend box office[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/gone-girl-leads-weekend-box-office/], generating $38 million, a huge result for an R-rated drama.

• The price of Bitcoin fell nearly 20 percent[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/price-of-bitcoin-tumbles/] this weekend to its lowest level of the year, prompting worries of a crash. After reaching its peak of about $1,150 late last year, the virtual currency has been in a prolonged slide, reaching $286 on Sunday.

• Suffolk Downs , near Boston, held its final day of thoroughbred racing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/us/suffolk-downs-is-put-out-to-pasture.html] on Saturday. Meanwhile, a filly named Treve won her second straight Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/141006/racing-superb-treve-emulates-alleged-second-arc-win], one of Europe’s most prestigious horse races.

• Catching up on TV: We have your episode recaps for “Homeland[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/homeland-recap-its-back-with-quinn-in-the-drivers-seat/],” “Boardwalk Empire[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/boardwalk-empire-recap-surprise-surprise-2/]” and “The Good Wife[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/the-good-wife-recap-do-not-mess-with-the-memory-of-will-gardner/].”

NOTEWORTHY

• One step closer to the World Series.

Kansas City’s 8-3 victory[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/sports/baseball/royals-skip-extra-innings-for-a-change-and-sweep-the-angels-away.html] over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday night sends the Royals to the American League Championship Series. They face the Baltimore Orioles, who swept[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/sports/baseball/baltimore-orioles-detroit-tigers-buck-showalter.html] the Detroit Tigers.

In the National League, the Washington Nationalstry to stave off elimination[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/sports/baseball/zero-room-to-spare-for-teetering-nationals.html] when they visit the San Francisco Giants today (5 p.m. Eastern, MLB). And the Los Angeles Dodgers face the St. Louis Cardinals (9 p.m. Eastern, FS1). That series is tied 1-1.

• Soaring TV deals.

The N.B.A. is to announce today renewed broadcasting deals worth $24 billion, nearly triple its previous contracts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/sports/basketball/nba-said-to-be-near-new-tv-deal-for-24-billion.html], with ESPN and TNT.

• No W.M.D.s.

Ten years ago today, the top American inspector in Iraq released a report[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/international/middleeast/06CND-INTE.html] saying that his team had not found any evidence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

BACK STORY

By law, the Supreme Court begins its 2014-15 term on the first Monday of October. That’s today.

The nine justices have already agreed to consider a number of high-profile cases, including possible employment discrimination against a woman in a head scarf.

From now to the end of next June, they will hear arguments, deliberate and deliver opinions at the Supreme Court building across from the U.S. Capitol.

But after the Constitution was adopted in 1789, the justices spent much of their time “riding circuit.” That meant literally traveling to a circuit of courts to decide cases.

As the population grew, cases multiplied and the justices found their hands full with appeals in Washington. It became increasingly difficult for them to make the time for the rounds.

In 1891, the federal court structure was revised, and the justices were freed from the requirement to travel.

But not from the circuits: Each justice now handles stays and other issues for one or more of the country’s 13 circuit courts of appeal.

Your Evening Briefing

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• They do.

Whether gay couples have the right to marry has been battled over in public opinion and lower courts.

But today, the Supreme Courtdeclined to weigh in[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/denying-review-justices-clear-way-for-gay-marriage-in-5-states.html], a silence that effectively brings the number of states allowing gay unions to 24 and clears the way in six more.

It’s not that the justices are ignoring the moment, says Linda Greenhouse, a former Supreme Court reporter for The Times.

“They watch the news and read the papers,” she says. “They are totally on top of this subject, probably as much as any nine people in the country.”

She says that there can be a number of reasons for the court to decline to hear arguments.

“One could be that they’re very divided and neither side could be guaranteed of the outcome,” Ms. Greenhouse says.

Or they might figure, she says, “Why should we expend our own political capital to fight it out when the public is speaking and it’s happening anyway?”

• A nod and a wave.

Over the weekend, we reported that one cultural casualty[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html?_r=0] of Liberia’s Ebola outbreak was the hug, a telling loss in a place where everyday greetings tend to include embraces and a kiss or two.

There is just one known case of Ebola in Dallas. But already, the virus has Texans wary of close contact, says our correspondent Kevin Sack.

“People in Dallas are anxious,” he says, “but not panicky in my experience.”

The ailing man in Dallas is fighting for his life[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/us/ebola-patient-in-dallas-still-in-critical-condition-cdc-chief-says.html], and those who live near the apartment where he was staying, especially other Liberians, are “clearly concerned,” Mr. Sack says.

“Where they might have exchanged hugs or handshakes upon greeting,” he says, “they now keep their distance and wave.”

“A male student at the high school attended by one of the exposed children told me that there’s a temporary halt in girls hugging boys in the hallways,” he says.

• Chasing the next big things.

The breakup Hewlett-Packard announced today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html] is aimed at expanding its market value and making the lagging giant more nimble.

The split might also bring something else — “that most sought-after thing in technology, a greater claim on the future,” says Quentin Hardy, a deputy business editor.

HP, at 75, hasn’t been considered on the forefront of tech in decades, he says. “It is scrambling to change that.”

The company’s leader, Meg Whitman, is focusing the new companies on areas that she thinks are primed for growth.

One is cloud computing. The other is personal computer and printing business, where the company already has a major foothold.

“She is even talking about putting HP into 3-D printing,” Mr. Hardy says, “currently a zero-billion dollar industry that nonetheless holds great hope for the future.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks dipped. The S.&P. 500 lost 0.2 percent.

TONIGHT

AMC’s hit series “The Walking Dead[http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead]” has its Season 5 premiere on Sunday.

But those who have never watched the zombie drama can catch up on earlier episodes with a mini-marathon that begins at 7 p.m. Eastern.

• Indonesia’s worst year.

In his startling and much-praised 2013 documentary “The Act of Killing[http://www.pbs.org/pov/theactofkilling/], ” the filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer recounts anti-Communist massacres that began in 1965 and claimed as many as 2.5 million lives. (10 p.m. Eastern, PBS)

• Caught by a hidden eye.

“The War Against Gays in Russia[http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/hunted-the-war-against-gays-in-russia/synopsis.html#/]” uses undercover film footage to expose the people behind homophobic assaults. (9 p.m. Eastern, HBO)

• Game night.

In Major League Baseball, the Washington Nationals will try to stave off elimination[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/sports/baseball/zero-room-to-spare-for-teetering-nationals.html] when they visit the San Francisco Giants (5 p.m. Eastern, MLB). And the Los Angeles Dodgers are at the St. Louis Cardinals (9 p.m. Eastern, FS1). That series is tied, 1-1.

In Monday Night Football, the Seattle Seahawks (2-1) visit the Washington Redskins (1-3) at 8:30 p.m. on ESPN.

• If you’re staying up …

On “The Daily Show”: Dr. Atul Gawande, the author of “Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End.” (11 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central)

“The Tonight Show”: Jeremy Renner, star of the coming movie “Kill the Messenger”; Carol Burnett; Mario Batali; and music from Joe Perry. (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC)

“Late Show With David Letterman”: the comedians Aziz Ansari and Tom Dreesen; and Jackson Browne performs. (11:35 p.m. Eastern, CBS)

TOMORROW

• Music, but not to listen to.

The guitarist Joe Perry writes about his own rise to fame in “Rocks: My Life In and Out of Aerosmith.”

And, OMG, the pop sensation One Direction publishes “Who We Are: Our Official Autobiography.”

DALLAS -- The murderous civil war that terrorized Liberia from 1989 to 2003 left at least 5 percent of the population dead, and sent wave after wave of refugees to neighboring countries. To escape the ethnic and political turmoil, more than 700,000 fled from a nation that had barely two million residents when the conflict began.

Among them were Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who brought the Ebola virus to the United States last week, and Louise Troh, the woman he had come to Dallas to visit. After meeting in the early 1990s in a refugee encampment near the Ivory Coast border town of Danané, the two Liberians started a relationship and bore a son, several family members said.

It is not clear what drove the couple apart -- Mr. Duncan, 42, who is fighting for his life at a Dallas hospital, has not spoken publicly, and Ms. Troh, 54, who will be quarantined for another two weeks, declined to discuss their history.

But starting in 1998, when Ms. Troh left for the United States -- first settling in Boston, and then in Dallas with another Liberian man -- they began a 16-year separation.

Not only did Mr. Duncan not see Ms. Troh, he missed the entire childhood of their son, Karsiah, who adapted well enough to his new home to become the starting quarterback for the Conrad High Chargers.

Tragedy befell Ms. Troh in February when a daughter in Liberia died during childbirth. In March, she split with Peterson Wayne, the Liberian refugee she had followed to Texas. It was after that that she and Mr. Duncan apparently revived their relationship, first at long distance, and then when Mr. Duncan landed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Sept. 20.

''They had had a falling out, and had patched things up,'' said the Rev. George Mason, Ms. Troh's pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church, ''and he had come here with the intention to marry and start a new life together. Obviously, what happened has thrown a wrinkle into that.''

And then some. What began as a joyful reunion -- refugees from African civil strife seeking to rebuild their lives in America -- spiraled last week into a national health scare once only imagined in science fiction. Once again, Mr. Duncan and Ms. Troh found themselves in the vortex of larger forces beyond their control.

The arrival of Ebola with Mr. Duncan put Dallas so on edge that parents kept children home from school and officials with the State Fair of Texas programmed Big Tex, their talking mechanical mascot, to urge fairgoers to wash their hands. It commanded the attention of President Obama and his top health advisers, exposed a series of disconcerting lapses in medical care and crisis logistics and incited a national debate over whether to restrict travel to and from afflicted countries. For Ms. Troh, who spent five days as a captive in her contaminated apartment, a week that started with home-cooked meals and happy introductions ended with the seizure of her belongings by workers in yellow hazardous-material suits.

On Sunday, the director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said that Mr. Duncan's medical condition was quite critical and that he was ''fighting for his life.''

Mr. Duncan, who goes by Eric, is the youngest of seven siblings, according to his brother, Wilfred Smallwood, who lives in Phoenix. His father was an engineer for an American mining company, Mr. Smallwood said.

After five years in the refugee camp in French-speaking Ivory Coast, the family moved to Ghana, where there was less of a language barrier, Mr. Smallwood said. A sister, who now lives in Charlotte, N.C., was the first of the clan to make it to the United States, shortly after the war began. Their mother came a decade later, followed by Mr. Smallwood, but Mr. Duncan left Ghana and returned to Liberia, where he stayed.

Before leaving for Dallas, Mr. Duncan had been living in a neighborhood called 72nd SKD Boulevard on the eastern outskirts of Monrovia, an hour's commute from his job in the central city. He had worked for about a year as a driver for Safeway Cargo, which acts as the customs clearance agent for FedEx in Liberia, said Henry Brunson, the company's manager.

Mr. Duncan rented one of three small rooms in a one-story white building with concrete walls and a roof of corrugated zinc. He enjoyed riding his Yamaha motorcycle, and interacted regularly with his neighbors but did not receive guests at home.

Mr. Smallwood said Mr. Duncan obtained a visa several weeks before leaving, and on Sept. 4 he quit his job without warning or explanation, Mr. Brunson said.

But 11 days later, only four days before his scheduled departure, Mr. Duncan made a consequential decision to help his landlords transport their pregnant 19-year-old daughter to a hospital, according to the landlords and other neighbors. The woman, Marthalene Williams, had been stricken with Ebola and was convulsing.

He rode in a taxi with the woman and her relatives. After the hospital turned her away for lack of space in its Ebola ward, he helped carry Ms. Williams, who was too weak to walk, from the taxi back into her house. A neighbor said she saw Mr. Duncan holding her legs while others supported her back and arms. The woman died several hours later.

On Sept. 19, as he prepared to board a Brussels Airlines flight to the Belgian capital, where he would catch connections to Dulles International Airport and then Dallas, Mr. Duncan was screened for Ebola by health workers at Monrovia's airport. His temperature measured as normal -- 97.3 degrees, according to the C.D.C. When asked on a form whether he had been exposed to anyone with Ebola in the past 21 days, the virus's maximum incubation period, he answered no, said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority.

Texas prosecutors said Sunday that they were considering whether to bring charges against Mr. Duncan.

''We are actively having discussions as to whether or not we need to look into this as it relates to a criminal matter,'' Craig Watkins, the district attorney for Dallas County, said Sunday. ''We're working with all the different agencies to get to the bottom of it.'' Mr. Watkins did not elaborate on what those charges might be.

It was Mr. Duncan's first trip to the United States, his brother said, and he was clearly excited to reunite with Ms. Troh and his long-lost son, who now attends Angelo State University, west of Dallas.

Mr. Duncan settled into Ms. Troh's sparsely furnished two-bedroom apartment, Unit 614, on the second floor of the Ivy, an unremarkable complex in the Vickery Meadow neighborhood. A king-size bed filled Ms. Troh's room, and two mattresses covered the blue-carpeted floor of the living room, which was dominated by a large-screen television. The apartment was shared by Ms. Troh's 13-year-old son, Timothy Wayne, and two men in their 20s -- Mr. Smallwood's son, Oliver, and a friend named Jeffrey Cole.

Jet lag sapped Mr. Duncan for several days, and he found himself restless at night and sleepy during the day, said Josephus Weeks, a relative of Mr. Duncan's in North Carolina. Ms. Troh liked to prepare an excess of food so she could lure others to eat it, according to Peterson Wayne, and she introduced family and friends to Mr. Duncan when they dropped by.

Youngor Jallah, one of Ms. Troh's daughters, said she met Mr. Duncan when she dropped off her children on Sept. 21 before rushing away to her job as a nurse's assistant. He seemed nice, she said, and offered condolences about her sister's death in childbirth last February. When she came back to pick up the children, her 6-year-old daughter, Rose, announced, ''Oh, Grandma has a new boyfriend.''

On Sept. 25, Mr. Duncan began complaining to Ms. Troh about chills, and she drove him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, not far from her apartment. He arrived in the emergency room with a mild fever of 100.1 degrees and reported having abdominal pain for two days, a sharp headache and decreased urination, according to the hospital. When a nurse took his history, the hospital has reported, he said he had not been around anyone ill but had recently been in Africa.

The nurse noted this, but doctors apparently failed to consider the possibility of Ebola for reasons that remain unclear. Mr. Duncan was sent home with antibiotics that were powerless to halt the progression of his virus.

On the morning of Sept. 28, after a nightlong bout with diarrhea, M. Duncan did not want to get out of bed. Ms. Troh, who is also a nurse's assistant, had to go to work and called Ms. Jallah to come care for him. When she arrived, he complained of being cold, and she took a quick trip to a nearby Walmart to buy a thicker blanket.

She made him tea, and then fetched a blood pressure monitor from her car. The readings were frighteningly low, and his temperature measured close to 103, she said. His eyes had turned red, and he told her he had been to the bathroom seven times during the night. ''O.K., you can have your tea, but then we are going to the hospital,'' she told him. He resisted, saying he would wait for Ms. Troh to return. She circumvented the argument by calling 911.

Ms. Jallah said she was not thinking specifically about Ebola, but she had a warning for the arriving emergency medical workers: ''You need to wear masks and be protective because this man is from a viral country.''

Ms. Jallah followed the ambulance to the hospital, and by the time she found Mr. Duncan in Room 42, nurses had already placed an isolation sign on the door. When she got back to her apartment, she instructed her four children not to touch her, sealed her clothes in a plastic bag and took a bath laced with Clorox.

She called her mother and told her to avoid the bed that Mr. Duncan had shared and to bag up his towels. When Ms. Troh protested because the blanket was new, Ms. Jallah returned to Walmart to buy bedding, towels and a thin mattress. ''That blanket is not as important as your life,'' she told her mother.

The next day, she and her mother returned to the hospital and could see Mr. Duncan through a glass panel. Ms. Troh gestured to him, asking if he could sit up, and Mr. Duncan shook his head no. She waved and encouraged him to wave back, but he could barely move his hand under the sheets, Ms. Jallah said.

On Tuesday, tests confirmed that Mr. Duncan had contracted Ebola. Ms. Jallah said that she and Ms. Troh learned the news on television that morning. They have been quarantined ever since, the children instructed to stay home from school.

Ms. Troh and the other residents of her unit were moved on Thursday to a comfortable private residence -- with a basketball court for her son -- that was provided by a local benefactor. She said during a Saturday telephone call that she remained ''stressed out'' by her concern for her family's health and by a week spent in the media glare. ''We are peaceful people,'' she said. ''We are not criminals. We are here legally. Leave us alone.''

Ms. Jallah and her family remain in their cramped apartment, which lost power for several days this week after a storm. With two weeks of isolation remaining, the twice-a-day visits from health workers have revealed no symptoms of infection.

U.S.
Increased Screening for Ebola Being Weighed, Obama Says

DALLAS — As this city waited anxiously to learn whether Ebola has spread beyond one victim, President Obama announced on Monday that the government would consider increased screening for the virus at airports both in the United States and in West Africa.

Mr. Obama made the announcement[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/06/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa] after being briefed in Washington by Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mr. Obama called the fight against Ebola “a top national security priority,” but did not specify how screening procedures would be changed. Dr. Frieden said that officials would explore a variety of options.

Mr. Obama also called for more help from other countries in fighting the outbreak in Africa.

In Dallas, where the Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, remains in critical condition despite taking a trial drug, officials acknowledged that their city is on edge as it waits to learn if those he stayed with and medical workers became infected while caring for him.

According to the C.D.C., the maximum incubation period for the virus is 21 days, but symptoms typically appear in eight to 10. Mr. Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian who apparently contracted the virus before flying to the United States, began complaining of symptoms on Sept. 24 and was hospitalized in isolation on Sept. 28. The 10-day threshold, therefore, will pass by the middle of this week.

“We are going to be having our fingers crossed and our hands folded in prayer this next week,” said Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas.

Thus far, none of the 10 people who officials say are at high risk — three who shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan and seven health care workers — have displayed any symptoms. An additional 38 people who are considered at lower risk also are being monitored by workers who check their temperature twice daily.

Some of those 38 are people who were with Mr. Duncan while he was contagious, but apparently did not have direct contact with his skin or bodily fluids, which is the C.D.C.’s standard for the high-risk label. They include the daughter of the woman Mr. Duncan was visiting, who cared for him before calling an ambulance, and one of the four people who spent five days last week in the contaminated apartment where he grew ill.

Mr. Duncan remained in critical condition on Monday at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital announced that doctors began administering doses of an experimental drug called brincidofovir on Saturday.

The drug, which is being developed by the biotechnology company Chimerix[http://www.chimerix.com/], is being tested against various viruses in clinical trials. Chimerix announced Monday that the Food and Drug Administration agreed to make the drug available to treat Ebola on an emergency basis.

It has never been tried before in people infected with Ebola, and there is not any data showing it works even in animals. But test-tube experiments in government labs suggest the drug might be effective, the company said.

Supplies of another experimental drug, ZMapp[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/us-to-increase-production-of-experimental-drug-but-may-not-meet-demand.html], are at least temporarily exhausted, according to Dr. Frieden.

Another American infected with Ebola, Ashoka Mukpo, 33, a freelance cameraman working for NBC in Liberia, arrived in the United States on Monday. He will be treated at the biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, which is designed for extremely contagious patients, NBC reported.

State and local officials in Dallas urged calm as the city waits out the Ebola incubation period.

“The concern right now is that the stress of this and the fear of this could be more damaging to this community than the virus itself,” said Dr. David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner.

Jennifer Staubach Gates, the City Council member who represents the diverse area where Mr. Duncan stayed for eight days, said the neighborhood was nervous. A problem, she said, was communicating the facts about Ebola in the 40 languages spoken there. Some residents, she said, had complained of discrimination by employers and retailers who did not want them near.

“They are the epicenter of this crisis and they’re afraid of the possible stigma,” she said.

In Austin, Gov. Rick Perry announced the formation of a task force charged with assessing the state’s ability to deal with pandemic diseases.

“Over the past several days we have learned a lot about the unique challenges of situations like this,” Mr. Perry said. “There were mistakes made. There will probably be mistakes made in the future as we go forward.” He added:  “I stand by the fact that the process is working. We don’t have an outbreak.” 

Reporting was contributed by Mark Landler in Washington, Andrew Pollack in Los Angeles, David Montgomery in Austin, and Timothy William in New York.

World; Middle East
Saudis Are Next on Biden’s Mideast Apology List After Harvard Remarks
By MARK LANDLER

WASHINGTON — Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joseph_r_jr_biden/index.html?inline=nyt-per] has one more stop on what has become a Middle East apology tour in the wake of his impolitic answer to a Harvard student’s question: Saudi Arabia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/saudiarabia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

After apologizing to officials from Turkey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/turkey/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and the United Arab Emirates over the weekend, Mr. Biden is trying to connect with Saudi leaders, a senior official said, to clarify that he did not mean to suggest that Saudi Arabia backed Al Qaeda[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda/index.html?inline=nyt-org] or other extremist groups in Syria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The vice president’s troubles began Thursday when he declared, in a question-and-answer session at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, that the biggest problem the United States faced in dealing with Syria and the rise of the Islamic State was America’s allies in the region.

Turkey, Mr. Biden said, has admitted allowing foreign fighters to cross into Syria, while Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia funneled weapons and other aid to Syrian rebels that ended up in the hands of Al Nusra, Al Qaeda and other extremist groups.

The White House expressed relief on Monday over Mr. Biden’s apologies, with the press secretary, Josh Earnest, noting that “the vice president is somebody who has enough character to admit when he’s made a mistake.” But asked repeatedly about the substance of his remarks, Mr. Earnest did not say the vice president was wrong.

In fact, neither of Mr. Biden’s claims is inaccurate. The United States has been pressing the Turkish government for months to seal off its border to prevent would-be jihadists from using Turkey as a transit route to join the ranks of the Islamic State. And experts say aid from the Persian Gulf monarchies has wound up with extremist groups in Syria.

President Obama made a similar point in August about Syria’s Arab neighbors fueling extremist organizations in their zeal to oust President Bashar al-Assad, though he did not name the culprits.

“There are factual mistakes, and then there are political mistakes,” said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This is a political mistake.”

The timing of Mr. Biden’s remarks was particularly awkward, given the fragility of the Sunni Arab coalition that Mr. Obama is trying to build to confront the Islamic State.

The Obama administration is engaged in tortuous negotiations with Turkey about the scale and nature of its participation in the military campaign against the Islamic State. And while Mr. Obama lined up Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar to take part in airstrikes against the militants in Syria, preserving the coalition over a prolonged campaign that could require Arab ground troops will be challenging.

“The fact that he called the leaders of these, or at least senior officials, in both of these countries to apologize is an indication that he himself wishes he had said it a little bit differently,” Mr. Earnest said.

Mr. Biden’s gaffe overshadowed what was meant as a major foreign policy address, in which the vice president sought to put the multiple upheavals in the world — the Islamic State, the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak and the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine — into a broader context.

The vice president just hired a new national security adviser, Colin H. Kahl, a former Pentagon official and a Georgetown scholar who specializes in Iran. Mr. Kahl, who worked as a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Obama campaign, had a major hand in the speech.

Several officials said Mr. Biden’s contrite phone calls to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/recep_tayyip_erdogan/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Turkey and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, had cleared the air. Mr. Biden takes particular pride in his relationship with the prickly Mr. Erdogan.

In December 2011, he was granted a two-hour session with Mr. Erdogan, then the prime minister, when he was recuperating at his private residence from a medical procedure. Mr. Biden and his aides put on slippers and were introduced by Mr. Erdogan to his son, daughter and son-in-law.

In a recent conversation, Mr. Biden said, the Turkish leader confided, “You were right — we let too many people through” and was now trying to seal its border. Mr. Erdogan denied saying that and told reporters, “If Mr. Biden has said such a thing at Harvard, he needs to apologize.”

“Foreign fighters never crossed into Syria from our country,” he said. “They would cross into Syria from Turkey on tourist passports, but nobody can claim that they have crossed with arms.”

When Mr. Biden speaks with Saudi officials, he may also have to deal with a comment he made later in the session, comparing the decision of the United States to work with Saudi Arabia to the American decision to ally with Stalin in fighting Hitler[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/adolf_hitler/index.html?inline=nyt-per] during World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

“I’m being a little facetious,” he said. “All generalizations are false, including this one I’m about to make.”

Mr. Biden’s comments came at the end of a trouble-prone period during which he has apologized to Jewish groups for using the word “shylock” and raised eyebrows for praising a former Senate colleague — Robert Packwood, an Oregon Republican who resigned in 1995 after multiple accusations of sexual harassment — at a Democratic women’s conference.

Asked about the spate of missteps, Mr. Earnest said, “The fact of the matter is that the vice president is somebody who continues to be a core member of the president’s national security team.”

Stopping Ebola in America

The widening Ebola epidemic in West Africa — combined with the fears generated by an Ebola patient who carried the virus to Dallas — have led to calls for the United States to screen travelers when they reach American airports. That is a reasonable defensive tactic if done judiciously, although it is unclear if that would have stopped the Liberian man, who carried the virus to Dallas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/after-ebola-case-in-dallas-health-officials-seek-those-who-had-contact-with-patient.html] before developing symptoms.

The American health care system needs to react with greater vigilance when cases do reach this country. It is incredible that doctors in a Dallas hospital reportedly made no effort to ascertain the patient’s travel patterns, and there were delays[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/us/retracing-the-steps-of-the-dallas-ebola-patient.html] in cleaning the Dallas apartment where he had been staying, disposing of the medical waste and moving other residents of the apartment to a safer location.

Top American health officials are strongly opposed, with good reason, to take the more extreme step of banning all travel to the United States from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the epidemic is concentrated, as several prominent Republicans, like Louisiana’s governor, Bobby Jindal, have recommended. That could actually hamper the battle to contain the epidemic abroad — the first line of defense against the disease — in part by leaving Americans who are risking their lives to contain the epidemic stranded in Africa with no way to return home. If volunteer workers can’t return home, they may elect not to go in the first place, thus weakening the fight against the epidemic.

Currently, air travelers are screened in West Africa before they are allowed to board planes leaving their countries. Their temperatures are checked, and they must fill out a detailed questionnaire asking if they have various symptoms, such as fever, headache or vomiting, and if they have had any contact with Ebola patients or other possible exposures. The questionnaire is comprehensive, well designed and useful — assuming travelers answer honestly.

Thomas Eric Duncan, who took the virus to Dallas, did not answer honestly. He had no temperature when he left Liberia or when he first arrived in Dallas. But he lied on a questionnaire. When asked if he had been exposed to anyone with Ebola, he answered no, even though he had carried an Ebola victim shortly before she died. He is now in critical condition[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/us/ebola-victim-went-from-liberian-war-to-a-fight-for-life.html] in a Dallas hospital. So far, none of the people he had close contact with have developed symptoms.

There is room to improve the screening in West Africa, where government officials and workers are often incompetent and in some cases unable to use the temperature devices they have been given. Still the system seems to be working. Though the epidemic has been growing since it was first identified in March, only one case, Mr. Duncan’s, has reached the United States, while scores of people have been blocked from boarding planes.

Even so, it makes sense to add another layer of protection at airports in this country. Travelers from West Africa could be asked to fill out an additional questionnaire, on which they might be less tempted to lie since they will already have reached American soil. Verbal questioning could further probe whether a passenger is likely to be infected. Until the epidemic in West Africa is controlled, it remains possible, even likely, that another Ebola case would reach this country. The American health care system should be prepared to move quickly, treat the victim and trace and isolate all people the patient had contact with. Bungled responses like the one in Dallas are simply unacceptable.

Ebola Infects Spanish Nurse, A First in West

BARCELONA, Spain — A nurse in Spain[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/spain/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] has become the first health worker to be infected with the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus outside of West Africa, raising serious concerns about how prepared Western nations are to safely treat people with the deadly illness.

The nurse contracted the illness while treating a Spanish missionary who was infected in Sierra Leone and flown to Madrid’s Carlos III hospital, where he died on Sept. 25, Spain’s health ministry said. The priest, Manuel García Viejo, died three days after being flown back to Spain, and the nurse entered his room only twice, including once after his death, according to Antonio Alemany, a health official from the regional government of Madrid.

The case is particularly worrisome to health experts because Spain is a developed country that is considered to possess the kind of rigorous infection control measures that should prevent disease transmission in the hospital. Although the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic has killed hundreds of doctors and nurses in West Africa, health officials in Europe and the United States have reassured the public repeatedly that if the disease reached their shores, their health care systems would be able to treat patients safely, without endangering health workers or the public.

While the risk to hospital workers is thought to be far lower in developed countries, the infection of the Spanish nurse, along with the missteps in dealing with Ebola in Dallas, exposes weak spots in highly praised defense systems.

Ana Mato, Spain’s health minister, told a televised news conference that the nurse, who has not been identified publicly, tested positive for Ebola twice, and that the rest of the 30-person team that looked after the missionary would be monitored to see if any of its members develop symptoms of Ebola. She said it was not clear how the nurse became infected.

“It is certainly a sobering moment whenever we see a health care worker infected,” said Abbigail Tumpey, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/] in the United States. “It really highlights the need for rigorous infection control throughout everything health care workers are doing, starting with the triage of patients, getting patients into appropriate isolation and then appropriately treating and managing the patient. Any lapse could potentially expose somebody.”

The case in Dallas, Ms. Tumpey added, has led the C.D.C. to redouble its efforts to urge hospitals to be on the lookout for potential cases and to handle them correctly.

Ms. Mato, the Spanish health minister, said, “We are trying to determine whether all the health safety protocols have been followed.”

Situated close to the highway that circles the Spanish capital, the Carlos III hospital is tied to the much larger La Paz hospital in Madrid, but it was selected because it has long specialized in researching H.I.V.[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and other infectious as well as tropical diseases. In August, an entire floor of the hospital was sealed off and turned into an isolation unit, initially to treat Miguel Pajares, another Spanish priest who had been working in Africa and was the first European to be repatriated after being infected with Ebola. Father Pajares died on Aug. 12, five days after entering the special unit.

In August, when the Spanish government decided to repatriate Father Pajares, the decision raised some concerns among local medical experts about whether Spain had adequate infrastructure to handle such a case. Daniel Bernabéu, the president of Amyts, a Spanish union representing doctors, said at the time that the government decision was “political and not sanitary.” He claimed that neither the government nor anybody else could “guarantee 100 percent that the virus wouldn’t escape.”

On Monday, Mr. Bernabéu told Efe, the Spanish national news agency, that even if Spain had the means to prevent Ebola spreading from the infected nurse as it has done in Africa, her case “should be used by all of us to think about whether we should host everybody and how to do it well.”

Ms. Mato urged people to remain calm, adding that “all the possible measures” were being taken to guarantee public health safety.

Antonio Alemany, a health official from the regional government of Madrid, told the news conference that the nurse went on vacation a day after Father García Viejo died. She got in touch with a medical center on Sept. 30 after feeling feverish, but had been leading “a normal life” while on vacation, he added, without giving details on her whereabouts during that period.

Mr. Alemany said the nurse initially showed only “low symptoms” of illness, with a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of roughly 100 degrees. He described her current condition as stable. He would not estimate how many people had contact with the nurse in the past two weeks, saying that a complete list was being drawn up. On the list is the nurse’s husband, Mr. Alemany said; she has no children. Spanish newspaper websites listed her age as either 40 or 44.

She has been kept in isolation in a hospital in Alcorcón, on the outskirts of Madrid, but not in a unit specialized to treat infections like Ebola. She was transferred to the Carlos III hospital late Monday.

Saudi Arabia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/saudiarabia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s acting health minister said Monday that this year’s hajj had been free of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and other contagious diseases because of measures taken by the kingdom to protect more than two million pilgrims who took part in the annual Islamic pilgrimage. The hajj[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/islam/hajj/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which lasts around five days, ended Monday. There were concerns regarding Saudi Arabia’s readiness to ensure a healthy hajj for pilgrims after the kingdom became the epicenter for the potentially fatal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS.

Several health workers and doctors died of that coronavirus in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, raising alarm about the safety of hospitals. The acting health minister, Adel Faqih, said the kingdom deployed thousands of health workers during the hajj and performed data screening on pilgrims upon arrival to the kingdom as a precaution. He said the kingdom’s ban on issuing visas to people from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, which have been hit hard by an Ebola outbreak, would remain in place for the foreseeable future.

Question:

Can I get Ebola from public transportation? As in, if a passenger coughed into their hand and then held onto the pole, and then another passenger held onto that pole and inadvertently wiped their eye?

Answer:

The answer is no. Someone with Ebola is really, really sick. They're seeking hospital care. It is unlikely they are riding the bus. They are not going to work. The virus is spread by bodily fluid contact: by blood, by vomit. When it's being spread by sweat or urine, you're practically at the dead body stage. So it's not transmitted the way that colds could be, by touching a pole in a subway or bus.

Question:

How long does the Ebola virus live on contaminated surfaces, such as bed sheets, door knobs, etc.?

Answer:

It's different in every set of circumstances. The Ebola virus eventually dries out in the air and dies. It's not like anthrax, which forms a hard capsule around itself and can survive for months or a year. Ebola is a virus that is meant to live inside blood or fluid in your cells. It's not meant to live in the open air, so it dies. A sheet that has wet blood in it is more dangerous than one with dried blood, because by then it would have dried out. There's not one answer, but it is considered to be fairly safe after about 24 hours, certainly in environments that are cleaned regularly like hospitals.

Question:

Can a blood test show if a person has the Ebola virus before they are symptomatic?

Answer:

With blood tests that we have now, no. In fact, in order to be fairly certain, you have to have the first symptom, which is a fever, for about three days before there's enough virus coursing around in your blood for the blood test to be accurate.

Question:

Many viruses (such as herpes) can be transmitted before a person shows symptoms. Why is that not the case for Ebola?

Answer:

The basic answer is that all viruses are different. In the case of Ebola, you have to get a basic all-over body infection with infected blood and vomit coming out of you before you can pass the disease on to anybody else.

There Before Ebola Had a Name

Dr. Peter Piot was just 27, a budding virologist with a thirst for adventure, when he was dispatched to the heart of Africa to track down a terrifying virus that he had helped discover.

It was 1976, and the virus had arrived at his laboratory in Antwerp, Belgium, in a blue plastic cooler holding two glass tubes of blood. They had been sent from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) by a doctor caring for a Flemish nun who was dying of fever and loss of blood.

One tube was intact. The other was broken; its contents mingled with melted ice to form a red soup. A bloodstained note said the nun was among 200 people, including doctors and nurses, dying in an outbreak that had raged for three weeks in remote Yambuku, not far from the Ebola River.

The prime suspect was yellow fever, a mosquito-borne infection that Dr. Piot's laboratory at the Institute of Tropical Medicine was equipped to detect. But unknown to anyone then, the nun's blood harbored the virus that was soon to be named Ebola.

In those days, microbiologists were cavalier about protection. As Dr. Piot and his colleagues emptied the thermos, they wore only thin latex gloves -- none of the high-security masks and moonsuits that are now standard.

They removed small amounts of blood from the intact tube to carry out routine tests for known microbes and special tests for yellow fever, along with hemorrhagic-fever viruses like Lassa, Marburg and dengue. They also injected the nun's blood into cells grown in the laboratory and the brains of mice.

The tests excluded all known infectious agents, but Dr. Piot assumed that whichever one had caused the nun's illness must have been destroyed during the airplane trip from Zaire. Still, he and his colleagues checked the mice each day.

After a week, all the mice were dead, strongly hinting that the infectious agent had not been destroyed after all. An autopsy showed that the nun's liver had microscopic lesions that Dr. Piot's boss, Dr. Stefaan Pattyn, knew to occur in Lassa fever. But because Lassa had already been ruled out, Dr. Pattyn steered the research toward identifying a new one.

At the time, only three laboratories outside the Soviet Union were equipped to handle deadly viruses safely: Porton Down, near London; Fort Detrick, a military base in Maryland; and what is now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. The World Health Organization instructed the Belgians to immediately send the samples in tightly sealed containers to Porton Down, which, in turn, forwarded them to the C.D.C. because it was the world's reference laboratory for hemorrhagic viruses.

The Antwerp scientists kept part of the material and looked at it through an electron microscope. It showed that the nun's virus was a new one -- wormlike, and huge as viruses go -- that resembled Marburg. C.D.C. scientists then confirmed the Antwerp team's discovery and named the virus Ebola.

Dr. Piot's wife was three months pregnant with their first child. Yet scientific curiosity fueled his desire to go to Zaire to undertake the epidemiologic investigations to determine how this new virus spread.

The Belgian government said it lacked funds for such travel -- until politics and scientific competition intervened. As American, French and South African scientists who knew about the findings headed to Zaire, the Belgian government realized it would be shutting out its own scientists, and it rushed Dr. Piot to its former colony to study the virus.

Two Belgian nuns with Ebola had been evacuated from Yambuku to Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, and the specter loomed of an imminent, uncontrolled epidemic of Ebola among the millions living there and beyond. In the few hours he had before his plane left, Dr. Piot raced to amass as much protective gear as he could take along.

In Zaire, he joined an international team of scientists who flew to Yambuku and mapped Ebola's spread, determining that the principal route was through unsterilized needles and syringes, contact with infected patients and touching bodies at funerals. They also collected blood from patients for later testing and prepared for the arrival of a larger and better-equipped team to control the outbreak.

In four months of field operations, other scientists also discovered a second outbreak of Ebola, in Sudan. Why the virus struck simultaneously in two distant areas with virtually no contact between them was a mystery -- just as are the current independent outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and Congo.

Dr. Piot, who has told much of this story in previous interviews with me and in his 2012 memoir, ''No Time to Lose: A Life in Pursuit of Deadly Viruses,'' expanded on it in a recent interview in light of the current epidemic in West Africa, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.

He said he expected discovery of more viruses like Ebola. And despite today's much safer laboratory procedures, he added, such virulent pathogens could prove just as dangerous.

''We were lucky not to get infected, not only in the laboratory but later on when I was drawing blood from patients and touching them,'' Dr. Piot said from England, where he is now the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

He was lucky in another way. In 1976, ordered to fly in a waiting helicopter to meet with visiting Belgian officials in Kinshasa, he smelled alcohol on the pilots' breaths and refused to go.

Soon after it took off, the helicopter crashed. A few days later, Dr. Piot led a team to retrieve the decomposing bodies from the jungle.

Despite the near-misses, ''what dominated was the absolute excitement of discovery,'' he said, adding: ''I didn't realize that we were making history in those days,'' and ''I never imagined that Ebola would become a real public-health problem because until now, the outbreaks, as dramatic as they may have been, have been fairly limited.''

Dr. Piot played a key role in another epidemic. He went to Zaire to investigate cases soon after AIDS was first recognized in the United States in 1981. Later, he directed the United Nations AIDS program for 10 years.

This July, the normally cautious Dr. Piot sounded one of the first alarms that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was out of control. He publicly called it ''a mega-crisis'' that required militarylike logistics and control measures like isolation and quarantine of infected individuals and their contacts.

He worried that his message about the world's tardy response to control Ebola might be hyperbolic, he said, but that he ''would rather be accused of overreacting than responding too late or not doing enough.'' Now he believes he was ''on target.''

But when asked about health organizations' widely varying projections of the extent of the current Ebola epidemic -- one worst-case estimate said it could reach 1.4 million -- he said he ''would definitely take them with a big grain of salt'' because they are ''not based on accurate current data, so there are too many unknowns.''

Dr. Piot returned to Yambuku to celebrate his 65th birthday in February, a month before Ebola was first identified in Guinea. Since then, he has not gone to the affected areas in West Africa because of his duties at the tropical medicine school. But there, driven by moral and practical issues, Dr. Piot has set up one of the rare programs to ensure that faculty and staff members who go to West Africa to work on Ebola will continue to be paid, and 163 have expressed interest in volunteering, he said.

''The mortality to medical staff and nurses has been enormous and devastating,'' he told me. ''Our colleagues are the most affected of all professions, paying a high price for their work, and also infecting others.''
