TRAPPED IN A RED TAPE NIGHTMARE

I don’t mind filling out government forms when I think someone is reading them. But I can’t see the point in filling out a form that is never collected or, worse, just thrown away.

When I flew back to Australia on an international flight earlier this month I was issued with a form about ebola. Every passenger was instructed to fill it out with their name, address, contact details and even the seat they were sitting in. I guess if the guy sitting next to me gets ebola they want to be able to track me down and put me in quarantine. We were told the Australian Government required us to fill in these forms and warned of the consequences if we gave false ­information. Fair enough.

As I came through quarantine I tried to give my completed form to the very polite official who was collecting the forms. He wasn’t interested. The form is of no use to me, so I asked him what I should do with it. He pointed to a rubbish bin that had been helpfully ­located by the exit. The bin was overflowing with all the other ebola forms that passengers had thrown away.

The reason I am getting cross about this is it is the sixth time I have flown into Australia this year so it is the sixth time I have been through this rigmarole. I have flown in from Europe, America, China, and Singapore. I have flown in on different airlines. Each time we have been instructed to fill out an ebola form which no one bothers to collect.

Now this is in addition to the standard form everyone entering Australia has to fill out that asks whether you are bringing into the country drugs, firearms, weapons, illegal pornography and a whole host of other things besides. Of course no other country asks arriving passengers to fill out a form so long and comprehensive. But this is Australia. We are world-beaters at regulatory overkill. At least that form is collected. The ebola form isn’t. It’s just a useless exercise in getting people to provide ­un necessary information.

The immediate threat of ebola has passed and we haven’t had any fatalities in Australia. So why does the government still ask people to fill out forms that no one is reading?

Lurking in that question is an insight into how modern government works and why it is gradually strangling us.

After the ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 the ­Australian government wanted to show it was serious about protecting public health and safety. Of course it could ­always track arrivals through passenger lists, but it wanted to go further. It ordered the issue and collection of new forms, but since the outbreak has ended no one has bothered to terminate the requirement. It’s just how government works.

Governments and public servants want to be seen to be doing everything possible to guard against any potential risk. This means doing something in addition to what was already being done. Each new piece of regulation adds to the old. No one in the public ­service loses their job for ­imposing a cost or burden on the public that is too high. It is only if they leave something undone that they get into trouble.

Back in July the government announced it would spend more money on bio­security, enhance food safety and tighten food labelling. It also said it would cut red tape. All these are worthy proposals, it’s just that doing them all at once is tricky. You can trust the public servants to do well on the new regulation, but it’s cutting the red tape where they will have trouble.

Government is like a lush tropical jungle. It doesn’t need care and nurture to take off. It grows of its own accord. It’s the pruning that takes effort. ­Unless you prune, it will suffocate any productive vegetation that gets in its way.

Forget the inconvenience to travellers and tourists of our over-the-top-bureaucracy and spare a thought for all those small and big businesses that spend hours and hours filling in forms that nobody reads. Every hour takes them away from their business. Now that I think about it, it is probably better that no one is reading those forms. Imagine the cost if we had to employ people to do that! Anyone working in business will tell you that the amount of regulation today is greater than five years ago, which was more than it was ten years ago and more than it was before that. In modern democracies the growth of government has proved unstoppable. Various governments have halted it for a time, some have even ­reversed it for a bit, but it has always resumed.

So, too, with taxation. Your average wage earner is paying more tax today than they were five years ago, which was more than they were five years before that. Is society better for this higher tax and extra regulation? It hasn’t produced much in terms of growth or jobs.

Each year the government extends its reach a little more, a few extra forms to guard against a new risk, sometimes real, sometimes imagined. Each extra burden uses up resources and time. The cumulative effect is crippling.

And these are the people we expect to generate jobs and the taxes to pay for all of this!

Answer the dumb question, dummy

Are rich and famous celebrities who agree to the occasional media interview to promote their latest multimillion-dollar movie the only human beings on planet earth to suffer through a dumb question as part of their job? No. The sub-editor whose job it is to proofread the first sentence of this article, for example, is at least one non-celebrity who has very, very recently had to suffer through a dumb question.

And, for that, I apologise.

Yet, still some people appear to be under the impression that famous actors are the only ones to have ever endured such an indignity.

Fans were outraged this week on behalf of American actor Kate Mara when a radio personality asked her during an interview about her new superhero movie reboot why she’d cut off her long hair. A few days earlier, British actor Cara Delevigne (pictured) was asked if she’d read the novel that inspired the movie she was promoting on a morning TV show. Before that, Robert Downey Jr walked out on an interview because a TV journalist asked him a confusing question about his relationship with his dad and drugs. Sure, they’re all dumb questions, but none are dumber than the questions people who aren’t famous get asked every day as part of their jobs.

Just ask a barista or a doctor or a teacher. Or more specifically, just ask a barista to make you a wet cappuccino (yes, it’s actually a thing), ask a doctor if you might have ebola after your New Zealand ski trip, or ask a teacher how to spell the word OK. OK? OK.

The only difference between the dumb questions asked of celebrities and the dumb questions people who aren’t famous get asked is that the latter usually responds with grace and humility while the former usually makes several million more dollars from the experience. Are celebrities really so precious that they can’t handle for a few seconds the dumb questions the rest of us get asked every day? Sorry subs — that’s another one for you.

Kim Kardashian’s youngest sister Kylie Jenner is turning 18 this week and some club promoter is paying her $200,000 to attend her own birthday party, and we all have to be happy for her because she’s still technically, for the next four days, a child and only a terrible person would wish a child anything other than a joyous celebration and an eternity of bliss ahead, right?

Yes, we all have to be happy for her.

Even you, the person reading this with their jaw clenched and brow furrowed and fists squeezed tight enough to cut off their own blood supply.

It’s just not fair for adults like us to target a helpless millionaire 17-year-old with any of the negative psychic energy that may or may not be radiating out through our pulsating temples as our brain’s frontal lobe swells with resentment towards this child who through no talent or hard work of her own has happened on a life of endless beauty and riches.

Yeah, how does that $3000 birthday cake taste that you’re getting for free? Good? Does it taste “just”? Is it a just dessert? Here, let us feed you another slice, right into your Kardashian adjacent face. Yes, we’re just so, so, so happy for you.

What Makes You Beautiful singer Zayn Malik has broken off his engagement to his fiancee Perrie Edwards, split from his music collaborator Naughty Boy, quit successful boyband One Direction and alienated himself from the fans who made him an international pop superstar.

Amid all of this mayhem, however, Malik appears to not even know how at risk his life is of spiralling completely out of control.

If only he could see what his fans can see, perhaps he would understand how at risk his life is.Yet he doesn’t even know how at risk his life is.

New Ebola vaccine may end outbreak

A VACCINE tested on thousands of people in Guinea exposed to Ebola seems to work and might help shut down the epidemic in West Africa, a World Health Organisation study has shown.

There is at present no ­licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, which has killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa since the world’s biggest outbreak began in the forest region of Guinea last year.

“If proven effective, this is going to be a game-changer,” WHO director-general Margaret Chan said.

“It will change the management of the current outbreak and future outbreaks.” Scientists have struggled for years to develop Ebola treatments and vaccines and have faced numerous hurdles, including the sporadic nature of outbreaks.

Many past attempts have failed, including a recently abandoned drug cocktail being tested in West Africa by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals.

Researchers gave one dose of the new vaccine, developed by the Canadian government, to more than 4000 people who were contacts of confirmed Ebola cases within 10 days of being identified.

More than 3500 contacts of other Ebola cases got the shot after a 10-day delay. In the group that received the vaccine immediately, there were no Ebola cases, compared with 16 cases in people who got delayed vaccination.

The vaccine has since been licensed to US pharmaceutical giant Merck.

The trial will now include 13 to 17-year-olds, and possibly children from the age of six, on the basis of new evidence of the vaccine’s safety, according to an online report by the medical journal The Lancet.

BRITISH health authorities say the risk of Ebola transmission to the UK has been significantly reduced and airport screenings are being scaled back.

PUBLIC Health England (PHE) said on-site screening teams will continue to be based at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, where more than 90 per cent of people from the affected countries arrive.

But Birmingham and Manchester airports and St Pancras Eurostar terminal in London will switch to the arrangements already in place at all other ports of entry to the UK, in which passengers from affected countries self refer.

"PHE will continue to screen and subsequently monitor high-risk returning workers until all three affected countries are jointly confirmed free of community transmission,"PHE's director for health protection, Professor Paul Cosford, said.

"The risk of Ebola transmission to the UK from west Africa is now significantly lower than when the screening arrangements were originally implemented in October 2014.

PHE said over the past year it has screened 9785 people at UK borders, tested 257 people for Ebola and monitored 610 individuals who have returned from west Africa, where the disease has killed more than 11,000 people.

There were 22 confirmed cases of the virus in Guinea and four in Sierra Leone in the week to July 19, according to figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Liberia reported no new cases.

THE price of chocolate is set to rise by nearly 60 per cent in the next five years as the world’s appetite for it creates a global chocolate deficit’.

As Australians have seen Freddo Frogs and other favourites shed weight over the past two years, the $152 billion chocolate industry is warning more unpleasant news is on the way.

Ebola in Africa, El Nino weather patterns and political unrest in cocoa countries have combined with growing demand from Asian markets to create the perfect storm for chocolate prices.

Experts predict a worldwide shortage by 2020 and manufacturers have warned they will not be able to absorb the rising costs.Cocoa bean prices have more than quadrupled over the past 15 years, including a 9 per cent lift in the first 10 months of this financial year, and are now $4000-plus a tonne, approaching record levels.

Far from the adventures of their youth, baby boomers have the time, and means, to explore the globe in style.

WITH cash to splash, the children off their hands and time to spare, baby boomers are enthusiastic travellers.

Despite their ravenous appetite for new destinations, cultural experiences and inspirational sights, the 55 years and older demographic isn’t keen to ‘rough it’ when they travel. This has fuelled a growing market of travel offerings which combine off-the-beaten-track destinations with luxurious, hassle-free travel through cruises, tours and packages.

Gemma Burnham, sales director at travel deals site TripADeal, shares her insights into the popular and up-and-coming destinations.

Europe While they may have done whistlestop tours in their younger years, baby boomers are now keen on a slower pace, with time to explore, enjoy and relax in the historic continent.

“Longer duration, 20-day-plus tours are really popular in that (baby boomer) market,” Burnham says, adding river cruises are going from strength to strength.

“Tours like Amsterdam to Budapest take in beautiful historic towns along the way. These towns are really accessible from the port, so you can just dock and walk around.

“Otherwise, you can choose to stay on the boat and watch the world go by – you can do as much or as little as possible.” According to Burnham, a growing number of cruising devotees are choosing to mix a river cruise with a larger Mediterranean cruise to venture further afield and take in larger cities.

“People will often do a river cruise, then link to a bigger vessel to explore places like Italy and Croatia,” she says. “With different vessels you can see different sides of Europe.”

The Americas Alaska is by far the most popular cruise destination among over 55s, explains Burnham, and it’s very easy to understand why. “The landscapes are incredible, you’ve got the glaciers and cliffs, then you have the wildlife – you can go on shore excursions to see polar bears catching salmon; these are things you remember forever,” she says.

In the US, the national parks of the west coast are heading to the top of traveller wish lists, with boomers often choosing luxury coach tours as an easy way to take in the likes of the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park.

Venture down to South America and Burnham says Peru is a must for its blend of ancient ruins and fascinating culture.

Asia Close to home and offering a wide range of affordable and fascinating travel destinations, Asia has been a longstanding hot spot for Australian travellers. And, while over 55s may have enjoyed mainstream destinations such as Bali and Phuket in their younger years, they’re now looking for the next big thing.

“The more obscure the destination, the better,” says Burnham, adding luxury cruises in Asia are a popular way to get off the typical tourist track in comfort.

Borneo is one of the latest destinations to come on to the radar. Largely untouched by tourism, it offers travellers a raw, authentic experience. Luxury jungle stays are the best way to get up close to Borneo’s rare wildlife, including pygmy elephants, sun bears and proboscis monkeys with their distinctive long noses.

Thailand is still a strong contender, but rather than the usual coastal destinations, baby boomers are heading north, lured by ancient ruins, bustling markets, authentic cuisine and traditional hospitality.

“People can tie in a trip to northern Thailand with Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos for even more culture,” Burnham suggests.

“While some of these less touristy destinations may be daunting, tours which are organised to include English-speaking guides, luxury transportation and meals have increased their appeal among over 55s.”

Africa With the Ebola crisis under control in many parts of Africa, this once-in-a-lifetime destination is now back on the agenda.

Glamping in luxury tents, or five-star lodge stays in safari destinations, offer an alluring blend of luxury and adventure, says Burnham.

In South Africa, the melting pot of Cape Town holds vibrant appeal, with its city sights, stunning coastline and natural wonders such as Table Mountain.

Leaping to the far north, Morocco, particularly Marrakech, delights with its souks and fascinating labyrinthine streets. “It’s like stepping into a scene from Aladdin, where you can haggle for lamps and rugs, and enjoy the interesting mix of flavours in Moroccan cuisine,” Burnham says.

Australia An irony of our far-flung island continent is Australians are often quicker to journey across the globe than explore the wonders in our own backyard. But what a backyard it is.

Burnham highlights Kakadu as one of the best examples of our homegrown natural beauty, with a luxury bush bungalow an ideal base from which to explore waterfalls, dramatic landscapes and ancient Aboriginal rock art.

Further south, some completely different – but equally beautiful – sights are on offer in Phillip Island, from the pristine coastline to the island’s iconic penguins.More: tripadeal.com.au

VR film on life in Syrian refugee camp

THE UN has used technology to give the public an insight into the plight of Syrian refugees through a virtual reality film.

CLOUDS Over Sidra is a short documentary film following a day in the life of a 12-year-old Syrian girl living in a refugee camp in Syria's neighbour Jordan.

Using special VR headsets, viewers feel like they are transported inside the Zaatari refugee camp that has been the 12-year-old's home for the past one-and-a-half years.

In a scene in which children stream into a makeshift school, the technology makes the viewer feel like they could reach out and interact with the smiling children who seem to be approaching to greet them.

The Syrian conflict is in its fifth year and has triggered an exodus of nearly four million people. UNICEF, the UN children's agency, says two million of the refugees are children.

The movie was shot with technology that is also increasingly used in the game industry.

VR headsets are not widely available to consumers but companies such as Samsung, Sony and Facebook are trying to make their use more mainstream.

UN project manager Kristin Gutekunst said on Tuesday the virtual reality documentary helps people identify with the plight of refugees.

The movie was shown this week to education ministers from around the world on the sidelines of the World Education Forum held in Incheon, South Korea.

"Instead of just feeling bad for someone, you actually feel like you might be in the same situation with them," Gutekunst said.

The UN hopes that deepening empathy through the movie will help its refugee fundraising efforts.

"I have also heard this is one of the hardest issues to fundraise for because people don't identify with the community. Our hope is to create deeper understanding so as to inspire empathy and inspiration to act," she said.

The UN plans to expand the use of the virtual reality technology to raise awareness about other global issues such as Ebola, pollution in India and the earthquakes in Nepal.

This is the most important column you will read this week — and possibly the scariest. I’m not one to be dramatic, but lately I came one step closer to becoming a ghost.

Well, not in the supernatural meaning of the word, but in the sense that proof of my ­existence came close to going “poof!” up in smoke.

Am I rambling? OK, deep breath. I should start at the ­beginning and that awful fake speeding ticket.

I could provide you with a long list of reasons why I’m not stupid for clicking on that file. I won’t mention it was so sophisticated it even tricked a tech-savvy person such as myself (cough). No, I’ll just tell you straight up I clicked on a virus — a really, really bad one.

“I hate to tell you this, but you have caught the ebola of computer viruses,” my IT guy said. The alleged fine was a ­trojan that went straight into my hard drive and encrypted every one of my files quicker than you can say dominoes. This is the kind of virus that flashes up a ransom note — pay $6000 and we’ll give you the encryption key.

She’ll be right! I have back- ups. Three of them, right? Wrong. The nasty bug infested my cloud backups and hard drive, corrupting everything — including my photos. Photos!

I mentally flipped through the images over the last few months: two birthdays, Christmas, New Years and that amazing shot of our boys, all smiling angelically at once.

People race into burning houses to save photos. Photos are our most valuable record of history. They are time capsules to a place we’ll never revisit. But the truth is we are all in danger of becoming ghosts with see-through histories.

Computer viruses are just one factor. Today’s Facebook-Instagram-Snapchat-Selfie society has never been better documented but it could be fleeting. Very little is properly stored and when it is, you’d be surprised how compromised those systems can be.

“If we don’t find a solution our 21st century will be an information black hole,” Google’s vice-president Vint Cerf recently warned.

When the boss of a ­global tech giant tells you not to trust technology, it’s time to, well, panic. Mr Cerf told the world not to rely on computer backups but to instead print out everything you want to keep.

He ­explained so fragile are our storage systems and so quickly outdated we are in danger of becoming a new dark age — future generations will be unable to access our data, records and photos. Think about it.

When you take this Mother’s Day photos this weekend, where will they be stored? Do you leave them on a memory card? A friend recently lost her camera and she hadn’t backed up the photos. She lost hundreds and it was enough to make her physically sick.

Have you backed up photos on recordable CDs? I have. Well, here’s an alarming fact. CD-Rs suffer from degradation and have a reliable lifespan of up to 10 years.

Just 10 years!

Even if they lasted longer, where do you think you’ll play them? Laptops no longer come with a disc drive.

Tried to use a floppy disk lately? What about cassettes? How about that box of Handycam video tapes you have in the bottom drawer? Can you actually play them?

Technology is so fabulous, yet so flimsy. I used to put all our precious memories into real, hard-copy photo books. They’re my greatest treasures but I’m about five years behind. My Mother’s Day resolution is to catch up.So this Sunday, do yourself a favour and take lots of photos (make sure you’re in them!) then back them up and print them out. Oh, and one last thing — don’t click on any speeding fines.

BLACKBURN charity the Al-Imdaad Foundation has raised enough money to buy a new digital X-ray machine for a hospital in India.

More than £11,000 was raised to pay for the piece of equipment in Alipore Hospital Gujarat.

Al-Imdaad Foundation received help in raising the funds from their partners, Human Appeal International, and the new piece of kit will make a difference to lives across India.

Hassan Mayet, president of Alipore Hospital, said: “Alipore Hospital is along the busiest highway in India and is surrounded by 92 small towns and villages.

“We have many trauma-related cases when after primary treatment we need to perform X-ray for proper diagnosis.

“We had a normal conventional X-ray department which needed to expose the film in three layers of chemicals and then the film needed to be dried all before the film could be given to the doctors. The process took 25 minutes and the films were dark.

“Thanks to Al-Imdaad Foundation UK and Human Appeal International, we were now able to acquire a Digital X-ray to serve the population.

“Now the film is clearer, and need not be exposed to chemicals. Instead the film is printed by computer and also can be transferred to consulting doctors computers.

“Above all it is time-saving, the X-ray film can be exposed within five to seven minutes. Hence during emergencies we save 20 minutes which will be helpful to diagnose the patient at earliest possible moment.”

Abdussamad Mulla, country director of Al-Imdaad Foundation UK, said: “Our work in various parts of India continues, as well as 65 countries globally.

“I would specially like to thank our partners and donors for their generous contributions, together we are making a difference worldwide.”

Al-Imdaad have recently donated £5,000 to support the Ebola medical appeal and have also provided £20,000 for a new kidney dialysis machine at Blackburn Royal Hospital.

The Al-Imdaad Foundation global teams are currently responding to the Nepal earthquake which has left thousands dead and millions homeless.

Greens troika off the Bandt wagon

THE man who asked the government to chauffeur him around west Africa on an ebola fact-finding mission is the new Greens leader after the shock resignation of Christine Milne yesterday.

In a move that showed the Greens to be a cold, calculated political machine rather than a “koala-hugging” party, Ms Milne orchestrated a post-Stalinist “troika of leaders” as her replacements, toppling former deputy Adam Bandt.

Some in the 11-member party believed they were in Canberra for a budget meeting but Ms Milne is understood to have given Senator Di Natale and new joint deputies Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters advanced notice of her decision to retire at the next election. That left Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt blindsided and out of a job.

The new Greens leader bristled when questioned about who had had advanced notice of the coup yesterday.

“I’m not going to go over who said what to whom, who voted in what way, what discussions were had,’’ Dr Di Natale said. “Someone may have been disappointed with the outcome … surprise, surprise, that’s politics.’’ The move mirrored the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin, when power was shared between Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov.

Dr Di Natale confirmed he had spoken to his wife about leadership issues six months ago while Ms Milne refused to rule out having discussed a leadership change with some party members.

“I’m not going to go into any discussions that have been had because that’s not how the Greens work,’’ she said. “We are basically a collegiate group and we followed the party room rules exactly as we did last time.” The leadership transition could pose a problem for Labor leader Bill Shorten, with many believing Dr Di Natale will put the Greens on a more mainstream path.

He is an avid sports fan from a “practical background” which may lead some Labor voters to defect to the Greens.

The Greens and Labor have voted as a coalition on many issues but Mr Shorten yesterday distanced himself: “Labor’s priority is to protect living standards, jobs and a secure economic future. The Greens have other priorities. I’m proud to lead the only political party that gives its members their say in choosing their leader.” Dr Di Natale indicated he would continue to block savings for health and education reform, describing the need for cuts as “nonsense”.

However, he indicated he might be open to negotiation on a fuel excise tax.î editorial page 28

FROM the appalling human tragedy of ebola to the haunting faces of Swiss mental patients and the bizarre world of Bolivian women’s wrestling , this year’s winners of the Sony World Photography Awards cover the full range of human emotions, as well as some of the planet’s most exhilarating natural wonders.

Now in its eighth year, the competition attracted an incredible 173,000 entries from 171 countries.

In the end it was a New York-based photographer John Moore of picture agency Getty Images who took first prize with a moving series on the ebola crisis in Liberia.

It was this heartbreaking image (right) taken in the capital Monrovia that won him the accolade, by humanising the devastating health crisis.

It shows a woman screaming with grief as health workers — intimidatingly anonymous in their protection gear — carry away the body of her dead sister.

Winner of the lifestyle professional category, Li Fan explored the lives of the ethnic Yi people living in the Great Liangshan Mountains in China.

UK-based Simon Norfolk took out the landscape professional award by using a fire trail to show how the Lewis Glacier on Mt Kenya, in Kenya, has been melting away over the past 80 years.For his first prize, Moore takes home $US25,000 in cash as well as the Sony photographic equipment.

THE ANGELINA EFFECT

Celebrities are often mocked for their charitable efforts. But there's one actor who consistently makes a difference to women's health, says Jane Merrick

February was Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and, I have to confess, I had no idea. That was until Angelina Jolie revealed, in an article in The New York Times, that she has had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent her developing the disease. This is the extraordinary thing about the 'Angelina Effect'. It is impossible to predict how many women's lives will be saved because of her decision to write about her own experience, but it is clear that some will, and that is a wonderful thing.

Jolie's Diary of a Surgery is personal, honest and, above all, driven by a strong will to live.

She writes about wanting to see her children grow up and to meet her grandchildren. Because of her decision to have surgery, she says: "I know my children will never have to say, 'Mom died of ovarian cancer'." She sacrifices some of her own privacy to raise awareness of the disease, with the Hollywood actor known for celebrating her own motherhood stating that she is now in the menopause and cannot have any more children.

Jolie also eradicates any suggestion that might be in people's minds that having part of your reproductive organs removed makes you any less of a woman, just as having a double mastectomy, as she did two years ago, did not undermine her womanhood. "I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared."

Jolie has inherited the 'faulty' BRCA1 gene, which left her with an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and a 50 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer. Her mother, aunt and grandmother died of the disease. So it was a precautionary check-up that showed a number of "elevated inflammatory markers" suggesting a higher risk of cancer and that led her to having surgery.

Not all ovarian cancers are linked to BRCA1, so for women who do not carry this gene, it is difficult to spot the warning signs. It is not like feeling a lump in your breast, an easy thing to check regularly. Anyone experiencing one or more of the four key symptoms - persistent pelvic or abdominal pain, persistent bloating, difficulty eating or feeling full, and needing to wee more urgently - more than 12 times a month should go and see their GP, say cancer charities.

Just as more women went to their doctor with concerns about breast cancer after Jolie spoke out about her double mastectomy, it's without doubt that now, more women will become aware of ovarian cancer and how to spot the symptoms. While breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, and ovarian cancer is the fourth most common, the latter is more deadly because early diagnosis is so difficult. According to Ovarian Cancer Action, the chances of living longer than five years are 43 per cent, but the charity says that this survival rate would rise to 90 per cent if diagnosis was made earlier.

I looked up these symptoms and statistics only because of Jolie's article. That is the Angelina Effect. Those who criticised Jolie for her activism against war rape did so because they are sceptical of celebrities taking up causes, such as being goodwill ambassadors for the United Nations, like Emma Watson on women's rights or Orlando Bloom, who was in Liberia visiting ebola clinics this week on behalf of the UN. Their critics fail to see that it is their celebrity that is exactly the point; awareness they raise goes so much further.

Breast cancer attracts - rightly - a huge amount of attention. Everyone has heard of the National Breast Cancer Foundation and knows about the pink ribbons. Ovarian cancer does not get half the publicity it should. It may be well past Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, but Jolie has now made us women aware.

My week in the land of the Dear Leader

Lachie Hinton’s mum slept badly while the young artist was gathering information for his next exhibition, which opens tonight. Hinton had gone alone to North Korea, about which the Australian Government’s Smartraveller website offers the following warning: “We continue to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

“Travel by Australians to the DPRK is uncommon and foreign visitors have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention.

“Mobile devices will be monitored and electronic devices search by DPRK authorities.” No wonder Hinton’s mum was fretting on his return.

At least she didn’t have to worry about ebola. A couple of months after Hinton’s return to Sydney, the regime of Kim Jong-un reacted to the perceived threat of the disease by advising that all foreigners entering the country would be quarantined for 21 days.

“Foreign nationals are being quarantined in designated hotels, sometimes in remote locations,” Smartraveller now advises.

So why would a 23-year-old artist from Sydney be so desperate to visit North Korea?

“I think it’s important to get these kinds of images out of North Korea,” Hinton says.

“The degree of isolation of North Korea really fascinates me. The fact that a country like that can still exist. People there aren’t allowed to leave; they’re not allowed to communicate with the outside world.” Hinton hopes his exhibition of paintings, opening tonight at Gaffa gallery, will reveal what he witnessed while he was on a week’s tour of the capital Pyongyang with two specially assigned guides.

One painting is of workers manicuring public lawns using hand shears. Another shows the ever-present portrait of the late “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il watching over drinkers in a bar. Kim Jong-il’s son Kim Jong-un now rules the country but, oddly, his image is not plastered all over the city, Hinton says.

Hinton visited Kim Jong-il’s preserved body which is publicly displayed in a transparent case.

His painting of the body is the central panel of a triptych, flanked by images of a public swimming pool where children look insecure and fearful despite the fact they are meant to be having fun. The triptych is called The Dear Leader: Omnipresence And The Innocent.

Hinton did not attempt to paint while he was in Pyongyang, although he was permitted to draw buildings and official monuments. He took as many photographs as he could, although some met with displeasure.

“I went off to the bathroom and came back and (the guide) said: ‘I hope you don’t mind but I’ve deleted some of your photos just so you don’t get into trouble at the border’,” Hinton says.

One of the deleted pictures was of children doing heavy labour on the roads. Hinton has made a painting on the subject, which is titled Construction Kids.

Hinton says his North Korean experience was “bizarre” and “terrifying” — not because of goosestepping soldiers or displays of military might, but because citizens suffered constant surveillance and had lost their sense of joy.

“I was well out of my comfort zone. I thought, ‘oh my God, what am I doing?’,” Hinton says.

SIERRA Leone's six million people are being confined to their homes for three days in a final bid to stamp out Ebola.

THOUSANDS of teams will fan out around the country from Friday, knocking on doors to remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it.

In the hot spots - the regions around the capital and in the north - health workers will also search for undetected Ebola cases.

Alfred Palo Conteh, the head of Sierra Leone's Ebola response, says a major goal of the campaign is to fight complacency, more than a year after the outbreak was declared in West Africa.

Ebola has infected nearly 12,000 people in Sierra Leone.

INTERNAL documents reportedly show WHO officials had early warning of Africa's Ebola outbreak and received an urgent plea for help.

THE claim, published by multinational US news agency The Associated Press, is based on a number of internal emails and documents obtained by its journalists.

The agency says while WHO acknowledges being slow in its response, it blames the delay in part on the surprising characteristics of the outbreak, the worst ever with more than 10,000 believed dead.

It says the documents show WHO officials were informed of the dire situation early and received an urgent plea for help.

Documents also show senior staff privately floated the idea of declaring an international health emergency over the disease's spread in early June, two months before the declaration was made on August 8.

However, top directors discouraged making the move earlier, saying the declaration could be seen as "a hostile act" and endanger economies.

THE blood sample of a New Zealand health worker who's returned from Sierra Leone after helping treat people with Ebola is being tested in Melbourne.

THE woman's blood samples have been sent to a high security laboratory in Melbourne to be tested and it'll be up to two days before a result is known.

The health worker left Sierra Leone on Sunday and contacted her Christchurch public health officer when she became unwell on Friday morning.

"Based on the patient's symptoms, the Ebola virus needs to be ruled out," New Zealand Health Minister Jonathan Coleman said in a statement.

"I am advised that it is quite possible they are suffering from gastroenteritis or some other illness such as malaria."

Dr Coleman said New Zealand had carefully planned for any eventuality.

The woman's partner was the only person she'd been in direct contact with during the potentially infectious period, and the partner is now self-monitoring as a result.

"Ebola is not easy to catch - transmission requires direct contact with an infected individual and only occurs through contact with blood and other body fluids," Dr Coleman said.

"If the health worker does have Ebola, they will not have been infectious while travelling as the individual was not symptomatic at that time."

The woman has been transferred from her Christchurch home to one of New Zealand's four specially isolation facilities.

A BRITISH military healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone has arrived in the UK.

THE RAF plane, which has also brought back two of the female worker's colleagues for further monitoring, touched down at RAF Northolt in west London on Thursday afternoon.

All three will now be transferred to the Royal Free Hospital (RFH) in London where the infected worker will be treated at its special high-level isolation unit.

Public Health England (PHE) announced on Wednesday that the worker had tested positive for Ebola after being exposed to the virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone.

Up to 700 British military personnel are currently deployed in the West African country to aid the Ebola effort.

A total of four military healthcare workers are known to have come into contact with the infected worker and two of them will now be assessed at the RFH as a precautionary measure.

The pair that remain in Sierra Leone will be kept under observation there while a decision is made about whether to bring them to the UK.

Nurses Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley - the only other Britons to have tested positive for the disease - were also treated at the RFH and both made full recoveries.

A PHE spokeswoman said rapid tracing was undertaken in Sierra Leone to identify anyone who had been in recent close contact with the worker as soon as she was known to be infected.

The Ebola disease has killed more than 9960 people in West Africa.

A ROYAL Air Force plane has been sent to evacuate a British healthcare worker who has been diagnosed with Ebola in Sierra Leone.

A ROYAL Air Force plane sent to the west African country on Wednesday is bringing the military servicewoman back to be treated in London's Royal Free Hospital, an MoD spokeswoman said.

The condition of the patient, who was publicly confirmed to have Ebola on Wednesday, is unknown.

She is the third Briton to contract the virus in Sierra Leone - two nurses, William Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey, recovered after being treated in Britain.

Ebola has swept through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia since December 2013, killing more than 9900 people, according to the World Health Organisation.

Britain has focused its aid effort on its former colony, Sierra Leone, and up to 700 British military personnel have been deployed along with numerous civilian medical staff.

THE World Health ­Organisation will soon start large-scale testing of an ebola vaccine in Guinea to see how effective it might be in ­preventing future outbreaks of the dreaded virus.

The UN health agency said last night the study would be focused in Basse Guinee, the region with has the most ebola cases in the country.

Officials will aim to ­vaccinate people exposed to other cases, who are at risk of developing ebola. If they agree, officials will immunise them to see if they might be protected. The vaccine being tested was developed by Canada.

If the vaccine is effective, “it will be the first preventive tool against ebola in history,” WHO chief Dr Margaret Chan said.

Authorities in Liberia are preparing to discharge the last ebola patient.Incidence management system head Tolbert Nyenswah said the patient will be released from a treatment unit in ­Monrovia. There were no other confirmed cases in the country and as such, Liberia can begin to count up to 42 days to be ­declared ebola free in keeping with WHO protocols.

TESTS have confirmed two young Melbourne girls have been cleared of having Ebola after returning from Guinea.

THE girls, aged four and eight, were taken to hospital from Melbourne Airport early on Thursday when it was noticed they both had high temperatures.

The original tests came back negative, but they had to wait for 72 hours until further tests were done.

Additional samples were also negative, and the girls have recovered from their illnesses and returned home to their family.

The negative results means there is no risk to passengers who travelled on the same flight from Abu Dhabi.

The girls had been on a trip to Guinea with their family.

TWO youngsters feared to have contracted ebola on a family holiday to Guinea were yesterday cleared of the killer virus.

Twelve hours after the ebola scare began, tests at Melbourne’s Royal Children’s Hospital have cleared the children, aged four and eight.

The state’s chief health ­officer Professor Michael ­Ackland said the girls are being treated for a respiratory illness and are now doing well.

The girls had returned to Melbourne with their parents and another sibling following an extended visit to Guinea, Prof Ackland said.“Routine screening of ­returning travellers from ebola-affected countries in west Africa identified that the girls had elevated temperatures,” he said. “As a ­precaution in accordance with universal infection control procedures, they were transported to the Royal Children’s Hospital to be assessed for a range of infections — including Ebola virus disease.’’

A BRITISH nurse who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning from Sierra Leone is being investigated over claims of misconduct.

PAULINE Cafferkey flew back to the UK via Casablanca and London Heathrow before landing at Glasgow Airport late on December 28.

She was admitted to hospital in Glasgow the next day after feeling feverish and was diagnosed with the disease, which has left more than 9000 people dead.

Public Health England (PHE) said it had passed information to the General Medical Council (GMC) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) after assessing the screening of healthcare workers returning to the UK.

Three nurses and two doctors are now being investigated.

"During our recent assessment of the screening of some returning healthcare workers at Heathrow on December 28th, information emerged which needed to be passed to the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council," a PHE spokeswoman said on Monday.

"We are aware that the regulators are now considering the matter and it would be inappropriate for PHE to comment further at this time."

Ms Cafferkey had been volunteering with Save The Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town before returning to the UK in December.

She spent more than three weeks being treated at the Royal Free Hospital where she was critically ill for a time, but was released last month after making a full recovery.

A report released earlier this month found that Ms Cafferkey possibly caught the virus by wearing a visor and not goggles, although this could not be certain.

THE LAST WORD ... WITH ADAM HILLS, THE LAST LEG HOST

"I'VE never sat down and thought, 'Right, I'm going to start doing rants on this show' (The Last Leg). I kind of went on one, and I got a good response.

A few weeks later I let rip with another one ... suddenly you've got the channel saying every week, 'We need a rant, we need a rant!' I'm not going to manufacture something if I'm not actually really annoyed.

With something like that you've got to be really careful that you don't start delivering them to order. What's weird is that now I've become the ranty guy. People look forward to my rants. I'm all right with it.

To be honest, I'm not sure a British person could get away with these rants. I get away with it because I'm an Aussie, and they think I'm uncultured.

On The Last Leg, we've covered Gaza, Ebola, Syria, Robin Williams dying, Joan Rivers dying. With this series, we thought, 'What could possibly go wrong?' And then there was Charlie Hebdo ... It happened Friday, and we were on air Friday night, literally four hours after the whole hostage situation unfolded in Paris. So we were rewriting the show while we were watching the news.

You can't just wing it; you really have to put a lot of thought into what you're saying on air. But we had to cover it, especially considering it was an attack on a satirical magazine. It was a question of what can you laugh at, and what is out of bounds.

And as it turned out, we had a lot of people tuning in on Friday night. We are almost becoming a kind of go-to show for people to make sense of it all.

We try to find some levity in it without mocking what went on. I still have moments where I think, 'When did I become the responsible mouthpiece of British television?' The Adam Grieves Tumblr account ... that was a weird week. It started with Fiona O'Loughlin calling me out for writing something nice about Joan Rivers. Thankfully that week I was actually filming a pilot for another show on Channel 4, so I was busy enough that I didn't get too bogged down with what was going on Twitter. A lot of people tend to write 'in memoriams' whenever someone passes away. And because I was on Spicks and Specks, there's a good chance that many of them were on the show at some point. I almost feel a duty to write something nice about them."

Ultravox legend is touring the world entirely alone, writes Kathy McCabe

A solo tour for a rock star is rarely without an entourage. A tour manager, security and technical crew are the bare minimum most popular musicians would engage to accompany them on the road.

But not Midge Ure. For his solo tour, the former Visage and Ultravox frontman, the man partly responsible for one of the biggest charity hits in history — Do They Know It’s Christmas? — really is travelling the world alone.

He is also booking his own flights and hotels, lugging his own baggage and instruments and driving his own hire cars.

Before you jump to any conclusions about his sanity or financial health, there is a method to Ure’s madness.

He has become a regular guest lecturer at Paul McCartney’s Liverpool Institute For Performing Arts and other “fame” schools, and decided he had better be telling it like it is to the starry-eyed students.

Talking about his experiences of the music industry as a recording artist would be irrelevant to these millennials because “there isn’t an industry any more”.

“They aren’t going to walk out of college with a piece of paper and get a five-album deal,” he says.

Further fearing that graduates would be well-skilled in the songwriting and production departments but not in the realities of the touring musician, Ure decided to give himself a crash course in Gigs 101.

He didn’t have to do it — he has “people”.

“Yeah, maybe I could have made it up and sat at home in bath, got on the internet and blogged about how tough it was in Arizona,” he laughs.

Instead, he got on the internet in his home in Bath and searched for cheap flights and car rental deals for his Fragile Troubadour tour of America last month.

He filmed the experience for a documentary, which one senses will eventually screen beyond his college classes.

“I am quite good at spending time on my own. And I quite enjoyed the process of doing this. Maybe if I had to do it, it might not have been fun,” he says.

“I didn’t leave things to chance — I can’t stand that sensation of the mad panic, so I would get to the airport two hours before. At least I was smart enough to tour the warm parts of America in the middle of winter.” While his DIY solo tour doco will no doubt prove educational for future students, it is likely they will also be keen to hear the untold stories from a man who has enjoyed an illustrious career — from co-founding Visage in the late 1970s, playing with Thin Lizzy, creating Ultravox, co-writing that charity hit, right up to releasing his latest solo record Fragile last year.

His current world tour draws from his entire repertoire and the Scottish musician and writer says the acoustic show allows him the flexibility to play any one of 100 songs as it occurs to him, or the audience demands.

Considering much of his early work was of a pioneering electronica nature, you can’t help but wonder how Fade To Grey or the epic Vienna are reimagined as acoustic pieces.

Ure said it took much trial and error to figure it out.

“I was doing a tour in America many years ago — it was four singer-songwriters — and all the way across America I kept being told I needed to do Vienna,” he says.

“But I didn’t know how to go about it; I couldn’t get out of the arrangement — the heartbeat and the bass drum and the viola. I tried it but it was pretty ropey.

“By the end of the tour, I got a handle on it and I realised that, because the majority of the audience knew the song, they heard all the parts in their head.” Another of his hits, Do They Know It’s Christmas? got a reworking last year to raise funds to fight the ebola crisis in Africa.

Ure laughs when asked if he had any diplomatic duties in a star-packed room that included ex-couples and chart competitors.

He admits he did have to soothe some nerves when the song’s younger contributors found out their pre-recording research was redundant because he had tweaked some lyrics.

All the hysteria around the recording paled when he scored Father Of The Year points by introducing his daughters to their favourite pop star, Ed Sheeran.

“Oh, I went up in their estimation. Almost as much as the day one of my daughters found an old chart when she was rummaging in the loft. She came downstairs saying, ‘Dad, the chart says your record is above David Bowie’s. How did that happen?’ ” kathy.mccabe@news.com.auTwitter: @McCabeRadar● Midge Ure, The Basement, April 12, from $60; Lizottes Newcastle, April 15, from $65

A MUM-of-two is preparing to swap East Lancashire for Africa to help tackle the Ebola crisis.

Julia Hogan, who works as a team leader for Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust’s Contraception and Sexual Health (CaSH) service, is set to fly out next week following five days of intensive training.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Mrs Hogan, a qualified nurse from Nelson, will spend five weeks in Sierra Leone providing nursing care at treatment centres.

She will spend three weeks on her return away from work as part of Public Health England’s protocol for people returning to the country after volunteering to assist with the Ebola crisis.

Mrs Hogan, who will celebrate her 54th birthday while out in Africa, said: “I qualified as a nurse in 1981, working at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

“I have been with the CaSH service for 10 years leading the team and providing sexual and reproductive health care to people in East Lancashire.

“I applied to volunteer to help out with the Ebola crisis as I have always wanted the opportunity to use my nursing skills in an area where they are really needed.

“This will be a big challenge and I am really looking forward to working with African colleagues and being in a completely different setting.

“As a team, we are always looking at different ways to develop links with professionals overseas to transfer knowledge and skills.

“This is a fantastic opportunity to learn about the challenges and obstacles faced by healthcare professionals working in areas with lower resources and share skills and knowledge.

“On a personal level, I am grateful to have an opportunity to be able to make a difference to a crisis hit area and develop my nursing skills overseas.”

Dee Roach, executive director of nursing, quality and governance at Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust said: “We are extremely proud that one of our nurses has made the decision to volunteer an area hit by the Ebola crisis.

“We are focused on providing compassionate care to the people of Lancashire and it is great that these values will be travelling with Julia all the way to Sierra Leone.

“We wish her the very best in her travels and look forward to hearing of her experiences on her return.”

She is hoping to keep a blog of her experiences over the next five weeks which will be published via the trust’s Twitter account – @LancashireCare.

Parents should not swallow the ‘food is medicine’ mantra

THE so-called wellness industry has an unhealthy dark side that needs exposing. Increasingly it is revealed parents are not vaccinating their children, and feeding kids potentially deadly raw milk for the “healthy” bacteria on the advice of their alternative therapist.

While most of the professional bodies for alternative practitioners have now come out with position statements in support of vaccination, in practice many are quietly advising their patients not to vaccinate, fuelling a discredited link to autism, and directing parents to feed their kids raw milk to treat illnesses such as autism.

A good deal of the chiropractic sector does not even believe in germ theory. They believe that as long as you pop along for your “wellness” tinkering every week, you won’t fall prey to infectious diseases.

Some leading chiropractors were members of the anti-vaccination group the AVSN, which once boasted that chiropractors were its greatest fin-ancial supporters. Recent com-ments by Arizona chiropractor Heather Wolfson about a five-year-old who could not be vaccinated, and who died of chickenpox related complications, shows just how deranged chiropractic thinking can be.

“If this mother would have sought out chiropractic care, gave just two simple vitamins A and C, she would have never developed pneumonia … This little girl is dead, not from chickenpox, but from chemicals and poor nutrition.” I would like to see those chiropractors who don’t ­believe in germ theory to head to ebola-stricken Africa to put their craft to the test.

The wellness industry lives by the mantra “food is medicine”, a term deeply embedded in the anti-vax movement.

Amid its advice is to drink raw milk. As naturopath Helen Goodwin wrote, this is the only way it should be drunk, “as the beneficial bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus is still alive”.

But Goodwin acknowledges the potential for harmful bacteria is the reason why it is ­illegal to sell raw milk for consumption in Australia.It contains listeria and E.coli and other pathogens which recently caused the death of a Victorian toddler.

Africa-focused miners hit hard in 2014

Falling commodities, ebola, labour and geopolitical problems weigh heavily on sector.

West Australian mining companies with operations in Africa have had $3.6 billion wiped from their value in the last year.

Falling commodity prices, the ebola epidemic, labour issues and geopolitical tensions have combined to scare off investors, and those remaining have seen their shares almost halve in value.

A Deloitte Australia report shows the combined market value of publicly listed WA companies with operations in Africa drop by $3.6bn, or 47 per cent, in 2014, to $4 billion.

Weaker demand from the Chinese manufacturing sector, a strengthening US dollar and oversupply of some of the major commodities had a major impact on Africa, Deloitte clients and markets partner for Western Australia Tim Richards said.

"Coupled with the ebola outbreak in West Africa, as well as challenges relating to industrial relations and geopolitical tensions, 2014 was a challenging year for many companies and has highlighted the changing nature of investment into Africa," he said.

Merger and acquisition activity was responsible for nine African focused companies exiting the share market, which contributed to $2bn of the fall in net worth of the companies.

But the report found the sector still has potential, with Australian investment in the oil and gas sector in Africa increasing over the past few years.

The release of the Deloitte figures coincides with the start of Africa's largest mining conference, Mining Indaba, in Cape Town on Monday.

Fewer delegates are expected this year and many West Australian mining executives are staying away from the event.

Australia-Africa Mining Industry Group chief executive Trish O'Reilly said Indaba organisers had been offering discounts to stimulate interest in the conference.

At the peak of investment about 18 months ago, around 230 Australian companies were active in 42 African countries.

Since then many junior explorers have shelved plans, particularly in ebola-affected countries.

West Australian premier Colin Barnett delivered a keynote speech at the 2014 Indaba conference but he will not be attending this year's conference.

Ebola infection 'linked to visor'

A REPORT into how a British nurse may have caught Ebola suggests she may have done so by donning a visor with protective clothing meant to go with goggles.

THE report by Save the Children says it cannot be completely certain how Pauline Cafferkey contracted Ebola but both pieces of equipment are "equally safe".

The nurse volunteered with the charity at the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Kerry Town before returning to the UK in December.

She spent more than three weeks in a London hospital where she was critically ill but was released last month after making a full recovery.

Save the Children on Wednesday published the findings of an independent review into the possible causes of how the 39-year-old caught the virus.

The report said both visors and goggles were safe but there were slight differences in the type of clothing worn with each and in the protocols for putting them on and removing them.

Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said: "We will never be 100 per cent sure how Pauline contracted Ebola.

"The panel found that the Save the Children procedures, equipment and protocols at the ETC are safe and meet all required standards and that training is of a good standard.

"Although there is no conclusive evidence, the panel suggests that Pauline's use of a visor, within a context geared to the use of goggles, was the most likely cause of her contracting Ebola."

"The panel found that where Save the Children-approved protocols may not have been followed, or where prescribed equipment was not used, they weren't picked up immediately and therefore action might not have been taken quickly to correct them.

"Lessons have already been learned and as a result of the findings, we have further tightened our protocols and procedures," Forsyth said.

Chocolate shrinking, but not the price

CHOCOLATE lovers will be scrambling to stock up on Cadbury Dairy Milk family blocks before the size soon shrinks.

Cadbury has announced it will reduce its standard 220g block of Dairy Milk down to 200g as a result of the rising cost of manufacturing. That’s the equivalent of four squares.

All Dairy Milk variations, such as hazelnut, black forest and fruit and nut, will be streamlined to 200g as well over the next few weeks.

Chocolate fans will remember the furore in 2009 when Cadbury reduced its then-250g block to 200g. Then it made a big song-and-dance about its ‘‘joyful’’ decision to increase the size to 220g in 2013 (no mention, of course, of its previously larger-still size).

But if you think your chocolate is about to get 1/11th cheaper to correspond with the smaller size, think again. Cadbury said it has not changed the recommended retail price of its blocks. However, retailers are responsible for setting the price consumers pay so the price point could still change.

‘We know people will not be happy about getting less chocolate, but we are maintaining what is most important, the taste and quality hasn’t changed,” a Cadbury spokesman said.

“We had to make a choice — increase the price we recommend to our retailers or change the size a little.” Cadbury is not the first major brand to downsize products while leaving prices ­unchanged. It’s a common practice in the grocery sector as consumers are less likely to notice a size change than a price increase.

Pet food, body sprays, ­potato chips and even Vegemite, owned by the same parent company as Cadbury (Mondelez), have all resorted to this little trick.Cadbury said the decision to reduce the size was because of the rising cost of manufacturing. Cocoa prices have ­increased significantly as ebola-ravaged countries in west Africa, which produce the majority of the world’s cocoa supply, have been unable to maintain levels.

East Lancashire health volunteers return home from helping Ebola fight

TWO health workers have returned home after six weeks helping Ebola victims in Sierra Leone.

Matthew Newport, a doctor from Rossendale, and Kathy Farrell, an emergency nurse at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, were among dozens of British medics to fly out to West Africa in December, where more than 8,000 people have died from the disease.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Both have returned home healthy and told of the heartbreak of seeing several babies die at their base in Makeni, but also the joy at helping other patients make miraculous recoveries.

The pair slept in basic accommodation about four miles from the treatment centre, and would have to wear a specially designed protective suit before entering the cordon.

Matthew, 27, from Newchurch, said: “The first patient we saw was a young girl and she died on Christmas Eve, which was really difficult. And many of the babies we saw just weren’t robust enough to get to the stage where they were making anti-bodies to fight the virus.

“But people did make amazing recoveries as well.

“In total we had about 50 patients in the camp over the six weeks and the mortality rate was about 50 per cent.”

Matthew, who has worked as a locum at the Royal Blackburn and Burnley General hospitals, was tasked with triaging patients, administering anti-biotics and IV fluids, and performing blood tests.

He suspended his masters degree in disaster management to sign up to the mission with International Medical Corps, an NGO, and is preparing to fly out again for three months.

Matthew said the hardest thing to deal with was the ‘overwhelming’ 40-degree heat, which left the team drenched in sweat inside their protective suits. Because of this, he said they resorted to treating patients at night and sleeping during the day, as they had previously only been able to wear the suits for 45 minute periods.

Kathy, a 42-year-old mum-of-four from Bolton, said: “It was quite a surreal experience and quite an intense situation.

“What was difficult at first was people didn’t think we were there to help, as they would see people come into the cordon and not come out again.

“But many of the initial patients were too ill for us to help, and the longer we were there the more successful we were able to be, as we could see people earlier.”

Ebola vaccines trial starts in Liberia

A TRIAL of two potential Ebola vaccines is under way in Liberia's capital after smaller studies determined that the vaccines were safe for human use.

THE trials in Liberia are taking place after smaller studies determined that the vaccines were safe for human use. By comparing them now with a placebo shot, scientists hope to learn whether they can prevent people from contracting the ghastly virus that has killed some 60 per cent of those hospitalised with the disease.

Yet despite the trials' promise, authorities must still combat fear and suspicion that people could become infected by taking part. Each vaccine uses a different virus to carry non-infectious Ebola genetic material into the body and spark an immune response.

On Sunday, in one densely populated neighbourhood of Monrovia, musicians sang songs explaining the purpose and intent of the trial in a bid to dispel fears.

B Emmanuel Lansana, 43, a physician's assistant, was the first to receive doses on Monday. Two shots were administered at different points on his right arm. His wife had expressed apprehension about the vaccine trial, but Lansana said he still wanted to take part.

"From the counselling, all of the reservations I have were explained, my doubts were cleared," he said.

Up to 600 volunteers are taking part in the first phase, and trial organisers have said eventually as many as 27,000 people could take part.

The World Health Organisation says the Ebola epidemic has infected more than 22,000 people and claimed more than 8800 lives over the past year. Without a vaccine, officials have fought the outbreak with old-fashioned public health measures, including isolating the sick, tracking and quarantining those who had contact with them, and setting up teams to safely bury bodies.

The vaccine trials come as the three most affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - appear to be making strides against the Ebola epidemic first identified last March.

The UN health agency said last week that the countries had reported fewer than 100 cases in the past week, for the first time since June.

PUBLIC Health England (PHE) said the individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for assessment and next of kin have been informed.

The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms.

"Our thoughts are with this person, who has been courageous in helping those affected in West Africa, and in preventing the wider spread of Ebola," PHE's director for health protection and medical director Professor Paul Cosford said.

"We have strict, well-tested protocols in place for this eventuality and we are confident that all appropriate actions have been taken to support the healthcare worker concerned and to protect the health of other people."

Television journalist Michael Usher will remain in self-imposed quarantine for the next week after visiting Africa for a story on the ebola crisis.

Usher won’t see his three children during that time after the 60 Minutes reporter and his team of four colleagues were detained at Sydney Airport for nearly five hours ­yesterday.

The group had spent a week in Sierra Leone.

“I am on a complete self-­imposed ban from my own family for the next seven days,” Usher told The Daily Telegraph.

“Every precaution has been taken. We are fine, there is nothing wrong with us but you just don’t know and it would be grossly unfair of us to take any risks.” Travellers are now required to fill in an ebola-specific form disclosing where they have been in the lead-up to their arrival in Australia.

After disclosing details of their trip to Customs officials, Usher and his colleagues were separated and assessed by Customs and Quarantine officers as well as representatives from the NSW Department of Health.

The new initiatives show how seriously the government is taking the threat of ebola.

“It took a while but I think it is pretty encouraging that they were extremely thorough and meticulous in what they went through.

“They took our temperature two or three times when we were there just to check,” he explained.

“They were looking for fever, they were looking for vomiting, signs of ebola.” Usher and his colleagues disposed of the clothing they wore in ebola- ­affected areas ­before leaving the country.They will check their temperature twice daily for 21 days and text message the results to local Health Department officials to monitor their ongoing health as ebola has a three-week incubation ­period.

Aussie nurse ebola scare

AN Australian nurse working in Sierra Leone with ebola patients has been airlifted to hospital in the UK after accidentally breaching personal safety measures.

The nurse has not been diagnosed with ebola and the evacuation was a precautionary measure.

A spokesman for The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was a low-risk incident: “The individual, who for privacy reasons has not been named, has not been diagnosed with ebola, and her transferral to the UK for a 21-day observation period is a precautionary step.’’ The nurse was working at the Australian-run Aspen Medical clinic in Sierra Leone when the breach of personal safety protocols occurred.

The Australian-funded clinic is operating at a capacity of 38 beds and is on track to scale up to 50 beds by early February. To date, 18 patients have recovered and been discharged from the centre.

It is unclear if the Australian will be taken to London’s Royal Free Hospital, which currently has Britain’s only isolation ward for ebola patients.

It is where Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who was diagnosed with the disease on December 29, is recovering, after reports earlier this week that she was “no longer critically ill”. Ms Cafferkey contracted the disease while working as a volunteer at a British-built ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

The World Health Organisation estimates the ebola outbreak in west Africa — the worst on record — has killed 8371 people, including 495 healthcare workers.

The current outbreak has infected more than 21,000 people in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone since March, according to the WHO.

The bulk of those cases have been in Guinea, where the disease has killed more than 1800 people, Liberia, where it has claimed more than 3500 lives, and Sierra Leone, where more than 3000 have died from the disease.

There have been at least 24 cases outside Africa traced from the current outbreak.Those cases were in the US and Europe, with two people, including a former Liberian, dying from the disease in the US, while two people have died in Spain and a UN medical official died in Germany.

Did you know everyone in the whole wide world will die one day?, my inquisitive four-year-old informed me yesterday from the backseat, where she was reading her Frozen book.

She’s been asking a lot about death lately and I don’t blame the news or her kindy friends or the older kid down the street. I blame Disney. I blame Disney because none of their favourite fairytale characters have parents, because they all died. Think about it.

Anna and Elsa’s parents are killed at sea. Cinderella and Snow White had totally wicked step-mums. Princess Jasmine? No mum; only a dad who wants her married off to whichever prince will have her.

Sleeping Beauty was raised by well-meaning fairies in the woods. Pocahontas only has a dad. Bambi’s mum dies. Peter Pan doesn’t even know what a mum is. Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to try to get home to her Aunty Em.

Annie is an orphan. Ariel’s mum dies when she was just a young mer-girl. Simba’s dad dies in the most violent of ways. Not sure where Mowgli’s parents are or why he was left to roam the jungle alone. Nemo’s mum dies. Tiana’s dad tragically dies before she meets her frog prince and fulfils her dreams. Shall I go on?

And where in God’s name are Max and Ruby’s parents? Do they seriously live alone? I’m calling DOCS.

Anyway, I digress. But I think there is a lot of sadness in our story books. Can’t we lighten up a bit and lessen the harsh dose of reality?

Having two little girls like Anna and Elsa lose their parents is totally traumatic for anyone watching, let alone for little people who don’t really know what death is. Yes, we need stories to be real-ish and teach them, among other things, how singing can help overcome adversity — but can’t one of the princesses live happily ever after — with BOTH of their parents?

I know a lot of parents who don’t watch the television news at night ­because it’s too sad. Between war and ebola and babies dumped down drains, the world is a scary place, no matter how you look at it.Bad things happen every day, so fairytales should be kinder to our kids. They should be able to find comfort in knowing their parents will help them on their life journey. Maybe if these confused princesses had their mums around, their dads wouldn’t be so quick to try to marry them off, and they’d know Prince Charming doesn’t guarantee a happy ending.

Channel 10 has revealed that contestants on I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here will include a TV actress, a model, a comedian and a cricketer.

Entertainment circles are abuzz that local stand-up comedian Joel Creasey, referred to as Australia’s acid-tongued prince, is among the contestants.

Another name that has been linked to the reality show is that of long-running Today show gossip reporter Richard Reid.

Confidential can exclusively reveal that Reid has left Today, effective immediately. “After seven glorious years, it’s time for me to step down as the reigning gossip guru of Today,” Reid said.

Ten contestants will go into the reality show’s African jungle location within weeks.

The show looks set to debut in the last week of January or first week of February and will screen live five nights a week.

“The contestants will include a world-famous overseas TV actress, an international model, a young Australian comedian and an Australian cricketer,” Ten’s head of entertainment and factual programming Stephen Tate said.

Tate was giving no names away.

Rumours that the overseas TV actress was American Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina, the Teenage Witch) started following the show’s Twitter feed earlier this week.

Broadcaster Sophie Monk, media identity Derryn Hinch and cricket legend Shane Warne were among those reported to have turned down offers of $60,000 a week to be on the show.

“What is crucial is to get the mix right,” Tate said. “Ultimately we’re putting together a great big dysfunctional family.

“The celebrities can’t know about each other until they enter the jungle. The surprise on their faces is a very important thing.” The show’s rules include no phones, no make-up and no personal assistants. “The funniest questions (from celebrities) have been around what luxury items they can bring,” Tate said. “Some were trying to tell us that mascara was a medical exemption.” The celebrities’ most serious questions were around health and safety, given the outbreak of ebola in West Africa. There is also the threat of wild animals.

“We have the typical security ... we also have special wildlife security guards stationed around the camp who are the first line of defence if any predators are coming through,” Tate said.

“As far as ebola is concerned, where it has broken out in West Africa is closer to Europe than the area we are in.

“Where we are is absolutely pristine. We test the water every day and it is absolutely pure.”Hosts Julia Morris and Chris Brown will head to Africa in a week’s time to start rehearsals. “They need to acclimatise because it is the wet season where we are,” Tate said.

Jet crashes and the MH370 ­mystery dominated 2014’s headlines, and the horrendous Sydney siege, the Boko Haram kidnappings (the girls have not been brought back) and ebola also loomed large.

I mentioned my heavy heart to one friend who reminded me that our extraordinary access to media means we are more aware of the bad stories than in the past but, in many respects, the world is in a better place than it was a year before. For example, we have far fewer ­extremely poor people in the world than ever before.

This is sometimes hard to ­reconcile. Especially when you ­observe first-hand the challenges in developing nations in which poverty or violence, hardship and hunger are rife. Or we witness backward steps in policy and development in ­developed countries.

Any analysis of the globe reveals the world is growing richer, health-ier, more educated and more ­peaceful. Against that, we do have four ‘‘L3’’ emergencies (the UN classification for the most severe ­humanitarian crises) in South Sudan, Iraq, the Central African Republic and Syria.

We also have the largest number of forcibly displaced people (51 million) since World War II.

Human impact on the natural world remains dire.

There was some good news on climate change last year with the pre-G20 summit announcement by China and the US to reduce carbon emissions and the European Union’s agreement to reduce CO2 to 40 per cent of 1990 levels by 2030.

I am confronted regularly with the disproportionate impact of ­disadvantage on women and girls which is especially evident with ­gender-based violence. Last year, the scourge of sexual violence in conflict received worldwide attention and efforts to combat such ­violence have improved.

Access to education globally — although increasing — remains ­especially difficult for girls, and the abuse and exploitation of children worldwide are glaring indictments. The good news is that mortality for under five-year-olds globally is at its lowest on record.

Dealing with diseases, such as malaria, account for much of this improvement. 2014 saw malaria deaths reach half the number they were in 2000, which is a landmark. This underscores how improvements to health are a prerequisite to economic and social success.

Last year’s first-ever soft landing on a comet (with the robotic space probe Rosetta and its module Philae) reminds us why science inspires us all … and that “Space is big. Really big” as Douglas Adams noted.

Perhaps per ardua ad astra (through adversity to the stars) isn’t such a bad motto for life.

A PERSON with a history of travel to west Africa has been admitted to a Welsh hospital to undergo tests for Ebola, doctors say.

THE patient has been admitted to Royal Glamorgan Hospital, near Llantrisant, under the "strict protocols" for the virus.

Dr Gwen Lowe, of Public Health Wales, said the public would be made aware if Ebola is confirmed in the patient.

"Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual with a history of travel to West Africa has been admitted to Royal Glamorgan Hospital under the strict protocols for possible Ebola," Dr Lowe said on Wednesday.

"This means that all precautions in the transport and management of the patient have been adhered to and the individual is currently being cared for in strict isolation pending test results which are expected later today.

"Based on our established evidence-based risk assessment protocol, we are confident that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure there is no risk to public health."

The news comes as British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, 39, remains critically ill with Ebola after returning from voluntary work in Sierra Leone.

Mrs Cafferkey, who was working with the charity Save the Children in Kerry Town, is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

The UK's screening procedures for Ebola are being reviewed after it emerged the nurse had been cleared to fly from London to Glasgow despite her temperature being checked seven times when she landed at Heathrow.

Since its outbreak the disease has claimed more than 8000 lives across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

AN Australian-funded Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone has successfully treated an 11-year-old girl.

FOREIGN Minister Julie Bishop said an 11-year-old girl was the first to be discharged and has been released into the care of her family.

Ms Bishop said the girl's father had paid tribute to the Australian and New Zealand health professionals who treated his daughter.

She said 37 patients had been admitted to the facility, which was treating 26 people.

Ebola has killed more than 7900 people, almost all of them in west Africa.

The World Health Organisation says more than 20,200 cases of the virus have been reported since the outbreak began in December 2013.

British engineers built the 100-bed centre at Hastings airfield, near the Sierra Leone capital, and handed it to the Australian mission in mid-December.

There are 32 Australian and New Zealand health professionals at the facility, and four have returned home after completing their deployment.

Ms Bishop said a wall had been erected at the centre so surviving patients could place their hand prints on it. The 11-year-old girl was the first to do so.

"I'm pleased that the treatment centre is under way. That it is making a difference, that we are saving lives," she told reporters in Perth.

The clinic's operation comes after months of criticism that the federal government's initial response was "lethally inadequate".

British nurse Pauline Cafferkey is in a critical but stable condition in hospital in London after contracting Ebola while working at a British-built treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

A BRITISH nurse who contracted ebola in Sierra Leone and was hospitalised in London this week is now in a critical condition, the hospital says.

“The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is sorry to announce that the condition of Pauline Cafferkey has gradually deteriorated over the past two days and is now critical,” it said on Saturday.

It comes as another suspected case of ebola was reported in Gloucestershire yesterday.

On Wednesday, doctors had said the nurse was sitting up in bed, reading and talking to staff from inside her isolation tent.

They said she had agreed to have blood plasma treatment and take an experimental anti-viral drug, which was unnamed but was not ZMapp, the drug used to successfully treat fellow British volunteer nurse William Pooley.

Dr Michael Jacobs, infectious diseases consultant at the Royal Free London, had warned at the time: “Ebola runs a very variable course and the next few days are going to be very critical.” Ms Cafferkey, who works for Britain’s state-run National Health Service (NHS), had been volunteering at a British-built treatment centre in Sierra Leone when she contracted the deadly virus.

She returned to Britain last Sunday after spending five weeks in Africa with other volunteers and Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone.

After disembarking from her flight to Heathrow, the 39-year-old complained to officials of a fever.

She was allowed to board a connecting flight to Glasgow however, after having her temperature taken seven times.

Hours after landing, the nurse was rushed to Gartnavel General Hospital. She was later transferred to London.

It comes as another suspected UK case of ebola was reported in Swindon, Wiltshire, yesterday when an unidentified person who had recently returned from west Africa reported feeling unwell and is believed to be showing symptoms of the virus.In a statement, Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust confirmed it was caring for a patient who was being tested for ebola.

Cafferkey is the second person to be treated for Ebola in Britain after Pooley, who recovered and has since returned to Sierra Leone.

FELICITY FITZGERALD, 32, IS A VOLUNTEER PAEDIATRICIAN IN SIERRA LEONE. HER EDITED DIARY REVEALS LIFE ON THE EBOLA FRONTLINE

DAY 1 I’m writing this somewhere over Morocco and my stomach is tied in little knots of excitement and just a hint of trepidation. I’m en route to the ebola isolation unit in Connaught Hospital, Freetown.

After a year of happily ­living in PhD-land, I’m hurling myself into the biggest outbreak ever of a virus the very name of which makes people blanch. Bonkers.

And yet there isn’t anywhere else in the world I should be. I’ve always hero-worshipped volunteers for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and other crisis-response NGOs and wondered if I’d have the guts to go.

Furthermore, this is my field: bugs, viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. I’m single, with no children, my only dependents being my pot plants, and I am not currently on a clinical rotation.

I knew my family would be supportive, albeit rather anxiously. This was what struck me two months ago when I ­initially thought of volunteering: who else should be staffing these treatment centres but people like me?

This is potentially one of the most important events in the field of infectious diseases that will occur in my lifetime.

Though when the idea first came to me it wasn’t without a hearty dose of fear. One ­colleague asked me if I felt like I was “going over the top”. But the more I read about ebola the less scared I became. This is a virus after all, not black magic.

A horrific virus that has been laying waste to three countries but a virus that can be contained. This is the ­resounding message I’ve heard from healthcare workers out there and those returning.

We have to scale up treatment centres, to offer effective care to sufferers and, crucially, to separate the infected from uninfected. Every day there are victims unable to ­access a treatment centre is a day the virus will win. But the overriding mood among those working in the outbreak is not despair or fear but determination to get things done.

The weeks ahead will be gruelling, heartbreaking and hugely physically demanding. I’m sure I will live to regret a facetious comment that my hot-yoga addiction will prepare me for the sweatbox of personal protective equipment (PPE).

That said, I know I will hate leaving in five weeks and be eager to return as soon as I can. Sorry, Mum.

DAY 3 I reek of chlorine. It is the first thing I smell when I wake up, and when I move I waft of swimming pools. I’m beginning to wonder if I’ll ever smell of anything else.

And yet it is comforting, as no damn filovirus is getting past my 1:10 chlorine. Chlorine is now a way of life in Sierra Leone — not only for those working with ebola patients, but at the door of every shop and cafe, even at road blocks. In fact, pretty much the whole of Freetown now smells of it.

In the isolation unit the odour almost overpowers all the less sanitary smells that go with such sick patients.

I have been learning the complicated dance of donning and doffing PPE, during which your hands get dunked in chlorine at least 10 times, more if you’re feeling particularly paranoid. Each dunking feels like added protection against any particles lurking on your gloves but chlorine burns are an unexpected occupational hazard. Yikes, they sting!

Another unexpected hurdle has been adjusting to having no physical contact with anyone. When I instinctively move towards someone to shake hands, welcoming smiles become slightly fixed grimaces and people recoil, as you would from a snotty child or muddy dog. Some work around this by knocking ­elbows — a greeting termed an “elbowla”. Dark humour is a saving grace here. I have been welcomed as a “Pikin Doctor” (paediatrician) with huge smiles and laughter. Cries of “Hey Pikin Doctor” follow me through the hospital.

The enthusiasm is a little unnerving. Yes, I am a paediatrician, but before arriving here my experience of managing children with ebola was minimal (read: non-existent).

The gruelling physicality of shifts in the unit would put any boot camp to shame, and time off is mostly spent writing protocols, making plans, debating what is feasible in such a setting, and reminding ourselves that we really should talk about something other than ebola.

I’ve only been here a few days and am pretty tired. My admiration is enormous for local workers and those who’ve been here since the outbreak began.

The expressions of extreme terror of those dying of the disease will always haunt me.

I’ve never seen anything like it before. They are suffering personified. Anything we can do to try to mitigate the horrors justifies any amount of sweat, toil and burnt hands.

DAY 9 A wonderful thing happened today. I was able to give a patient in our unit the news that he tested negative for ebola and was free to go home.

He leapt out of bed, danced for joy, and praised the Lord and us — and even, mortifyingly, bowed to our PPE-clad feet. Throughout the unit we could hear him singing. I’m not the only one who got a bit weepy.

And yet there was a spectre at the feast.

The way the system works is that when you ­attend a healthcare unit, you are immediately screened for symptoms of ebola — fever plus abdominal pain, vomiting, headache and so on.

The symptoms are pretty non-specific and can signify anything from malaria to flu. If there is any suspicion of ebola, you are admitted to an isolation unit, beds permitting, to be tested. And there you are kept until the results are available. This is meant to be within 24 hours, but can be up to eight days.

Patients who test positive are then transferred to treatment centres such as those run by MSF, and negative patients are either discharged home or to the hospital, depending on how sick they are.

The delay means that those who turn out to be negative, such as our elated singing man, may be in beds next to positive patients, with profuse diarrhoea, vomiting and even bleeding.

Patients are separated from each other by a wall of plastic sheeting; we use chlorine to decontaminate our gloved hands between patients; they are told not to leave their bed.

But we just don’t know yet how many people will actually be infected by being admitted. I’m dreading the prospect of him returning.

Unsurprisingly, emotions run high here. Joy and despair walk hand in hand as do the comical and sinister.

Hiccups, for example. I hiccup a lot and have always found it an excuse to giggle. However, hiccups are a feature of ebola — appearing quite late in the disease. Suddenly, they’re a lot less funny.

Similarly, in wonderful ­Sierra Leone style, our drive to work yesterday was halted by an impromptu road block. Five cool teenagers were filming a hip-hop video.

Today we stopped in almost the same place, held up by a crowd who also seemed to be singing. It took a minute to recognise this as the keening sound of grief — and to spot the menacing Darth Vader figures of the burial team removing a corpse from a house.

Freetown feels like a city on a knife-edge. Hilarity and nervous energy overlying an undercurrent of constant anxiety and an insidious, invisible killer. And yet life goes on. Hope the video makes it to YouTube.

DAY 11 A few months ago I read a blog of an MSF volunteer who found himself shouting over the beautiful jungled canopy of Sierra Leone, “Where is everybody?”.

Today, four months after the World Health Organisation declared an international emergency, I did the same thing.

I had gritted teeth and clenched fists and it came out as more of a squeak, but my fury and ­incomprehension echoed his.

I always knew I would find it frustrating being unable to provide the sophisticated care I would like, but this isn’t only about the unavailability of ­intensive care units and machines.

This isn’t only about watching young people die in a terrible way and being able to offer nothing but words of comfort in badly accented Krio.

This is about people dying in triage tents with no access to any kind of medical therapy as there are no beds available.

This is about having to put desperately sick people in ambulances for five hours, as that is the nearest treatment centre with space.

This is about how the world knew that a nightmarish plague had hit West Africa, waited more than six months and then sang a song about it.

Of course, I know that many agencies are contributing and working as fast as they can, and that there are some who have been campaigning for months.

I can’t imagine how much more frustrated they must be. Perhaps during my time here progress will be made.

There are many dreadful things about the ebola ­epidemic — the suffering, the squalor and the undercurrent of fear that you could be next.

For me, at this point, by far the most terrifying thought is that nothing will change and the status-quo of international ­turpitude will continue.

DAY 16 Yesterday I nearly spread-eagled over a corpse we were lifting out of a car (wellies and floors covered in chlorine are an occupational hazard), but was saved by a colleague who is an ebola survivor. Gratitude ensued until we got outside, changed back into our normal clothes and he said, “Wow, Flic, is that an under-boob sweat patch?” Yes. Yes, it is. Suddenly a lot less grateful.

Sweat, like chlorine, is a way of life. It can get in your eyes and impede the one method of normal body ­language you have left — eye contact.

As a paediatrician I find this particularly challenging, as my normal methods of putting children at ease are out of bounds — no pulling faces, no peekaboo (can’t be waving ­potentially contaminated gloves near your visor) and, sadly, very little body contact, as children have a tendency to grab things.

In treatment centres where everyone is confirmed positive, some of the better patients assist in looking after children, which is a wonderful boon.

We put a four-year-old boy in an ambulance with a relatively well old lady, handing her oral rehydration salts and asking her to make sure he drank on the journey.

He beamed with delight and stretched out his arms to the first normal-looking person offering him a drink in two days.

Top of my wishlist for paediatric ebola patients is for survivors to look after them in the unit.These children are going through enough not to be terrorised by faceless figures in white suits — and the singing silly Pikin Doctor in me will have to remain ­suppressed for now.

A NURSE who was diagnosed with Ebola after returning to the UK from Sierra Leone is set to be treated with an experimental anti-viral drug.

PAULINE Cafferkey, a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire, is receiving specialist treatment in a quarantine tent at the Royal Free Hospital in north London after initially flying home to Glasgow.

Dr Michael Jacobs said Ms Cafferkey was being treated with convalescent plasma taken from the blood of a recovered patient and an experimental anti-viral drug which is "not proven to work".

He said: "She is sitting up and talking. She is able to read. She's been eating a bit, drinking and she's been in communication with her family, which has been really nice.

"She's as well as we can hope for at this stage of the illness.

"She's had the treatment, it's gone very smoothly, no side-effects at all."

Dr Jacobs said the hospital was unable to obtain ZMapp, the drug used to treat fellow British volunteer nurse William Pooley, who recovered, because "there is none in the world at the moment".

"Although it's been used in a handful of patients, we simply don't know if ZMapp works and is of benefit to patients," he said.

East Lancashire medics on Ebola alert

MEDICAL bosses are reassuring East Lancashire residents that they have contingency plans in place should there be an Ebola outbreak in the area.

It comes after health worker Pauline Cafferkey was confirmed as the first person in the UK to be infected with the virus after she returned to Glasgow from Sierra Leone. She is now receiving treatment in a specialist centre in London.

Ian Stanley, acting executive medical director at the East Lancashire Hospitals Trust, said should a case be discovered, in the region, plans were in place.

He said: “Our plan follows the national guidelines that have come from the government and their World Health Organisation partners. “Trust staff have been briefed on what they should do and are prepared to respond if necessary.

“We remind the public that, for Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed. As such, the risk to the general UK population remains very low.”

To catch Ebola, which has reached epidemic proportions in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, you need to make direct contact with the body fluids of someone who has Ebola and is also sick and showing symptoms.

Symptoms include fever, sore throat, muscle pain and headaches, which are generally followed by vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. The trust has given training on how to put on protective equipment in the case of dealing with an Ebola patient to staff in the emergency department and the urgent care centre.

The hospitals’ lead clinicians have also been working in the laboratory and with domestics.

Information posters on Ebola are displayed in all UCCs, A&E, the medical assessment unit, the ambulatory care departments, X-Ray and all of the outpatients clinics.

Sister Cathy Fallon, who works in the emergency department at Royal Blackburn Hospital, spent Christmas with a contingent of NHS volunteers, who travelled to West Africa to help those with the Ebola virus. And Major Kathleen Higgins, from Brierfield, an Army reservist and NHS nurse, was also set to fly to Sierra Leone to help with the fight.

Hunt for passengers on UK’s ebola plane

THE Scottish government was trying to contact passengers who shared a flight with the UK’s first ebola patient – a female healthcare worker who picked up the deadly disease in Sierra Leone.

The patient, who is now in isolation in a specialist infectious disease unit in Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow, flew back through Casablanca, Morrocco, and London’s busy Heathrow airport on her way to Glasgow.

She arrived at 11.30pm Sunday. She went to hospital with ebola symptoms early Monday morning and was isolated at 7.50am.

The Scottish government was frantically trying to contact the 71 other people on board the British Airways flight from London to Glasgow, but suggested there was “negligible risk” as the patient “displayed no symptoms” of ebola, even though she became ill so soon after arrival.

“Our first thoughts at this time must be with the patient diagnosed with ebola and their friends and family. I wish them a speedy recovery,” a government spokesman said. “Scotland has pre-pared for this possibility from the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa and I am confident we are well prepared.” A government statement said NHS Scotland infectious diseases procedures had been put into effect.

“All possible contacts with the patient are now being ­investigated and anyone deemed to be at risk will be contacted and closely monitored,” a Scottish government spokesman said.

“However, having been ­diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness, the risk to others is considered extrem-ely low.” A British Airways spokesman said the airline was working closely with the health authorities in England and Scotland and would offer assistance with any information they require.

The spokesman said anyone on the flight, BA 1478, should contact the government through a special hotline. “The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low,” the airline said.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said “all measures would be taken to protect public health”.In Sierra Leone a five-day Christmas lockdown aimed at preventing new infections ended on Monday. Officials did not reveal if the lockdown was successful, but the Nat-ional Ebola Response Centre reported 21 new cases in the nation’s eastern Kono District on December 26 and 27.

First case of Ebola arrives in Britain

An NHS worker who has been diagnosed with Ebola after returning to Glasgow from Sierra Leone has arrived in London for specialist treatment.

The woman, who had been working in Sierra Leone with Save the Children, has been in isolation in hospital in Glasgow since yesterday morning and is in a stable condition.

She arrived at the Royal Free Hospital in north London in an RAF truck accompanied by police cars.

She flew back to the UK via Casablanca in Morocco and London Heathrow, arriving at Glasgow Airport at around 11.30pm on Sunday on a British Airways flight.

MORE TOP STORIES:

She was admitted to hospital early yesterday morning after feeling feverish and was placed into isolation in the Brownlee Unit for Infectious Diseases at the city's Gartnavel Hospital at 7.50am.

She was transferred from Glasgow Airport on a military-style plane in a quarantine tent surrounded by a group of health workers in full protection suits, bound for London.

Meanwhile, two more people who have been in West Africa were being tested for Ebola, one in Scotland and one in Cornwall.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish patient was another health care worker who had recently returned from the region.

The Cornish patient has been placed in isolation at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske, Truro.

It is understood the patient, who attended the hospital this morning, recently returned from a country affected by an outbreak of the virus.

In a joint statement, the hospital and Public Health England said: "A patient has been admitted to Royal Cornwall Hospital and is currently undergoing a series of tests - one of which is for Ebola.

"We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation, following nationally-agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients.

"Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust has been following national guidance around Ebola and made plans in line with advice from Public Health England and NHS England."

It is understood the Scottish patient who is being tested had been staying at a youth hostel in the Highlands and was being transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland: "I should stress that, although this is another returning healthcare worker from West Africa, the patient here, as far as we are aware, has had no direct contact with people infected with Ebola, so it is a case that is being described as low probability.

"But we are operating, given the seriousness of Ebola, on a highly precautionary basis and that's why this patient over the course of today will be transferred for tests."

Around 100 have been tested for Ebola in hospitals across England this year so far.

The NHS worker is the second Briton to test positive and first to do so on UK soil.

Nurse William Pooley, 29, contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone in August before getting the all-clear following treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

He returned to Sierra Leone last month to continue treating patients in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff.

Most of the people tested for Ebola had visited west Africa.

Health officials are tracing the 71 people who were on the British Airways flight from London to Glasgow with the woman who has the virus and passengers on the flight from Casablanca to Heathrow.

Ms Sturgeon said the risk to the general public is "extremely low to the point of negligible".

Apart from the other passengers on the flight and hospital staff the patient is thought to have had contact with only one other person in Scotland, who is being contacted.

Ms Sturgeon said: "Given the early stage of the diagnosis, the patient was displaying no symptoms of the kind that would lead to onward transmission and put other people at risk before she reported as being unwell."

The woman had been working with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre at Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, Michael von Bertele, Save the Children humanitarian director, said: "Our thoughts are with the individual, their family and colleagues at this difficult time. We wish them a speedy recovery.

"Save the Children is working closely with the UK Government, Scottish Government and Public Health England to look into the circumstances surrounding the case."

Health Protection England said the healthcare worker left Sierra Leone on Sunday and was a passenger on flight AT596 from Freetown to Casablanca, flight AT0800 from Casablanca to London, and transferred at Heathrow to flight BA1478 for onward travel to Glasgow.

It said the risk of infection to other passengers on the flights is considered extremely low but, as a precaution, it is arranging for all passengers and crew on the flight from Casablanca to Heathrow to be provided with health information and will be contacting and following up those passengers who were sitting near the affected passenger on these flights.

Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, said the NHS worker with the virus, one of dozens of British volunteers helping fight the disease, was "a very brave person".

He added that the woman was admitted to hospital in the early hours of the morning, shortly after arriving home from Sierra Leone the previous evening, and she had not exhibited any severe symptoms of the disease, meaning there was a low risk of transmission to other passengers.

"The most important thing to remember about Ebola is it is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids - diarrhoea, blood or vomit.

"She only had a fever and when people have a fever they do not transmit the virus. We believe the risk to the public is low."

The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust confirmed that she had arrived this morning and was being treated for Ebola at the high level isolation unit.

The Queen praised medical staff fighting the Ebola outbreak in her traditional Christmas message, saying she had been "deeply touched" by their "selflessness".

The UK is one of a number of nations that has seen its doctors and nurses volunteer to help countries such as Sierra Leone combat the epidemic, which has claimed over 7,000 lives.

After chairing a meeting of the Whitehall Cobra contingencies committee in London yesterday following news of the Scottish case, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there would be a review of the "procedures and protocols" adopted by NHS workers and other government staff working in Sierra Leone.

He said the Government was doing "absolutely everything it needs to" to keep the public safe and that the measures it had put in place were working well.

Professor Paul Cosford, director for health protection for Public Health England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It is important to understand that the way the Ebola virus is transmitted is through contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is seriously ill... Blood or diarrhoea in particular.

"This particular individual has symptoms of fever but she did not have the symptoms that make us worried about transmission before she was in the isolation facility in Glasgow.

"So we are confident the risk to others is low but obviously as a precaution we are making contact with the people who were on the flight into Heathrow with her and on the flight from Heathrow to Glasgow.

"We are never complacent about those things so we want to be absolutely certain those people who will naturally be concerned they may have been on the flight with this individual have contact from us to give them that reassurance.

"We are making a specific effort to identify those who were sitting in the immediate vicinity on the flight so we can give them particular assurance and also on a very precautionary basis make sure they know what symptoms you would look out for if there was any concern at all and also where to contact if they have those symptoms.

"But I would emphasise the risk is extremely low to anybody else outside of the hospital treating her."

IN A YEAR OVERSHADOWED BY COLLAPSING COMMODITY PRICES, EBOLA OUTBREAKS, TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BUDGET DEADLOCKS, BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE AWARDS FOR THOSE WHO ACHIEVED AND UNDER-ACHIEVED IN THE TOP END OF TOWN.

ASX-LISTED ROOSTER TURNED FEATHER DUSTER VOCATION LIMITED It did not take long for the vocational education provider Vocation Limited to metamorphosise from market darling to market dog. In September, the month its shares hit an all-time high of $3.40, Vocation rejected speculation a review of its contracts with the Victorian Government would hurt its profits.

Then in late October, came the admission it might. “Up until last week when we entered a trading halt it was the opinion of the board and management the impact would be immaterial based on the advice of a very experienced Victorian management team and independent Victorian advisers,’’ said Vocation’s chief executive Mark Hutchinson triggering a share price collapse. Chairman, the former Labor politician John Dawkins soon after resigned and another massive profit downgrade came in December. To cap it off, the company on Christmas Eve said it would not be paying any interim dividend and warned of massive writedowns in its first half results. Its shares last traded at 19 cents a pop.

MOST PUBLIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN A CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE JAMES PACKER AND DAVID GYNGELL Chairmen and chief executives usually like to argue behind closed doors. This was not the case with the Crown chairman and Nine Network boss who decided to have a brawl out the front of the billionaire’s Bondi pad. The two, who grew up around the mean streets of Bellevue Hill, allowed themselves to be photographed together in several aggressive poses. Rather than just being a case of good ole rough and tumble, it is believed the two had a disagreement over something.

TIMID REGULATOR OF THE YEAR AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION The same Senate Inquiry that slammed the Commonwealth Bank was equally scathing of the corporate regulator over its handling of the Commonwealth Financial Planning scandal. It found the Greg Medcraft-chaired ASIC was a “timid, hesitant regulator, too ready and willing to accept uncritically the assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for ASIC’s concerns or intervention”.

MOST POSITIVE SPIN ON AN $63 MILLION LOSS MARK ROWSTHORN “I’m not going to pretend FY14 hasn’t been a challenging year for our organisation, but I’m pleased to report that the financial strength of the business has been restored and that we are looking toward real growth rather than just ‘recovery’,” said the chief executive of the floundering transport company McAleese. McAleese reported a $63 million full-year loss, well off its prospectus forecasts of a $36.5 million net profit. Since its November 2013 listing, shares in McAleese, which owns the troubled fuel transportation company Cootes, have fallen from $1.47 to 18 cents.

SONG OF THE YEAR BEST DAY OF MY LIFE Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey was forced to defend playing the American Authors song in his offices after delivering one of the most controversial Federal Budgets in living memory. He explained he played it because it is son Xavier’s favourite song, who he hadn’t seen for three weeks.

PAY PACKET OF THE YEAR DAVID GYNGELL On top of his street-fighting skills, the Nine Entertainment chief executive wowed the media world with his $19.6 million in remuneration for the 12 months to June 30. This included $2.7 million in base pay, a $2.7 cash bonus, $2.5 million in bonuses related to Nine’s listing on the sharemarket, and $11.6 million of share rights and incentives.

ATTEMPTED COMEBACK OF 2014 BILL IRELAND The former high-flying founder of the financial services group Challenger and the imploded Mariner Financial remerged from bankruptcy with plans to raise up to $7 million to fund the backdoor listing of his Voyager Global Group. But seems Ireland, who is a “consultant” to Voyager, is finding it hard to whip up much enthusiasm in his new venture, with the offer being extended twice after failing to raise the minimum $3 million. It has been extended into 2015.

BEST NICKNAME FOR A CHIEF EXECUTIVE PELICAN South Sydney Rabbitohs part-owner Russell Crowe did not take to well to a Biz Con report that the chief executive of the club’s sponsor Crown Resorts was expecting them to lose the grand final against the Bulldogs. “Rowen Craigie needs to start looking for another job. You pelican,” tweeted the film star. Despite telling Biz Con he expected Souths not to have a fairytale end to the NRL season, Crown boss Craigie told the Telegraph the next day: “Comments I made before the match about a Canterbury upset were just a reference to a possible upset given Hawthorn’s victory over the Swans last week.” Days later Crown chairman James Packer bought into the premiership club.

CORPORATE MOUSTACHE OF THE YEAR IAN SILK The Australian Super chief executive for the past eight years retained his stranglehold on the gong without a challenger in sight. It is believed Silk is planning major renovations to his moustache in the new year.

MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD ADVICE FOR A BOARD AT AGM BRENT KERMODE The son of Cabcharge founder and former executive chairman Reg Kermode had some advice for the company’s board at its annual meeting, where the shareholder activist Stephen Mayne was unsuccessful in his bid to get elected as a director.

“I’d just like to say that in terms of the board for Cabcharge that they should adopt a no-dickhead policy,’’ he pleaded from the floor of the meeting.

MOST SUDDEN RESIGNATION OF A DIRECTOR ROD GILMOUR Cabcharge announced the sudden resignation of its non-executive director just hours before he was due to stand for election at the company’s annual meeting. Chairman Russell Balding declined to say whether the resignation related to Gilmour not securing enough votes. “The fact that the resolution has been withdrawn, I don’t feel there’s need to comment or provide any information in that regard,’’ Balding told the meeting.

THE BENJAMIN BUTTON DIRECTOR OF THE YEAR LEN AINSWORTH The 91-year-old Ainsworth Game Technology chairman and founder became the oldest director of an ASX 200 company to be re-elected as a director at his company’s November annual meeting. “Don’t let my age fool you. I’m very active. I’ve still got my wits about me,’’ Ainsworth told Biz Con.

PROMISE OF THE YEAR GORDON CAIRNS At his last shareholders meeting as David Jones chairman, Gordon Cairns was quizzed if the department store’s South African takeover suitors Woolworths would ditch the piano player on the floor of its Elizabeth Street store. Cairns said he would bring the matter up with Woolworths chief executive Ian Moir to ensure the “pianist was part of his development plans for the future”. “And this is from someone who is tone deaf,” said Cairns.

MOST LONG-WINDED REASON FOR A CAPITAL RAISING MAVERICK DRILLING The oil and gas explorer raised $20.4 million at the start of the year partly to help pay the salaries of the raft of executives it had hired, including BHP Billiton’s former head of petroleum Mike Yeager who was appointed its chief executive in late 2013. The company explained: “The proceeds of the placement will be used principally to fund the human resource talent and infrastructure required by Maverick to enhance the company’s oil and gas technical capability and better position it to assess, develop and execute future oil and gas opportunities.”

MOST SURPRISING RESIGNATION STUART GRIMSHAW The rising star stunned the banking community when he resigned as the chief executive of Bank of Queensland in August to take up a role heading a US pawn shop group EZCorp. The US-listed business controlled by the secretive Australian-born private equity investor Phillip Ean Cohen reported a $US45.7 million loss for the year to September 30.

MOST FIERY ANNUAL MEETING SPEECH LEN GILL The chairman of Metgasco, which had its coal seam gas operations halted by the NSW Energy Minister Anthony Roberts in early 2013, let fly at the company’s annual meeting. “Your company has been badly impacted by the ‘shifting sands’ and delays resulting from a period of effective moratorium and numerous government policy and regulatory changes. These have, in our view, created substantial sovereign risk in NSW,” Gill told the company’s annual meeting.

MOST SURPRISING PASSION FOR PAPERCLIPS SAM WALSH The Rio Tinto chief executive put his work commitments on hold to give the keynote address at a procurement conference in Sydney. ‘’It is great to be here today,’’ he told the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply conference. “I ask you: what more could someone want from life? I believe I’ve been blessed, starting with a solid grounding in procurement,’’ said Walsh who started his career as a trainee buyer at General Motors.

SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY AWARD WESTFIELD RETAIL TRUST Westfield Retail, the half owner of 46 Australasian shopping centres, adjourned the vote on its proposed merger with Westfield Group’s Australasian operations to form Scentre. Westfield Retail chairman Dick Warburton adjourned the shareholder meeting in late May after the group only gained 74 per cent support, short of the 75 per cent required for the deal to go ahead.

He explained the meeting to be adjourned because of Westfield’s Group revealing it would offload its half-stake even if Westfield Trust blocked the merger proposal. Westfield Trust then launched an advertising blitz to convince shareholders of the merits of the proposed deal. Seemed to do the trick with the vote just getting over the line when the meeting resumed three weeks later.

MOST GROVELLING APOLOGY IAN NAREV “To all the customers who received poor advice I apologise unreservedly. We are truly sorry and we acknowledge the financial hardship that you suffered as a result of the poor advice,’’ said the Commonwealth Bank chief executive in July. This was after a Senate Inquiry found the bank had allowed “unscrupulous advisers to continue operating” in its Commonwealth Financial Planning arm.

MOST UPBEAT MULTI-BILLION LOSS QANTAS The Flying Kangaroo punched above its weight in the world of aviation when it posted a $2.84 billion full-year loss in August, one the biggest losses ever by an airline anywhere in the world. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce was still looking for a silver lining. “We believe the worst is over for us now,’’ he said. That certainly seemed to be the case by the end of the year, with Qantas’s share price hitting a four-year high thanks partly to falling oil prices and signs of easing competition from Virgin Australia.

MOST MEMORABLE ON-AIR SPRAY ON AN ASX-LISTED COMPANY CHAIRMAN JOHN SINGLETON The Macquarie Radio Network majority owner shared his thoughts on Fairfax Media chairman Roger Corbett after merger talks between the two broke down early in 2014.

Singo in a chat with 2GB host Alan Jones: “If you are a proper chairman, a decent human being, not a precocious, pretentious pr.. k — I apologise for that word — precocious, pretentious little whipper snapper like Roger Corbett.

“Roger wants to be chairman. Give the little bloke his chairmanship … he’s only got a year to go and then he can be president of the Avoca bowling club or rotary or something, some self-important, pompous, puffed-up job for him.”

MOST MEMORABLE ON-AIR SPRAY ON AN ASX-LISTED COMPANY CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN SINGLETON In the same radio interview, Singo labelled Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood an idiot.

“He doesn’t know what he’s doing so he just hires consultants to tell him what to do. Obviously he does nothing except do what they tell him.”

THE WHERE’S WALLY DIRECTOR OF THE YEAR AWARD GINA RINEHART Ten Network disclosed in its annual report that its now former independent director (but still major shareholder) attended none of the television network’s 11 board meetings in the year to August 31. The iron ore billionaire resigned as a director in October after serving close to four years on the board.

BEST ROASTING AT AN AGM HELD ON THE GOLD COAST BERYL SMITH The 87-year-old “high roller” Beryl Smith took the Echo chairman John O’Neill and his board to task for not having enough non-smoking areas at Jupiters casino on the Gold Coast.

“Sydney also has a high-roller non-smoking room and another high-roller room for smokers. You wouldn’t think that the three casinos all belonged to the same company,’’ blasted Beryl.

THE “GONNA DO” AWARD FOR 2014 CLIVE PALMER The alleged billionaire and professor flagged plans in August for a new national newspaper. More than a year after he registered the business name, Palmer tweeted News Corp “could have a New Australian newspaper competitor as I’ve registered the trademark Australasian Times”. The federal member for Fairfax’s other business ventures yet to see the light of day include the Deng Xiaoping Memorial Challenge Pty Ltd and the cruiseliner the Titanic 2.

MOST EXCITABLE LAUNCH OF AN INITIATIVE BY A ABBOTT GOVERNMENT MINISTER BRUCE BILLSONThe Federal Minister for Small Business could barely contain his excitement over the launch of a ‘’free of charge” webinar and business mentoring initiative in July comparing it to the most famous rock concert of all time. “This would be like the Woodstock of entrepreneurship. Everyone will say they were here today. Everybody,’’ Billson told the audience of 100-odd people at the launch of Start-Up Australia. “It will be 4000 people squeezed into this room and saying -’I was there’. This is such an important time,’’ he said. “Today is truly a great day. A great day.”

AS the world celebrated the holiday season, Sierra Leone’s government declared a five-day lockdown in the nation’s north to step up efforts to contain the ebola epidemic.

The lockdown meant no religious services could be held, although an exception was made for the country’s Christians on Christmas Day.

“The lockdown is designed to intensify the containment of the ebola virus. We are working to break the chain of transmission,’’ a spokesman said.

Ebola has killed more than 7500 people in west Africa.

Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are the three nations worst hit by the epidemic, and Sierra Leone has recently overtaken Liberia as the country with the highest number of ebola infections.

Shops and markets would be closed throughout the containment period and “no unauthorised vehicles or ­motorcycle taxis” would be ­allowed to drive around — except those officially assigned to ebola-related assignments”.

“Key objectives” included allowing health workers to identify patients. Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency after the ebola outbreak on July 31 and imposed restrictions on the movement of people.

As of yesterday six of the country’s 14 departments had these restrictions in place.On December 12 the government announced a restriction on large Christmas and New Year gatherings.

Bishop of Blackburn: Terrible troubles of the world need spiritual solutions

AS I look back over the past year, it seems that certain news items keep repeating themselves.

The threat of unpredictable terrorist attacks is ever present.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Examples of violent power struggles continue to put innocent lives in danger, most recently and very tragically in Pakistan, but also in the Middle East, Ukraine and parts of Africa.

It has been tough to contain the spread of Ebola in West Africa.

And there has been a string of cases of sexual abuse by people held in respect in our society.

It does not make for a pretty picture of the kind of world we live in and shows the kind of potential that human nature has for evil and doing terrible things to others.

But this view of how things are emphasises we are in a world far removed from what God originally intended and for which some radical action is necessary. And that is what we celebrate at Christmas.

God, the Creator of all things, saw the mess and confusion that humankind has made of His good creation, by leaving Him out of the picture and trying to live independently of Him.

His rescue plan involved His arrival in the form of a human, leading to His remarkable three-year ministry and culminating in His planned and purposeful sacrificial death on a cross. It was there, even though He had done no wrong, that He bore the consequences of all the wrong in the world, so that those who turn to Him might know His forgiveness and allow Him His rightful place in their life.

Christianity is a faith about a change of heart. As that new beginning with God at the centre takes place, so people and communities change, the Kingdom and rule of God in human life is more evident and the world begins to return to what God originally meant life on Earth to be. Christians believe that hope for the world to be a better place does not depend on anything other than a restored relationship with God.

The birth of Jesus Christ shows God’s initiative and desire and provision for that to be the case.

There is no getting away from the fact that the solution to the problems in the world is a spiritual one — and I am not ashamed to say so.

I wish you all a joyful Christmas.

Canon SUE PENFOLD: Christmas wishes don’t have to be reserved for what present we want

IT’S that time of year – when children are asked what they want for Christmas, or what Santa will bring.

It’s an exciting time, full of anticipation. It can be lovely for children – but how is it for grown-ups? For parents it can be tricky responding to children’s wishes – cost can be an enormous issue, but so too can the practical issues (no dear, we can’t keep a reindeer in the back garden.) So what do grown-ups want? Does anyone ever ask us? Of course they do, and we have to think whether this year we’d like a new pair of slippers or a cookery book.

Most of us are long past the age of asking for the impossible. And yet, somewhere deep down inside we do have things we long for, even if some of them do seem improbable.

Maybe we want health, or restored relationships, or a world without Ebola, foodbanks, violence or war.

Those aren’t things that would fit on Santa’s sleigh, let alone in a stocking, but the world would be infinitely poorer if we didn’t want such things.

What do we do with our longings for our world to be put right? Do we just ignore them because they seem impossible?

The answer to what we do with our wishes might lie in the Christian season of Advent. This time before Christmas isn’t just time to get on with the shopping and see how many Christmas dinners we can fit in. Advent is traditionally the time to look forward, not just to Christmas, but to Jesus’ return in glory, as king and judge.

When I was a child I thought that was an event to be feared – ‘judge’ sounds scary!

As a young adult it all seemed a bit improbable and irrelevant. But now it begins to make sense. If our deepest wishes are for our world to be put right it’s probably beyond us, and we need God to act. And if God will act, then we know that our deepest wishes aren’t just wild, improbable dreams but wishes that will one day come true.

And if our wishes can be fulfilled, then we don’t just sit and do nothing while we wait – we get on and do our tiny little bit towards making our deepest wishes come true.

HOSPITAL staff have been undergoing training so they are prepared if Ebola reaches East Lancashire.

East Lancashire NHS Hospitals Trust has already given training to emergency department and urgent care centre nursing and medical staff, as well as its lead clinicians, and is about to start in the laboratory and with domestic staff.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Information posters on Ebola have also gone on display in all urgent care centres, emergency department, the medical assessment unit and ambulatory care departments, X-ray and all outpatients clinics.

Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe infection in humans and non-human primates caused by Ebola virus.

It is a filovirus that was first recognised in 1976, and has caused sporadic outbreaks since in several African countries.

So far 10,000 cases of Ebola have been recorded in the current outbreak, and up to 50 per cent of patients have died, making it the worst Ebola epidemic in history.

There is no known cure, and in an age of extensive global travel, NHS staff have been warned to be mindful and vigilant of patients visiting NHS facilities with Ebola-type symptoms.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat, and muscle weakness. No imported case of Ebola has ever occurred in the UK, but patients who have travelled to West African countries including Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia could be at risk.

Staff have been warned to isolate patients who may be infected, and contact specialist infectious diseases teams.

They have been warned not to touch suspected Ebola patients, and protective equipment has been made available in the case of dealing with an Ebola patient.

Ian Stanley, (acting) executive medical director, said: “East Lancashire Hospital Trust has a contingency plan in place if there is an Ebola outbreak in the area.

“Our plan will follow the national guidelines that have come from the government and their world health organisation partners.

“Trust staff are being briefed on what they should do and are prepared to respond if necessary.”

ONE of Sierra Leone's top doctors, Victor Willoughby, is the country's 12th physician to become infected with the Ebola virus.

VICTOR Willoughby is the country's 12th physician to become infected, 10 of whom have died.

Government Chief Medical Officer Dr Brima Kargbo confirmed on Sunday Willoughby had tested positive for Ebola.

Nearly 1800 people have died from Ebola this year in Sierra Leone amid the regional epidemic.

Doctors and nurses have been especially vulnerable because the disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick.

Junior doctors in Sierra Leone last week launched a strike to demand better medical treatment for health workers who contract the disease.

Kargbo also said on Sunday that skeleton crews had returned to aid the senior doctors.

East Lancashire nurse set to fight Ebola in Africa this Christmas

A BRIERFIELD nurse is flying out to Sierra Leone to help the British Army in its fight against Ebola.

Major Kathleen Higgins is an NHS nurse, but is also an army reservist who serves with the 207 field hospital.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Major Higgins has been called up to join in the army’s humanitarian effort, and will be packing her bags and setting off to West Africa in the week before Christmas.

She will spend Christmas in Sierra Leone, and will be in post for approximately two months.

Major Higgins will be working in the viral treatment centre, looking after military and non-military healthcare professionals who have confirmed or suspected Ebola.

She said she does not fear for her own safety, as she has undergone extensive training in preparation for her departure.

Major Higgins said: “The risk is absolutely minimal if all the drills are performed properly.

“We’ve been training and retraining.

“It’s a contact disease, and you have to be in contact with bodily fluids to contract it.”

Major Higgins, who is 51 and lives in Brierfield, has been an army reservist on-and-off for thirty years.

She first joined up at the age of 17, but took some time out when she had her son, Duane, who is now 29-years-old, and has also served in the army.

Her husband Andrew is also an army reservist, so is very supportive of her posting to Africa.

Major Higgins said her motivation to join the reservists stemmed from a family connection to the forces, and a desire to help others.

She said: “I’m from a military background, and it’s something I’ve always had an interest in.

“It’s the combination between being a healthcare professional, and having military involvement.”

Major Higgins has previously served abroad in Afghanistan, in a field hospital in Camp Bastion in 2010 and 2011, but she said her posting to Africa will be very different, as she will not be working in a conflict situation.

She said: “It’s humanitarian rather than conflict, which gives it that bit more purpose.

“I’ve been in Afghanistan looking after patients that had had traumatic injuries, but this is very different, it’s a humanitarian response to the Ebola crisis.”

The NHS will be compensated by the army for the time Major Higgins takes away from her job in Southport, and she believes her time in Africa will prove invaluable in her day job.

She said: “I’ll come back with enhanced skills and experience.

“I’ve been compulsorily mobilised but I’m quite happy about it - This is what I joined the reservists to do, should the situation arise.”

Foreign aid takes a massive hit - again

AUSTRALIA'S foreign aid has been dealt a second massive blow this year with billions to be pulled from the program to fund national security.

IT'S unlikely Joe Hockey would appreciate being cast as a reverse Robin Hood, but that's the way charity groups see him after he announced another massive cut to the foreign aid budget.

The treasurer confirmed $3.7 billion would be slashed from aid over the next four years - the single largest source of savings unveiled in Monday's mid-year budget update.

It's a double whammy for the aid sector, which suffered a $7.6 billion blow in the federal budget a little over six months ago.

They were bracing for another hit this time around - but nothing on this scale.

"What we're seeing is acts of vandalism now," ActionAid executive director Archie Law told AAP.

The aid budget will now only increase with inflation and extra cash will not be made available until the nation's finances are back in the black.

Critics claim this will plunge aid spending back to Howard-era levels and equate to just 0.2 per cent of national income.

"This is the lowest ever level since records began in 1954 - when Queen Elizabeth II first visited Australia," Australian Council for International Development CEO Marc Purcell said in a statement.

CARE Australia boss Julia Newton-Howes said it was unacceptable a wealthy global citizen that chaired the G20 and the UN Security Council could ignore its obligations to those in need.

"We can't turn our back on problems like Ebola, on problems like global poverty, because if you ignore those problems they'll bite much harder," she told AAP.

Mr Hockey said the savings would offset $1.3 billion in new spending on national security, including $630 million to combat homegrown terrorism.

The government had worked hard to ensure the savings had no impact on the Australian economy, he said.

YES, it’s that time of year again. We all try to pretend that it’s fun but, really, Christmas is about as enjoyable as testing a giant festive Nutcracker doll on your testicles.

Yes, I could go on and on about the ridiculous carols every shopping centre plays to get you into the “mood” but make you feel like ramming a candy cane into your eardrum.

And I could bang on about the fact you have to spend Christmas with a bunch of people you spend the rest of year avoiding — your relatives. Can there be anything better than watching Uncle Dave bring along a six-pack of Foster’s Light Ice (the same six-pack he has brought for the past eight years, ­because they don’t even make that beer any more), stick it in the fridge and then drink your good stuff?

Except, perhaps, listening to Aunt Maud’s anecdotes about her infectious skin condition, bowel issues and other vomit-inducing ailments across the turkey? It’s enough to make you go all Northern Territory News and stick a cracker up your clacker. But these are just the entrees to the real horror of Christmas — the presents.

Sure, if you’re a kid then presents are great. Except those crappy Christmas jumpers that Gran insists on handing out and making you wear, so the kids can look like the rest of the dickhead relatives.

But if you’re an adult, then presents are just painful.

Everyone tries to get “creative” with presents when you’re an adult. Instead of giving you a gift card, or something genuinely useful, like a book, they ­decide what’s in order is a wacky gift, about as funny as ebola.

And then there are all of the stores so desperate to get in on the gift-giving that they market useless crap as ideal gifts.

I actually saw a facial hair remover being offered up as a perfect gift for the woman in your life. Yes, nothing says I love you like a not-so subtle suggestion she needs to lose the mo.

Or how about a vacuum cleaner? Truly, a present that sucks. Just like Christmas.Twitter: @DuncanLay

Christmas Day in a bio-hazard suit

AUSSIE VOLUNTEERS ARE SPENDING THE FESTIVE SEASON FIGHTING THE EBOLA BATTLE, WRITES MATTHEW BENNS

THE baby’s heartbroken parents did not want to let the tiny body go. “The family was distraught and the Red Cross workers found it extremely hard to convince the family to let go of the body for safe burial,” Australian Red Cross volunteer Michael Gloeckle said.

The tragic little baby was another victim of the ebola epidemic that has claimed more than 6000 lives and infected almost 20,000 people in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

“It’s just so sad to reflect that the baby’s death could have been prevented,” Mr Gloeckle, from northern NSW, told The Saturday Telegraph.

He is in the Liberian capital Monrovia to educate and co-ordinate safe burials in the stricken country.

Mr Gloeckle is drawing on experience gained helping in major disasters, including cyclones in Vanuatu and Fiji, typhoons in the Philippines and earthquakes in Indonesia.

Removing and cremating the bodies is the first step in helping to prevent the spread of the disease.

Culturally, this is completely new since the norm in Liberia before ebola included washing of bodies and plenty of touching, which is a major source of transmission of ebola, he said.

The disease, which spreads through bodily fluid, has brought the country to a standstill with schools closed, fresh food distribution halted, sports and soccer cancelled and people with infected family members mourning the loss of loved ones.

“I know that so many families have been ripped apart by this terrible disease. Most of my colleagues at Red Cross have lost family members or friends,” he said.

Mr Gloeckle is one of a string of Australian volunteers pulling on the bio-hazard suits that he calls “portable saunas” and preparing to spend the Christmas holidays away from family to help those struggling in West Africa.

In Sierra Leone, Australian paramedic Joel Donkin from regional NSW is working with Victorian doctor Melissa McRae and nurse Tracy Zordan to treat those infected with the killer disease that as yet has no cure.

“The situation is still fluid. There are new outbreaks in some areas balancing improvement in others. I think we are moving ahead but slowly,” said Mr Donkin, who previously worked as a medic in the Australian army.

“The people of Sierra Leone need help to defeat this disease. I hope that my background, skills and experience gives me something to contribute.” But like all the volunteers he is nervous about how easily the disease is transmitted. “Of course I am worried about my safety, but not my security. We are taking all precautions and following established protocols to protect ourselves,” he said.

In the past few days in Sierra Leone health officials have found scores of bodies in the remote diamond mining area of Kono, prompting fears the true scale of the crisis remains unreported.

“We are only seeing the ears of the hippo,” said Dr Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone’s Director of Disease Prevention and Control, who has put the area of Kono in lockdown until Christmas to try to contain the latest outbreak.

The World Health Organisation says while the situation has improved in some areas, the disease is still “running ahead” of efforts to contain it.

Australia is sending medical workers through Australian-owned medical provider Aspen to staff a 100-bed field hospital in Sierra Leone at a cost of $20 million.

Mr Donkin said: “Governments have conflicting priorities and things take time to gain momentum. The important thing is that we are helping now and that resources should not be wasted trying to re-invent the wheel.“Is it hard seeing people sick, dying or dead? Always,” he said. “But I find it useful to focus on the living.”

We’ll all get wiped out

DEEP under our cities, down where the slithy toves gyre and gimble in the wabe, there is a wipe-berg.

It is a giant, stinking ball of nastiness. It is blocking our sewers. It is composed of wet-wipes. Yes, wet-wipes.

There are many of these colossal wipe-bergs, under suburban homes and city streets. They are blocking giant pipes and backing up toilets in offices and houses.

They have to be winched out of the sewage processing plants. And they are a symptom of something very disturbing about modern, middle-class Australians. Apparently we are too posh for paper.

Toilet paper, that is. Dry toilet paper. Here in the 21st century, what our society has deemed most essential is for our bathroom experience to be — and I’m sorry for the use of this word in a family newspaper — moist.

I don’t want to pry here, and I’m certainly not planning to overshare, but what the hell has happened in the generation since backyard outhouses were superseded by flushing loos, and dunny-men were consigned to the garbage bin of history?

What happened to the nation that once so proudly kept a stash of newspaper squares on a rusty nail in the lavatory, for no-fuss clean-up?

Perhaps the most disturbing fact I am bringing to you this lovely Sunday morning is that the main wet-wipe culprits are men, aged 15-49, living in the outer mortgage-belt suburbs.

In other words, the once-stoic Australian fella has gone comprehensively and inarguably soft.

But, unfortunately, his wet-wipes haven’t. They never do. They might say ‘flushable’ on the package, but the truth is they take up to five years to break down, compared with 30 seconds for regular toilet paper. They just clog up the sewers, making life a living nightmare for hard-working plumbers and dedicated urban sanitation professionals.

I’m blaming the military-industrial complex, specifically Big Wipe. In case you haven’t noticed, there has been an enormous explosion in recent years in the wet-wipe subsection of what supermarket types call Fast-Moving Consumer Goods.

It’s a giant business.

You can get wipes designed spe-cifically for your hands (anti-bacterial or not), your baby’s nappy region, your toddler’s hands, your mascara, your fine facial pores and, of course, your bottom.

There are wipes pre-loaded with window cleaner, car wax, furniture polish, toilet sanitiser and bleach.

This all has a very last-days-of-Rome feel about it.

This is not just about convenience. It’s a deep-seated desire for a level of cleanliness that, frankly, is starting to seem a bit weird.

Where did we get this modern ­obsession with sanitising everything? And when did we get so deeply afraid of dirt? And what’s our ­obsession with cleanliness doing to the rest of our environment — in particular, our drains?

I’ve noticed lately — perhaps because I have a grubby little toddler in tow — that Australians might like to talk a big game about dirt, but when it comes to the real filth, we’re not equipped to cope.

If you asked most adults, they’d say dirt used to be a natural part of growing up.

They might reminisce about making mud-pies and wriggling through the grime under the house, getting thoroughly grotty.

But when these same adults, now parents themselves, see their own kids getting filthy, they’re not so sure. Because the visceral reality of a kid enjoying dirt is slightly less nostalgic, and more downright disgusting.

Hands in the dog-bowl. Fingers in the drain. Dry dog-turd in the mouth. Cigarette butts down the gullet.

Our own mothers used to lick their fingers and wipe the muck from our faces. Today, parks are full of modern mums chasing after their kids with specially designed, cucumber-­scented, hand and mouth wipes.

I know. I’m one of them, even though I try to resist the urge whenever I can. It’s a struggle against my most basic instinct; to keep this child as safe and keen as consumer technology will allow. I really want to cultivate a reasonable level of good-fun filthiness, and yet my instinctive brain is telling me to bust out the White King.

There’s an elusive balance, somewhere between Dettol and ebola. But I think the wipe-berg is telling us something.

It’s saying: enough.You don’t need ultra-sanitation, especially not where the sun don’t shine. You just need a couple of squares of two-ply. That’s clean enough. The alternative is too revolting to contemplate.

“They were most excited by laying still in a paddock and being sniffed by cows” Holiday — it’s such an enchanting word. How it looks. How it sounds. What it promises. Used as a prefix to other words — “reads”, “houses”, “romances” – it’s like sprinkling glitter over the everyday. Shame, then, that I haven’t had one this year.

Nope, a full 12 months has passed without so much as a sun lounger or a dog-eared beach house novel, or a long evening in a pub garden tapping my thongs to Talking Heads (yep, showing my vintage).

Sure, there’s been the odd weekend away but not one of those delicious long breaks where the days pass without names and you laze around laughing and sinking love into your children.

Before I get ambushed with emails pointing out that I’m hardly battling ISIS or ebola, yes of course living in Australia is like being on permanent holiday (complete with Jacqui Lambie as tour guide). But surely we all need to step away from our diaries and responsibilities occasionally.

Yet as I round the final curve on 2014 — and goodness knows I can’t wait to see the finish line — I’ve learned that we need to re-educate ourselves on the notion of “escape”.

During my year journeying nowhere I kept a quote in my notebook from the acerbic food and travel writer A. A. Gill.

Adrian has the best job in the world and was recently here for Tourism Australia’s gala dinner in Tasmania.

For someone who doubtless spends half of his life in business class, he’s remarkably insightful on our escalating need to self-medicate our tired lives with a plane ticket and a cocktail.

“Escape what?” he asks.

“Travelling is time out between two dimly-cliched places — a here that is fraught, hectic, relentless and infuriating, and a there that is peaceful, comforting, effortless and undemanding.

“But if that really describes your home and your holidays, then you’re living your life the wrong way round.” Resonate? Yep, me too. So this year I’ve tried to bring “there” to “here” which is not to say Chez Mollard is now decked out with a Moroccan-tiled spa complete with white robes in every bedroom and “tasting plates” for dinner (just seeing the floor in my daughters’ bedrooms would constitute a holiday).

Rather, on glimpsing that work commitments and budget would not extend to two weeks’ sailing in Croatia, I sought to make small changes that might imbue ordinary life with the delights, comfort and sensual pleasures you’d typically enjoy on vacation.

I started in the bedroom — new doona cover, scented candles and daily removal of newspapers and discarded clothes. Cleaning the windows in the ensuite provided a glorious bird’s eye view of neighbouring gardens bursting with bougainvillea and birdlife. It’s extraordinary how enjoyable it is to clean your teeth while watching a magpie gorge itself on a seed pod.

In the kitchen I adopted a “picnic” approach over the arduousness of planned and prepped meals.

Jamie Oliver’s pre-marinated lamb with tahini sauce ($13 in Woollies) quickly became a favourite along with prawn tortillas, cooked in seconds, and serve with bowls of tomatoes, coriander and flash-grilled corn.

Exercise, for so long a labour without love, is now everyday and incidental: a power walk with a friend every Wednesday, boxing on Fridays, a daily blitz through the 7 Minute Workout app. Best of all, any days I’m working from home, I dress in bathers and a kaftan because it guarantees I’ll try like mad to squeeze in a 20-minute swim.

Other small pleasures: smelling the gardenias rather than passing them by, a portable speaker so I can listen to music in any room in the house, soft cotton maxi dresses that swirl round the ankles, toenails painted coral that wink like tropical fish in the ocean, limes sliced into soda on those days that demand something more special than water but less damaging than wine, and sleep, because sometime in the past five years it’s gone from basic need to luxury, gazing at my children because, as author Anna Quindlen says: “I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less.” Has it felt like a holiday? Yes, in part. Mostly it just feels healthy — as if joy is not predicated on some expensive, Michelin-starred “trip of a lifetime” but threaded through the ordinary.

It’s like stringing fairy lights into a tree, or realising that weight is not maintained by bingeing then starving but by liking your body enough to treat it well.

It reminded me of taking the kids to England three years ago when they saw Stonehenge and Legoland but were most excited by laying still in a paddock and being sniffed by cows.

I think I’m on to something because this week Reddit came out with the most “disappointing destinations on earth”. Los Angeles was dismissed as a “lie”, Paris as “smelling like urine” and Venice as “Disneyland for middle-aged American yuppies”.I plan to spend the summer at home on a “staycation”, listening to Talking Heads and letting the days go by.

Dark continent on brink of collapse

Poverty and violence mean the times have never been harsher in Africa, writes MATTHEW BENNS

They came in the dead of night, attacked her husband and raped her repeatedly. With other women from the ­village she was taken to a rebel camp and held as a sex slave until she ­escaped six months later.

“When I gave birth to triplets I couldn’t believe that they were mine. They were like three rats, one for each man who had raped me. I couldn’t understand what had happened to me. I felt like I had lost my mind,” 41-year-old Vumiliya said.

Her story is repeated by thousands of women across the Democratic Republic of Congo which has been named the most dangerous place on Earth to be a woman.

Africa is a dangerous continent to be in right now and Australia, which has been chairing the UN Security Council this year, is playing a key role in trying to deal with its myriad problems.

Last week fighters from ­Islamic extremist group al-Shabab in Somalia crossed the border into Kenya and pulled 60 passengers from a bus bound for Nairobi. Anyone who could not recite the Shahada Islamic creed was executed — 19 men and nine women were shot at close range.

Survivor Douglas Ochwodho said: “When my turn came, the militiamen started arguing and by some miracle they passed me by. My wife’s blood was all over my body. In her way she saved my life.” On the same day in Nigeria, Boko Haram Islamic extremists killed 48 fish sellers in the troubled Borno state.

They cut their throats or tied their hands and feet ­together and threw them into the lake to drown.

Head of the fish traders association Abubakar Gamandi said: “The attackers killed their victims silently without the use of the gun to avoid attracting attention from the multinational troops in the area.” Three days later two teenage girls walked into a crowded marketplace in north-eastern Nigeria with explosive vests hidden under their niqabs.

The first detonated her bomb and killed three women. As people rushed to their aid the second girl detonated her bomb, killing more than 40.

Again Boko Haram was held responsible.

It is the same group that kidnapped 276 girls from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok in Borno state in northeast Nigeria.

The mass abduction caused global outrage.

Six months later Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message that dashed the parents’ hopes of release. He said the schoolgirls had converted to Islam.

“The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,” he said.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is at the forefront of international efforts to stamp down on Boko Haram.

“I have offered Australia’s support to the Nigerian government in its counterterrorism efforts,” she told Saturday Extra in an exclusive interview.

“The abduction of 200 women and girls in April this year and subsequent events ­relating to their welfare were appalling,” she said.

Australia chaired the UN Security Council sanctions committee which in May added Boko Haram to its al-Qaeda Sanctions List. The group has also been listed as a terrorist organisation under the Australian Criminal Code.

“The Australian government is deeply disturbed about recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria, ­including the recent suicide bombing of a mosque in the city of Kano,” Ms Bishop said.

But there are problems right across the continent and ­Australia is using its temporary UN seat and financial clout — to the tune of more than $250 million — to make a difference.

“We have used our seat on the United Nations Security Council to influence the international response to crises in Africa, ensuring that the Council gives priority to the protection of civilians and ­improving the effectiveness of peacekeeping missions,” Ms Bishop said.

“We worked to deploy a new peacekeeping mission into the Central African ­Republic (CAR) in response to fears of possible genocide.” There are currently at least 1.6 million people in dire need of assistance in the CAR, half of them children.

“We used RAAF planes to transport UN supplies and peacekeepers into South Sudan at the outbreak of the civil war and we worked to shine a light on insidious ­sexual violence in conflict and the important role of women in peace processes,” she said.

Lulu Mitshabu, Africa ­program co-ordinator for ­Australian charity Caritas, knows first-hand what the Foreign Minister is talking about.

She walked into her village in the Democratic Republic of Congo with her two children to be warned by a neighbour that M23 rebels were torturing her husband: “I had to make a quick decision. I grabbed my children and went to the border.” Her crime, in the eyes of the terrorists, was speaking out for women’s rights. Three months later her husband, beaten and tortured, escaped and joined them in a refugee camp in Zambia. But the torture was not over. They were given 48 hours to find ­another country to take them or be taken back to the DRC.

“I knew we would be killed if we went back. I went to the church to pray and a lady there asked me what was wrong,” Ms Mitshabu said.

That lady was from the Australian High Commission and she immediately ­organised paperwork to help Ms Mitshabu and her family migrate to Australia.

“It made me realise just how vulnerable I am as a woman and as a refugee and I made myself a promise that I would do what I could to work for an organisation that could help these people,” said Ms Mitshabu, who now lives in Canberra and works for Caritas.

Paul O’Callaghan, CEO of Caritas Australia, believes Australia needs to do more. “Over the last 18 months we have witnessed significant cuts to our overseas aid program including a marked reduction in funding to Africa,’’ he said.

“In 2014 Africa is home to more than 50 per cent of the world’s poor and within the next 10 years this figure is ­expected to rise to around 80 per cent. This is a reality that cannot be ignored, as Australians we need to show leadership in the Africa region.” Ms Bishop believes we are: “Australia has been working to mitigate some of the world’s most acute humanitarian ­crises, such as in South Sudan and Somalia where our ­assistance has provided medical supplies, food, water and shelter to those most in need.” But what will ever be enough in Africa?

After her rape and eventual escape, only to give birth to her rapists’ triplets, Vumiliya thought her horror was over.

“The second time I was raped was in 2013. When M23 was advancing on Goma they looted everything. I ran away before they reached my home but the trouble was everywhere,” she said.

“The day it happened they raped so many women. I was staying in a house with my husband’s sister and my daughter. A soldier came into the room and he raped all of us. My sister-in-law was seven months pregnant. After the rape, she lost the baby. “ The husband blamed her for the rape of his daughter and sister and kicked her out.

“When this happened I felt like I had nothing in the world — it felt like heaven and earth didn’t want me,” she said.

She fled to a camp for ­displaced people and was given assistance by Caritas. Vumiliya and millions like her are hoping for stronger winds of change to blow through Africa and is looking to countries like Australia to make sure they do.

Second stage of Ebola drug trial starts

HALF of the 60 volunteers who received the experimental Ebola vaccine in the UK will now receive a follow up vaccine as part of the trial.

SCIENTISTS want to discover if a second booster injection would increase the protection of aid workers and health professionals treating those infected with the killer virus in West Africa.

Half of the 60 healthy volunteers who received the experimental Ebola vaccine at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University in November will now receive a follow up vaccine as part of the ongoing trial.

It is one of several safety trials across the world of the candidate vaccine developed by Glaxo-Smith-Kline and the US National Institutes of Health that were fast-tracked in response to the Ebola outbreak.

Professor Adrian Hill, who is leading the trial at Oxford University's Jenner Institute, said the aim of the trial is to determine the safety of the two vaccines used in combination, and whether the second booster vaccine can increase immune responses further.

"If a single dose of an Ebola vaccine is sufficient, it makes absolute sense to use that," Prof Hill said.

"But it also makes sense at this early stage of trials to see if a second booster vaccine can greatly increase the levels of immune responses produced."

The experimental vaccine does not contain infectious Ebola virus material and will not cause a person taking part in the trial to be infected.

So far, the experiment has triggered promising immune responses from 20 healthy volunteers taking part in a preliminary trial, but it won't be until larger trials in West Africa next year that the effectiveness of the vaccine will be known.

Ebola has infected nearly 17,000 people, of whom about 6000 have died, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

AN EAST Lancashire nurse will spend her Christmas fighting the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.

Sister Cathy Fallon, who works in the emergency department at Royal Blackburn Hospital, will join the next contingent of NHS volunteers to travel to West Africa.

MORE TOP STORIES:

On December 15, the mum-of-four will head to an MOD facility in Yorkshire for eight days of intensive training, to prepare for four weeks of nursing patients at a number of locations in Sierra Leone.

Cathy who lives in Bolton and has worked for East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust for nine months, said: “This is something I’ve always wanted to do and I thought long and hard about it before deciding to go.

“I wanted to take my nursing skills to somewhere they are desperately needed and get a different level of nursing experience and bring this back to the UK with me to share it with others. I also wanted to show anyone else who is thinking about volunteering to do this that it is possible and my team here have been really supportive of my decision.”

She will be the trust’s first member of staff to volunteer to go to West Africa to help in the response to the epidemic. It comes after a team of 30 NHS medics and nurses was dispatched last month.

Cathy added: “I’ll be away for Christmas which will be hard but my family have been very supportive of me. There are children in Sierra Leone who have no-one because of the Ebola virus and if I can make a difference to their lives at this time, then I will have achieved what I wanted to do.”

In its latest report, the World Health Organization said 6,928 people were now known to have died from Ebola, while more than 16,000 have been infected.

Between 200 and 300 people are dying every week, with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the far the worst hit countries.

Meanwhile, the head of the UN Ebola response mission in West Africa said there is still a “huge risk” the deadly disease could spread to other parts of the world.

Chris Pearson, chief nurse at ELHT, said: “I want to congratulate Cathy for taking this step to help others and we wish her well and a safe return. She is going to keep in touch with us with her blog and daily journal so we can read about what she is doing. “I am very proud to have Cathy as part of our nursing team here.”

A MAN suspected of being infected with the Ebola virus has been hospitalised in Pakistan.

THE 47-year-old passenger was in frail condition, and was handed over to health officials under screening laws relating to passengers coming from Ebola-affected countries, an airport official said.

"The suspect had some symptoms of Ebola and after initial medical assessment he was sent to a hospital," the official said.

Private Dunya TV reported that the man was taken to state-run Jinnah hospital and put in an isolation ward prepared to deal with Ebola patients.

Blood samples of the patient were being analysed.

If confirmed, he would be the first case of Ebola in Pakistan.

Last week, a man suspected of carrying the virus was later found to be in the terminal stage of hepatitis C, coupled with dengue fever.

He died in a hospital in the eastern city of Faisalabad.

Ebola has infected more than 15,000 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation.

Investors to grill Rio over Simandou

Rio Tinto boss Sam Walsh expected to face questions over planned $22bn iron ore project.

Investors are expected to grill Rio Tinto boss Sam Walsh this week about the company's plans to develop the $US20 billion ($21.64bn) Simandou iron ore project in West Africa.

Falling iron ore prices and an oversupply of the steel-making ingredient are weighing on investors' minds as host nation Guinea tries to lock in investment while dealing with the ebola epidemic.

Rio Tinto signed an investment framework deal with Guinea's government, Chinalco and World Bank-owned International Finance Corporation earlier this year to push ahead with the massive project which includes a 650km railway and deep-water port.

But some analysts say now is not the time to spend billions of dollars bringing more iron ore to market given recent price falls and an increase in production among the world's biggest producers.

Fat Prophets Resources analyst David Lennox said Rio would struggle to build the infrastructure and bring the mine into production by 2018 as planned.

"This lower price just puts somewhat of a curtailment on the profitability of it," Mr Lennox said.

He said the company would now need to reduce its price forecasts and model various risk scenarios such as changes to the taxation regime.

Last week Rio's chief executive Sam Walsh told analysts the company was focused on Pilbara iron ore and did not mention the long-delayed Simandou project.

However, Rio's Simandou boss Alan Davies is reportedly heading to Asia and Dubai this month to meet with contractors who are eager to build rail and port infrastructure.

Playtpus Asset Management chief investment officer Donald Williams said given the changes in the iron ore market over the last 12 months it was surprising to see Rio pushing ahead with Simandou.

"It seems an odd time to be adding to your tonnage," Mr Williams said.

"Potentially the oversupply will get worse before it gets better."

Mr Williams added that it appeared there could be a political imperative to progress the project.

He said analysts and investors would be asking many questions at Rio's investor seminar in London on Thursday.

Rio Tinto and its partners say the mine could produce 100 million tonnes of iron ore a year, operate for 40 years, double the country's GDP and stimulate 45,000 indirect jobs.

Doc: I HAVE received many questions of late from readers asking for my opinion regarding the Ebola outbreak and whether to travel or not.

I’d like to provide a statement from CEO Sue Badyari of World Expeditions (worldexpeditions .com.au) to help understand the situation. World Expeditions has been in operation since 1975 and is a global leader in small group adventure and cultural holidays.

“The first thing to consider, Africa is a huge continent. The entire land mass of the US, China, Eastern Europe, Japan, UK and India combined, fit within its parameters.

“Ebola has been detected and taken lives in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The remaining African countries are Ebola-free.

“Countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Morocco, Ethiopia, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, where most tours operate, are unaffected.

“World Expeditions does not operate trips to any of the affected countries. Further, we recommend that travellers to Africa do not undertake additional travel to the affected areas of Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia at this time.

“The next important point is that bodies such as the World Health Organisation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as many other medical experts and teams, are working to contain the virus in the affected areas. Their efforts appear to be effective as there is no evidence of the Ebola virus spreading to other nations.

“The only way that Ebola may be transmitted from one person to another is through coming into contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids when that person is displaying the symptoms. There is no evidence that Ebola can be contracted by airborne transmission. As the Ebola virus cannot be contracted by a person unless there is transmission of the fluids of an infected person to another, it is widely accepted that Ebola will not evolve to a pandemic.

“Western governments are consistently monitoring changing circumstances in countries where disease outbreaks, war and natural disasters are occurring.

“Their duty of care to citizens of their nations is to report on these situations and provide advice to travellers. Of note, other than the countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea, there is currently no country in Africa where our governments are warning travellers not to visit due to this virus.

“Finally, from a purely humanitarian perspective, there are companies operating holidays for foreign visitors across Africa who are the source of employment for hundreds of thousands of local people. To decide not to travel to Africa at this time will have an adverse affect on them and their families. Our hope is that you will consider these facts in determining whether to travel to Africa at this time.” Please also check the Smart Traveller website (smartraveller.com.au) for up-to-date advice.

MY SISTER accompanies us on holidays and we are looking at a Mediterranean cruise. Are there any cruise lines that offer three-bed accommodation in a suite or balcony rooms?

Doc: Have a look at Princess Cruises (princess.com). They feature a sofa-bed to be used for the third passenger in their mini-suites with a balcony, or suite with a balcony.

Princess provides a large range of Mediterranean cruises to choose from, for example their 12-day Grand Mediterranean starts at $3649 a person for two people and $2242 for the third. This cruise on the Island Princess departs in May next year and visits Italy, Turkey, Greece, France and Spain.

A number of cabins on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, (cunardline.com.au) and P&O’s Arcadia (pocruises.com) also feature three berths, and both companies offer many options for cruising through the Mediterranean.

Mediterranean Shipping Company (msccruises.com.au) also provides options for three passengers and it has more than 100 itineraries to choose from throughout the Mediterranean, ranging from two nights upwards. For example, its 11-night cruise aboard the MSC Splendida starts in Rome’s ancient port of Civitavecchia and heads to Genoa, Italy, then Barcelona, Spain, Casablanca, Morocco, Tenerife in the Canary Islands and home to Rome. Various shore excursions are available in Genoa, Barcelona, Marrakech and in Spain.

Balcony cabins for three people are available with the option of the Aurea Experience.This is one of the different fare structures designed to enrich your cruise by providing extras and includes 24-hour room service, discounts on fitness classes, spa package, priority dining times and unlimited drinks.

AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTEERS ARE TURNING THE TIDE AGAINST EBOLA, WRITES JANET FIFE-YEOMANS

Rick Brennan has seen firsthand the dedication — and dangers — of the exhausted health workers risking their lives to save people stricken by history’s worst ebola outbreak.

One of his own friends in the crowded Liberian capital of Monrovia died after contracting the disease while treating a patient at the height of the crisis which has left more than 5600 dead.

“These guys are working 24/7 and they are pretty tired, physically and emotionally,” Dr Brennan said yesterday.

While the Australian government has dithered over sending health workers to the west African countries stricken by the terrifying viral haemorrhagic disease, ironically it is Australians who have been at the forefront of the fight that is slowly, but finally, being won.

Sydney-born Dr Brennan, 55, has been moved from his usual role of emergency director at the Geneva-based World Health Organisation to head up WHO’s response to the ebola disaster.

The acting director who has stepped into his role is another Aussie from Sydney, Dr Michelle Gayer, and the director of ebola response at Unicef in their New York headquarters is Dr Peter Salama from Melbourne.

Dr Brennan, a graduate of Sydney University and former Westmead emergency doctor, said the world was now getting the upper hand over ebola and the current battle should be over in six to nine months: “We have started to turn it around but it has been tough.’’ A frequent traveller to the world’s trouble spots, Dr Brennan knows Monrovia well, having made it his home for three years from 2009 as he helped rebuild Liberia’s health system after a 14-year civil war. When he returned in September and October this year in his role with WHO, the world was aghast as about 2000 new ebola cases a week were being diagnosed throughout west Africa.

Even health workers delivering babies have been doing so wearing full ebola-protection suits to protect them from the bodily fluids that spread the disease.

“Ebola had never been seen in that part of Africa before and by the time it was recognised it had spread and we have been playing catch-up ever since,” he said.

He said it was education, and not isolation, that was helping win the battle and he remained concerned the whole of Africa has been stigmatised when in fact only four countries had been affected: “The good thing about ebola is that we know what works. There is no vaccine yet and no cure but we know how to stop it and that is with basic health measures.’’ WHO’s aim is to have 100 per cent of patients isolated by January 1. But in the impoverished and isolated communities, the cultural practises of washing, kissing and touching their dead had spread the disease.

It has been hard to persuade people that burying victims in body bags or forced cremations can be done with some dignity but Dr Brennan said that had been one of the most successful ways of controlling ebola.

Dr Brennan, who quit his job at Westmead Hospital in 1993 to devote himself to humanitarian work after he returned from working a volunteer in Bosnia, said the world was in the grip of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history, affecting more than 100 million people.There are currently an unprecedented five “Level 3” emergencies which required “all hands on deck” including Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Iraq as well as ebola.

AN EBOLA vaccine is still months away, experts say, as researchers report success in early safety tests with a leading candidate.

A phase-one trial with the virus-based prophylactic carried by chimps shows it was “well-tolerated” by 20 healthy adults who generated antibodies and immune cells in response, though this did not mean they were protected.

The work was “encouraging,” epidemiologist Rodolphe Thiebaut of France’s Institute of Health and Medical Research said.

But “we don’t have formal proof the vaccine will work,” he said. Such proof could only come from observing a reduced ­infection rate among vaccinated people in an outbreak zone.“We don’t know if the immunity seen in vaccinated people is protective, nor if the other vaccines in development will perform better,” said Jonathan Ball, virology professor at the University of Nottingham in England.

But the deadliest outbreak continues to hit Sierra Leone, with 385 new confirmed cases reported in the week to November 23, compared with 533 cases the previous week.

In Guinea, the number of new cases is said to be stabilising, with 148 new cases confirmed in a week compared with 81 the week before.WHO said 15,935 people had been confirmed with the disease since this outbreak began in March, with 592 of them healthcare workers.

Broad new powers under biosecurity bill

BROAD new powers are contained in a mammoth 600-page bill that updates Australia's century-old biosecurity laws.

THE federal government introduced legislation to the lower house on Thursday for sweeping changes to the country's century-old biosecurity regime.

Among them are new powers allowing biosecurity officers from the Department of Agriculture to enter a premise without a warrant if they suspect evidence of a pest or disease hazard.

That can only be exercised in a "biosecurity emergency" - that is, if Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce believes circumstances of a nationally-significant threat exist.

But the new warrant powers could be deemed controversial.

Questions have been raised on the issuing of a warrant for a heavily-criticised departmental investigation that was later blamed for the closure of a West Australian biotech company.

An interim Federal Court decision earlier this year found, on the face of it, a warrant sought by a departmental officer to raid Serana in 2013 was unlawfully issued.

An opposition MP has urged caution over the potential new powers, despite some being included in biosecurity legislation proposed by Labor in government in 2012.

Labor MP Alannah MacTiernan, who's led a campaign for answers about the Serana case, says it would be unsafe to expand departmental powers.

"Until we can be confident that the culture in the department and the level of oversight is adequate to provide assurances against capricious or even corrupt behaviours," she told AAP in a statement.

Meanwhile, people believed to have a communicable disease, such as Ebola, would have their movements significantly restricted through control orders.

They will be detained or quarantined for up to six hours and may not be able to leave home.

Broader control orders will also be imposed over specified "zones" that pose biosecurity risks, permitting officers to monitor or conduct surveillance activities.

People who interfere with an "activity" zone - for example, by removing warning markings - would be penalised.

Those who stay within the zone without consent could face up to five years in jail.

Debate on the bill won't resume until at least February 2015.

Bono, Obama named least influential by GQ

GQ hasn't just named the beautiful and the best celebrities, they have also picked out the 30 most uninspiring celebs who take up too much oxygen.

EDITORS at the US publication have compiled a list of the 30 stars they believe are uninspiring to the general public, noting that this batch of people "took up vast clouds of oxygen, gave us back nothing of use, and probably helped accelerate the death of our planet".

Rocker Bono and his band U2 were criticised in September for releasing their Songs of Innocence album exclusively through iTunes - the record was installed into nearly 500 million users' music libraries automatically.

GQ editors slammed the band for using the stunt as "some kind of noble gift to The People", and added, "This was a $100 million marketing campaign. Yes, $100 million to turn U2's socially conscious dad-rock into a piece of direct mail."

R&B singer Thicke came in at number 25. The singer had a rough 2014 after his actress wife Paula Patton filed for divorce - he staged a failed attempt at winning her back by dedicating his latest album, titled Paula, to her.

The publication's editors wrote, "The rest of this cheeseball's career is our collective punishment for making Blurred Lines popular. Let's ALL get a divorce from this man."

US President Barack Obama took out the second spot on the table with editors blaming him for being missing in action while Missouri burned, Putin conquered Europe and the CDC "played nude twister with Ebola patients".

TOP 10 LEAST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF 2014 ACCORDING TO GQ MAGAZINE:

1. Bono and U2, musicians

"The worst part was the way both Apple and U2 treated this like it was some kind of noble gift to The People"

2. Barack Obama, US President

"Are you even president anymore?"

3. Donald Sterling, Ex-NBA owner

"The racist/slumlord/pervert/nudist ex-NBA owner displayed a remarkable lack of power in 2014."

4. Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, How I Met Your Mother writers

"It's a sitcom. Why does it even NEED a twist? It's not as if Cheers ended with all the characters turning out to be ghosts."

5. Zach Braff, actor

"Can we all agree never to crowd-fund a movie again? Please? He should've just filmed himself rubbing that money on his armpits."

6. Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the National Football League

"He's made liking football feel gross and wrong."

7. Stephen A. Smith, talk show host

"How can ESPN fire SAS for being an idiot when they hired him specifically to be an idiot?"

8. Dwyane Wade, American professional basketball player

"His knees are the only things in America right now that are rusting faster than Cleveland."

9. CNN, televison news network

"We need to put the folks at CNN out of their misery. I can get better news standing at a goddamn bus stop."

10. Eric Cantor, politician

"OOPS!"

Beating a life-threatening illness gave Russell Watson a new focus

BOB Geldof would be proud of Russell Watson. For ‘The Voice’ is one of those celebrities who never tires of raising money for charity.

Indeed his Blackburn Cathedral gig on December 17 will support The Princes Trust, for which he has been an ambassador for nine years.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Sir Bob has been at the centre of controversy over whether singer Adele allegedly snubbed the chance to perform on the 30th anniversary Band Aid single to raise funds for Ebola victims in Africa.

As it turns out the much-loved songstress had made a private donation to Oxfam.

Russell’s pretty vocal on the issue of celebs and charity and doesn’t believe anyone should feel pressured into doing fundraising work. But, then again, he doesn’t think they should do it for self-promotion either.

He says: “You either have to want to do it or not. The flip side is that there are people who do it for the right reasons and people who do it for the wrong reasons.

"Very clear messages are sent out with some charity events and obviously promotion comes into it.

"I’ve always been very careful about that. The stipulation is the charity.

“I have seen other artists, mentioning no names, who do something charitable and then it’s a case of, ‘Hey, my new CD is on sale in the shops’.

"I think that’s really crass, but I think there’s a fine balance between getting it right and milking the profile of the charities.”

Every Christmas Eve, Russell pops down with presents for the kids at Francis House, a children’s hospice near his Cheshire home. “I get nothing from that other than the joy of seeing the kids’ faces.

“ I see charity as me giving my services to someone who is not as fortunate as I am.

“And because I went through a time when I was very ill, I have more of an affinity with the charity work that I do and the people I work with. I get a good feeling, a sense of achievement.”

Russell is, of course, talking about the two pituitary tumours he suffered in 2005 and 2007.

He was working on his album ‘That’s Life’ in LA when he had to return to the UK for surgery to remove the potentially fatal lump which was pressing on the optic nerve.

After the delayed release of the album in 2007, and while in the studio working on his album Outside, he was leftstunned when MRI scans showed a regrowth and life-threatening bleed on his brain. He once again underwent an emergency operation and was in a critical condition in Cheadle’s Alexandra Hospital Intensive Therapy Unit.

He was later discharged and underwent an extensive rehabilitation programme, including radio therapy which he completed in 2008.

In 2010 he surprised doctors by releasing a comeback album La Voce.

In his career to date he has sold more than seven million albums worldwide, performing at the Classical Brit Awards and for the Queen.

He says: “I’m as good as I’ll ever be. I’ve made a recovery from the tumours and I’m OK.

“When you go through that kind of thing you become more conscious of your mortality and with that comes a different regime and a different way of looking at life.

“Up until that point all I had ever done was dislocate my thumb in a game of basketball.

"I’d hardly had a day’s illness and then all of a sudden things changed and my outlook changed because I’d gone from feeling invincible to ‘oh my God’. And you never think it will happen to you. You bounce out of bed in the morning with a spring in your step you never think about great big lumps growing out of the front of your skull.”

Russell is really looking forward to performing a one night only gig at Blackburn Cathedral on December 17 with the Dishforth Army Military Wives Choir – one of 50 such choirs formed following choral guru Gareth Malone’s TV series – Westholme’s Senior School Choir and Blackburn and Darwen Brass Band.

Westholme’s Principal Mrs Lynne Horner says: “We are still working on the finer detail.

"It’s going to be a wonderful evening and we’re so happy to support The Princes Trust.”

Russell is equally enthusiastic: “I sang in Blackburn Cathedral many years ago and it’s a great venue, acoustically and design-wise. It’s absolutely beautiful and it has a fantastic sound.

"Sometimes in cathedrals your voice gets carried away and starts bouncing around, but it’s one of those places that contains the voice really well so I’m really looking forward to singing there.”

Russell’s last gig of his cathedral tour is December 21. After that it’s back to his Cheshire home and his 25-year-old fiancee Louise, whom he intends to marry next year, for a quiet Christmas with his two daughters and a couple of friends.

“Christmas dinner will be a joint effort. I usually do the turkey and veg and the other half does the pigs in blankets.

"I always have to carve the turkey too. I hate that, it’s tedious I’d rather do the ironing and I really hate that.”

Russell Watson: Wednesday, December 17, 2014, 7pm, Blackburn Cathedral. Tickets range from £30 for a standard ticket and £100 for a VIP ticket. King George’s Hall box office on 01254 582 579 The VIP package includes a champagne reception with canapés, sponsored by Moore & Smalley and the chance to meet Russell after his performance. All money from the event, organised by Butterfly Ball Events, will help support unemployed young people in the North West get back into work, education and training.

I’M thoroughly sick of the carping about Sir Bob Geldof’s decision to re-record the Band Aid song Do They Know It’s Christmas?

This week the song became the fastest-selling single of the year after just 24 hours on sale. The video shows One Direction, Paloma Faith, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran joining old hands such as Sinead O’Connor and Bono (above) to belt out the charity classic. Thirty years on it still seizes my heart, still makes me care. But, more importantly, it moves me to action.If Geldof can get me and millions of others to spend $2.19 on his song then his genius is not just in raising money to fight ebola. It’s in showing others that it’s always better to do something rather than nothing.

Ebola fear big threat to airlines

THE ebola virus is looming as a serious threat to airline profitability at a time when Australian carriers are finally getting into the black.

Virgin Australia announced yesterday it was on track for a profitable end to the year, just a few weeks after Qantas revealed it had reversed its disastrous 2014 financial result.

But, as Virgin CEO John Borghetti painted a rosy picture of the airline’s outlook, Qantas chairman Leigh Clifford was more cautious as he addressed a lunch in Brisbane.

He said, although the weaker Australian dollar had helped the carrier climb out of its financial abyss, those gains could be short-lived: “We’re seeing some blue sky out there, but you get something like ebola, not that the disease itself is necessarily a threat to Australia, but it’s the reaction of travellers if there was to be an outbreak in certain areas.” Mr Clifford told the Australian Institute of Company Directors’ lunch: “During the SARS outbreak (in 2005) the Japanese just stopped travelling.

“That had a dramatic effect on us.” The Qantas chairman also predicted passengers would increasingly fly with other airlines when booking with the Flying Kangaroo as a result of more codeshare agreements.

“In five years time you’ll be able to book a QF flight which will be on our metal with us and someone else’s to a destination you might choose and I’d like to think we would have more of those arrangements,” he said.

“It’s a very competitive environment.” A short distance away Mr Borghetti was addressing a small gathering of shareholders at the airline’s annual general meeting, held in Brisbane.

He said Virgin was expecting a return to underlying profit in the second quarter of the financial year, and predicted Tigerair would break even six months earlier than forecast, at the end of 2016.

“Obviously there’s been a number of ­factors at play here,’’ he said. “The moderation in capacity has meant the supply-demand equation is getting closer to a more sustainable level.

“There is no question that we are continuing to win more corporate share, which gives us better yields.” He warned against “jumping to conclusions” about the fall in jet fuel prices, which have come down a staggering 30 per cent since July.

“You have to remember we have a hedging program in place,’’ Mr Borghetti said.“And as such you don’t see the full benefits of the fuel decline for a period of time.’’

The Abbott government must change or die. Newspoll now shows it trailing Labor by a disastrous 45 per cent to 55. Other polls are tighter, but all agree — the government has been ­behind for months.

And its list of excuses is ­running thin.

The government argues the polls flatter Labor and come the election, voters will reject an Opposition that won’t turn back boats, cut spending or axe its planned carbon tax.

That is true, but Labor could change in that time.

The government argues it’s making the hard decisions now to fix the Budget and has still two years left to make voters feel better.

Yes, but the Budget keeps blowing out and more pain must come. So here’s what needs fixing.

THERE IS TOO MUCH ­FOREIGN POLICY GOVERNMENTS don’t win elections with foreign policies, yet this one has talked of little else for months.

Sure, it didn’t schedule the MH17 disaster. Sure, its free trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea are huge wins. And, yes, it’s handled such things brilliantly.

But to many voters this packed foreign agenda will ­increasingly seem an evasion from their priorities — jobs, prices, schools, health care, cuts and taxes.

BACK TO WORK UNPOPULAR Budget cuts and broken promises are killing the government. Worse, falling iron ore prices and Senate stalemates mean the Budget has blown out by up to $51 billion more.

The government is caught. More spending cuts will cost votes, but bigger deficits will destroy its main argument for being. Where is its solution?

WHAT MEDIA STRATEGY?

TONY Abbott, unlike most leaders, has no senior media strategist to plot tactics, check policies and cultivate relationships with journalists.

Too much responsibility rests on his brilliant but frantically busy chief of staff, Peta Credlin. That has left the government too slow to react to blunders such as the parliamentary burqa ban proposed by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop.

There’s little sign of a long-term selling strategy for everything from the Budget to the trade deals.

This is deadly given the ­ferocious hatred of Abbott in the media Left, especially the massive ABC.

Check out Monday’s Q&A, which even one participant, Malcolm Turnbull, agreed was another “Abbott hatefest”.

And what exactly is the ­Liberal strategy for calling out ABC bias? STOP PLAYING NICE ABBOTT is a Christian who believes virtue is rewarded and enemies should be embraced.

He’s thanked Opposition leader Bill Shorten for being “bipartisan” on Iraq and has praised former Labor leaders Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam. But, in return, Labor’s Sam Dastyari this week called him the “village idiot”, and Shorten called him “weird”.

The government lacks mongrel and is getting belted in bare-knuckle politics. Example: US President Barack Obama in his speech in Brisbane loutishly attacked Abbott over global warming.

Abbott just took it on the chin when he could instead have chided this showpony. The Left would still have backed Obama but conservatives would have cheered ­Abbott’s firmness.

DON’T GET BOGGED THE government has picked too many fights it simply cannot win, which risks making it seem hapless.

It must ditch the undoable, argue only for what it can win and avoid as much as possible the Senate bloc.

SQUARE PEGS THE most successful minister, Scott Morrison, has been given no new problem to solve since stopping the boats.

The second most successful minister, Julie Bishop, is in foreign affairs, which doesn’t win the Coalition votes.

The minister most admired by the left-wing media, Malcolm Turnbull, has a communications portfolio where there’s been little call to charm the government’s media critics.

Treasurer Joe Hockey must lift in this critical portfolio.

Fresher faces — women particularly — are also needed.

Indeed, some of the Coalition’s most interesting talents aren’t ministers. TIME TO INSPIRE THE government isn’t offering voters a moral buzz to counter Labor’s warming faith.

It’s one big moral cause is constitutional recognition of Aborigines, which is of marginal interest and divisive.

Abbott could have owned the ebola crisis with his can-do style, but Labor stole it with its demands for a faster response.

GET FRIENDS LABOR is great at funding ­interest groups to say it’s wonderful. US presidents surround themselves with high-profile supporters when publicly ­announcing things.

But this government is lousy at finding friends and looks lonely. It had to criticise business for not publicly backing it, and even struggled to present scientists to back its huge medical research fund.

EXCITE CONSERVATIVES THE Left will always loathe a Catholic conservative like ­Abbott. If he wants friends, he’d best start with exciting fellow conservatives.

Instead, he’s given up the fights for free speech and workplace reform and dares not openly challenge the warming hysteria.

This government cannot go on like this and must fix things over Christmas.Get sharp. Offer inspiration. Ditch failures. And fight.

A CUBAN doctor who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has contracted the disease and is being treated by British doctors in Africa.

DR Felix Baez Sarria is being treated by British doctors in Africa, but he will be transferred to a special unit in Geneva at the recommendation of the World Health Organisation, Cuban state media said, citing the island's public health ministry.

Cuba won global praise for sending at least 256 medical workers to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea to help treat Ebola patients. State officials have emphasised the medics' high state of readiness for the mission, saying the doctors, nurses and support staff received weeks of instruction in protective measures and equipment.

Once in Africa, the Cubans got two to three weeks of additional training before heading into the field. They were to be quarantined in Africa for weeks at the end of their six-month mission before returning to Cuba.

State media said that Baez, an internal medicine specialist, came down with a fever of more than 38C on Sunday and was diagnosed with Ebola the following day.

Cuban officials did not say how he caught the disease or immediately release any other information about the case, the first reported among the health workers the island sent to Africa.

A SURGEON from Sierra Leone being treated at a US hospital for ebola has died. “We are extremely sorry to announce that the third ­patient we’ve cared for with the ebola virus, Dr Martin Salia, has passed away as a ­result of the symptoms of the disease,” the ­Nebraska Medical Center said.

Dr Salia, a native of Sierra Leone and a US resident, was infected with the deadly haemorrhagic fever while treating patients in his home country. He had been flown to Nebraska for emergency treatment on Saturday.

The hospital on Sunday said Dr Salia was in an “extremely critical” condition and doctors were doing all they could to save him.

Dr Salia was the 10th ­person with ebola to be treated in the US, and the second to have died.

In October a Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, died at a Texas hospital of the virus, which has killed thousands of people in Africa.The World Health Organisation says 5177 people are known to have died of ebola across eight countries.

SIX African orphans have a new life in Australia thanks to the generosity of the Newcastle community, which allowed them to escape the growing threat of ebola in their homeland, Liberia.

Trapped in desperate poverty and with an application for asylum that was taking years, the threat from the disease prompted officials to act quickly. Yesterday — after two years of red tape, a week in transit and 21 days of quarantine — the six Swaray kids started school in Australia.

After their mother died of cancer in 2011 and their father disappeared, presumed murdered, the siblings were left to fend for themselves. Their grandmother Iseta ­Swaray, herself a refugee in Newcastle, asked Sister Diana Santleben for help.

A volunteer at Newcastle’s Penola House which supports refugees in the community, Sister Santleben embarked on a two-year journey to save the children. The community donated $50,000 to pay for the application, which could have taken longer if not for the ebola threat. “It was a slight blessing in disguise,” she said.Leone, Satta Swaraysuah, Clarena, Ciatta, Satta, Tonia, and Princess now live in community housing in Newcastle and have begun to enjoy their new life. The eldest, Princess, said it was impossible to express her gratitude to Sister Diana and those who had helped. “I can’t believe I’m in Australia,” she said. “I just came back from school and everyone was very friendly. The journey was long and emotional.”

TONY Abbott has foiled Barack Obama’s attempt to hijack the G20 with climate change, refusing to put a cent into the US President’s push for a $10 billion global green climate fund.

And as chair of the G20, he succeeded in ensuring global economic growth and job creation was at the top of the final declaration yesterday, delivering a blow to Mr Obama’s attempts to elevate climate change to a first order issue of the world leader’s meeting.

In one of the rare instances of an Australian leader standing up to a US President on a major policy issue, Mr Abbott refused to allow the final communique to include a binding requirement that all G20 nations commit to the Green Climate Fund announced by Mr Obama on Saturday at University of Queensland.

Several Australian officials, however, said privately that it had been “discourteous” of the US President to grandstand on the issue as a guest in Australia — this year’s host of the G20.

But The Daily Telegraph can reveal Mr Abbott told world leaders behind closed doors at the G20 summit yesterday that he would “stand up for coal” during a robust debate on climate change.

He stared down the world’s most powerful leaders to fight for Australia’s $60 billion industry.

And he refused to give Mr Obama a commitment to contribute funds to the “climate bank” which would assist poor nations combat climate change — a fund he once described as “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”.

According to sources close to the discussions, Mr Abbott was “frank” in arguing against Mr Obama in the meeting. Mr Abbott was supported by others in the room including Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Saudi leader Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz.

Despite claims that climate change would dominate the real discussions in the leaders’ meeting, the final communique reflected the original draft circulated by Australia in September, which had climate change listed as the 19th point in the document, behind other issues including economic growth, tax, infrastructure and jobs priorities.

But Australia may yet stand alone in abstaining from the fund with Japan, France, the UK, Germany, Korea and Indonesia declaring they would contribute.

The incoming US Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell declared that the new Republican-controlled Congress would go to war with the President over the coal industry’s future.

Despite the disagreement, Mr Obama last night maintained Australia was still the “closest of allies”.

British Prime Minister David Cameron also said the climate change debate had not impacted his relationship with Mr Abbott.

“We have a very good relationship,” Mr Cameron said.

“Clearly Australia has already set out how it’s going to cut its carbon emissions by some 5 per cent ... but I think there’s compelling arguments to say that everyone should look at their own country, think what they should do to help bring about a global deal.” Mr Abbott did not rule out contributing to the bank and said decisions still had to be made. But sources close to the PM said Australia was putting $2.5 billion into emissions reduction and would not be contributing to the fund.

Mr Abbott said coal was critical to the world’s supply of electricity. “There are 1.3 billion people who have no access to electricity ... we’ve got to give them access to electricity. And coal is going to be an important part of that for decades.’’

MAIN POINTS OF G20 LEADERS’ COMMUNIQUE  Raising global growth to deliver better living standards and quality jobs across the world as main priority  Goal to lift G20’s GDP by additional 2 per cent by 2018, to add more than $US2 trillion to global economy and create millions of jobs  Establishing a Global Infrastructure Hub to foster collaboration between banks, private sector, governments and other international organisations  Reaffirming resistance toprotectionism  Reducing gap in participation rates between men and women in G20 countries by 25 per cent by 2025  Banking reforms to have institutions take on additional loss absorbing capacity to protect taxpayers if banks fail  Moves to prevent cross-border tax evasion  Commitment to improve transparency in endorsing 2015-16 G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan  Call for action on ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberiaand Sierra Leone.

We encourage parties that are ready to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance of COP21 (by the first quarter of 2015 forthose parties ready to do so). We reaffirm our support for mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, such as the Green Climate Fund.

» Obama delivers climate slapdown » Blood pledge to stand by Pacific allies » Urges respect for gays and women

IT was the ultimate expression of a friendship solid enough to withstand some blunt criticism: US President Barack Obama using an impassioned G20 speech to warn Tony Abbott against climate inaction.

In a sweeping address, Mr Obama reasserted his commitment to the Asia-Pacific, warning China that America has invested too much “blood and treasure’’ in the Pacific to walk away from protecting the freedom and ­security of allies.

Announcing plans for a $3 billion fund to help developing nations fight climate change, Mr Obama made it clear he will use the last two years of his presidency to pursue global climate consensus.

Mr Obama made it personal for Mr Abbott, saying he wanted his own daughters and their children to be able to visit the Great Barrier Reef in 50 years.

Describing Australians and Americans as being cut from the same cloth, citizens who believed in a “fair go”, he also warned that China must “adhere to the same rules as other nations, in trade or on the seas”.

“Now, as a Pacific power, the United States has invested our blood and treasure to advance this vision,’’ he said. “We don’t just talk about it.

“Generations of Americans have served and died in the Asia-Pacific so that the people of the region might live free. So no one should ever question our commitment, our ­resolve to our allies.’’ Despite pressing events around the world, including the war on ­terrorism in Iraq and Syria, conflict in the Ukraine and the ebola crisis, he said America would continue to stand up for democracy.

“When our friends are in need, America shows up. We are there to help in good times and in bad, you can count on the United States of America,’’ he said.

“We will continue to deepen our engagement using every element of American power — diplomacy, military, economic, development, the power of our values and our ideals.’’ After an opening joke about wanting a XXXX beer in “Brisvegas”, Mr Obama said Australia had a special responsiblity on climate.

“Here in the Asia-Pacific nobody has more at stake when it comes to climate change. Here a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that ­submerge Pacific islands,’’ Mr Obama said.

“In Australia it means longer droughts, more wildfires. The natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened. Worldwide, this past summer was the hottest on ­record.

“And you will recall at the beginning I said the US and Australia have a lot in common. Well, one of the things we have in common is we produce a lot of carbon. I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back and I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit. And I want that there 50 years from now.’’ Mr Obama also secured a round of applause for supporting women, gays and lesbians.

“We’ll stand up for our gay and lesbian fellow citizens,’’ he said. “I believe that the best measure of whether a nation is going to be successful is whether it is tapping the talents of its women.” And on Russia: “We’re leading in opposing Russia’s aggression, which is a threat to the world — which we saw in the appalling shoot down of MH17, a tragedy that took so many innocent lives, among them your fellow citizens.

“ As your ally and friend, America shares the grief of these Australian families, and we share the determination of your nation for justice and accountability.”Earlier, Mr Abbott opened the G20 by outlining his domestic agenda, including axing the carbon tax and a new $7 GP fee, a decision Labor leader Bill Shorten described as “weird and graceless.”

Australia to be hub of planned infrastructure boom to play out around the world.

Australia will take centre stage in an infrastructure boom to play out around the world, as the G20 pursues an ambitious plan to boost growth and jobs and in which development will play a key role.

However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has talked down the prospect of contributing to a global climate fund, which has been strongly backed by the US and Japan, or shifting away from coal-fired power in coming decades.

The G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane concluded on Sunday with a pledge to collectively boost growth by 2.1 per cent over the current trajectory by 2018, which if successful will add $US2 trillion ($A2.2 trillion) to global activity.

Each G20 member provided a list of more than 800 policies and programs they will put in place to create millions of jobs.

"We set a goal, we developed a plan, and we believe we have implemented it," Mr Abbott said.

"It is all about the people of the world being better off through the achievement of inclusive growth and jobs."

Australia's pledges largely come from the 2014/15 budget, much of which is being blocked in the Senate.

But one new measure will be a global infrastructure hub based in Sydney to bring together governments, banks and business to support a private sector-led project pipeline and help smooth access to financing.

Having the hub in Australia puts the nation in the box seat to help coordinate an anticipated global activity boom.

Mr Abbott said a commitment to close the gender gap in labour force participation by 25 per cent by 2025 could bring 100 million women into the global workforce.

The government has previously committed to creating one million new jobs over five years.

The initial wording of a paragraph in the G2 communique on climate change was modified after intervention by US and European leaders who wanted to include support for the UN's Green Climate Fund to help poor countries and encourage countries to commit to new emissions targets well before the Paris climate summit in December 2015.

"We will be making further decisions at the right time," the prime minister said on how the government would respond.

US President Barack Obama welcomed the strategy to boost infrastructure spending, strengthen banks, close tax loopholes and stop tax evaders.

"We have made very concrete progress," he said.

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will monitor G20 member pledges and report on their progress.

"The action plan was great but needs to be implemented," IMF chief Christine Lagarde said.

"We'll make sure we keep their feet to the fire."

Leaders expressed deep concern about the humanitarian and economic impact of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, promising to "do all we can to sustain and respond to the crisis".

China will host the 2016 summit after Turkey takes on the presidency for 2015.

Key points from G20 summit agreements:

-- Global infrastructure hub in Sydney to support best practices and coordination.

-- Close the male-female labour force participation gap by 25 per cent by 2025.

-- Prevent abuse of anonymous shell companies to facilitate illicit financial flows stemming from corruption, tax evasion and money laundering.

-- Complete by the end of 2015 a plan to tackle tax avoidance by multinational companies.

-- Release of new climate targets before December 2015 UN summit in Paris.

-- Support for climate finance.

-- Energy efficiency policies from cleaner fuels to smarter buildings.

-- Progress on international financial reform.

Three countries agree to stronger defence ties and jointly call for a peaceful settlement of maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region.

Australia, the US and Japan have agreed to stronger defence ties and jointly called for a peaceful settlement of maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region.

The meeting between Tony Abbott, Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the G20 summit came a day after the US President vowed use "every element" of America's power to ensure peace and stability.

Mr Obama also said regional security shouldn't be based on "coercion or intimidation ... where big nations bully the small, but on alliances for mutual security".

By the end of this decade, the US is set to deploy most of its navy and airforce to the region.

The three leaders agreed on Sunday - at their first trilateral meeting since 2007 - to boost joint military exercises.

In the statement, they urged "freedom of navigation and over-flight, and the peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in accordance with international law".

China is in dispute with four South East Asian countries over territories in the South China Sea, and with Japan over another set of islets.

"The three leaders reaffirmed the global reach of their cooperation and the value of comprehensive US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region," the statement said.

A trilateral military exercise is understood to be planned for June 2015 in Queensland.

Australia's interest in Japan as a possible supplier of replacement submarines for the Collins class is also understood to have come up.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will deliver a speech to parliament in Canberra on Monday, where he will outline his vision for the region and commitment to peace and stability.

President Xi has also signalled a closer defence relationship with Australia, which is a major trading partner.

Prime Minister Abbott told the two other leaders at the start of the meeting: "It's good to be here with two such economic and strategic partners."

They also resolved to tackle the spread of Ebola, Islamic State extremists as well as Russia's annexation of Crimea and actions "to destabilise eastern Ukraine".

The first leader-level trilateral dialogue between Australia, the US and Japan took place in Sydney, involving Mr Abe, John Howard and George W Bush.

A SURGEON working in Sierra Leone who was diagnosed with ebola is being flown to the United States to be treated at a Nebraska hospital, according to Sierra Leone and US officials.

According to the New York Post, Dr Martin Salia, 44, a citizen of ­Sierra Leone, will be treated at the Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha. He will be the first non-US patient to be treated in America.

Dr Salia, who reportedly lives in Maryland as a permanent US resident, was paying for the medical evacuation, which was to take place yesterday, the US Embassy in ­Freetown said.

He will be the third ebola patient at the Omaha hospital and the 10th to be treated in the US.

The last patient, Dr Craig ­Spencer, was released on Tuesday from Bellevue Hospital after being declared free of the virus.

Dr Salia initially tested negative for the disease after showing ­symptoms on November 6, but later tested positive and is in a ­stable condition in Freetown.

Sierra Leone, Guinea and ­Liberia have been ravaged by ebola, which has killed more than 5000 people. Nebraska Medical Centre, one of four US hospitals with specialised ebola treatment facilities, was chosen for Dr Salia because healthcare workers at Atlanta’s Emory University ­Hospital and the National Institutes of Health near Washington are still in a 21-day monitoring ­period.

Those two hospitals treated Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, two Dallas nurses who were infected while caring for Thomas Eric ­Duncan, a Liberian man who later died of the disease.The other eight ebola patients in the US recovered, including the nurses.

Spies have a picnic at a G20 covered with bugs

POLITICIANS and officials who attended the 2009 G20 summit in London learned last year that their computers and phone calls had been intercepted by spy agencies under the ­instructions of their hosts.

Few of the most senior delegates targeted would have been greatly surprised by the espionage efforts.

Officials have long been urged not to use their laptops, photocopiers, wi-fi or their usual mobile phones at such international summits. Most assume others are trying to ­listen in.

In London, the 2009 operation was unusual largely for the fact that it leaked, as a ­result of the activities of ­National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The spying involved tricking delegates into using internet cafes established by British spooks who subjected their emails and passwords to key-logging software and ­interception programs.

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin was forced to deny reports in the Italian press that USB flash drives and cables cheerfully offered to charge phones were equipped with Trojan horse technology.

Australian politicians still prefer BlackBerrys to iPhones because they are regarded as more secure, but the 2009 G20 spy operation again confirmed spy agencies had no trouble penetrating that security either to monitor calls and emails.

According to the Snowden leaks, a team of 45 analysts worked on providing an around-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at the international summit.

At home, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently ­revealed she was forced to get a new phone after spy intelligence agencies suggested it had been compromised.

In the lead-up to the G20 in Brisbane, the Australian Signals Directorate released public advice saying that the “targeting of high-profile events such as the G20 by state-sponsored or other foreign adversaries, cyber criminals and issue-motivated groups is a real threat’’.

The ASD’s official role is to provide foreign signals intelligence to the Australian Defence Force and government. It warned that the information contained on government systems, “whether classified or unclassified, is of strategic ­interest to cyber adversaries”.

The long list of international summits targeted in the past that the ASD noted included “malicious emails sent targeting Australian government agencies in an attempt to compromise their networks and obtain sensitive information’’ during ASEAN events.

Last year, APEC and G20-themed malicious emails were also sent to multiple Australian government agencies. According to the ASD the most common technique was the “socially engineered email’’.

“The aim of malicious cyber actors is to gain access to information any way possible. These adversaries look for a weak link to try and break into a network. It is important to ­remember that you may be targeted even if you are not ­directly involved with the event,’’ it stated.

Former ASIO director David Irvine also warned in June of “hacktivist protesters’’ but noted that intelligence gathering exercises were something individual delegations would look after.

‘‘Obviously there are going to be significant attempts to collect information relevant to G20. That’s something individual delegations … will have to handle their own way,’’ he said.

Against this backdrop, the cheerful bonhomie of world leaders touring the international summits of the globe with the ever present expectation that your phone is being bugged is something to behold.

“Overseas visits by prime ministers can be about protocol and diplomacy,’’ noted British PM David Cameron when he addressed Australia’s Parliament. “Of course, we Poms are known for our bluntness, and we never really get your tendency to beat around the bush and not say what you really mean.’’ Everyone got the joke. After dealing with US President Barack Obama’s headline-stealing effort at the G20 summit to force climate change to centre stage, Tony Abbott would have been grateful for Cameron’s diplomacy. Even if it did ­include one message abroad and another at the G20.

Only days before he left for the G20, Cameron took to Twitter to say that “problems with the global economy and ebola will be top of agenda’’.But just days later, after landing in Australia and mindful of friction over the Abbott government’s ebola response, Cameron tweeted: “The Australian PM and I agree: growth, jobs and security will be at the heart of this G20.’’

How perfect baby Gammy opened my eyes to choice

BABY Gammy changed my mind about Down syndrome.

In my 20s, and maybe even my early 30s, when the prospect of pregnancy was a way off, I thought I couldn’t bear to put a child through a life of suffering if I had the choice.

Seeing Gammy — an Australian child born to a surrogate in Thailand — being lavished with love by his birth mother made me grasp, for the first time in a really visceral way, why the parents of children with Down syndrome say their kids are a gift.

It is embarrassing to admit this, but the footage of Gammy was the first time I’d really understood the obvious truth: that Down syndrome children are just children. They’re not defined by their genetic make-up. They are perfect. Of course they are.

The families of children affected by Down syndrome talk about the complete delight they enjoy in their kids. Children with the syndrome live longer, fuller, richer lives today thanks to the advancements of medicine, special-needs care, education and broader social awareness.

But when you’re sitting in a radiology clinic, waiting for a doctor to analyse a scan for risks to your unborn child’s life and health, Down syndrome is terrifying.

I’ve never faced the horrendous choice so many parents have to make: will we proceed with a pregnancy that might result in an innocent child suffering in any way? If we can save our baby from even a moment’s discomfort or discrimination, will we?

As reproductive science advances, that scenario faces more and more Australians every single day. Parents-to-be — including those who have spent fruitless years trying to conceive — are having to grapple with appalling decisions about the future of foetuses and embryos that might or might not be viable.

Karyomapping, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, scanning for Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis testing and all the other screening — they all add up to a wondrous wealth of knowledge for parents-to-be.

But all this choice — just like the miraculous bounty available in our supermarkets — can be a curse. Freedom of choice sounds great in theory. In practice, the choice can become something more like: “Shall we take the risk that this child will live in pain, or die prematurely in a terrible way? If we make the wrong decision, are we ruthlessly sacrificing a life?” The horror of choice is the underside of all the wonderful things about our 21st century.

The broad sweep of human history is that, over time, everything basically keeps getting better. We live longer. We eat better. We grow taller, stronger, healthier. Ancient diseases are forgotten, and new ones are taken on and conquered.

That’s how, broadly, childbirth and infancy have been transformed. Pregnancy and delivery have changed from moments of mortal danger to a Hallmark card. The old superstitions about not buying baby clothes before the actual birth have gone. Now we enrol kids in high school within hours of their arrival in the obstetric ward. Deaths, of course, still happen in birth and infancy, but they are relative rarities rather than the norm.

It’s shocking, today, to reflect that our grandparents, and all the hundreds of thousands of generations before, faced the real risk any baby might die in its first days alive or be born with a deformity or a disability. A mother had to deal with the real prospect, all the way through gestation, birth and infancy, of attending a funeral instead of a christening, of grief instead of joy.

And in return we have gained these choices. If we implant this embryo or proceed with this pregnancy are we actually being cruel? Are we selfish if we allow a child to be born who might endure physical pain, or discrimination, or who might die in infancy? If we “terminate”, to use the coldest word in the English language, are we murderers?

And what guarantee does any baby have? No child, even the most perfectly formed infants born into the safety of a tertiary hospital in a glittering city, comes with a warranty. Every parent, no matter how rational, has lain awake in at least a moment’s fear: what if my baby dies in an accident? What about disease? Could someone snatch my child away? Whooping cough? Ebola?

You might think it’s wrong for parents to play god, that we shouldn’t have to deal with those decisions; they’re too much for humans to grapple with. You might think all this is a slippery slope. If today we’re testing embryos for breast-cancer genes and Huntington’s disease, will we soon be testing for autism? For asthma?I hope not. I do know this: it’s too late to turn back this tide of choice. The information is there, and it’s not going away. Many of our ancient burdens have been lifted. Somehow, we have to learn how to deal with new ones.

Brisbane rests easy after a successful G20

THE G20 leaders' summit is over and world leaders are dashing home as Brisbane prepares to return to normal.

FOR world leaders and for Brisbane, the G20 summit is finally over.

Barely had the official G20 summary been released and the leaders were off, with US President Barack Obama in the air soon after the summit wrapped up on Sunday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't even hang around that long, citing the need to get back to Moscow and catch up on his sleep as he headed to the special G20 airport in Brisbane before proceedings had even finished.

Brisbanites will soon get their city back as the riot fences are removed and special laws that made it illegal to carry reptiles on some streets expire.

Police declared it a triumph, with no major incidents reported from the 6000 officers deployed to patrol the often empty streets in the city's CBD and south bank areas.

The mercury soared, with snipers atop Brisbane rooftops reporting extreme temperatures beyond 60 degrees Celsius.

Protests were numerous, colourful, but peaceful.

Inside the giant Brisbane convention centre, 3000 journalists from across the globe bunkered down to cover the G20 proceedings.

In the end the business side of the two-day spectacle was distilled into an unassuming three-page communique.

G20 leaders - the heads of the world's largest developed and emerging economies - pledged to do their bit to grow the global pie.

The overarching goal is to achieve more than two per cent economic growth in the bloc above business as usual by 2018.

The real test will be whether countries come good on their promises, but that's really for the next G20 host - Turkey - to oversee.

There were also commitments to crackdown on tax avoidance, bolster financial markets from shocks and shore up the banks deemed "too big to fail".

But despite the Abbott government's wish for a narrow agenda under its G20 presidency, there was much more to the G20 than just jobs and growth.

Climate change and the Ebola outbreak were hot topics, dominating talks on the sidelines of the main event.

The show-stopping moment was Mr Obama's speech to students at the University of Queensland, a grandiose affair given blanket coverage by global media.

The US president added much needed humour, conviction and spectacle to a summit predominantly comprised of closed door talks between colourless functionaries.

Other highlights were the "family" photo of G20 leaders - a potentially tense diplomatic exercise - and the awkward hand gestures shared by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Mr Putin.

The mantle now gets passed to Turkey, who assumes the G20 presidency in December and will host next year's leaders' meeting.

For Australia, the fun and games continues.

Indian president Narendra Modi, Chinese president Xi Jinping, French president Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will hang around a few days for non-G20 events.

Mr Modi and Mr Xi will have the honour of addressing federal parliament in Canberra this week.

Abbott wraps up G20 largely unscathed

THE G20 presented Prime Minister Tony Abbott with an unprecedented opportunity to prove if he's got what it takes to be an international stateman.

THE prime minister was already under fire for refusing to put climate change on the G20 agenda and instead doggedly pursuing his growth and jobs plan.

But it was his decision to air domestic grievances before the leaders of the world's most powerful economies that attracted the fieriest rebuke from his political enemies.

In his G20 welcome Abbott lamented how "massively difficult" it was to get his budget measures through parliament and boasted of repealing the carbon tax and stopping asylum seeker boats.

Given the prime minister called the G20 the world's most important economic forum, perhaps the argy bargy of Canberra shouldn't have been aired.

It was particularly jarring when compared to Barack Obama's soaring oration later in the day.

Labor stuck the knife in, with Bill Shorten describing Abbott's speech as "weird" and a "bizarre parochial little Australian contribution."

"World leaders are here to talk about Ebola, security, inclusive growth, global free-trade, climate change and instead we have Tony Abbott bringing his shopping list of domestic whinges," he said.

A spoof article doing the rounds on social media captured the sentiment with the headline: "Abbott To Address G20 Leaders On Parking Issues In His Warringah Electorate".

The government's insistence that climate change wouldn't be a top G20 priority ended up creating more trouble that it was worth.

The issue overshadowed the summit and left Abbott on the back foot when it became clear world leaders had other other ideas about its importance.

Eventually a paragraph was included into the official G20 communique referencing climate change, but the whole sideshow was an unedifying distraction.

Abbott resolved the "shirt fronting" tension with Vladimir Putin at APEC ahead of the G20 and helped deflect the expectation a showdown was imminent with the Russian leader.

The summit did provide Abbott an unprecedented opportunity to hobnob with world leaders and act the statesman on his own turf.

The photo ops with some of the most recognised people on earth holding koalas also didn't hurt.

He made time to court several foreign leaders personally and got some diplomatic runs on the board.

Abbott said he didn't want his G20 to be a talkfest and the summit did produce a growth plan, but time will tell if anything much else came from this two-day spectacle.

Aust outmanoeuvered on climate change

IT was the one issue Australia fought to keep off the G20 agenda. Instead, that approach saw climate change dominate the summit.

THE coalition did its absolute best to keep climate change off the official Brisbane G20 agenda but in the end was powerless to stop the leader of the free world levering it into the discussion.

Australia was outmanoeuvred before the G20 had even begun.

Just days before the summit China and the US - the world's two largest polluters - broadsided the Abbott camp by announcing an ambitious new plan to slash carbon emissions by 2030.

The deal, hailed by global leaders, was all the buzz in Brisbane and left the government struggling to justify why climate change wasn't being given air time.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott had argued the G20 was an economic forum and there were more appropriate gatherings to discuss the climate.

Things got worse before the summit officially got underway on Saturday afternoon.

US President Barack Obama, speaking at the most publicised event of the entire summit, warned the Great Barrier Reef could disappear within decades if action wasn't taken.

It was a powerful appeal not only to the G20 hosts Australia and Queensland, but to all Australians.

Mr Obama also answered UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon's call for developed nations to give generously to a green fund to help poorer nations deal with "the defining issue of our times".

The US committed $US3 billion, with Japan on Sunday saying it would chip in $US1.5 billion. Australia is yet to make a formal contribution.

However, Australia eventually relented on the climate change issue - not without a fight, apparently - and agreed to a paragraph in the official G20 communique.

But the fact the agenda was targeted by the US shouldn't have come as a surprise.

For most of the year the European Union and the US have been among the most vocal critics about the absence of climate change from the agenda.

The government painted itself into a corner by declining to consider issues outside its growth and jobs focus, despite the obvious desire of other G20 members to give climate change a hearing.

Australia's reluctance won't be mirrored by next year's hosts Turkey, who will not only put climate high on the agenda but have pledged to canvass everything from Ebola to refugees.

A STATEMENT issued by leaders at the G20 meeting in Brisbane has voiced deep concern about the world's worst outbreak of Ebola.

A G20 leaders' statement issued on Saturday in Brisbane has voiced deep concern about the world's worst outbreak of Ebola, which has so far killed more than 5000 people in West Africa.

"This outbreak illustrates the urgency of addressing longer-term systemic issues and gaps in capability, preparedness and response capacity that expose the global economy to the impacts of infectious disease," the statement said.

The statement came after US President Barack Obama earlier on Saturday used a speech at the University of Queensland to also challenge nations to do more on Ebola.

The leaders' statement said the G20 was committed to doing what was necessary to ensure international efforts "extinguish" the deadly virus.

A commitment was also made to use bilateral, regional and multilateral channels, in partnership with aid groups, to combat the crisis.

"We will work to expedite the effective and targeted disbursement of funds and other assistance, balancing between emergency and longer-term needs," the statement said.

The statement also urged that countries give more than just money to fight the disease, including sending qualified and trained medical teams and personnel, as well as equipment.

Earlier, Mr Obama warned that while the latest outbreak had been largely confined to West Africa, the virus represented a risk for all.

"We cannot build a mote around our countries and we shouldn't try," he said.

BATTLING EXTREMISM

BRITISH Prime Minister David Cameron has ramped up pressure on social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook to remove terrorist and extremist material from their sites or face being legislated.

In an address to the Australian Parliament yesterday in which he also revealed new anti-terrorism laws for the UK, Mr Cameron had a blunt message for social media companies whose platforms have become the media of choice for terror groups.

“A new and pressing challenge is getting extremist material taken down from the internet,’’ Mr Cameron said in only the second address to a joint sitting of the federal parliament by a British leader.

“There is a role for government in that. We must not allow the internet to be an ungoverned space. But there is a role for companies too.

“In the UK we are pushing companies to do more, including strengthening filters, improving reporting mechanisms and being more proactive in taking down this harmful material.

“This is their social responsibility. And we expect them to live up to it.” Mr Cameron and Prime Minister Tony Abbott flew to Brisbane yesterday afternoon to join other world leaders ahead of the arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin, for the start of today’s G20 summit.

In paving the road for a potentially rocky meeting, Mr Abbott yesterday accused Mr Putin of trying to resurrect the Soviet empire and said the world would be better disposed to Russia if it acted as a merchant for peace. Mr Cameron echoed the tough language, calling Russia a bully and reminding Europe of the lessons of history. He said he didn’t believe there was a military solution to Russia’s behaviour in East Ukraine and believed economic sanctions were taking effect.

Mr Cameron traversed a range of issues in the first UK leader’s address to federal Parliament since Tony Blair in 2006, including the long shared military ties and the threat of trade protectionism, while having a subtle dig at countries such as China, claiming nations could not cheat economic wealth creation by skirting the rule of law.

He vowed to repair the era of “benign neglect” of the Australia/UK relationship, while reminding Aussies of the subtlety of English humour.

“Coming here is like visiting family,” he said.

“And I don’t just say that because my own Australian auntie is watching from the gallery.” Laughter also erupted as he quipped how he thought he was in line for a “shirt-fronting” from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop as she strode towards him at a recent conference in Italy. Instead, Ms Bishop offered support for Britain’s fight against ebola in West Africa.

“I wondered for a moment whether I was heading for what I’m told we now need to call a shirt-fronting,” Mr Cameron said.

“But, no, Julie, who is a great friend of Britain, said Australia would add 100 beds to our ebola treatment facility in Sierra Leone. Typical Australia, always there with action, not words.” The British Conservative leader’s message remained focused on the joint task of both countries to combat the new scourge of terrorism at home and abroad: “In both our countries we have seen some of our young people radicalised, going off to fight in Iraq and Syria, and even appalling plots to murder innocent people.

“We have to confront this threat at its source.” Mr Cameron said his focus for the G20 would be fighting protectionism: “One of the greatest threats to our success is the spectre of protectionism. Opening up trade doesn’t cost jobs, it creates them.”íEDITORIAL PAGE 42

World bank outlines progress on plans for 'virtual economic buffer', reiterates risk of future pandemics.

The proposal for a global public health corp that could be rapidly deployed to deal with epidemics such as the Ebola crisis ravaging West Africa is gathering support.

The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has revealed progress has been made in discussions on a proposal for countries to sign up to a contingency fund to prevent future outbreaks, that could instantly disperse billions of dollars for personnel, equipment and logistical support.

Speaking on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brisbane, Dr Kim said the fund would provide a "virtual buffer" for the world economy should another epidemic break out, with details of how it would work possibly finalised as early as the next six months.

"I just want to stress that pandemics, epidemics in fact are a very real downside risk to the global economy. They are also human tragedies, they are public health emergencies," Dr Kim said.

"It would require putting together something like a global public health corp. People from all over the world could be ready to respond at a moment's notice."

The comments came amid calls from aid groups and world leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama, for the Ebola crisis to be elevated as a key issue at the G20 meeting, and for nations to do more to combat the deadly virus.

Dr Kim said the fund could disperse millions and "many billions of dollars if necessary".

G20 to make world 'better off': Abbott

Negotiators say resolutions within reach on tax reform, anti-corruption measures.

G20 summit host Tony Abbott is confident the outcomes of this weekend's global leaders' meeting will make the world a better place.

Negotiators who've done the lion's share of the work before the summit say the key outstanding issues are tax reform and tackling corruption, although resolutions are within reach.

"The world will be substantially better off as a result of this," the Australian prime minister said at a meeting with 26 global corporate executives on Friday.

While Mr Abbott has made "growth and jobs" the focus of Australia's G20 presidency, other issues vying for attention include Ebola, climate change, Islamic extremism and Russia's military muscle-flexing.

On Sunday the G20 leaders will unveil the Brisbane Action Plan - a statement on how they will collectively achieve a two per cent boost in world growth by 2018 - which will include the strategies of individual countries.

There will also be a final communique and reports from 10 working groups, on issues from tax to energy efficiency.

Labour unions and business chiefs, meeting as the L20 and B20, as well as civil society groups (C20), produced a mixed bag of advice to G20 leaders on the eve of the summit.

Union boss Sharan Burrow said higher wages and a commitment by each country to spend one per cent of domestic output on infrastructure annually could more than double the overall growth target and create more than 30 million jobs.

B20 chairman Richard Goyder said a combination of more flexible labour laws, tax reform, a co-ordinated effort on infrastructure and tackling corruption could deliver 50 million jobs and economic activity worth $3 trillion.

C20 chairman Tim Costello wants the leaders to ensure the benefits of growth flow to the poorest in the G20.

"If the benefits only go into profits for the top five per cent, it is not real growth but entrenches the inequality. Then the G20 would have failed," he said.

Mr Abbott conflated the issue of Russia's military assertiveness with economic issues during a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who addressed the Australian parliament on Friday.

"Interestingly, Russia's economy is declining even as Russia's assertiveness is increasing," he said.

"Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace ... instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union."

Russia and China are likely to take a dim view of a trilateral meeting between Mr Abbott, US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the G20 summit to discuss greater defence co-operation.

G20 members have not ruled out further sanctions against Russia over its support for separatists in the Ukraine.

Mr Cameron and Mr Obama want the Ebola crisis in West Africa on the discussion agenda, as they seek to bolster funding and expertise to fight the spread of the killer virus.

Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, whose nation will hold the 2015 G20 presidency, said the G20 agenda shouldn't be limited to the global economy.

Climate change was "the biggest challenge to humanity", he said, and deserved attention at the next summit.
