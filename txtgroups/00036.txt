Grim prognostications of pestilence are as old as the Book of Revelation, but they have not gone out of style or been rendered moot. Plague is a tribulation that science, technology and social engineering haven’t fixed. In the mid-1960s, some public health officials imagined that antibiotics and other modern therapies would enable us to ‘‘close the book’’ on infectious diseases and so make it possible to focus on noncommunicable afflictions, like heart attack, diabetes and stroke. But that optimism was mistaken.

By one account, published in Nature in 2008, more than 300 instances of emerging infectious diseases occurred between 1940 and 2004. These included both the first appearance of scary new viral diseases (like SARS), with the potential to cause global pandemics, and the re-emergence of older bacterial infections in new forms (like antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus), which are less dramatic but also capable of causing illness and death on a large scale. The authors of that study warned that global resources to counter disease emergence were poorly allocated, with most new outbreaks occurring in tropical countries, and most scientific and surveillance efforts concentrated elsewhere.

The most gruesome emergent diseases — like those caused by Ebola virus in Africa or Nipah virus in Asia — affect relatively few. The most devastating, AIDS, is caused by a devious, patient virus that wages slow-motion war against the human body, with mortal consequences for millions. The most explosive — SARS in 2002, or some recent strains of influenza — had the potential, but for prompt action and good luck, to claim many more victims than they did.

AIDS, SARS, Ebola virus and many other new diseases have one thing in common: they are zoonotic. This means they came from nonhuman animals and made the leap to humans. The infectious agent might be a virus, or a bacterium, or another sort of parasitic microbe, or a worm; the animal in which it resides inconspicuously, before spilling over into humans, is known as its reservoir host. The reservoir host might be a bat (as with the SARS virus), or a rodent (the various hantaviruses), or a chimpanzee (H.I.V.-1). The reservoir host of Ebola virus is still unidentified — a lingering mystery — though bats again are suspected. And all of our influenzas (even the so-called swine flus) originate in wild aquatic birds.

We now know from molecular evidence (published by Beatrice H. Hahn, Michael Worobey and their collaborators) that the pandemic strain of H.I.V. went from a single chimpanzee into a single person (presumably by blood-to-blood contact when the chimp was slaughtered for food) around 1908 or earlier, in southeastern Cameroon. The virus then must have passed slowly downriver, human to human, into the large population centers of the Congo basin before spreading worldwide.

Sixty percent of human infectious diseases, including the worst of the old ones and the scariest of the new, are zoonotic. Now disease experts wonder about the ‘‘next big one:’’ when will it come, what will it look like, from which reservoir host will it spill over, and how many people will it kill?

Prediction is difficult. But we can be reasonably confident on a few points. The worst new diseases of the future, like those of the recent past, will be zoonotic. Unfamiliar pathogens come to people from wildlife or livestock. The scariest of the new bugs will probably be viruses. Formidable, hardy, opportunistic and impervious to antibiotics, viruses replicate and evolve quickly. They exist in extraordinary diversity and seem ever ready to colonize new hosts.

Experts believe that the next global pandemic is likely to be caused by a virus with high ‘‘intrinsic evolvability,’’ meaning that it mutates especially quickly or recombines elements of its genetic material during the process of replication. It crackles and snaps with accidental variation. Darwin told us that variation is the raw material of adaptive change; and adaptive change is what enables an organism to thrive in unfamiliar conditions — including human hosts.

In 1997, Dr. Donald S. Burke cautioned that the watch list of candidate viruses for the next global pandemic — the ones with high intrinsic evolvability — should include the influenzas, the retroviruses (like H.I.V.-1 and H.I.V.-2), and the coronavirus family (including SARS). His warning was validated when SARS emerged.

Precise prediction may not be possible, but informed vigilance is. Intrepid disease ecologists are hiking into forests, climbing through caves, visiting remote communities to investigate small outbreaks, gathering evidence of novel infections, and sleuthing the mysteries of reservoir host and spillover. In labs, other scientists are developing sophisticated new molecular tools for quickly identifying and characterizing new viruses. Private, governmental and international health institutions support scientific efforts and public-health planning to limit the scope of coming pandemics.

There are issues of civil liberties and privacy, as well as issues of public health, to be faced as we prepare for the ‘‘next big one.’’ Consider the matter of travel. When Dr. Burke issued his warning, you could get on an airplane just about anywhere carrying a pocketknife. You can’t do that anymore. But you can still board a plane carrying a virus. This may change. Soon, it will be possible to identify quickly who is or is not infected with a dangerous new virus, and the carriers may be excluded from certain activities — or worse. During smallpox outbreaks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some American communities instituted compulsory vaccination and forcible confinement in pesthouses. A 21st-century version, based on similar fears about a new zoonotic virus, might involve cheek-swabbing and speedy molecular diagnostics at airport security checkpoints, followed by ... who knows what sort of quarantine for those carrying the bug.

We’ll need to balance between individual liberties and the health of the human herd. Field research in areas of high biological diversity, careful scrutiny of the interactions of humans and wildlife, control of the killing and transport of wild animals for food, attention to the disease threats inherent in factory-scale livestock husbandry, efficient sampling and diagnostic tools, global monitoring networks, better vaccines, better antiviral drugs, and contingency plans for confining and controlling outbreaks — these represent our best defenses against the ‘‘next big one.’’ We can’t prevent another malign bug from entering the human population. But will it kill a few thousand people, or tens of millions?

The answer may depend not just on the nature of the virus, and on the density and abundance of Homo sapiens on this planet, but also on the particulars of how we respond. Viruses are adaptable and heedless. Humans are adaptable and smart.

Diseases That Spread From Animals

In his Op-Ed, David Quammen explores the origins of potential afflictions that might cause future pandemics. This accompanying article looks deeper at the symptoms, circumstances and fallout that characterized the Black Death, Spanish Influenza, Ebola virus, AIDS and SARS.

December 1347, The Black Death

A catastrophic wave of disease reaches southern France, Sicily and other locations in southeastern Europe, having spread along the Silk Road from a point of origin in Central Asia or China. Symptoms include fever, bloody vomiting and swelling in the groin, armpits and neck. Most victims die quickly.

The Black Death sweeps across Europe, killing tens of millions of people -- possibly as much as 60 percent of the Continent's population. Its cause -- recently confirmed by molecular research -- is Yersinia pestis, the plague bacterium, carried by rodents and passed among them (and to humans) by fleas.

Plague still exists, as an endemic infection of rodents in many parts of the world -- and it can still be passed to humans -- but nowadays it is easily treated with antibiotics.

Many infectious diseases tormented humanity during the later Middle Ages and into the modern era. Among these were typhus, cholera and yellow fever. And then came . . .

March 1918, Spanish Influenza

It's the crescendo of World War I, and a doctor in the small town of Haskell, Kansas, is treating several cases of influenza. Around the same time an unusual number of soldiers at the nearby Camp Funston report to the camp hospital with fever, headaches and other symptoms suggesting influenza.

From Camp Funston many soldiers move to other U.S. bases and to France in crowded troop carriers, spreading the infection as they go. In August a second strain emerges, more virulent than the first. After two years the global influenza pandemic, exacerbated by war-related stresses and increased travel has killed an estimated 50 million people.

Later molecular research on preserved material from victims reveals that the responsible bug was a H1N1 influenza. It originated, like all human influenzas, in wild aquatic birds. What made efforts to stem the disease especially difficult at the time was that scientists then were incapable of seeing or identifying a virus -- this one or any other. They thought the pandemic was caused by a bacterium. Bacterial pneumonia may indeed have been a complicating factor in many cases. Then again, because this was before antibiotics, there was no highly effective treatment against the bacterial infections either.

August 1976, Ebola Virus

At a hospital in northern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), a local man seeks treatment for a fever. Within two weeks he is dead. In the course of an outbreak that burns through the hospital and surrounding villages, another 279 people die -- roughly 90 percent of those infected. An international response team assembled by the World Health Organization helps curb and investigate the outbreak. They isolate a new virus and name it ''Ebola,'' after a nearby river.

Further outbreaks have occurred in the decades since, in various parts of Central Africa, many involving dozens or hundreds of human deaths.

Five species of Ebola-like virus are now known, with the original from Zaire still holding the name Ebola. Most are extremely virulent but none is highly transmissible, and no known outbreak has ever spread death beyond Africa. Ebola itself is a horrific virus, causing fever, abdominal pains, vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes bleeding (though not ''bleeding out'' or organ liquefaction, despite some sensational accounts to the contrary) and other symptoms. Still, it's not likely a pandemic threat.

June 1981, AIDS

A young immunologist named Michael S. Gottlieb, working in Los Angeles, publishes the first medical alert of a new syndrome -- a syndrome of failing immune systems among five male homosexual patients. The illness proves widespread, transmitted by sexual contact (not just among homosexuals), intravenous injection and blood transfusions, and is soon known to the world as AIDS. By 1984 researchers in the United States and France find its cause -- a retrovirus eventually known as H.I.V.-1. (H.I.V.-2, less virulent and less transmissible, is discovered in 1985.) By 2011, according to the most recent figures from W.H.O., about 35 million people have died of AIDS and 34 million others are living with H.I.V.

Although the alarms didn't sound until 1981, recent molecular work on archived tissues suggests that H.I.V.-1 entered the human population as early as the first decade of the 20th century. It seems to have spilled over from a chimpanzee host, probably through blood-to-blood contact, during a fateful hunting incident in southeastern Cameroon.

February 2003, SARS

Dr. Liu Jianlun, a physician from Guangzhou, China, checks into the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. He has come for a family wedding despite feeling ill. His condition worsens, and by sneezing or coughing, or perhaps vomiting, he spreads his infection to other guests in the hotel. Those guests depart for their own homeward journeys, to Toronto, Singapore and elsewhere.

About 8,000 people worldwide become sick, and 774 of them die from what by then has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome before the outbreak is halted in July.

The SARS virus, once identified, proves to be of the coronavirus family. It resides endemically in bats. Highly transmissible, highly adaptable (it mutates quickly) and highly lethal, it stands as a model for scientists of the kind of virus that might cause a devastating pandemic in the future.

The list of infectious diseases that could leap from remote areas of the world to strike countries thousands of miles away is growing. A warning of what can happen occurred a decade ago when an outbreak in China of a mysterious new viral disease, known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was covered up by the Chinese authorities, allowing infected airline passengers to carry the virus to more than two dozen other countries. The disease killed nearly 800 people and caused large economic losses in Asia and Canada.

Now longstanding worries that such deadly viruses as Ebola might be carried from Africa to the United States and elsewhere have been joined by new concerns. These include, among others: potentially dangerous strains of avian flu recently detected in China; a newly discovered and often lethal lung disease, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which has so far been found mostly in Saudi Arabia; multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis that are very difficult to treat; and a painful mosquito-borne viral disease known as Chikungunya fever, which was first detected in Africa, spread to Asia and Europe, and recently invaded the Caribbean.

Beyond these natural threats lurk man-made threats, such as biological weapons that could kill millions and the danger that deadly pathogens being studied in laboratories might escape confinement or be deliberately released to set off a pandemic.

It made good sense, then, when the Obama administration, after meeting with representatives of three United Nations agencies and 26 countries last week, announced an ambitious plan to improve the surveillance and treatment of infectious diseases over the next five years in up to 30 countries.

There is much to be done. Although 196 countries have signed an international agreement, reached in 2005, to report outbreaks promptly to the World Health Organization and take steps to control them, the vast majority have not fully complied. The odds for improvement this time around may be better. The health systems in poor countries, though still fragile, have improved thanks to international programs to combat AIDS and other diseases, and those systems could be expanded.

A pilot project in Uganda last year, supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showed that biological specimens from sick patients could be gathered in remote areas of the country and carried by motorcycle and overnight delivery service to a well-equipped central laboratory, and the test results could be transmitted back by cellphone to the remote areas. A new technology currently being tested in Uganda is a dipstick, like those used for pregnancy tests, that can diagnose pneumonic and bubonic plague at the patient's bedside in 20 minutes.

A relatively small investment can get this health security initiative off the ground. The Defense Department and C.D.C. are spending a combined $40 million this year (mostly from the Pentagon budget) to help detect and contain infectious disease threats in 10 countries. The administration said that it will propose an increase of $45 million in the C.D.C. budget for 2015 to help additional countries.

Congress ought to approve that money. A five-year program to extend assistance to 30 countries to protect their populations could cost the United States up to $1.5 billion, which would be worth spending if the initial projects prove successful. Other advanced nations need to contribute money and expertise, too. Diseases know no borders, and a health crisis in one country could, without control, become our own.

A POISON of choice since antiquity, belladonna has been linked to witches, sorcerers, kings and queens -- all with murder on their minds. Also known as deadly nightshade, it is part of the Medicinal and Poison Plants Tour at the United States Botanic Garden, said Beth Burrous, the tour's creator.

Despite its lethal history, belladonna also has medicinal uses, such as those of scopolamine, a belladonna product for relief from motion sickness, Dr. Burrous said. ''Plants make substances that are poisonous or medicinal because they are defending themselves against predators.'' Often, ''only a matter of degrees'' separates a cure from a deadly toxin, she added.

Students from the National Capital Poison Center attend her monthly poison plants tour to solidify such distinctions and expand their knowledge on how plants affect human health, Dr. Burrous said. ''These students will be answering emergency calls for poisoning and treating cases of poisoning, many caused by common plants. This gives them real-world context.''

The collaboration between the botanic garden, which houses more than 200 plant species, and the poison center is just one example of how museums are making contributions to health care, said Ford W. Bell, president of the American Alliance of Museums.

According a recent alliance report, ''Museums on Call: How Museums Are Addressing Health Issues,'' museums are opening their doors and collections to promote health literacy, research, medical training and disease prevention.

A science museum like the Field Museum in Chicago, which has been collecting specimens for more than 120 years, is ''an amazing resource,'' said Darin S. Carroll, a microbiologist in the Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With archived specimens from the Field's collection, Dr. Carroll was able to confirm the identity of the species of exotic African rodent imported into the United States that was responsible for an outbreak of monkeypox virus in 2003.

''Instead of us marching across Africa to collect the specimens, which we would never have the funding to do, we can use a collection that already exists,'' Dr. Carroll said, adding that learning more about the natural setting of zoonotic diseases (transmitted from animal to human) like monkeypox ''helps develop more efficient prevention and control strategies.''

''Everyone knows the Field Museum and the Smithsonian are where you go to see mammoths and dinosaurs as a kid,'' he said. ''What they don't know is that behind those exhibit walls are archived specimens and tissues we can use in applied public health research.''

Specimens provide a baseline for institutions like the C.D.C. to study deadly pathogens. The Field recently teamed with the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, also in Chicago, on the Emerging Pathogens Project to help facilitate research into zoonotic diseases like Ebola and SARS.

''We wanted to see if we could fill in the pieces of the biodiversity puzzle so when an outbreak of one of these devastating diseases happens, there is a better infrastructure to answer questions about disease-causing organisms,'' said Shannon Hackett, associate curator of birds at the Field Museum and a director of the Emerging Pathogens Project. ''As humans we tend to think the only linking that matters is people being sick, but you can only answer questions by understanding the rest of biodiversity,'' Dr. Hackett said. ''What were these organisms doing before they got into people?''

In some areas of Africa, she said, birds are infected with malaria but not dying, ''so what is it about their immune system and physiology that allows them to be heavily parasitized but with no symptoms? If we understand that dynamic, can we understand how we might come up with treatment for humans?''

Art museums are well suited for partnerships with health care institutions, particularly when visual-thinking strategies are used to help train future medical practitioners. ''It is a methodology that uses art as a tool to hone communication skills, critical-thinking skills and visual-literacy skills,'' said Hope Torrents, school programs coordinator at the Lowe Art Museum, part of the University of Miami.

She is the creator of the Fine Art of Healthcare, a workshop that employs visual-thinking strategies to help develop diagnostic observation and communication skills for graduate students from the university's health care schools. ''Standing before a piece of art and finding meaning is similar to looking at a patient to generate a possible diagnosis from signs and symptoms,'' Ms. Torrents said. ''Art works so well because it is nuanced, it has ambiguity and there are multiple interpretations.''

Workshops include a mix of students from the university's medical, nursing, psychology and physical therapy curriculums -- and group discussion is encouraged. ''We want to help them understand how important collaboration is before they get out into the field.'' Ms. Torrents said. ''Statistically, misdiagnoses occur more often due to lack of communication or poor communication skills.''

Students have told her that their interviewing skills have improved after attending the workshop, she added, to the benefit of future patients. ''Sometimes diagnosis takes time,'' she said. ''Sometimes you have to back in and start over, and that can include listening to other ideas and even changing your mind.''

Dr. Gauri Agarwal is assistant regional dean for medical curriculum at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Her students attend sessions of the Fine Art of Healthcare as part of their introduction to medical humanities. ''Clinical skills and medical reasoning can only come with seeing patients, but perhaps a mindful approach and certain valuable communication skills can be refined using art,'' Dr. Agarwal said.

''The students have found the experience of learning in a museum to be enjoyable and a valuable counterpart to the science which fills most of their days,'' she added. ''It reminds them that knowledge is only one measure of ability -- the best physicians are those that quietly observe, patiently listen, hear the individuality and perspective of each patient, and are able to effectively communicate.''

Ebola, Killing Scores in Guinea, Threatens Nearby Nations

The first outbreak of Ebola fever in the West African nation of Guinea has killed at least 59 people and may be spreading into nearby countries, international health agencies warned on Monday.

Guinea's Health Ministry said most of the 80 known cases of the disease were in border areas near Sierra Leone and Liberia; early reports of three cases in Conakry, Guinea's capital, were unfounded, experts said.

There were reports of patients with symptoms in both Sierra Leone and Liberia, but no laboratory-confirmed cases, said Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert with the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders.

The dead include some workers who treated early cases.

Most Ebola outbreaks have been in Central African countries. The first, in 1976 in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, killed 280 people. The most recent, in 2012 in Uganda, is thought to have killed fewer than 50.

The outbreak in Guinea is of the Zaire strain, which has a 90 percent mortality rate.

Death is caused by fever and internal bleeding. Human outbreaks usually start after hunters eat the carcass of an ape that died of Ebola -- possibly after eating fruit contaminated by bats, which are the virus's natural reservoir.

But inhabitants of the affected villages in Guinea also eat bats, ''so it's possible for it to skip the apes and go straight from bats to people,'' Dr. Sprecher said.

Once humans are infected, the virus spreads easily in bodily fluids from the sick or the dead.

Outbreaks are contained by isolating the ill and making sure that those treating them wear gloves, masks, goggles, hazardous material suits and other barriers against infection.

Medical teams also take over burials, since some traditional practices, like washing bodies by hand, can lead to infection.

Searching for the sick and educating the public about the danger are also crucial measures, because some people panic and flee during outbreaks and may carry the virus from town to town.

There is no cure, but many patients survive with supportive care.

Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization both have teams in Guinea working with the Health Ministry to contain the outbreak.

Unicef has also sent supplies, including intravenous fluids, oral rehydration solution and bleach, said Dr. Mohamed Ag Ayoya, a Unicef representative in the country.

The outbreak was confirmed on Friday, ''and the government has taken leadership and cognition,'' he added.

The countries threatened by the outbreak are among the world's poorest and cannot mount large public health efforts on their own.

Sierra Leone is the only one of the three nations with a laboratory that can test for Lassa fever, a lethal tropical disease that requires a similar containment response. And ''you have to step it up for Ebola,'' Dr. Sprecher said.

A patient in a Canadian hospital who was feared to have been infected by the Ebola virus while in West Africa does not have the virus, health officials said Tuesday.

On Monday, the severity of the patient's illness and the fact that he had recently returned from Liberia had led to speculation that Ebola had appeared in Canada for the first time.

Liberia borders Guinea, where an Ebola outbreak has killed 59, and there are reports of small numbers of patients with similar symptoms in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Tests on the man, hospitalized in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, determined that he did not have Ebola nor a related virus like Marburg, Lassa or Crimean-Congo, all of wihch cause hemorrhagic fever, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

It was not immediately clear what he had, but Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said it might be severe malaria.

On the presumption that the patient might have a hemorrhagic fever virus, he was isolated and all medical personnel tending to him had to wear masks, gloves, goggles and other protections to prevent infection through contact with bodily fluid, a Saskatchewan health official said.

Although Ebola is a terrifying illness and there have been more than 20 outbreaks of it or related viruses since it was discovered in 1976, all have been contained rapidly by isolating victims and those who have been in contact with them.

To help quell its first Ebola outbreak, the West African nation of Guinea has banned bat soup. Bats are believed to be the natural reservoirs of the filovirus that causes Ebola, and fruit bats are a popular food in West Africa, usually cooked in a peppery soup or smoked over a fire. While boiled bat meat is presumably safe, smoked meat could be dangerous, and butchering bats for the table certainly is. The current outbreak in Guinea has killed 63 people, but the appearance of new cases has slowed significantly, the country's health ministry said. Most outbreaks are thought to start when jungle hunters eat the flesh of apes that died of Ebola, presumably after eating fruit contaminated by bat feces or saliva. But where bats are in the diet -- as they are in parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific -- no intermediary host is needed.

Welcome to NYT Now, the new app from The New York Times.

As you head into your weekend, take a look at some of the things that caught our attention today.

• Where some of that Saudi oil money goes.

The setting was opulent when President Obama held talks today with the aging King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.

Michael Shear, the Times reporter traveling with Mr. Obama, wrote this to us: “The president and the ailing king (reporters could see his oxygen tubes) met in a grand room with marble floors, gilded chairs, upholstered walls and jeweled chandeliers.

“And in the large dining room where we reporters waited during the meeting, a huge spread was laid out, American style: mini hot dogs, mini hamburger sliders and grilled cheese sandwiches.”

• In Malaysia, the Grand Prix goes on.

But national mourning over the missing jet shadows[http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/26766623] this weekend’s popular Formula One race.

Signs on racers’ cars will acknowledge Flight 370, and a concert featuring Christina Aguilera, which was part of the race festivities, was canceled.

Still, the capital’s airport is close to the racetrack, and some relatives of lost passengers have been moved out of nearby hotels, along with press briefings, to make way for racing teams and fans.

• Straying from the text and into trouble.

“It’s tough to make movies for the easily offended. Studios assume these biblical stories are in the public domain, but a lot of believers consider the Bible their private property, and if you don’t interpret them the same way they’ve been taught, they’re going to speak out.”

That was Craig Detweiler, a professor of communications at Pepperdine University, speaking to The Los Angeles Times[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-ca-noah-on-film-20140330,0,7420386.story#ixzz2xHaqVzT2] about “Noah,” one of Hollywood’s first biblical movies in nearly 50 years.

The movie, opening today, has stirred criticism among some Christians for deviating from the Old Testament.

• Here come the brides and brides and grooms and grooms.

Same-sex marriages are allowed as of midnight local time in England and Wales.

That’s 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific for those Skyping in for the receptions.

• One of the world’s scariest diseases is spreading.

The West African nation of Guinea has lost more than 60 people to its first epidemic of Ebola, which causes dangerous fevers and hemorrhaging that can infect others.

Now four cases[http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/ebola-confirmed-conakry-guinea-32814] have been reported in the capital, where quarantine measures are in place to prevent more transmissions.

“It’s worrisome,” said Donald G. McNeil Jr., a Times science reporter who covers infectious disease. “This strain can be 90 percent lethal and the capital is far more crowded than the jungle, where the epidemic started.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks were up across the board. The S.&P. 500 index gained 0.46 percent.

TONIGHT

• He’s back.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has returned to his action roots, stars in “Sabotage,” his fourth movie since stepping down as California governor.

“Lovers of camp and cannabis are the most plausible audience,” writes Manohla Dargis[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/movies/arnold-schwarzenegger-is-back-in-sabotage.html], the Times film critic, in her review of what she described as an “extravagantly silly movie about a gang of marauding Drug Enforcement Administration thugs.”

Welcome to NYT Now, the new app from The New York Times.

Global warming warnings, bidding on birds and some other things that caught our attention today:

• What comes after the deadline?

The health insurance law is crossing a kind of finish line today, with open enrollments over at midnight (though there will be extensions).

Numbers will still be tracked, but now the focus will turn to the nitty-gritty of making the whole system, not just the website, work.

“They’ll announce if the number goes over seven million,” Paul Volpe, a Times editor in Washington, told us. “But now they’ll be looking to see things like who has paid the first month’s premiums.”

• If you can’t say anything good ...

A new report on climate change from a U.N. panel warns of profound economic disruption, food shortages and all manner of other misery.

Social media lit up with reaction, but many members of Congress did not follow suit.

Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, tweeted on health care, baseball and filibustering.

His Republican colleague, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the author of a book on climate change called “The Greatest Hoax,” had made no public comment as of 6 p.m.

• Saving some of the whales.

Japan says it will abide by the International Court of Justice’s ruling halting the country’s whaling in the Antarctic.

But it also kills whales — claiming scientific purposes — in the northern Pacific, Slate points out, and Norway and Iceland do not abide by the 1986 international whaling moratorium.

And some groups in the United States, Russia, Denmark and St. Vincent still catch whales under a clause that permits “aboriginal subsistence hunting.”

• One of the world’s scariest diseases is spreading.

At least 78 people have died in the West African nation of Guinea’s first epidemic of Ebola.

Liberia has reported two cases, and Senegal closed its border with Guinea, which is facing outbreaks in the capital as well as the south.

“It’s worrisome,” Donald G. McNeil Jr., a Times science reporter who covers infectious disease, told us. “This strain can be 90 percent lethal and the capital is far more crowded than the jungle, where the epidemic started.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks were up across the board. The S.&P. 500 finished higher by 0.8 percent, while small-cap stocks measured by the S.&P. 600 were up 1.8 percent.

TONIGHT

• Get comfortable, and caught up on some TV.

ABC is enabling a weeklong binge by allowing free streaming of a full season of each of nine shows.

Yours until April 6 on Hulu.com and the Watch ABC app: “Resurrection,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Nashville,” “Betrayal,” “Killer Woman,” “The Neighbors,” “Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,” “Trophy Wife” and “The Taste.”

TOMORROW

• In their natural habitat, dead and alive.

Copies of two of John James Audubon’s masterworks, “The Birds of America” and “Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America,” are being auctioned on Tuesday at Sotheby’s in New York.

Audubon, an excellent hunter and fisherman, achieved such remarkably detailed renderings by painting from specimens killed either by himself or by hired hunters.

Ebola Reaches Guinean Capital, Stirring Fears

DAKAR, Senegal -- An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the West African nation of Guinea has reached the crowded capital, Conakry, prompting new fears about its spread, health officials said Tuesday.

Over the past month, the disease has traveled from Guinea's remote forest regions near the Liberia and Sierra Leone borders and has already killed 83 people, including four in Conakry.

Now, with 13 cases in a densely populated capital of two million people, health officials say the challenge of containing the outbreak has become more acute. Ebola has killed hundreds in rural Central Africa over the past four decades, but it is unusual for it to reach urban centers.

Residents of Conakry said Tuesday that disquiet had set in, though markets were crowded and the capital's monstrous traffic jams continued unabated. Some were carrying around small bottles of bleach, people were avoiding shaking hands, and pharmacies were selling out of hand sanitizer.

''In Conakry everybody is worried,'' said Fodé Abass Bangoura, a lawyer with an office downtown. ''People are really preoccupied about this. There is a sort of psychosis about this now. I'm avoiding physical contact with people, and I'm eating at home.''

At some grocery stores that serve expatriates, clerks are wearing gloves, and sanitizer is being distributed at restaurants. Health workers have been going into the capital's crowded markets, warning people about the disease through megaphones and distributing chlorine soap.

Even more worrying than the presence of Ebola in Conakry, health officials said, is its deadly presence at both ends of the country.

''It's the combination of having quite a number of cases, and also the geographical dispersion,'' said Dr. Hilde de Clerck of Doctors Without Borders, the global medical charity. ''Now that it has reached Conakry, it is also special, and a bit more scary.''

Senegal has closed its border with Guinea. About half a dozen suspected cases and two confirmed cases have been identified in neighboring Liberia, officials said. The center of the epidemic remains in Guinea's remote forest region, around the towns of Macenta and Guéckédou, where isolation wards have been set up.

The Ebola virus is rare but deadly. Its point of origin is often the consumption of bush meat, including meat from apes or possibly bats, and it has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Human transmission occurs through contact with bodily fluids. Already, the Guinea outbreak is more serious than the most recent previous one, in Uganda in 2012, when fewer than 50 died. In that outbreak, cases were also recorded in the capital, Kampala. But in some previous outbreaks in Central and Eastern Africa, as many as 400 cases were recorded, health officials said.

Death is painful, with high fever, severe headache, vomiting, diarrhea and profuse bleeding. Health workers are often among the first to die, and they must take extraordinary precautions to avoid being infected when helping patients, including wearing head-to-toe biohazard suits. The heat inside the suits can be intense, and health workers are counseled not to wear them for more than 15 minutes.

The remaining cases in Conakry are in an isolation ward at the city's main hospital, Dr. de Clerck said. The current Conakry cases all emanate from an initial infection -- five medical workers who treated it, and eight family members -- so there is some hope that the disease in the capital can be contained.

''It's a good sign that the epidemic has not yet spread,'' Dr. de Clerck said. ''There is no evidence, for now, that it is spreading to other parts of the city. So there is a little bit of hope for the city.''

The World Health Organization is monitoring about 400 people in Guinea for 21 days in order to ''break the chain of transmission,'' said Gregory Hartl, its chief spokesman. ''If they start showing symptoms, we ask them to isolate.''

''The fortunate thing with Ebola is, it's quite difficult to transmit,'' Mr. Hartl said. ''You have to touch someone. Fortunately for the greater population, the risks are quite small.''

Relief workers from Doctors Without Borders carried a body on Tuesday at a center for Ebola victims in Guéckédou, a town in Guinea at the heart of an epidemic that has killed more than 80 people. (PHOTOGRAPH BY SEYLLOU/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE -- GETTY IMAGES)

Ebola virus: A grim, African reality

There’s nothing like an outbreak of Ebola virus disease to bring a small, struggling African nation to international notice. One week we couldn’t place it on a map; the next week, after Ebola virus disease strikes, we know the body count and the name of the capital and whether its airport has closed.

This sad distinction now attaches to Guinea, a country of 11.5 million, in which the latest of Africa’s viral tribulations was reported by the World Health Organization, upon notification from Guinea’s Ministry of Health, on March 23. As of Tuesday the toll was 157 confirmed or suspected Ebola cases, including 101 deaths. That’s a case fatality rate of 64 percent, somewhat lower than the worst of previous outbreaks but high enough to remind us that Ebola is more inimical to humans than perhaps any known virus on Earth, except rabies and HIV-1. And it does its damage much faster than either.

Among neighbors just across Guinea’s southeastern border, Liberia has confirmed several Ebola cases of its own, in people who recently traveled from Guinea, and Sierra Leone is watching very carefully. No one wants this thing to spread.

The Guinea outbreak has also raised one puzzling new question about Ebola: What is this particular species of virus, known technically as Zaire ebolavirus, doing way over in West Africa, so far from the Central African forests in which all its previous outbreaks have occurred? Viruses don’t travel, except in other living creatures. It seems to have hitched a lift, across Nigeria and Ghana and Ivory Coast and other intervening nations, within something or someone. Maybe it was carried by a bat.

Scientists have identified a total of five species of ebolavirus, four native to Africa and one to the Philippines. They are all zoonoses, meaning animal infections transmissible to humans. They reside quietly in some species of wildlife, this or that forest creature, from which they spill over occasionally to cause mayhem and death in people. Ebola virus can only pass from person to person by direct contact with bodily fluids, and therefore an outbreak is stoppable by simple isolation and ‘‘barrier nursing,’’ or the careful handling of patients and corpses, once enough medical gloves, gowns, goggles, rubber boots, body bags and knowledge have reached the scene.

Although the outbreak is eventually halted, the virus isn’t gone. It hides in the forest within some hospitable animal, its reservoir host. The identity of the reservoir host (or hosts) for Ebola virus is unknown, but three species of fruit bat are suspected. One of those species, the hammer-headed fruit bat, lives in forests from the Congo basin as far west as southeastern Guinea and is sizable enough to be attractive as human food.

In Guinea, the index patient (the first case) has not even been identified, though the preponderance of cases in Guéckédou, a city near the southeastern border, suggests that the outbreak may have begun down there. Without knowing the index patient, investigators can’t know how the fateful spillover happened. Did someone eat a bat? Did someone scavenge another dead chimp, one that had shared fruit with a bat?

That sort of research will have to come later, I was told recently by Dr. Stuart Nichol, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Nichol, himself a veteran of many outbreak responses, is chief of the C.D.C.’s Viral Special Pathogens Branch, a portfolio containing all the world’s nastiest viruses. Some of his people are presently in Guinea. For now, Dr. Nichol said, the focus is on human health: identifying cases, getting them isolated, giving them supportive care (there are no real treatments for Ebola virus disease), tracing contacts, breaking the chains of transmission.

The original Zaire species of ebolavirus was the first recognized back in 1976, when it emerged at a place called Yambuku in the northern boondocks of what then was Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of the 318 people infected, 280 (88 percent) died. A later outbreak in northeastern Gabon, in 1996, began with a chimpanzee carcass, scavenged from the forest by a group of boys on a hunting foray and devoured communally back at their village. (Chimps cannot be the reservoir host of Ebola because they too die from it, as this one evidently had.) Thirty-one human cases, 21 deaths. The Zaire virus has also struck three times in the Republic of Congo just across the river, killing dozens of people each time.

In all, since 1976, more than two dozen outbreaks of the various ebolaviruses have accounted for just over 1,640 reported deaths. So it’s a terrible thing, Ebola virus disease, but relatively rare.

The worst of these viruses (notably the Zaire species) burn hot in human populations, then succumb to control and disappear back into the forest for years at a time. Their invisible immanence makes them all the more dangerous during those lulls between outbreaks, and for that reason ecological research — efforts to find the reservoir hosts, and to learn how host-to-human spillovers occur — is vitally important.

People around the world have read such horrific tales about Ebola that they tend to dread it inordinately, sometimes with dark fascination, as though it’s a preternatural killer. It is not. It’s a horrible virus if you catch it, but it’s not easy to catch.

It afflicts poor African people who live in villages amid forest and are obliged by scarcity of options to eat bats, apes and other wild creatures, found dead or captured live.

Ebola in Guinea is not the Next Big One, an incipient pandemic destined to circle the world, as some anxious observers might imagine. It’s a very grim and local misery, visited upon a small group of unfortunate West Africans, toward whom we should bow in sympathy and continue sending help. It’s not about our fears and dreads. It’s about them.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Tuesday that the current outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 140 people. Ebola causes high fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and internal and external bleeding. There is no cure or vaccine and it has a high fatality rate. The United Nations health agency said at least 230 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola have been recorded in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The statement said 129 deaths in Guinea and 13 in Liberia have been linked to the disease. The outbreak is unusual because the disease is typically found in central or eastern Africa.

French far-right leader takes center stage; Le Pen goes to Brussels to form a broad populist coalition against the E.U.

Emboldened by the victory in European elections of her fiercely anti-European Union party, Marine Le Pen, the leader France’s National Front, took her fight into the lair of the ‘‘monster of Brussels’’ on Wednesday, traveling to the headquarters of the 28-nation bloc she blames for Europe’s ills to lobby for a new far-right alliance spanning the Continent.

Ms. Le Pen, whose party trounced France’s mainstream political forces in European Parliament elections that ended on Sunday, visited Brussels to try to stitch together a bloc of likeminded groups in the legislature that, she told a news conference, would ‘‘prevent any progress’’ toward European unity and work to restore the power of individual nation states.

For now, she is falling short, betraying the fractious nature of Europe’s right-wing groups, which find even each other too toxic to associate with, despite sharing common cause in wanting to push Brussels bureaucrats out of the politics of their nations.

‘‘The model of a totalitarian, technocratic Europe is now out of date,’’ Ms. Le Pen said, speaking in the European Parliament alongside the leaders of populist, anti-Brussels groups from Austria, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.

Ms. Le Pen visited Brussels just a few hours after a late-night gathering of European leaders, including the French president, François Hollande, who bemoaned the National Front’s victory as ‘‘a trauma for France, and for Europe,’’ that had ‘‘tarnished the image of France.’’

For Ms. Le Pen, the would-be standard-bearer of Europe’s surging far-right forces, the trip was part of a long campaign by the National Front to shed its reputation as a refuge for anti-Semites and racists and turn itself into a respectable political force with a serious shot at one day governing France. The National Front, following its success in the European elections, in which it got around a quarter of the French vote, rebranded itself as ‘‘the first party of France.’’

‘‘Her goal is not to be re-elected to the European Parliament. Her goal is the Élysée Palace, not Brussels,’’ said Jean-Yves Camus, a French political analyst who is an expert on the party. ‘‘She wants to show that she is serious and able to work.’’

Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands and a close ally of Ms. Le Pen’s, declared the gathering in Brussels a ‘‘historic meeting’’ that marked the end of Europe’s six-decade-long drive for economic and political integration. ‘‘We are writing history here today,’’ said Mr. Wilders, whose party finished third in the European election, a rare example of an anti-establisment party finishing worse than expected.

Harald Vilimsky, a leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, hailed Ms. Le Pen as ‘‘the iconic figure of the new Europe, of bringing sovereignty back to the nation state.’’ Complaining that there is a ‘‘demonization of anybody who criticizes the European project,’’ he said that Brussels had become ‘‘a combination of Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca. It is untouchable.’’ His party finished a strong third in Austria with nearly 20 percent of the vote.

As Ms. Le Pen and her fellow insurgents outlined their plans to hobble the European Union’s bureaucracy in Brussels, hundreds of mostly youthful protesters gathered outside the Parliament building waving placards and chanting slogans that denounced the National Front leader as a fascist.

But the protesters shared the fury of Ms. Le Pen and her allies against the European Union, particularly its emphasis on austerity measures as the solution for Europe’s continuing economic problems. ‘‘Those who cause misery reap anger,’’ the crowd chanted after marching from the Parliament building to the European Commission, the Union’s executive arm.

To form a formal group in the European Parliament, Ms. Le Pen needs to secure the support of at least 25 legislators from seven countries, two more countries than the five she now has. The U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, which finished first in the British stage of the European elections with nearly 27 percent of the vote, has refused to collaborate with Ms. Le Pen because of what it says are her party’s racist and anti-Semitic roots.

The Danish People’s Party, which trounced mainstream parties in Denmark, also ‘‘wants nothing to do with her party.’’ said Soren Espersen, a member of the Danish Parliament and the party’s spokesman on foreign affairs. ‘‘They have a very bad reputation,’’ he added.

Asked about opposition to the National Front not only from mainstream centrist parties, but also from insurgent groups that share her loathing of the European Union and her dislike of immigration, Ms. Le Pen said she was confident she could muster the necessary numbers to form a formal group, which would unlock funding and guarantee speaking time.

She said Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, had rejected an alliance ‘‘for tactical reasons’’ because he did not want to give up leadership of a group in Parliament now dominated by his party. She noted that Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain ‘‘thinks that Mr. Farage is the head of a group of drunken racists. People are flinging accusations around.’’

Wary of giving ammunition to critics who decry her party as fascist, Ms. Le Pen has ruled out joining forces with openly anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi parties like Jobbik in Hungary and Golden Dawn in Greece. She said the National Front did not want to be associated with parties ‘‘of that ilk.’’

Simon Hix, a professor at the London School of Economics, said Mr. Farage would probably stick to his separate course from Ms. Le Pen. He predicted that the French far-right leader ‘‘will manage to cobble something together, but it won’t last long. Their attention will shift to domestic politics very quickly.’’

To counter its often sulfurous reputation, which Ms. Le Pen on Wednesday blamed on ‘‘demonization by our enemies and the media,’’ the National Front worked hard before the European Parliament election, which began last Thursday in some countries and then rolled across Europe for four days, to recruit a new generation of well-educated and well-spoken candidates far removed from the often thuggish elements that tainted its image under Ms. Le Pen’s predecessor as party leader, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a former French paratrooper.

But she has not managed to entirely purge the influence of her father, his views and his veteran cronies. Mr. Le Pen, who founded the party four decades ago and remains its honorary president, last week stirred up one of the polemics for which he is famous by suggesting within earshot of reporters that ‘‘Monseigneur Ebola’’ — a reference to the deadly ebola virus — might wipe out would-be African immigrants to France and ‘‘solve’’ what he called a disastrous mass influx of foreigners.

Mr. Le Pen, 86, who last weekend won re-election to the European Parliament, later defended his words as a simple ‘‘observation.’’ His daughter kept her distance from her father’s comments, telling France 2 television that ‘‘it was perhaps a disillusioned observation, a bit pessimistic, but it had nothing to do with immigration.’’ Mr. Le Pen had been discussing global demographics, she noted, and not immigration to France.

Mr. Le Pen seems to thrill at provoking the indignation of the French political elite, and French voters are well accustomed to his penchant for talking on the edge. Prime Minister Manuel Valls, of the Socialist Party, called his ‘‘horrifying wordplay’’ a glimpse of ‘‘the true face of the National Front.’’

The National Front’s victory in the European elections cemented its transformation from a fringe party to a more central one, emboldening Ms. Le Pen to start plotting a course toward the French presidency in the next national elections in 2017. But whether she will get that far is uncertain.

Ms. Le Pen grabbed votes in part by softening the party’s image, focusing on concerns over immigration, the economy and Europe. But the National Front’s record of espousing xenophobic and anti-Semitic dogma still lingers.

‘‘It is still a fascist ideology, even if it is disguised under the smile and the charm of Marine Le Pen,’’ said Dominique Moïsi, a senior adviser at the French Institute for International Relations. Many who voted for her were disenchanted with mainstream parties, he added, ‘‘but they were not necessarily hoping she would go to the Élysée Palace.’’

Nonetheless, the National Front is moving to capitalize on its gains, as well as on the striking disarray within Mr. Hollande’s Socialist Party and the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, the scandal-plagued party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose leader, Jean-François Copé, resigned Tuesday amid embezzlement allegations.

With problems mounting, the National Front is in a position to become a third major alternative in a political landscape that has traditionally been dominated by the Socialists and the U.M.P. Ultimately, Ms. Le Pen’s ability to advance further on the national scene will depend on whether the mainstream parties can rebuild themselves and regain the confidence of voters.

‘‘If the mainstream parties react with enough courage and lucidity, and find the right way to speak to the citizens, then Marine Le Pen’s high point will have been May 2014,’’ Mr. Moïsi said. ‘‘But if they fail to understand the gravity of the message sent to them by the electorate, you can’t exclude that Marine Le Pen could be the president of France.’’

Ebola Gets Worse in West Africa

The World Health Organizationwarned[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_06_04_ebola/en/] last Wednesday that the epidemic caused by the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa, which had seemed to be waning, has recently taken a turn for the worse. The afflicted nations and their neighbors will need to redouble their efforts to contain a virus for which there is neither a cure nor a vaccine.

The virus is thought to reside normally in fruit bats, which then spread it to wild animals and, through them, to humans. Human-to-human transmission occurs through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected people or through contact with objects contaminated with those fluids. It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to develop; the victims are hit with sudden fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

In the absence of a specific treatment, patients are given intense supportive care, such as oral rehydration with electrolytes. Most patients die — up to 90 percent of them in some outbreaks.

The W.H.O. reported that between May 29 and June 1, Guinea, which documented its first case back in December, recorded 37 new cases and 21 new deaths to bring its cumulative totals to 328 cases (193 of them laboratory-confirmed) and 208 deaths. Sierra Leone, which reported its first cases just a few weeks ago, has reached a cumulative total of 79 cases (18 confirmed), including six deaths.

The nongovernmental assistance group Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, warned[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/resurgence-ebola-epidemic-west-africa] last week that the outbreak was hitting previously unaffected towns in Guinea, making control more difficult than ever in that country.

Still, the group says that about 30 of the patients it has treated in Guinea since the beginning of the outbreak have survived. It is now setting up a new clinic in Sierra Leone, at the epicenter of the epidemic there, in collaboration with the nation’s Ministry of Health.

The outbreaks will require a large educational effort to alert people to the dangers, to warn people not to eat “bush meat,” to warn mourners not to touch the victims during burial ceremonies, and to protect health care workers from unwitting contamination, among other public health measures. Ebola is a frightening virus, but it is not an inevitable death sentence if medical care is sought promptly and steps are taken to prevent transmission.

An Ebola outbreak continues to spread in three West African countries, with more than 330 deaths reported, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Wednesday. Most of the cases and deaths have been in Guinea, where the outbreak is believed to have begun. In an update published Wednesday on its website, the United Nations health agency said that more than 500 suspected or confirmed cases had been recorded. It said that 337 reported deaths had been linked to the virus. This is the first time Ebola has struck three countries at once and the first major outbreak in West Africa. Fear of the disease, which causes horrible bleeding and for which there is no cure, has hampered efforts to isolate the sick.

Flawed Saudi Response Fueled Outbreak of MERS, Middle East Virus

JIDDA, Saudi Arabia — As the virus tore through the city’s largest hospital, jumping from bed to bed and afflicting scores of people, terror filled the wards.

Some doctors and nurses refused to treat the sick or stopped coming to work altogether. Patients panicked. One surgeon recalled a man with a broken limb trying to flee the emergency room so he would not catch it, too.

“Everyone was afraid,” the surgeon, Dr. Mohammed Ahmed, said of the spike in cases this spring.

It was the darkest hour since the new illness, known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/], or MERS, first appeared in Saudi Arabia late in 2012. In all, more than 700 cases have been documented in 20 countries, nearly all of them linked to Saudi Arabia. More than 250 people have died.

The sudden spread of a mysterious and fatal new virus is reminiscent of the early days of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a related disease that appeared in dozens of countries and killed more than 770 people, principally in Asia in 2003.

MERS circulates most heavily in a region that is the nexus for Islam. This port city, Jidda, is the arrival point for most of the two to three million pilgrims who make the hajj to Mecca each year. Riyadh, the Saudi capital, has had the second-largest outbreak after Jidda, and cases have also appeared in Mecca. The hajj will not take place until October, but many Muslims travel to Mecca during the holy month of Ramadan, which most Muslims began observing on Sunday. And off-season pilgrims have already spread the disease to Iran, Jordan and Algeria.

Saudi officials know how urgently they need to beat the disease, and they say they now have the latest outbreak under control. But the fact that the number of cases and deaths have more than tripled since the end of 2013 has led health experts to cite grave flaws in the way this ultraconservative and staunchly private monarchy has handled the crisis.

King Abdullah fired the country’s health minister and his deputy in April, leaving experts wondering whether the shake-up would bring greater transparency and international cooperation. “In the U.S., when you have a crisis like the Veterans Administration scandal, the new head is in front of the TV cameras explaining what the new plan is,” said Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance[http://www.ecohealthalliance.org/], a veterinary organization that tracked the disease in animals. “There is no tradition of openness in Saudi Arabia.”

A World Health Organization panel said this month that the surge in cases that began in April had fallen off, but that “the situation remains serious” and that hospital outbreaks should be investigated for breaches in safety protocols.

“I am not saying we’re not worried, but this is something that can be controlled,” said Hanan Balkhy, executive director for infection prevention and control at Saudi Arabia’s National Guard hospitals. “If this were Ebola, I would go the king myself and tell him, ‘We need to isolate the kingdom.’ ”

Both SARS and MERS are coronaviruses, named for their shapes. Both are thought to have originated in bats and then spread through other animals to people. But while SARS circulated in obscure forest animals like palm civets that are eaten in southern China, MERS infects camels, which are common in the Middle East. MERS seems to jump more easily to humans, possibly in raw camel milk, but it spreads less readily between people than SARS did.

One theory gaining popularity is that MERS cases peak in the spring because camel calves are born at that time. So until a human or veterinary vaccine is developed, people in contact with camels must be careful, especially in the spring.

Yet the outbreak this year suggested that lapses in the kingdom’s health system played a bigger role in spreading the virus than camels did. Most of the hundreds of new infections were linked to hospitals, dialysis clinics or other health facilities, and many were among staff members. Two health workers from Saudi clinics were hospitalized in Indiana and Florida.

The greatest number of new cases was at the King Fahd Hospital in Jidda. Doctors said a mix of bad management, crowding and lax hygiene helped spread the virus there.

The outbreak came during the busiest time of year, when many Saudis were on vacation, leading to more car accidents, sports injuries and other mishaps, doctors said. New emergency patients were registered in a crowded area, and hospital rooms meant for four people often held 12.

Suspected MERS cases were not always identified and isolated, and patients unwittingly spread the virus around the hospital — one in the cardiac ward, and another among dialysis patients, according to Dr. Ahmed Ragab, chief of the hospital’s intensive care unit.

“If one patient came in with the virus, all the others would get it, because they were all next to each other,” Dr. Ragab said.

Some medical staff members were lax with sanitary measures, not wearing masks or infrequently sanitizing their hands. Many fell ill.

When the king fired the health minister, Abdullah al-Rabeeah[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-health-official-fired.html], in April, he gave the job to the labor minister, Adel Fakieh, who is known for bypassing the kingdom’s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy. Mr. Fakieh enlisted McKinsey & Company[http://www.mckinsey.com/], the corporate consulting firm, and opened a command center in Jidda to track cases.

The changes at the top soon filtered down to the King Fahd Hospital, where Dr. Imad al-Jahdali became director in May.

“The scene at the time was panic, from the public and from the media,” Dr. Jahdali recalled. “King Fahd Hospital was the spotlight for everything.”

He divided the hospital in two, with one half exclusively for MERS patients. Anyone with a fever and breathing problems is quickly isolated for testing.

The disease has been surrounded by controversy since it came to light, when an Egyptian microbiologist, Ali Mohammed Zaki, sent a sample from a Jidda hospital to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. Dutch researchers patented the new virus and named it after their center, enraging Saudi officials, who considered the action intellectual property theft. They fired Dr. Zaki and petitioned the W.H.O. for a new name for the virus.

Scientists from 18 universities or health agencies in eight countries were recruited to work on the virus. Egos began clashing, especially as teams raced to publish results. Two rivals published the genomes of viruses from the same patient and his camel in separate academic journals.

Some researchers accused the Saudi deputy minister of health, Ziad Memish, of duplicity and bad management, saying he hampered progress, while others said he was made a fall guy for an outbreak beyond his control.

Dr. Memish, described recently in The Lancet, the British medical journal, as “the father of mass gatherings medicine[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960851-5/fulltext]” for his work on protecting pilgrims, denied accusations that he took credit for the work of others or kept sloppy records. But he acknowledged occasionally switching cooperation from one team to another, bruising feelings.

“Some collaborations began and prospered; some did not,” Dr. Memish said by email. “That’s the way science and life progresses, sometimes.”

One recent afternoon, a family brought an old woman with a nasty cough to King Fahd Hospital. She was immediately wheeled into an isolation room. Dr. Jahdali watched proudly as health workers blocked her relatives from following, so they would not get sick. Confirmed cases go to a special wing where rooms with tight sliding glass doors hold one patient each and nurses wear gloves and snug-fitting masks.

Whether Saudi Arabia can get the virus under control will depend, experts said, on how effectively such measures can be applied nationally — not an easy task in a country of long distances and weak government oversight of some health centers.

The number of new cases reported nationally appears to be falling, with about 200 in May and only 27 since then, the health ministry said.

“The most direct cause of this improvement — after, of course, the blessing of Allah — is the stringent implementation of infection control in hospitals,” said Tariq Madani, who heads the health ministry’s MERS task force.

Ben Hubbard reported from Jidda, and Donald G. McNeil Jr. from New York.

The New York Times editorial board writes that [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/gov-christies-money-trail.html?ref=opinion&_r=0]Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey “has yet to show sufficient interest in managing the public’s money in ways that benefit the public.” “He has used dubious strategies to avoid raising taxes,” the board adds, citing multiple instances that have hurt the state. A recent one involves the diversion of funds from a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Hudson River tunnel project to rebuild the deteriorating Pulaski Skyway; it’s being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr. The board says, “Mr. Christie has presented himself nationally as a straight-talking politician who can work with Democrats and attract voters from both parties. That image is taking a beating.”

Other significant viewpoints from around the world:

The trial for the accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is “an occasion to showcase the fairness of the American system of law, with its admirably strong set of protections for the accused,” writes[http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/06/28/tsarnaev-trial-must-scrupulous-even-that-means-moving/xZ9xsaV89VHHgZMTOYLT6I/story.html] The Boston Globe. The board recommends that Mr. Tsarnaev’s request to have his trial moved out of Boston be “evaluated strictly on that basis,” since it may prove difficult to provide an unbiased jury from the city’s population. Especially with prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Tsarnaev, the court should be meticulous. “The last thing that Bostonians should want is a guilty verdict that gets overturned on appeal. The trial court should do all it can to make certain that its verdict is thorough, fair — and unassailable.”

“An alarming report[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/ebola-massive-deployment-needed-fight-epidemic-west-africa] released last week by Doctors Without Borders said that West Africa’s current Ebola outbreak is ‘out of control,’” The Washington Postreports[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/west-africa-cant-manage-the-ebola-outbreak/2014/06/29/07f4c354-fee9-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b_story.html]. “The outbreak[http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/27/this-is-now-the-deadliest-ebola-outbreak-on-record-and-its-getting-worse/], already the deadliest in history, had killed almost 400 people[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/ebola-outbreak-worst-ever-needs-drastic-steps-who-says.html] as of Thursday.” The editorial board urges West African and international public-health leaders to “to coordinate a regional response.” Public awareness is lacking, and there is a risk that the outbreak might spill over into other parts of Africa, and perhaps beyond.

The Independent reminds the worl[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/the-nigerian-girls-are-still-missing-9570464.html]d that the roughly 200 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by the terrorist group Boko Haram more than a month ago are still missing: “despite Hollywood stars and Michelle Obama taking pictures of themselves holding up placards saying ‘Bring Back Our Girls’, it has proved impossible to return them to their families.” The editorial board calls on the international community to continue pressuring Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to hasten the search and coax a shift in attitude toward girls and women in the West African nation.

The Christian Science Monitor recalls[http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/0629/A-Yosemite-moment-for-nations-in-conflict] the decision of President Abraham Lincoln to “sign a two-paragraph law that set aside Yosemite[http://www.csmonitor.com/tags/topic/Yosemite+National+Park] valley and a nearby sequoia forest in California  ‘for public use, resort, and recreation … inalienable for all time.’ This act of preservation later became the basis for the national parks, such as Yellowstone, the Smokies, and the Everglades.” This, the editorial board explains, highlights a uniquely human distinction, that despite cultural, ethnic or linguistic differences, communities can identify unifying national pride in the beauty of natural landscapes.

The Guardian criticizes[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/29/in-praise-of-swearing] yet another of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s “puritanical ordinances.” New language restrictions will ban 500 words — constituting “mat,” or “the Russian language of profanity” — from the Russian dictionary, including “khuy,” a derogatory term for an obnoxious male (the editorial board claims the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky said that word  says “everything a Russian might think or speak could be expressed with”). In his efforts to quash their usage, Mr. Putin, the board writes, “stands for a new Russia built on repression of every sort. We raise instead two fingers to salute the Russian mat.”

The outbreak of the disease is already the largest and deadliest ever, according to the organization, which had put the death toll at 399 as of June 23, out of 635 cases.

The 17 percent increase in deaths and 20 percent jump in cases in a week will add urgency to an emergency meeting this week of 11 West African health ministers in Accra, Ghana, who aim to coordinate a regional response. The outbreak has left some of the world’s poorest states grappling with one of the most lethal and contagious diseases on the planet.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Thursday:

• Tracking the hurricane.

Arthur, now officially at hurricane strength, is expected to bring high winds and dangerous rip currents to beaches up and down the East Coast, with North Carolina possibly bearing the brunt[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/07/02/us/ap-us-tropical-weather.html].

In the drought-stricken West, many fireworks shows[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/07/03/us/ap-us-fireworks-drought-.html] are expected to go ahead as planned despite the high threat of wildfires.

• “I call on both sides to stop the bloodshed.”

That’s from the father of a slain 16-year-old Arab, the possible victim of a Jewish revenge attack[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/israel.html] whose funeral is today.

Tensions remain high in Jerusalem, where clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police broke out on Wednesday.

• A good month for job creation?

Wall Street economists expect to see job growth of about 215,000 in this morning’s labor report for June. Their forecasts see no change in the 6.3 percent unemployment rate.

The pace of hiring in recent months has been relatively strong despite a very weak first quarter, when the economy contracted at an annual rate of 2.9 percent.

• A response plan for a lethal disease.

The World Health Organizationconcludes its emergency meeting[http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/epr-highlights/4187-special-ministerial-meeting-ebola-accra-2-3-july-2014.html] in Ghana today on the largest and deadliest outbreak of Ebola virus[http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/ebola-hemorrhagic-fever/overview.html].

The group said this week that there had been 467 deaths of 759 total known cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in recent months.

• Meeting the immigration challenge.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas testifies today[http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/field-hearing-crisis-texas-border-surge-unaccompanied-minors] to the House Homeland Security Committee about the surge of unaccompanied minors arriving in his state.

On a lighter note, Mr. Perry says he will no longer wear cowboy boots[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/us/rick-perry-gives-up-his-cowboy-boots.html], a move that some believe is part of an attempt to soften his image as he considers another run for president.

• Chinese and South Korean leaders team up.

The Chinese president is in South Korea today for talks with his counterpart there[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/world/asia/chinas-president-to-visit-south-korea.html?src=twr].

The meeting appears to be aimed at disrupting the alliances the United States has developed in the region.

MARKETS

• Wall Street closes early today, shutting down at 1 p.m. for the Fourth of July weekend.

Stock futures are nearly flat awaiting the jobs report; European shares are up modestly, and Asian markets closed mixed.

• The European Central Bank is not expected to take any new action at its meeting today after moving last month to a so-called negative interest rate.

But Mario Draghi, the bank president, did leave the door open[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/business/international/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rate.html] then to a bond-buying program like the one used to restart U.S. growth.

• Janet Yellensent a message to markets[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/upshot/janet-yellen-signals-she-wont-raise-rates-to-fight-bubbles.html] on Wednesday that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates to fight financial excesses.

• China is letting banks set their own exchange rates[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/business/international/china-takes-step-toward-freeing-currency-from-state-control.html] against the dollar in over-the-counter transactions, another step to freeing the renminbi exchange rate from government control.

NOTEWORTHY

• Not too early to celebrate the Fourth.

The Library of Congresshonors[http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-103.html] the 200th anniversary of “The Star-Spangled Banner” with a panel discussion and a free concert today.

In Boston, a scheduled rehearsal today for the annual Boston Pops concert and fireworks show becomes the real deal[http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/07/02/organizers-meet-today-decide-whether-hold-rehearsal-concert-esplanade/hAEMRvOxUOfuSGYQPNkqYO/story.html], with officials moving up the event because of weather concerns.

• And then there were four.

It’s women’s semifinals day[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/schedule/index.html] at Wimbledon, with the 23rd-seeded Lucie Safarova facing the 2011 winner and sixth-seeded Petra Kvitova. The second match has the 13th-seeded Eugenie Bouchard facing the third-seeded Simona Halep.

On Wednesday, the defending men’s champion, Andy Murray, fell to Grigor Dimitrov, a rising Bulgarian, in straight sets in the quarterfinals[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2014-andy-murray-routed-by-grigor-dimitrov.html].

• Back on the track.

Sprinter Tyson Gay returns to competition today, running the 100-meter race at the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, having completed a reduced one-year ban[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/sports/no-appeal-on-shorter-ban-for-tyson-gay.html] for doping.

• Aging up.

Lisa Simpson, the saxophone-playing vegetarian Buddhist who is “The Simpsons” middle child, has been 8 years old for more than 25 years.

The actress who provides her voice, Yeardley Smith, turns 50 today.

BACK STORY

It was no ordinary Tuesday in 1826.

It happened to be the Fourth of July, and the 50th anniversary of America’s independence from Britain.

On that day, two founding fathers who were there at the birth of the nation died at their homes within hours of each other, one in Massachusetts, the other in Virginia.

Both John Adams, 90, and Thomas Jefferson, 83, died of natural causes, but there was much fascination — then and now — with the idea that only divine intervention could explain the coincidence.

Or perhaps, speculated The Bulletin of the Historical Society[http://www.bu.edu/historic/battin.htm]: “The two old men were simply hanging on, waiting for the same important anniversary. When they reached it, they just gave up on the same day and died.”

Daniel Webster, in a eulogy, wrote[https://www.dartmouth.edu/~dwebster/speeches/adams-jefferson.html], “In the very hour of public rejoicing, in the midst of echoing and re-echoing voices of thanksgiving, while their own names were on all tongues, they took their flight together to the world of spirits.”

Hope for Frogs Facing a Deadly Fungus
By CARL ZIMMER

Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
In the 1990s, a disturbing silence began to settle across the world. From mountain lakes to tropical streams, the music of singing frogs began to disappear.

It took a few years for scientists to figure out what was happening. A species of fungus — Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/science/increasingly-in-decline-frogs-face-a-deadly-fungus.html], or Bd for short — was infecting and killing amphibians.

Two decades later, Bd has proven itself an exceptional biological catastrophe. It afflicts amphibians on every continent, and scientists suspect it has driven hundreds of species to extinction since its discovery.

“Even Ebola doesn’t cause extinctions,” said Jason R. Rohr, an expert on the fungus at the University of South Florida. “This makes it arguably the second most deadly organism on the planet, behind humans.”

In a new study published on Wednesday in Nature[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/nature/journal/v511/n7508/full/nature13491.html], Dr. Rohr and his colleagues offer what they consider cause for hope. They’ve discovered that frogs can acquire defenses against the fungus. The results might lead to a vaccination-like campaign to slow the epidemic, Dr. Rohr said.

Other researchers hailed the conclusions of the new study, although some were skeptical about its usefulness. In the study, the amphibians did not develop overwhelming defenses against the fungus. So even if scientists did start a sweeping campaign to save them, their defenses might not become strong enough to stop the destruction.

The stakes of this debate are high. If Bd continues to spread unchecked, it could drive many more species extinct, with huge ecological consequences. In the forests of the northeastern United States alone, the biomass of amphibians outweighs birds, mammals and other vertebrates. Many predators depend on amphibians for food; algae in streams depend on amphibian larvae to release nitrogen that fertilizes them.

We humans benefit from amphibians, too, and not just thanks to their appetite for mosquitoes and other pests. Amphibians produce many unusual chemicals that have been turned into useful compounds, from cancer drugs to powerful adhesives. When an amphibian species become extinct, millions of years of evolutionary experimentation disappears with it.

Only in recent years have scientists gotten a basic understanding of how Bd kills. Its spores land on the skin of amphibians, and the fungus burrows down to deeper layers, where it releases a toxin that paralyzes immune cells.

But there have long been tantalizing hints that some amphibians can fight back. Some species, such as bullfrogs, haven’t declined despite being exposed to Bd. In other species, certain populations have vanished, while others have endured. In Australia, scientists have even discovered that a frog species that was decimated by Bd has been bouncing back[http://www.plosone.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0058559].

Dr. Rohr and his colleagues wondered if these amphibians were developing immunity to the fungus. They might have a response similar to the way we develop immunity to influenza and other pathogens after exposure.

To find out, the scientists swabbed Bd onto the bellies of Cuban tree frogs. After the frogs became infected, the scientists cured them by taking advantage of a weakness of the fungus: it can’t survive for very long at high temperatures.

Dr. Rohr and his colleagues kept their frog chambers heated to 86 degrees for 10 days, after which the fungi disappeared. The scientists then repeated this procedure three more times, exposing the frogs up to four times to the fungus.

Frogs that had already been exposed to Bd produced a much stronger immune response to a new infection, the scientists found. They produced more immune cells, and the fungus produced fewer spores.

The exposed frogs were also much more likely to survive an infection than a frog exposed for the first time. What’s more, these effects became stronger after each exposure.

Dr. Rohr and his colleagues also found that amphibians can learn to avoid the fungus. In another experiment, they put oak toads in a chamber. One side of the chamber was contaminated with fungal spores, while the other was fungus-free. They found that toads that had never been exposed to the fungus would explore both sides of the chamber, becoming infected along the way.

But toads that had previous been exposed (and cured with heat) tended to avoid the side of the chamber with the fungus. If they were exposed more than once, they were even less likely to go to there. Dr. Rohr and his colleagues are investigating how the toads learn to avoid exposure to Bd. It’s possible that the toads can detect a chemical made by the fungus.

Dr. Rohr thinks the new study helps explain why Bd has eradicated some populations of amphibians and not others. When the fungus invades, it can sweep through the animals quickly — possibly killing them all.

But in some cases, a few amphibians survive that first attack. They may find refuge in a sunny spot, for example, where Bd can’t grow quickly. Their immune system may vanquish the fungus. Perhaps they learn to avoid the fungus and develop a stronger immune response.

Doug Woodhams, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado who was not involved in the study, said that it might be possible to strengthen the defenses of captive amphibians before releasing them into the wild. “This may provide the head start that is needed to avoid immediately contracting lethal infections,” he said.

It might even be possible to release Bd-protecting proteins into the waters where wild amphibians live. Instead of infecting amphibians with live fungi and then heating them, Dr. Rohr suggests that scientists might be able to use a simpler method. His research suggests that dead spores might spur stronger defenses, or even just a Bd protein.

“We have to stay optimistic that we can find some sort of solution,” said Dr. Rohr.

Such a strategy will work, though, only if the defenses it produces are powerful enough to overcome the fungus. And Lee F. Skerratt of James Cook University in Australia, who wasn’t involved in the new study, doesn’t see much hope of that in Dr. Rohr’s research.

“The size of the effect is relatively small,” he said, calling its potential value for saving amphibians “highly uncertain.”

Karen R. Lips of the University of Maryland also questioned how effective such a campaign would be. After all, wild amphibians are already exposed to both live and dead spores. “We live in a Bd world,” she said.

Despite her reservations, Dr. Lips said that understanding how amphibians fight Bd was crucial in the struggle to save them. “Any evidence that some amphibians are surviving with disease is good news,” she said.

New cases and deaths from the Ebola virus outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], already the worst ever recorded for the disease,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-is-largest-ever.html] have surged by double-digit percentages in the past week, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] reported Tuesday,

with no sign of a slowdown. Alarmed Ivory Coast[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/ivorycoast/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] border authorities blocked hundreds of Ivorian refugees in Liberia from returning, news agencies reported.

In its latest update[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_07_15_ebola/en/], the W.H.O. said the number of suspect, probable and confirmed cases as of Saturday totaled 964, up about 14 percent from a week earlier. Deaths totaled 603, up about 16 percent from a week earlier. Half the deaths have been in Guinea.

“This trend indicates that a high level of transmission of the Ebola virus continues to take place in the community,” the W.H.O. said in the update. “The respective Ministries of Health are working with W.H.O. and partners to step up outbreak containment measures.”

The latest figures were reported as the W.H.O. helped finalize a coordination center in Conakry, the Guinea capital, in an attempt to slow the spread of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] with no known cure and a death rate that can reach 90 percent. The virus first appeared in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is believed to have been spread originally by fruit bats. Gorillas, chimpanzees, forest antelopes and porcupines can also spread the virus.

Despite the latest outbreak, the W.H.O. said it was not recommending any travel or trade restrictions in the three affected countries. Nonetheless, news agencies reported Tuesday that Ivory Coast had prevented 400 refugees who had fled to neighboring Liberia during the violent 2010-11 Ivorian political upheaval from re-entering the country. Agence France-Presse said Bruno Kone, an Ivorian government spokesman, had justified the move, quoting him as saying, “We cannot be lax in this area.”

Welcome to NYT Now, the new app from The New York Times.

Here’s what you need to know:

• What if the Gaza war escalates?

With militants in Gaza still launching rockets and Israeli airstrikes continuing, Israel’s decision to observe a five-hour cease-fire on Thursday doesn’t remove the possibility of a ground invasion. [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip.html]

Such an operation would undoubtedly raise the casualties on both sides, and there are other risks, says our Jerusalem bureau chief, Jodi Rudoren.

Israel would most likely face more international criticism, particularly given the lopsided firepower and death tolls. (It counts one death so far, the Palestinians more than 200.)

And there is also the possibility, Ms. Rudoren says, of “a long-term occupation of Gaza with responsibility for its 1.7 million impoverished residents.”

For Palestinians, she says, the fears hark back to how, in an invasion five years ago, “Israeli troops essentially bisected the strip and blockaded Gaza City.”

“That said,” she adds, “some militants relish a ground attack as an opportunity to confront the enemy directly — and to showcase what they see as its brutality to the world.”

• What’s on?

Media deals are super hot these days, with telecom and Internet companies hunting for content partners.

Today, Time Warner said it had rejected an $80 billion takeover offer[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/rupert-murdoch-said-to-have-made-offer-for-time-warner/] from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. That’s not the end of the story: The offer was rich enough that shareholders may insist that Time Warner revisit the bid.

What would a deal mean to the average entertainment consumer?

It would put some of the biggest content providers under one roof, says Michael de la Merced, one of our business reporters.

Movie studios like Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox and cable networks like HBO and the Fox stable of channels would all be part of one giant company.

“That would give it potentially enormous power over the kinds of movies, television shows and other types of content that are produced,” he says, “as well as how much they ultimately cost.”

• Looking good, sort of.

Big banks had warned that their profits wouldn’t shine in the latest quarter, but so far they’ve been mostly wrong.

Bank of America’s numbers[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/bank-of-america-earnings-slump-43/?ref=business] today looked bad, but if you don’t count $4 billion to settle mortgage claims, they exceeded expectations.

Likewise, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs all reported second-quarter earnings on the positive side this week. Forecasts for Morgan Stanley are bright for Thursday.

But that isn’t a signal that the banking business is better, says Michael Corkery, a Times finance reporter.

“This wasn’t so much a case of trading revenue coming in strong,” he says. “It is more the case that it didn’t come as low as many banks had signaled it would.”

“All the banks are still warning that it’s likely to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future.”

• When keeping it weird becomes a challenge.

Since he first riffed off “My Sharona” with “My Bologna” in 1979, Weird Al Yankovic has been relevant — and outlasted many of the pop stars he parodied — by mastering the art of the speedy satire.

But with his latest album, “Mandatory Fun,”[http://www.weirdal.com/] Mr. Yankovic is fighting to keep up with the genre he helped create, says our culture reporter Dave Itzkoff.

Weird Al’s releasing a new video daily through Monday. His spoofs of Robin Thicke, Pharrell and Lorde are already hot.

But he has lots of competition: Search “Robin Thicke parody” on YouTube and you get 139,000 results.

“Pop stars and pop songs are so much more dispensable now,” Mr. Itzkoff says, “so he has to work a lot faster to get his parodies out while audiences still care about the original song.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed up. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.4 percent.

TONIGHT

• The line between good and evil.

“The Divide[http://www.wetv.com/shows/the-divide]” is a legal drama inspired by the Innocence Project[http://www.innocenceproject.org/about/Mission-Statement.php], the nonprofit organization that uses DNA testing to fight to reverse wrongful convictions, including many in death penalty cases.

“The premiere of this eight-episode legal thriller is remarkably free of cheap melodrama,” writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/television/the-divide-a-drama-inspired-by-the-innocence-project.html] our TV critic Alessandra Stanley (9 p.m. Eastern, WE TV).

• Just saying no, for now.

The latest MTV docu-series is premiering, and it takes an unusual tack for a channel obsessed with sex.

“Virgin Territory”[http://www.mtv.com/shows/virgin-territory/] is a show “premised on the absence of sex exclusively made up of conversations about it,” writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/television/virgin-territory-about-celibate-youth-debuts-on-mtv.html] our critic Jon Caramanica (11 p.m. Eastern).

• Not virgin territory.

Then there is “Sex in the Wild[http://www.pbs.org/program/sex-wild/],” with the focus on elephants in the first episode of a series about animal procreation (PBS, check local listings).

• Sports stars party in Hollywood.

The rapper Drake is the master of ceremonies at the ESPYs, which celebrate athletic achievement and a certain media empire (9 p.m. Eastern, ESPN).

Fans, and haters, can vote for their picks[http://espn.go.com/espys/2014/] until the show, live from the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, begins.

• If you’re staying up…

On “The Daily Show”: Jerry Seinfeld (11 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

“The Colbert Report”: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York (11:31 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

“Late Show With David Letterman”: Emma Stone, a star of “Magic in the Moonlight[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2870756/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4],” out next week; Nathan Fielder[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/magazine/nathan-fielder.html], the comedian behind “Dumb Starbucks”; American Authors[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/best-day-of-my-life/id806472660?i=806472664&ign-mpt=uo%3D2] perform (11:35 p.m. Eastern, CBS).

TOMORROW

• Combating a killer virus.

The heads of state of West African countries are gathering in Accra, Ghana, for a summit meeting, with Ebola as the most pressing issue.

New cases and deaths from an outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, already the worst ever recorded for the disease,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-is-largest-ever.html] have surged by double-digit percentages[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/world/africa/death-toll-from-ebola-surges-in-west-africa-prompting-alarm.html] in the last week.

How Environmentalism Can Help Stop Ebola

A relentless Ebola virus is sweeping through the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing nearly 470 people to date, according to the World Health Organization.

“The virus is thought to reside normally in fruit bats,” The New York Timeseditorial board writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/opinion/ebola-gets-worse-in-west-africa.html], “which then spread it to other animals and, through them, to humans.”

The bats live in forests, which are for many West Africans a source of food and, with growing demand for resources like wood, a livelihood.

For many observers, that combination is loom more deadly with each passing day.

West Africa has never experienced an Ebola outbreak on the scale of the current one, writes[http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/08/how-deforestation-and-human-activity-could-be-to-blame-for-the-ebola-pandemic/?tid=hp_mm] Terrence McCoy of The Washington Post, and the area is “reported to have one of the world’s highest rates of regional deforestation.”

“The Guinea Rainforest has been ravaged by deforestation and has shrunk to less than one-fifth of its original size,” Mr. McCoy says.

In Liberia, a country recovering from decades of civil war, more than half of the forests — “home to 40 endangered species, including the western chimpanzee,” report[http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/07/we-are-making-ebola-worse] James West and Tim McDonnell for Mother Jones — have been sold off to industrial loggers by the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

“Logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and chopping down trees for an increased demand for fire wood are all driving deforestation in Sierra Leone,” Mr. West and Mr. McDonnell write. “Where total forest cover has now dropped to just 4 percent, according to the United Nations Environment Program, which says if deforestation continues at current levels, Sierra Leone’s forests could disappear altogether by 2018.”

This is highly problematic for Ebola-stricken nations. Colin Schultz of Smithsonianwrites[http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/07/we-are-making-ebola-worse], “As people cut down the forest or push further into the forest for mining and other work, it brings humans and animals into closer contact.” More frequent encounters between encroaching human populations and newly habitat-less wildlife, he adds, “means more chances for viruses to jump from host to host.”

Consumption of bush meat from the forests — most often apes and monkeys, but also the aforementioned bats, wild birds, rodents, deer and forest antelope — in some West African countries is also contributing to the rapid diffusion of the disease. A Vice News broadcast says[https://news.vice.com/video/bushmeat-in-the-time-of-ebola]: “The scientific concerns surrounding the consumption of bush meat begin in our genes. Because we share 99 percent of our DNA with monkeys, the chances of infections and incurable diseases like Ebola crossing over from a monkey to a human are exponentially higher than with any other animal.”

But monkeys are only part of the problem. “A piece of bush meat would be any animal coming from the forest,” says Joseph Fair, an epidemiologist working in Liberia, interviewed for the Vice dispatch.

Many Western observers have called for a bush-meat ban, or at least the implementation of educational programs discouraging Africans from eating it. But many non-Africans don’t recognize “the need for bush meat,” Dr. Fair says. “Imagine living in the deep forest of Central Africa and/or Asia — it’s very difficult to raise domestic animals. Yet, human beings, by their nature, need protein sources. So bush meat, in many parts of the world, is still a necessary part of the diet.”

The situation is similarly fraught when it comes to logging and other resource-harvesting industries in the region. Scientists writing for the Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research, published by the South African Agricultural Research Council and the University of Pretoria, “found deforested regions where locals hunted, dug for gold and farmed were most susceptible to outbreak,” according to Mr. McCoy. “The findings landed upon some dismal conclusions: The activities locals depend on the most are also what puts them at the most risk for contracting Ebola.”

It all comes down to finding effective ways for human populations to intermingle with once-pristine forest ecologies. And this, most experts agree, is contingent on finding sustainable ways for West Africans to feed themselves and their families. “Public health and agriculture experts must work together to improve agriculture and figure out how to meet Africans’ demands for animal proteins in an environmentally sustainable way,” writes[http://thebulletin.org/how-prevent-next-ebola-outbreak7312] Laura H. Kahn for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “The Ebola virus can be contained, but doing so requires that people be convinced to change behavior that earns them money and provides them food.”

This is not a project African nations can undertake on their own. The international community has a vested interest in making sure the causes of Ebola in West Africa are identified, isolated and eliminated as quickly as possible. The Haaretz editorial board writes[http://www.haaretz.com/life/health-fitness/1.585839]: “There is no vaccine and no known cure for Ebola, which was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976,” more than 3,000 miles from the most recent point of outbreak in Guinea.

“The fact that this latest and biggest outbreak was in Guinea, nowhere near Congo, demonstrates that the danger of spread is real,” Haaretz warns.

“Lack of knowledge amongst the population about Ebola, the high mobility of people in this area of the world, and the wide geographic spread of cases all combine together to make it difficult to control this epidemic,” says[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/struggling-contain-ebola-epidemic-west-africa] Dr. Michel Van Herp of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). “People in these areas of West Africa are more mobile than those M.S.F. has treated in previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”

The solution, though longterm, is clear: to keep Ebola and similar diseases out of North American and European population centers and, most important, eliminate the disease in Africa, investments in developing the continent’s conservation efforts are of literal vital importance.

America’s Test at the Border

The crisis of young migrants at the Texas border is a test of American values, one of those surprise exams that history now and then throws our way: Here are 57,000 helpless children. We are a nation of 300 million. Do we spit on them, or give them blankets and beds?

It is a test that many are flunking. In Arizona, no surprise, people are losing their minds. Hearing that migrant children were being sent to the town of Oracle, a county sheriff instigated a protest that ensnared a busload of bewildered YMCA campers. A disbarred former county attorney running for governor has an ad[http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/07/17/andrew-thomas-az-governor-tv-ad-gay-liberal-judges-immigration/] showing a Mexican flag swallowing up a map of Arizona and the slogan “Before It’s Too Late.”

The fever is hot in other states, too: Graffiti denouncing “illeagles” in Maryland. A mayor whipping up a bus blockade in Murrieta, Calif. The call going out on YouTube for militias to get their weapons and boots, and man up to keep the little ones on their side of the river.

In Congress, which gave up on creating an orderly immigration system, Republicans are watching President Obama struggle to get a handle on the problem, and trying very hard not to help. Their reaction is one part panic, two parts glee. Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia is warning the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about migrants carrying the Ebola virus. For Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas, it’s H1N1 flu virus. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is using the crisis to demand an end to President Obama’s program deferring deportations of young people known as Dreamers. There is no time like a crisis to blow up earlier efforts to fix the system’s failures.

As the crisis emboldens demagogues in Washington, Mr. Obama has the obligation to act the grown-up. But he can be a tepid ally where unauthorized immigrants are concerned, since he sees the issue through a calculating lens that overlooks the moral urgency to act. As Republicans issue absurd calls to send in the National Guard to seal the border, it’s worth remembering that the Obama administration already did that — years before the child-migrant crisis erupted.

This volatile situation demands courage and calm. Mr. Obama has the calm, but does he have the courage? Can he send a clear message like the one given by the governor of Maryland, Martin O’Malley, who told his fellow governors: “It is contrary to everything we stand for as a people to try to summarily send children back to death.” Mayor Stephanie Miner of Syracuse wrote to Mr. Obama offering shelter in her city. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, are pushing back at Republican efforts to speed the children’s deportations. Clergy members in Texas and other states are teaming up to welcome and shelter the migrants.

With Republicans in a frenzy, public support for immigrants is being tested[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/16/immigration-poll_n_5589010.html?1405522973]. Leadership is needed.

The president, who has sought $3.7 billion from Congress for humanitarian and legal aid to migrant children, has the better argument. He has every right to defend his policies on moral as well as practical grounds, to confront the Tea Party’s fear and loathing with a call to treat traumatized children as refugees and protect them from harm.

It would be good to see Mr. Obama join other Democrats and Republicans in making the moral and legal case for compassionate action, to lead a backlash against the nativist backlash.

And while he’s at it, he can reaffirm his commitment to protecting, through executive action this year, millions of immigrants who have been here for years, who deserve the chance to legalize that Congress has refused them. He made this vow before the border crisis exploded; we could all benefit from hearing him repeat it.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Thursday:

• Another execution goes awry.

The death of a convicted murderer in Arizona took so long[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/us/arizona-takes-nearly-2-hours-to-execute-inmate.html] that his lawyer filed an emergency appeal more than an hour after the lethal drugs were injected.

A state witness said he was asleep and snoring, while other witnesses[http://www.macon.com/2014/07/24/3213821/ap-reporters-account-of-arizona.html] said he was gasping and snorting during the two-hour execution Wednesday. The inmate died before the court responded.

• Pressing the case for a Mideast cease-fire.

John Kerry continues his visit to the Mideast today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip-casualties.html] to negotiate an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, but the U.S. secretary of state has little to show for it so far.

Separately, the F.A.A. lifted its ban[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/world/middleeast/faa-lifts-ban-on-us-flights-to-and-from-israel.html] on U.S. flights to and out of Tel Aviv on Wednesday, saying Israel had taken precautions to ensure airport safety.

• Tougher sanctions on Russia weighed.

European Union officials are not expected to reach consensus quickly on their debate today on restricting Russian access to capital markets and defense and energy technology.

The stronger measures were proposed after the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight in Ukraine last week.

More remains of the 298 crash victims are being flown today to the Netherlands from eastern Ukraine for identification.

• Back to the East Coast.

President Obama wraps up a three-day swing through the West Coast with a speech at an innovative Los Angeles technical college[http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/23/45511/obama-s-trek-from-ritzy-fundraisers-to-la-trade-te/] today, while Michelle Obama attends a fund-raiser in Chicago.

• Reputation disaster.

The United States War College is reviewing the 2007 master’s thesis of Senator John Walsh, Democrat of Montana, after The Times found that at least a quarter of it was appropriated[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/us/politics/montana-senator-john-walsh-plagiarized-thesis.html] from other authors.

• Colorado’s same-sex marriage ban overruled.

A federal judge in Denver declared Colorado’s same-sex marriage[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/same_sex_marriage/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] ban unconstitutional but delayed the ruling to give the state until next month to seek an appeal.

• Ebola alarm rising.

The world’s largest outbreak[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28439941] of the devastating hemorrhagic disease is worsening in West Africa, with more than 630 dead in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Sierra Leone said its top doctor was infected.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are little changed. European shares are mixed, while Asian indexes ended widely varied.

• Major airlines, automakers and drug companies report their earnings today, among them United Continental and Southwest, G.M. and Ford, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

• Facebook shares reached a record high in after-hours trading on stronger-than-expected earnings. The stock is now close to double its initial offering price of two years ago.

• The I.M.F. updates its World Economic Outlook this morning.

NOTEWORTHY

• Superman turns 75.

And comic book fans are taking note at Comic-Con International[http://www.comic-con.org/], which is expected to draw 130,000 people to San Diego starting today.

They will be looking for preview shots of the “Superman vs. Batman” movie not due out until 2016, news about the new “Star Wars” movie that is shooting now, and leaks of the Marvel movie “Avengers: Age of Ultron.”

• Future of the final frontier.

Comic-Con also has a panel today on outer space and humankind’s coming adventures there.

“NASA’s Next Giant Leap,” moderated by the actor Seth Green, includes the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory systems engineer who achieved viral fame as “Mohawk Guy” during the Curiosity Mars rover landing in 2012.

• Weird Al is No. 1.

Mr. Yankovic’s new album, “Mandatory Fun,” is his first to top the charts, according to figures released Wednesday[http://variety.com/2014/music/news/weird-al-mandatory-fun-1201267687/]. It’s also the first comedy album to do so since Allan Sherman’s “My Son, the Nut” in 1963.

• A popular bloodsucker.

Residents of the Gulf Coast city of Clute, Tex., typically slap and spray away mosquitoes this time of year, but today, they’ll flock to a 26-foot skeeter named Willie-Man-Chew.

It’s the central attraction at the Great Texas Mosquito Festival[http://www.mosquitofestival.com/], with events including fajita cook-offs, baby crawl racing and a mosquito-calling contest.

• Famed South African raceway is auctioned off.

The Kyalami racetrack north of Johannesburg held Formula One Grand Prix races for nearly two decades until 1993.

With development in the area intense, speculation is high that the track may be bought and demolished.

BACK STORY

She won with a big-band version of “Happy Days Are Here Again,” becoming the first black woman to wear Miss America’s tiara.

But 30 years ago this week, with only about six weeks left in her reign, Vanessa Williams was forced to resign. Nude photos of her surfaced, and Penthouse was publishing them.

From that low point, Ms. Williams did not just rebound. She vaulted to a level of celebrity that surpassed the typical Miss America.

She made successful R&B albums, starred in films and Broadway shows, and appeared in dozens of television roles, including four seasons on “Ugly Betty.”

She has been nominated for Grammys, Emmys and Tonys, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Rick Rojas and Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.

Why Are We Ignoring a New Ebola Outbreak?

Three small, impoverished nations in West Africa—Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone—now demand the world’s attention as the deadly Ebola epidemic spins out of control, killing hundreds and threatening millions. Caused by a highly contagious virus, the disease starts with typical flu-like symptoms, yet most often leads to a horrific death in just a matter of days.

Since the outbreak started in early 2014, the World Health Organization reports 1048 people have contracted the disease, and over 600 have died[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_07_19_ebola/en/].  But since ministries of health in these three countries do not have the capacity to survey the disease and count the dead properly, many experts believe that the numbers are much higher[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/13/health-ebola-westafrica-idUSL6N0PO0V220140713].

 To put this into context, in 32 years (1976-2008) the Ebola virus infected 2,232 people in remote village areas and killed 1,503[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/]. In a matter of months, this current outbreak has killed more than one-third as many people.

Doctors Without Borders is the only non-governmental organization working against Ebola in Sierra Leone and Guinea. The organization I work for, Samaritan’s Purse, has collaborated with the group in Liberia, but this outbreak is too much for us to take on by ourselves. We desperately need others to join this fight.

More direct medical care and emergency supplies are urgently needed. More importantly, there is a tremendous need for public awareness campaigns. Although there is no cure for Ebola, people can survive this terrifying disease, and we know mortality rates dramatically drop with early medical intervention[http://www.nbcnews.com/#/health/health-news/inside-ebola-clinic-doctors-fight-out-control-virus-].

Our team recently treated Harrison, the first Ebola survivor in his own family, and in all of Liberia. Thankfully, he had friends who had been educated about the disease. They recognized the symptoms in him and got him prompt medical care. Without this early treatment, the odds are he would have died as his family did.

Of course, the best way to survive the disease is not to get it in the first place. Treatment after infection will not stop the crisis.  It is imperative that other organizations join us in reaching communities with accurate information on what the disease is, how to avoid getting it, and what to do if they or one of their loved ones becomes ill. Public health and awareness information is available from UNICEF and WHO, but a larger effort is needed to share it with the millions currently at risk.

Currently, there are more than 48 civil society organizations in Liberia, and there are dozens more in Guinea and Sierra Leone. We need them all to help us in the fight against this dreadful disease. Likewise, I call on the international community and the donor governments of the world, particularly in Europe and the United States, to step in and recognize the very limited capacities of the ministries of health in West Africa and to help them contain this disease.

I urge all organizations with capacity in medical, public health, social mobilization and water/sanitation to help in this fight.

A disaster has descended upon West Africa, and it deserves the full attention of the international community. The world’s deadliest and most contagious disease is on a collision course with millions in major population centers.

The situation is urgent. There is no time to wait.

Ken Isaacs is Vice President of Programs and Government Relations for the international relief organization Samaritan’s Purse[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/].

C.D.C. Says Tuberculosis Lab, Shut Amid Exposure Scare, Can Continue Its Work

Operations can resume at a government tuberculosis laboratory in Atlanta that was shut down this month as part of a moratorium[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/science/cdc-closes-anthrax-and-flu-labs-after-accidents.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] on handling dangerous microbes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] announced Thursday.

The moratorium, imposed by the agency after two accidents at other laboratories that could have exposed workers to anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and the lethal H5N1 flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus, was lifted at the lab because it has passed safety inspections and its work is crucial to treating drug-resistant tuberculosis cases all over the world, said Thomas Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman.

Top priority for reopening will go to labs directly involved in patient care and fighting epidemics, Mr. Skinner said. For example, he said, the labs handling the Ebola and chikungunya viruses might reopen soon because the worst epidemic of Ebola in history is underway in West Africa, and cases of chikungunya disease[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/us/2-in-florida-said-to-catch-fever-found-in-tropics.html?_r=0] are being diagnosed all over the United States.

The health agency also named 11 outside safety experts who will advise its director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, on fixing shoddy procedures[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/us/cdc-director-admits-to-pattern-of-unsafe-practices.html] at government laboratories.

While there have been calls for a panel with broad investigative powers, like the National Transportation Safety Board, Mr. Skinner said in an email that the panel’s purpose was to advise rather than investigate. But he added that “any group member wanting to visit a lab (even unannounced) and speak to any staff member speaking in the lab will be permitted to do so.”

None of the panel’s members have ever been employed by the C.D.C. Ten of the 11 teach at American medical schools[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medical_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or work at state laboratories; the exception is Heather Sheeley, who works in Britain’s public health agency.

The chairmen are Joseph Kanabrocki, assistant dean for biosafety at the University of Chicago, and Dr. Kenneth Berns of the University of Florida’s medical school.

The appointments drew mixed reviews from other experts. Michael T. Osterholm, a bioterrorism expert who is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, called the panel “an outstanding group.”

Amir Attaran, an expert on public health policy at the University of Ottawa, said the panel’s mandate seemed unusually vague and broad, since the news release describing it referred not just to C.D.C. labs but to “laboratories across the United States,” including private, academic and other federal ones.

He criticized the lack of foreigners as “almost jingoistic,” since an accident with an infectious agent could lead to a global pandemic.

Mr. Skinner said the decision to appoint mostly Americans was made “from a logistical standpoint.”

Correction: July 26, 2014, Saturday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about a decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow a tuberculosis laboratory to reopen quoted incorrectly from comments by Thomas Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman. He said, “any group member wanting to visit a lab (even unannounced) and speak to any staff member working in the lab will be permitted to do so.” He did not say, “speaking in the lab.”

Ebola rages in Guinea as fear keeps help at bay; Aid workers mistrusted by villagers are meeting with threats and hostility

Eight youths, some armed with slingshots and machetes, stood warily alongside a rutted dirt road at an opening in the high reeds, the path to the village of Kolo Bengou. The deadly Ebola virus is believed to have infected several people in the village, and the youths were blocking the path to prevent health workers from entering.

‘‘We don’t want any visitors,’’ said their leader, Faya Iroundouno, 17, president of Kolo Bengou’s youth league. ‘‘We don’t want any contact with anyone.’’ The others nodded in agreement and fiddled with their slingshots.

Singling out the international aid group Doctors Without Borders, Mr. Iroundouno continued, ‘‘Wherever those people have passed, the communities have been hit by illness.’’

Health workers here say they are now battling two enemies: the unprecedented Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 600 people in three countries since it was first detected in March, and fear, which has produced growing hostility toward outside help.

Workers and officials, blamed by panicked populations for spreading the virus, have been threatened with knives, stones and machetes, their vehicles sometimes surrounded by hostile mobs. Log barriers across narrow dirt roads block medical teams from reaching villages where the virus is suspected. Sick and dead villagers, cut off from help, are infecting others.

‘‘This is very unusual, that we are not trusted,’’ said Marc Poncin, the emergency coordinator in Guinea for Doctors Without Borders, the main group fighting the disease here. ‘‘We’re not stopping the epidemic.’’

Efforts to monitor it are grinding to a halt because of ‘‘intimidation,’’ he said. People appeared to have more confidence in witch doctors.

Health officials say the epidemic is out of control, moving back and forth across the porous borders of Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia — often on the backs of the cheap motorcycles that ply the roads of this region of green hills and dense forest — infiltrating the lively open-air markets, overwhelming weak health facilities and decimating villages.

It was in this rural area, 400 miles over bad road from Guinea’s capital, Conakry, where the outbreak was first spotted, and where it has hit hardest. More than 80 percent of those infected have died in this region, and Guinea has recorded more than twice as many deaths as the other countries.

In Koundony, over one-eighth of the population, including the headman, is dead; many others have fled.

There is no known cure for the virus, which causes raging fever, vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrolled bleeding in about half the cases and up to 90 percent of the time rapid death. Merely touching an infected person, or the body of a victim, is dangerous; coming into contact with blood, vomit or feces can be deadly.

Now the fear of aid workers, principally from Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross, is helping to spread the disease, health officials say, creating a secondary crisis.

Villagers flee at the sight of a Red Cross truck. When a Westerner passes, villagers cry out, ‘‘Ebola, Ebola!’’ and run away.

Doctors Without Borders has classified 25 villages in Guinea as ‘‘red,’’ meaning they are suspected of harboring Ebola but are inaccessible for safety reasons.

As recently as April, the epidemic appeared to be under control. But in the past two weeks, its center appeared to have shifted across the border to Sierra Leone, where most of the new dead were being recorded. The sick are being hidden and the dead buried, without any protection. This past week, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry reported that its lead doctor fighting Ebola had contracted the disease.

But in Guinea, in the village of Wabengou, residents placed a tree in the road to block outsiders. They also attacked an official delegation from Conakry, rushing its cars, banging on the vehicles and brandishing machetes, according to Doctors Without Borders.

‘‘We don’t want them in there at all,’’ said Wabengou’s chief, Marcel Dambadounou. ‘‘We don’t accept their presence at all. They are the transporters of the virus in these communities.’’

He was surrounded by grim-looking men from Wabengou, standing at a crossroads on the way to his village; none of them demurred.

‘‘We are absolutely afraid, and that’s why we are avoiding contact with everybody, the whole world,’’ he said.

Doctors Without Borders has set up an emergency treatment center in the regional capital, Guéckédou, but a nurse there said the center had diminishing appeal.

‘‘Here, if the people come in, they don’t leave alive,’’ said the nurse, Fadima Diawara.

It may not help win confidence that the medical teams wear top-to-toe suits and masks, burning much of the outfit after helping a patient.

The wariness against outside intervention has deep roots. This part of Guinea, known as the Forest Region, where more than 200 people have already died from the disease, is known for its strong belief in traditional religion. The dictator who ruled Guinea with an iron fist for decades, Ahmed Sékou Touré, was only partly successful in a 1960s campaign to stamp out these beliefs, despite mass burnings of fetishes.

Addressing villagers recently in Bawa, where a woman had just died, the regional prefect from Guéckédou, Mohammed Cinq Keita, warned: ‘‘There is no root, no leaf, no animal that can cure you. Don’t be fooled.’’

Near the border with Sierra Leone, Doctors Without Borders discovered an Ebola patient who had been privately ‘‘treated’’ in the village of Teldou and then returned to his relatives in another village, possibly infecting untold others.

‘‘Extremely, extremely concerning,’’ said Sylvie Jonckheere, the charity’s doctor on the scene. A colleague in full gear lectured the villagers of Teldou as the rain started, but was met with indifference or hostile stares; some turned their backs on him.

As the aid workers drove off, the private nurse who administered a shot to the Ebola patient defended his treatment. ‘‘I couldn’t say that he had the illness,’’ said the nurse, Eduard Leno. ‘‘His body was hot, that’s all.’’

Asked why the patient had not been sent to the clinic in Guéckédou, he said: ‘‘We are in the bush here. You can’t just send someone away. How will society view you?’’

Local officials have begun a campaign to open the closed villages, but here in tiny Koundony, fear is palpable.

On a recent day, a Red Cross truck drove up to the cemetery to deliver the body of Marie Condé, 14, wrapped in heavy plastic sheeting.

As the body was carried off the truck, a high-pitched wail pierced the country stillness. ‘‘There is no cure!’’ a woman cried. ‘‘There is no cure!’’

The gravedigger, Marie’s half-brother Famhan Condé, 26, was sweating as he heaved shovels of dirt. The grave, he said, would be the 26th he had dug since the epidemic began.

‘‘We’re all scared here,’’ he said. ‘‘There’s no solution. We can do nothing. Only God can save us.’’

West Africa's current Ebola outbreak has spread to a fourth country, as Nigeria on Friday confirmed a death caused by the disease. Officials said a 40-year-old Liberian government official died of Ebola in a Lagos hospital on Friday after arriving in the country on Tuesday. It is the first case of Ebola to be confirmed in Nigeria since the outbreak began in West Africa this year, said Nigeria's health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu. The Liberian was attending an international conference in Lagos and died early Friday. The Lagos University Teaching Hospital said the man's blood tested positive for Ebola. One of the world's most deadly and contagious diseases, Ebola has killed at least 660 and infected 1,093 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and now Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization.

On the Road
Business Day
A Boom in Corporate Travel, as Well as Threats to Safety
By JOE SHARKEY

LOS ANGELES — BOOM times are back in corporate travel, but so, too, is the anxiety.

For corporate travel managers gathering here at the annual convention of the Global Business Travel Association[http://www.gbta.org], two topics were high on the agenda: the surge in international business travel and the complex safety and security issues that arise as companies send more employees to diverse locations around the world.

This year’s convention, which has drawn about 6,700 travel managers, suppliers and others in the industry, falls during a tumultuous time for corporate travel. The trade group said that spending on business travel would rise about 7 percent this year, to roughly $1.18 trillion — $292.3 billion of that in the United States, up 3 percent. But as the industry representatives geared up over the weekend for five days of meetings, exhibitions and after-hours parties, there is a lot of sober discussion about travel safety and risk management.

“I’ve been at this 28 years — military, U.S. government, different response companies — and this is the greatest concentration of threat that I’ve ever seen, because of the frequency and severity of these incidents, but also because companies and institutions are global now,” said John M. Rose, chief operating officer of iJet[http://www.ijet.com/], a travel risk management company.

On Sunday, executives from iJet and another travel security and emergency response company, International SOS[https://www.internationalsos.com/en/], jointly presented a four-hour training session for a group of travel managers concerned about safety policies and health issues, for both highly experienced travelers and younger, novice travelers, “who tend to believe they are invincible,” said Wendy Stachowiak, director of global travel partnerships for International SOS.

Recent events have focused attention on growing corporate responsibilities for their travelers. “With everything that has happened in the last eight days, people are looking at things differently,” Mr. Rose said on Sunday. He asked the group gathered around tables in a conference room what they were hearing right now as main travel safety concerns. The first two responses, he said, were “Malaysian airliner shot down” and “outbreak of Ebola.”

In the last two weeks, a concentration of events has forced travel managers to focus more intensely on legal and ethical responsibilities for managing travel risk: the Malaysian airliner shot down by a missile in Ukraine and two other deadly plane crashes elsewhere; the halting of some air routes in the Middle East because of fears about ground combat; and the temporary suspension of some flights to Israel. In addition, the United States evacuated its embassy in Libya; street protests reached a boil in Hong Kong; and, just as disturbing to security managers, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus was spreading in West Africa.

“The thing that really keeps me awake is Ebola,” Mr. Rose said. That has dire implications, added Dr. Myles Druckman, medical director for International SOS, including a threat posed by returning international travelers who have been exposed to the virus. “These things were simply not on people’s radar in the past,” Dr. Druckman said.

Similar themes were sounded on Monday at a panel discussion titled “Get Me Out of Here!” sponsored by the trade association’s risk committee. “How do you plan for these things, and how do you decide what your responsibilities in general are to your traveling population?” said Pablo Weisz, a regional security manager for International SOS. “What kind of travelers do you have? Experienced? A traveler on their first or second international trip? What kind of training do those individuals need?”

Many travelers balk at keeping their companies closely apprised of their day-to-day activities and locations. But knowing where people are in a crisis is crucial, security experts say. Mr. Weisz said: “Young travelers might arrive in Beirut and announce that arrival on Facebook, but at the same time they might question why the company wants to know exactly where they are. It’s a matter of getting them used to it: Your company does need to know where you are.”

Increasingly, travel management involves legal issues, including potential criminal penalties in some countries for not maintaining adequate so-called duty of care for traveling workers. “There’s a lot of risk associated with not meeting your duty-of-care responsibilities,” Mr. Weisz said. In a lawsuit, for example, a company travel manager might be asked in court, “What did you do to protect your traveler?” he added.

With business travel growing around the world (China is likely to surpass the United States in business travel spending by 2016, the trade group says), “today you have a different dynamic in managing business travel,” said Michael W. McCormick, the Global Business Travel Association’s executive director.

“In the old days, it was Chicago to New York, New York to Los Angeles,” Mr. McCormick said. “Now, in a sense, every company is global, and they’re sending their travelers all over the world to do business.”

Short Staff Tries to Cope With Ebola

Early this month at a hospital in Sierra Leone, Dr. Daniel Bausch and another physician found themselves alone in a ward with 55 patients infected with the deadly Ebola virus. The nurses had walked out in a dispute over extra pay to take care of the Ebola patients, and some were also staying away for fear of contracting the disease, which has killed health workers.

Dr. Bausch and his colleague, both working for the World Health Organization, did what they could.

''Even if you wanted to be the hero, you couldn't take care of 55 people,'' he said. ''We tried to attend to the most important things we could attend to in terms of people who were the sickest. To be honest, it sounds terrible, not really the sickest, but the sickest who you think have chances of surviving. If you've seen cases of Ebola before, you can see when someone is on their last gasp and trying to treat them won't save them.''

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been struggling since March to stop what has become the largest Ebola outbreak ever, with 1,201 cases so far, including 672 deaths. The disease is causing widespread fear and disruption in West Africa, and shows no signs of being brought under control.

Liberia has closed many of its border crossings in an effort to contain the virus. Nigeria has shut down a hospital for decontamination, after a man from Liberia died there on Friday from Ebola. He had flown in from Liberia a few days earlier, and collapsed at the airport in Lagos. So far, 59 people who had contact with him are being monitored, but that figure does not include the passengers on the flight, who will also have to be tracked down.

That an infected person who may have been obviously ill managed to board a plane has stoked fears that other travelers could carry the disease to still more countries. So health officials in the region are considering the idea of monitoring people for signs of infection before allowing them to board flights leaving the affected countries, experts from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said on Monday.

Ebola is spread only by direct contact with bodily fluids -- blood, vomit, saliva, urine, stool -- from someone who is ill. People who are infected but do not yet have symptoms, which can include fever, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding, are not contagious. American health officials said that they did not expect the disease to reach the United States, but that if it did, standard infection control procedures would almost certainly stop it from spreading.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the disease centers, said in a statement, ''We do not anticipate this will spread in the U.S. if an infected person is hospitalized here but we are taking action now by alerting health care workers in the U.S. and reminding them how to isolate and test suspected patients.''

In areas where the disease has been spreading, health workers need special training to avoid infection and must wear several layers of protective clothing -- gowns, masks, goggles, boots, gloves and waterproof aprons or coveralls. The gear is suffocatingly hot and people can tolerate it for only so long in the tropics. The masks can fog up, making a risky business of, say, inserting an intravenous line or drawing blood. Another peril can come from taking off the protective gear, which must be removed according to a strict protocol.

Reports over the weekend that two American health workers in Liberia became infected despite wearing the required gear have troubled medical experts. Doctors from the disease centers said on Monday that they did not know how the two became infected. Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, a physician from Sierra Leone who was leading its efforts to fight the outbreak, has also become infected.

Dr. Bausch, an associate professor at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and the head of the Virology and Emerging Infections Department at the United States Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 in Lima, Peru, said he had worked during the current outbreak only in Guinea and Sierra Leone, not in Liberia. But he said that conditions at a hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone -- where he was on the ward with 55 Ebola patients -- might help explain why workers are at risk.

''You need to have a controlled environment, enough health workers to take care of patients, clean the ward, provide the ancillary services required to reinforce safe practices,'' he said. ''That was definitely not there.''

It was not uncommon, he said, to find that four or five severely ill patients had fallen out of bed and were soiled with blood, stool or vomit. Several people would be needed to clean and decontaminate them and their surroundings, but the personnel were not available. In that kind of setting, he said, the risk for health workers rises.

Doctors Without Borders has described the Ebola epidemic sweeping across West Africa as ‘‘out of control.’’ The Ebola virus, which is fatal in 90 percent of cases, has killed more than 670 people in West Africa and spread to 60 locations in four countries. The obstacles to bringing the virus under control are formidable, among them a shortage of medical resources and resistance from local communities terrified by a disease they do not understand.

The current outbreak began in Guinea in March. Sierra Leone is now the epicenter of the epidemic. The situation is deteriorating rapidly in Liberia. On Friday, a man died of an Ebola infection in Lagos, Nigeria.

Nurses and doctors are also falling victim to the disease. Two American aid workers have tested positive, and a doctor at Liberia’s largest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia, has died of the disease. The virus is amplified by a mobile population, especially across the shared borders between Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. In the Nigerian case, the infected victim entered on a passenger flight from Liberia. The World Health Organization and the Nigerian government have shut down the hospital where the man died, and other passengers on the flight are being tracked down and tested.

Infected individuals must be isolated in health centers to prevent the virus from spreading to others and to give them the care they need. Bodies of victims must also be disposed of with care: The virus, present in bodily fluids, including sweat, is most infectious at the end-stage. Then there is widespread ignorance among the most vulnerable populations about what needs to be done. The result is that many people are hiding sick loved ones at home and transporting bodies for burial with no understanding of the precautions they must take.

Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, has declared a national Ebola emergency. The governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria must also act with equal urgency to raise public awareness, put additional trained medical personnel on the ground and trace patients’ contacts with others. The current Ebola outbreak is more than a sum of national emergencies. It is now a regional crisis, and the whole of West Africa must act to contain it.

Washington Prepares to Host Meeting of African Leaders

WASHINGTON — Federal officials have warned government employees here that the arrival next week of 50 African leaders — and their motorcades — will bring city traffic to a standstill during a two-day White House summit meeting about issues on the continent.

In an email to top officials at federal offices, the nation’s personnel chief urged agencies to let their workers stay at home during the event, which takes place next Tuesday and Wednesday. Traffic is also expected to be snarled on Monday and Thursday as the leaders arrive and leave.

“Agencies should consider encouraging employees who can be spared from their duties to request to adjust their work schedules,” Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, wrote Friday in a memo.

The two-day gathering was arranged after President Obama visited Africa last year. Officials have said the summit meeting will focus on increasing trade and investment in Africa, improving security, and building on the continent’s progress toward democracy.

The White House said that all African leaders who are “in good standing” with the United States and the African Union[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/african_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org] are included. The president did not invite President Robert Mugabe[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/robert_mugabe/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Zimbabwe and President Omar Hassan al-Bashir[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/omar_hassan_al_bashir/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Sudan, among several others.

The leaders are invited to a reception on Capitol Hill on Monday evening, events at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Tuesday morning, a dinner at the White House on Tuesday evening and a series of sessions with Mr. Obama on Wednesday. The first lady, Michelle Obama, and Laura Bush, the former first lady, will be the hosts of the African leaders’ spouses at a daylong symposium at the Kennedy Center.

Ms. Archuleta wrote that for now the federal government would remain open Monday through Thursday next week, but she advised federal employees to monitor local news outlets for announcements about potential street closings, disruptions to public transportation or a closing of the federal government.

Some of the leaders will be arriving from countries that are experiencing an outbreak of the Ebola virus, but officials at the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that the government was not taking any specific precautions. “We believe air travel continues to be safe, and the C.D.C. has stated there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak,” Edward Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said in an email.

The World Health Organization has said that the more than 1,000 cases of confirmed Ebola infection[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/world/africa/short-staff-tries-to-cope-with-ebola.html] in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone represent the worst-ever outbreak for the deadly disease, a hemorrhagic fever that has no known cure and a death rate that approaches 90 percent.

A spokesman for the C.D.C. said procedures are already in place to stem the spread of Ebola, and flight crews and airline personnel will generally not allow a sick passenger to board a plane.

The spokesman, Jason McDonald, said, “There are no plans or indications that we’re going to take any additional precautions with the leaders who are coming.”

The doctor leading Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s fight against the worst Ebola outbreak on record died from the virus on Tuesday, the country’s chief medical officer said. The death of Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, 39, highlights the dangers health workers face in trying to halt the disease’s spread across West Africa. Ebola is believed to have killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in February. The regional airline Asky has suspended flights to and from Sierra Leone and Liberia. Asky, which is based in Togo, also said passengers leaving Guinea’s capital, Conakry, would be checked for symptoms before departure. Nigeria’s largest carrier, Arik Air, has suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone because of the Ebola risk.

Federal law enforcement policies on marijuana use are out of step with scientific consensus, writes Philip M. Boffey for The New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/opinion/what-science-says-about-marijuana.html?ref=opinion]. “Marijuana is far less harmful to human health than most banned drugs and is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco.” Mr. Boffey concedes that marijuana isn’t an entirely harmless substance: “The potency of current strains may shock those who haven’t tried it for decades, particularly when ingested as food. It can produce a serious dependency, and constant use would interfere with job and school performance. It needs to be kept out of the hands of minors.” But on balance, “its downsides are not reasons to impose criminal penalties on its possession, particularly not in a society that permits nicotine use and celebrates drinking.”

Other significant viewpoints from around the world:

“Relatively tough sanctions from the United States and European Union on Russian banks and oil companies, and a string of military defeats that have pushed back his proxy forces” in Eastern Ukraine constitute “a dangerous moment” for Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, says an editorial in The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-west-must-prepare-for-a-wounded-putin-to-become-even-more-aggressive/2014/07/30/d80efcd8-1804-11e4-85b6-c1451e622637_story.html]. The editorial adds, “He is capable of shifts of direction — such as his sudden offer last summer to help strip his ally Syria of chemical weapons.” But Mr. Putin is “more likely to escalate than back down. Ukraine and the West must be prepared for a more forceful and overt Russian military intervention.”

The arrest of foreign correspondents in Tehran is “a brutal reminder of the distance between President Hassan Rouhani’s reforming promises and his willingness to act,” says an editorial in The Guardian[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/30/guardian-view-detained-journalists-iran-hassan-rouhani]. “His silence on this arrest, which took place over a week ago on 22 July, is turning the affair into a public test of the president’s ambition to usher in the more liberal era he promised barely a year ago, and his readiness to resist the determination of the conservative judiciary and ultimately Ayatollah Khamanei to block him.” The editorial calls on President Rouhani to prove his willingness to reform by freeing the journalists. Otherwise, “it will be a damaging blow to confidence in his capacity to deliver — particularly in the U.S.”

California Governor Jerry Brown signed an executive order in April that “prohibited homeowners groups from fining members for brown lawns,” reports an editorial in The San Francisco Chronicle[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/California-drought-We-all-must-conserve-5658166.php]. It didn’t stop the association of a Bay Area development from asking its resident to use more water for their lawns, which highlights a problem with the state’s approach to the water shortage: “Not everyone gets it. Hardly a day goes by without another letter to the editor arriving to complain about how the writer’s earnest conservation efforts were being overwhelmed by the obliviousness of water hogs — even by some of the same state and local governments that have been pressing for mandatory cutbacks on usage.” Everyone, the editorial says, must change their ways.

“The entire world must rally to the aid of West Africa as the region experiences the biggest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in history,” says an editorial in The Cleveland Plain Dealer[http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/07/the_world_must_fight_against_t.html]. “The viral disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent, has killed more than 600 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.” Help should include “volunteer medical teams, equipment and local outreach workers, especially as panic grows and the region’s health professionals fall prey to the disease, damaging an already rudimentary health system.” The world must devote special attention to keeping the disease out of Lagos, Nigeria, the largest city in Africa, the editorial points out. If it spreads to that city, “it could potentially hop-scotch across the world.”

In the two months since a military coup removed Yingluck Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand, from power, the newly installed National Council for Peace and Order “appears to have made progress in tackling protracted problems on many fronts,” according to an editorial in The Bangkok Post[http://m.bangkokpost.com/opinion/423340]. For example, the N.C.P.O. has cracked down on “forest encroachment by the rich to turn the once wooded land into resorts, condominiums, oil palm or rubber plantations.” But the N.C.P.O. needs to shift focus on unrest in southern provinces, which anchors Thailand’s sizable Muslim community. “Many people in this region, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are living a dangerous life, not knowing when they will fall victim to a bomb blast or gunshots perpetrated by the radical militants.” There have been 26 violent incidents since the coup, the editorial adds, and the N.C.P.O.’s actions in the south “are too little given the severity of the problem and the safety of the people down there.”

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Nada. Zip. Goose egg.

Between partisan bickering and intra-Republican clashes, Congress failed [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/us/politics/blow-to-house-gop-leadership-as-border-bill-falters-.html]to arrive at any kind of border bill. No emergency funds. No increased security.

It hasn’t just been a rough day on the Hill, it’s been a rough year. Could it get even worse?

“No!” says our congressional reporter, Jonathan Weisman. “It’s going to get better.”

This year has been more intense than usual, he says, “because it’s a midterm in which Senate control is truly at stake, and almost every race up for grabs is a Democrat fighting on Republican turf.”

“Next year, it’s not an election year,” he says, and “really you’re not going to see presidential politics start consuming politics till the summer.”

“And in the midterms, if the Republicans take control of the Senate, they’re going to want to show they can do something.”

• The crisis of so many crises.

People are fleeing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, Afghanistan and Myanmar — and that’s just some.

They are being displaced on a scale that hasn’t been seen since World War II, says Nick Cumming-Bruce, our reporter who covers the United Nations from Geneva.

And relief agencies are finding themselves desperate.

“It has put the entire United Nations humanitarian response mechanism under extraordinary strain,” Mr. Cumming-Bruce says.

In some places the lack of resources is so severe that, he notes, “the daily ration of food given to refugees is being sharply reduced.”

“There isn’t enough money in the pot to deliver what had once been the requisite amount.”

The only recourse is to go to donor countries, which claim to be tapped out.

“They ask for more,” Mr. Cumming-Bruce says, “but many programs remain critically underfunded.”

• Pitched battle against a virus.

The governments of several West African nations are desperate to stop an Ebola epidemic that started in March.

They’ve announced a range of emergency measures[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html], from closing schools to using security forces to enforce quarantines, after a surge of deaths in the last week brought the toll to 729.

It’s an uphill battle, says Adam Nossiter, our West Africa bureau chief, who has been reporting on the epidemic from Guinea and Nigeria.

There is no cure, and the majority of those infected die of raging fevers, diarrhea and internal and external bleeding.

“These countries — their leaders — are now quite fearful, reflecting the fears of the population,” Mr. Nossiter says.

“But their health systems are too weak to stop the outbreak,” he warns. “They need lots of outside help.”

• Argentina as precedent.

We’ve been hearing for years about sovereign default, thanks to the global economic downturn, and the efforts of debt-racked countries like Greece to persuade creditors to accept less than promised.

The case of Argentina, though, is a new wrinkle. It has ended up in its second default[http://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000003031166/argentina-default-clouds-market-horizon.html] in 12 years, squeezed by a hedge fund backed up by an American court.

“This landmark legal case may have made it harder for countries to reach deals that lessen their debt,” says Peter Eavis, a Times business reporter who is covering the default.

“The case does that, according to some experts, because it has strengthened the hand of creditors, like the hedge funds in this case.”

• Showdown in New York.

“There’s a sense that Cuomo is now being bedeviled and upstaged by a very Cuomo-like figure.”

That’s Michael Barbaro, one of our political reporters, on the examination by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/nyregion/us-attorney-warns-cuomo-on-ethics-case-.html] of how Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo shut down his own anticorruption commission.

The situation, Mr. Barbaro says, pits two “big, swaggering, only-in-New York personalities” against each other.

Preet Bharara, the headline-grabbing U.S. attorney, has turned to some of the same tactics used by Mr. Cuomo when he was the state’s attorney general.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed down. The Dow dropped 317 points, closing at 16,563.3, and the S.&P. 500 lost 2 percent, closing at 1,930.7.

TONIGHT

• The (fictional) Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a British-Israeli heiress in “The Honorable Woman[http://www.sundance.tv/series/the-honorable-woman],” a new series whose plot centers on the death of a Palestinian businessman connected to her family’s business empire.

Our TV critic Alessandra Stanleycalls the timing “disturbing,” [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/arts/television/the-honorable-woman-starring-maggie-gyllenhaal.html]but says the show is “an astute, sensitive and at times delicate psychological drama that is evenhanded” (10 p.m. Eastern, Sundance).

• The reality of fantasy.

A new series, “The Quest[http://abc.go.com/shows/the-quest],” drops 12 contestants into a medieval world of dragons and ogres, where they are declared defenders of a noble cause.

They compete to save the kingdom, and the last survivor earns the title of the One True Hero (8 p.m. Eastern, ABC).

• If you’re staying up …

On “The Daily Show”: Aubrey Plaza, who stars in the coming zombie comedy “Life After Beth[http://a24films.com/films/life-after-beth/]” (11 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

“The Colbert Report”: Campbell Brown, journalist and founder of the Partnership for Educational Justice[http://www.edjustice.org/], which is suing New York State to end teacher tenure (11:31 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

“The Tonight Show”: Julia Roberts; Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens: Live[http://www.bravotv.com/watch-what-happens-live]”; the actor and comedian Ron Funches[http://ronfunches.com/] (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC).

“Jimmy Kimmel Live”: Kerry Washington; a performance by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, who have a new album[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hypnotic-eye/id885180084] (11:35 p.m. Eastern, ABC).

TOMORROW

• Get ready to mosh.

The Lollapalooza Music Festival[http://www.lollapalooza.com/] — started by the alt-rock vanguard Perry Farrell in 1991 — takes over Grant Park in downtown Chicago.

The headliners are Eminem (Friday), Outkast (Saturday) and Kings of Leon (Sunday). But there are many, many more acts all weekend long.

Even the heavily secretive, fast-rising new British electro-soul collective Jungle[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/arts/music/identities-revealed-jungle-is-releasing-a-new-album.html] is making an appearance.

The Peace Corps said Wednesday that it was temporarily withdrawing 340 volunteers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and that two volunteers had been isolated and were under observation after being exposed to a person who later died of the Ebola virus. A spokeswoman said the two volunteers, who were not identified, were not symptomatic and would return to the United States after they were cleared to travel. Liberia, meanwhile, moved to close schools nationwide and put nonessential government workers on 30-day compulsory leave in a bid to halt the outbreak, which is the worst on record. Ebola is blamed for 672 deaths in the three countries, according to the World Health Organization.

A message for leaders of Africa; Listening Post

When Barack Obama made his first trip as president to Africa in July 2009, he memorably told lawmakers in Ghana that ‘‘Africa doesn’t need strongmen; it needs strong institutions.’’ Next week, several of those strongmen will convene in Washington as part of a landmark gathering of nearly 50 African leaders.

The question, Africa experts are asking, is what Mr. Obama will tell them. ‘‘Are we going to have a strong message for these strongmen?’’ said Vera Songwe, the World Bank’s country director for Senegal, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania.

The answer, White House officials say, is a resounding yes: The meeting, the largest of its kind on American soil, will send ‘‘a very tangible signal of elevating Africa within American foreign policy,’’ said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. ‘‘This is a way to put Africa on the same footing as other areas of the world.’’ Still, given the attendance of iron-fisted leaders from Angola and Equatorial Guinea — to say nothing of American partners with checkered records, like the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda — it is not exactly the message that human rights activists would like.

The centerpiece of the three-day summit meeting will be a high-octane session to stimulate trade and investment. The leaders will be put together with dozens of deal-hungry American chief executives. Former President Bill Clinton will speak, as will the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, whose foundation is a co-sponsor.

The White House will push initiatives like Power Africa, a privately funded plan to bring electricity to 20 million households across sub-Saharan Africa. Companies have pledged $9 billion, and the White House is likely to announce more backing at the summit meeting.

Though American officials are loath to admit it, the model for this approach is China, which has been spending lavishly in Africa, mainly to lock up mineral resources for its booming economy.

With such a heavy emphasis on commerce, however, some activists say the meeting will miss a chance to press African leaders on civil liberties and human rights abuses.

‘‘No African leader is going to say no to an invitation from Obama to come to Washington,’’ said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, who specializes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, although the leaders of Liberia and Sierra Leone elected to stay home to deal with the growing Ebola threat. ‘‘So in that sense, it’s a real missed opportunity.’’

The White House notes that it has made governance one of the three main themes of the meeting, along with trade and investment, and peace and security.

Human rights and the rule of law, officials said, will be an inevitable subtext in all the discussions. ‘‘As longstanding friends, it’s important that we speak to each other candidly,’’ the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said in a speech Wednesday at the United States Institute for Peace.

‘‘For all that Africa has achieved, progress has not come fast enough or spread far enough,’’ she said. ‘‘Discrimination and habits of corruption still undermine many countries’ ability to govern effectively.’’ Other experts said the administration was right not to call too much attention to the sins of its guests. The more subtle message, they said, will be to remind Africans that the best American companies want to invest only in places with a reliable rule of law.

‘‘It would be a huge mistake to lecture on the democracy and human rights agenda,’’ said Jennifer G. Cooke, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Yet human rights considerations clearly played a role in assembling the guest list. The United States did not invite the leaders of Sudan, Eritrea, the Central African Republic or Zimbabwe, all of whom are on bad terms with the African Union. Egypt was invited belatedly after its election restored it to good standing with the African Union.

Egypt’s new president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, declined the invitation and will send his prime minister instead — in part because none of the leaders will get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama. Administration officials said that was simply a matter of logistics; the leaders will have to make do with a handshake and a few words of greeting.

CABIN FEVER

Patient Zero

Opens on Friday

Directed by Kaare Andrews

1 hour 35 minutes; not rated

Tickets to “Cabin Fever: Patient Zero”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJkmT3ykes&feature=youtu.be] should come with saltines and ginger ale, though the nausea factor is less extreme — and the filmmaking less auspicious — than that of “Cabin Fever,”[http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E1D6133BF931A2575AC0A9659C8B63] which opened in 2003, and “Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever,” which bypassed a theatrical release.

Once again, the villain is a flesh-eating virus. At a remote island disease research center controlled by the Dominican Republic, Dr. Edwards (Currie Graham) hopes to extract a cure from Porter (Sean Astin[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/2649/Sean-Astin?inline=nyt-per]), an imprisoned, asymptomatic patient. This supposedly uninhabited island is where Marcus (Mitch Ryan) and his friends have the misfortune to go ashore for a bachelor party.

Less methodical and witty than its predecessors, “Patient Zero” often turns its infected characters into mindless, lurching zombies. Some shots are so dark or shaky that it’s difficult to tell what’s going on. The medical staff (apart from a voice of reason, played by Solly Duran) shows little regard for patient safety or common sense.

Like George A. Romero’s similarly claustrophobic “Day of the Dead,”[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/03/movies/film-day-of-the-dead.html] “Patient Zero” has allegorical overtones. Porter speaks of rendition and rights. Even taken literally, the movie could hardly ask for better timing, in light of the recent accidents[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/science/cdc-closes-anthrax-and-flu-labs-after-accidents.html] at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=first-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news].

Better actors would have helped. Playing to the cheap seats, the film reaches its nadir during a brawl in which a decaying buxom lab assistant (Lydia Hearst) and Marcus’s brother’s ailing girlfriend (Jillian Murray) literally rip each other apart. Up next: Russ Meyer’s “Cabin Fever.”[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/281703/Cabin-Fever-Movie-/overview]

Ebola Spreads Despite Efforts To Suppress It

ABUJA, Nigeria — As the death toll mounted from the worst outbreak of the Ebola virus, West African leaders quickened the pace of emergency efforts on Thursday, deploying soldiers and authorizing house-to-house searches for infected people in an effort to combat the disease.

International efforts to contain the virus also gained momentum and urgency. The World Health Organization announced a $100 million plan on Thursday to get more medical experts and supplies to the overwhelmed region, as the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States committed the agency to sending 50 more experts there in coming weeks.

First recognized in March[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/health/ebola-killing-scores-in-guinea-threatens-nearby-nations.html] in Guinea, the Ebola outbreak has surged through porous borders to invade neighboring countries, quickly outstripping fragile health systems and forcing health officials to fight the battle on many fronts. Past outbreaks have been more localized, but the current one has spread extensively over a vast region.

The stepped-up effort is long overdue, according to some analysts. They say the initial response was inadequate on both the national and international level and allowed the disease to mushroom from a local outbreak to an international threat.

The viral illness has extracted a terrible toll, killing 729 people, including top physicians in Liberia and Sierra Leone, nations that already faced an acute shortage of doctors. The outbreak has also sickened two American aid workers, who were being rushed back to the United States for treatment.

“The whole thing has been very incompetently handled,” said Lansana Gberie, a historian from Sierra Leone. “If the government had quarantined this area” where the outbreak started, in the remote northeast, “they could have contained it. Instead they opened a treatment center in Kenema, a major population center.”

On PoliticoSL, a widely followed website in Sierra Leone, a journalist, Umaru Fofana, has written recently[http://politicosl.com/2014/06/ebola-does-not-kill-in-sierra-leone/] that “the country seems leaderless in the fight.” Now that cases have spread so widely, controlling the outbreak will be more costly and difficult.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., warned on Thursday that the worsening outbreak could take at least three to six months to bring under control, “even in a best-case scenario.” Hostility and violence directed at health workers are making the job harder, he said.

The C.D.C. advised Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to the three countries hardest hit by the virus: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The agency issued a Level 3 travel warning, reserved for grave situations. It was also used for the outbreak of the highly contagious respiratory disease SARS.

Dr. Frieden said that a major concern is that travelers who become ill or injured and need medical care may risk being exposed to Ebola at hospitals in the region. When infection-control measures are poor, hospitals become “amplification points,” spreading the disease they are supposed to contain, he said.

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said Thursday that the United States was considering a medical evacuation to bring home American aid workers diagnosed with Ebola. Two, infected in Liberia, were in grave condition, according to a statement[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/samaritans-purse-doctor-serving-in-liberia-west-africa-tests-positive-for-ebola/] on the website of a charitable organization, Samaritan’s Purse.

Emory University Hospital in Atlanta issued a statement on Thursday saying it had been told of plans to transfer a patient with Ebola to its special containment unit, set up in collaboration with the C.D.C., in the next several days. Because of privacy laws, the hospital declined to name the patient.

The W.H.O. said the tally of deaths from Ebola rose after 56 more people died during the four days ending Sunday in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria had one fatality. In the same period, 122 new cases were detected, bringing the total of confirmed and suspected cases to 1,323.

The virus causes high fever, vomiting, diarrhea and, in some cases, bleeding. In the current outbreak, about 60 percent of the cases have been fatal. It is transmitted by contact with bodily fluids from someone who is ill.

There is no vaccine to prevent the illness, and no specific treatment for it, only care to try to nurse people through the worst of the fevers, bleeding and other symptoms. The only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate each infected patient, trace all their contacts, isolate the ones who get sick and repeat the process until, finally, there are no more cases.

President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone declared a public health emergency. He said security forces would be deployed to support health professionals, and that “all epicenters of the disease will be quarantined” along with “localities and homes where the disease is identified.” The measures would be enforced for 60 to 90 days.

Public meetings will be restricted, houses will be searched for infected people, Parliament will be recalled and top officials will be obliged to cancel all but essential overseas travel.

Liberia has announced steps to close schools, put nonessential government workers on compulsory leave for 30 days and order the deployment of security forces to combat the outbreak.

Nigeria recorded its only known death from Ebola when an American working in Liberia died there after flying into Lagos in late July. Fear of the disease is so great that courier companies have refused to transport a blood sample from the patient to a laboratory in Senegal for testing, according to the W.H.O.

Nigerian airport authorities said on Thursday that they had begun checking passengers arriving from the affected countries for high temperatures, and would order compulsory blood tests for those with worrisome symptoms. Airport checks are also in force in Sierra Leone, and Ghana announced new screening procedures on Thursday.

Mr. Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, who had planned to attend a United States-Africa summit meeting in Washington, said that he would instead travel to Guinea on Friday to discuss a regional response to the outbreak. “The disease is beyond the scope of any one country, or community, to defeat,” he said.

As news of the Ebola outbreak has spread globally, there was some worry that the disease could spread beyond West Africa.

Lucy Moreton, the head of the Immigration Service Union, which represents immigration staff in Britain, said there were concerns about how staff members should react if they suspected a traveler had been infected. “There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility and until extremely recently, there has been no guidance issued to staff at all as to what they should do,” she said.

Governments, experts and international bodies sought to tamp down fears.

In New York, Dr. Jay Varma, the deputy commissioner for disease control at the city’s health department, said that someone at an area airport with symptoms that could be from Ebola would immediately be isolated and tested, briefly quarantined at the airport and quickly taken to a hospital where the department has standing arrangements for just such an event.

In Geneva, the International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world’s major airlines, also played down the hazards outside West Africa, saying in a statement[http://www.atn.aero/article.pl?id=51203] on Thursday that the W.H.O. had not recommended travel restrictions or border closings.

An earlier version of the contributor box with this article misspelled the Nigerian capital, from which Adam Nossiter reported. It is Abuja, as is rendered correctly in the article's dateline, not Abjuja.

African Leaders Coming to Talk Business May Also Be Pressed on Rights

WASHINGTON — When Barack Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] made his first trip as president to Africa in July 2009, he memorably told lawmakers in Ghana that “Africa doesn’t need strongmen; it needs strong institutions.”[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/world/africa/12prexy.html] Next week, several of those strongmen will travel to Washington as part of a landmark gathering of nearly 50 African leaders.

The question, Africa experts are asking, is what will Mr. Obama tell them? “Are we going to have a strong message for these strongmen?” said Vera Songwe, the World Bank’s country director for Senegal, Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania.

The answer, White House officials said, is a resounding yes: The meeting, the first of its kind on American soil, is designed “to build a deeper relationship based on mutual interest and mutual respect,” Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, said in an interview. “In each of the sessions, there will be some very straight talk and give-and-take.”

Still, given the attendance of iron-fisted leaders from Angola and Equatorial Guinea — to say nothing of American partners with checkered records, like the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda — some advocates worry that human-rights issues will take a back seat to other priorities.

The centerpiece of the four-day meeting will be a high-octane conference to stimulate trade and investment. The leaders will be put together with dozens of deal-hungry American chief executives. Former President Bill Clinton will speak, as will the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, whose foundation is a co-sponsor, along with the Commerce Department.

The White House will push initiatives like Power Africa, a privately-funded plan to bring electricity to 20 million households across sub-Saharan Africa. Companies have pledged $9 billion, and the White House is likely to announce more support at the summit meeting.

Though American officials are loath to admit it — given their sharply different approaches to Africa — the United States is chasing China, which has spent lavishly on the continent, mainly to lock up mineral resources for its booming economy.

With such a heavy emphasis on commerce, however, some activists said the meeting will miss a chance to press African leaders on civil liberties and human-rights abuses, whether it is a crackdown on journalists by Rwanda or antigay legislation passed by Uganda[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/africa/ugandan-president-to-sign-antigay-law.html].

“No African leader is going to say no to an invitation from Obama to come to Washington,” said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/human_rights_watch/index.html?inline=nyt-org], who specializes in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “So in that sense, it’s a real missed opportunity.”

The White House notes that it has made governance one of the three main themes of the meeting, along with trade and investment and peace and security. Human rights and the rule of law, officials said, will be an unavoidable subtext in all the discussions.

“You can speak very plainly and very compellingly about things like corruption and female genital mutilation[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/femalegenitalmutilation/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and mistreatment of women without being finger-wagging or condescending or offensive,” Ms. Rice said, citing comments by Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, earlier this week[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/world/africa/first-lady-praises-leaders-for-progress-of-girls-in-africa.html] to a gathering of young African leaders.

Other Africa experts said the administration was right not to call out its guests too conspicuously. A more subtle and effective message, they said, would be to remind Africans that the best American companies only want to invest in places with a reliable rule of law.

“It would be a huge mistake to lecture on the democracy and human-rights agenda,” said Jennifer G. Cooke, the director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “If it looks like finger-wagging, it’s going to come across very badly.”

Yet human-rights considerations clearly played a role in assembling the guest list. The United States did not invite the leaders of Sudan, Eritrea, the Central African Republic, or Zimbabwe, all of whom are on bad terms with the African Union. Egypt was invited belatedly after its election removed it from the African Union’s blacklist.

Egypt’s new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, declined the invitation and will send his prime minister instead — in part because none of the leaders will get a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Obama. Administration officials said that was simply a matter of logistics; the leaders will have to make do with a handshake and a few words of greeting.

The presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone have canceled plans to attend to deal with an outbreak of the Ebola virus in their countries. That will deprive the meeting of Africa’s most visible female leader, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and may fuel worries that other Africans flying to Washington could carry the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there was no significant risk to the United States from the outbreak.

The Ebola outbreak is only the latest distraction for a White House that has been lurching from crisis to crisis. Some Africa experts said they worried that despite Mr. Obama’s best intentions, the summit would be overshadowed by the violence in Gaza and Ukraine.

Mr. Obama’s aides, however, said he planned to speak at the opening of the summit, take part in the business session, and play host at a dinner for the leaders at the White House. The meeting has been in the works since Mr. Obama’s trip to Africa last summer, which was viewed as a success but raised a perennial criticism of the administration.

“You have these big, high-profile trips to Africa and then the issue falls off the front-burner,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.

It says something about the chaotic state of the world that the Obama administration views Africa as a bright spot for American engagement. But Mr. Rhodes said on the merits, Africa had transformed itself into a genuine opportunity, with fast-growing economies and greater control over issues like health and food security.

“We’re never going to match the dollar amounts China announces,” he said. “But when you add together what we’re doing in development with the private sector, there’s a lot of incentive for the Africans.”

Ebola outbreak galvanizes West Africa; Urgent measures taken as toll rises; emergency is declared in Sierra Leone

West African leaders on Thursday quickened the pace of emergency efforts in response to a mounting tally of fatalities from the worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus, canceling travel plans and authorizing measures to combat the disease, including house-to-house searches and the deployment of the army and the police.

The World Health Organization said the death toll had risen to 729 from 672 after 57 more people died during a four-day period from July 24 to 27 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. In the same period, 122 new cases were detected, bringing the total of confirmed and probably infected patients to 1,323. The toll is the highest in a single outbreak since the virus was identified almost four decades ago.

Federal health officials in the United States on Thursday advised Americans to avoid nonessential travel to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia because of the Ebola virus outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a ‘‘Level 3’’ warning, its most serious type of travel notice, indicating ‘‘high risk’’ to visitors in the affected countries. This kind of advisory is uncommon and reserved for grave situations: It has been used in the past for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and for the earthquake in Haiti.

Desperate to contain the outbreak, Sierra Leone’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, declared a public health emergency, calling for the deployment of security forces to quarantine the epicenters of infection. He also said he would not be making a planned visit to the United States.

His actions followed steps announced in Liberia to close schools, put nonessential government workers on compulsory leave for 30 days and order the deployment of security forces to combat the outbreak. The Peace Corps, an outreach program run by the United States government, said it was withdrawing its 340 volunteers from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three countries most affected by the virus.

‘‘The epidemic is very big, very dispersed,’’ said Dr. Hilde de Clerck, the interim emergency coordinator in Sierra Leone for Doctors Without Borders. ‘‘It seems logical that the country is reacting. I do understand that the central government has to do something. Cases are now being reported in more southern regions. There is a geographical spread. We do see that it is several districts that are hit now.’’

Nigeria recorded its only known death from Ebola when an American working in Liberia died there after landing in Lagos in July. The airport authorities said on Thursday that they had begun checking passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea for high temperatures and would order compulsory blood tests for those with worrisome symptoms. Airport checks are also in force in Sierra Leone, and Ghana announced screening procedures on Thursday.

In an address to the nation in Sierra Leone posted late Wednesday on the presidential website, Mr. Koroma said the emergency would ‘‘enable us take a more robust approach to deal with the Ebola outbreak.’’

Mr. Koroma, who had been planning to attend a United States-Africa summit meeting in Washington, said he would instead travel to Guinea on Friday to discuss a regional response to the outbreak. Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was also reported to have canceled her attendance at the gathering in Washington. Guinea’s president, Alpha Condé, still plans to attend, a spokeswoman at the Guinean Embassy in Washington confirmed on Thursday.

Amara Jambai, the director of prevention and control at the Health Ministry in Sierra Leone, said, ‘‘We need to tell everyone that the epidemic is here, it is happening and it is serious.’’

In his address, Mr. Koroma said that security forces would be deployed to support health professionals and that ‘‘all epicenters of the disease will be quarantined’’ along with ‘‘localities and homes where the disease is identified.’’ The measures would remain in force for 60 to 90 days.

Public meetings will be restricted, houses will be searched for infected people, Parliament will be recalled, and top officials will be obliged to cancel all but essential overseas travel. The measures also promised ‘‘active surveillance’’ to ‘‘trace and quarantine Ebola victims and suspects.’’

‘‘The disease is beyond the scope of any one country or community to defeat,’’ Mr. Koroma said. ‘‘Its social, economic, psychological and security implications require scaling up measures at international, national, interagency and community levels. Extraordinary challenges require extraordinary measures.’’

Others blamed the government for the spread of the disease.

‘‘The whole thing has been very incompetently handled,’’ said Lansana Gberie, a Sierra Leone historian and analyst. ‘‘If the government had quarantined this area’’ where the outbreak started, in the remote northeast, ‘‘they could have contained it.’’

‘‘Instead, they opened a treatment center in Kenema, a major population center,’’ he said. ‘‘They were bringing patients into a major urban center. I think it was a key mistake.’’

With reports of the disease spreading around the world and graphic images of people suffering, there was some concern that the disease could reach much farther afield, including to airports in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

In Britain, Lucy Moreton, the head of the Immigration Service Union, which represents immigration employees, said there were concerns about how to react if they suspected that a traveler had been infected.

‘‘There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility, and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all as to what they should do,’’ she said.

Governments, experts and international bodies sought to tamp down the worries.

Dr. Peter Piot, co-discoverer of the virus and the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said there was little risk.

‘‘Spreading in the population here, I’m not that worried about it,’’ he told Agence France-Presse.

‘‘I wouldn’t be worried to sit next to someone with Ebola virus on the Tube as long as they don’t vomit on you or something,’’ he said, referring to London’s subway system. ‘‘This is an infection that requires very close contact.’’

The French minister of health, Marisol Touraine, offered a similar assessment in an interview with Le Parisien on Thursday. She said that the risk of importing the virus into Europe was low and that no such case had been documented. Yet Ms. Touraine called for extreme vigilance against an ailment she characterized as ‘‘very serious’’ and ‘‘very contagious.’’

In Geneva, the International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world’s major airlines, also played down the hazards outside the affected region in West Africa, saying in a statement on Thursday that the World Health Organization had not recommended travel restrictions or border closures and that the risk for travelers was low.

‘‘In the rare event that a person infected with the Ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air, W.H.O. advises that the risks to other passengers are low,’’ the statement said.

Ebola is spread only by people with severe symptoms that include vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and, finally, internal and external bleeding, the statement said. ‘‘It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,’’ it said.

In Germany, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, which specializes in tropical viruses, said on Tuesday that it had been asked by the government of Sierra Leone to treat its leading doctor after he contracted the disease.

Physicians prepared a special isolation station to receive the patient, who at the time was too weak to travel to Germany, the clinic said. Later that day, the chief medical officer in Sierra Leone was quoted by Reuters as saying the doctor, Sheik Umar Khan, had died of the virus.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Friday:

• Skirmishes amid a cease-fire.

A 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-conflict.html], brokered by the United Nations and the United States, began at 8 a.m. local time, but reports of some fighting quicky followed.

Overnight, 14 Palestinians and five Israeli soldiers were killed.

Israeli and Palestinian delegations are heading to Cairo today to try to negotiate a long-term deal.

• A delayed vacation for House Republicans.

They were headed into their five-week summer recess on Thursday, but Speaker John A. Boehner called his caucus back in today for a meeting on an emergency spending bill to address the surge of young migrants at the southern border.

The measure was scuttled on Thursday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/us/politics/blow-to-house-gop-leadership-as-border-bill-falters-.html] by a core group of conservatives.

• The Senate has already left town.

Even if the House passes an immigration bill, the Senate will be unable to vote on it. Their break has already begun.

Before they left on Thursday night, senators approved[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/us/senate-approves-veterans-health-care-bill.html] an expansion of veterans’ health care and financing for the Highway Trust Fund through next spring. But their emergency border bill fell to a filibuster.

• You may now (legally) unlock your device.

President Obama signs into law today a measure allowing consumers[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/bill-legalizing-unlocking-cellphones-passes-congress/] to open the digital locks on their cellphones so that they can more easily switch wireless carriers.

• Uganda’s antigay law in question.

A court there is expected to rule today[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/01/world/africa/ap-af-uganda-gays.html] on whether the legislation that allows for imprisoning gays is invalid because it was passed during a parliamentary session that lacked quorum.

• Reinforcements against Ebola.

West African leaders are meeting in Guinea today to discuss further efforts to fight the spreading Ebola epidemic. They’ll also announce a $100 million response initiative.

An infected American aid worker will be treated[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/08/01/world/africa/01reuters-health-ebola-usa.html] in a high-security ward at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, hospital officials said on Thursday.

• A long, long line.

Colorado today becomes the third state to allow undocumented immigrants and those with temporary legal status to get drivers’ licenses[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/colorado-to-begin-licenses-for-immigrants/2014/07/31/48504f6c-18f3-11e4-88f7-96ed767bb747_story.html] and ID cards.

About 9,500 people have already signed up for appointments at five processing sites.

• Compensation for drivers.

General Motors will begin accepting claims today from those who have been victims of accidents caused by defective ignition switches in the company’s cars.

The company has set aside $400 million to pay the victims.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are trending lower after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 317 points on Thursday, wiping out its gain for the year. European shares are down, and Asian markets dipped.

• Economists expect the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 6.1 percent as the Labor Department announces today the hiring and jobs data for July.

• The judge overseeing negotiations between Argentina and its debtholders has called a meeting this morning for updates on any progress between the two parties.

• Chevron and Procter & Gamble are among the companies that will report their quarterly earnings today.

NOTEWORTHY

• Where to stay in Paris when price is no object.

Two old choices are made new again: The refurbished, 101-year-old Plaza Athénée[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/travel/a-delicately-managed-face-lift-for-a-paris-beauty.html] reopens, with elegant suites from $1,190 to $10,000 a night.

And then there’s the former Hotel Majestic, a historic palace with a fresh life as the Peninsula Paris[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hotel-majestic-the-renaissance-of-the-mythical-paris-landmark-where-proust-met-joyce-and-history-was-made-9629834.html], priced around $920 to $4,650 (with even more luxurious suites to come).

• An interstellar western.

“Guardians of the Galaxy,” the fantasy-action movie based on the Marvel comic book series, opens today. Our critic Manohla Dargis[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/movies/chris-pratt-stars-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy.html] writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/movies/chris-pratt-stars-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy.html], “A pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats.”

• Capturing the spirit of the King of Soul.

In “Get On Up,” also opening today, James Brown is “portrayed indelibly by Chadwick Boseman in the viscerally explosive biopic,” writes our critic Stephen Holden[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/movies/get-on-up-stars-chadwick-boseman-as-james-brown.html].

The film “thrillingly captures the frenzy of Brown’s music, and the forces driving that frenzy, both musical and personal,” Mr. Holden writes. “Like its gyrating, spasmodic staccato beats, ‘Get On Up’ refuses to stand still.”

• Country music’s hometown.

The Birthplace of Country Music Museum[http://www.birthplaceofcountrymusic.org/], which is affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, opens today in the Tennessee town that purports to be just that: It’s where, in 1927, country music as we know it was conceived.

The town, Bristol, was where a producer looking for talent discovered Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, recording them for the first time[http://www.amazon.com/The-Bristol-Sessions-Recordings-Tennessee/dp/B000000QIP].

• Going for the king and the gold.

Teams from more than 100 countries will be represented at the Chess Olympiad, a biennial tournament that begins today in Tromso, Norway.

Competitors in what organizers call the “world’s fourth-largest sporting event” are tested for performance-enhancing drugs, just like Olympic athletes, per strict antidoping rules imposed by the World Chess Federation.

BACK STORY

On this day in 1834, the Slavery Abolition Act was enacted across the British Empire.

Throughout the Caribbean, on the islands once part of the British Empire, today will be hailed as a moment to celebrate freedom.

For most, it didn’t come immediately. Many slaves merely became “apprentices,” and it took years for their status to change.

But the act set in motion the process that ended hundreds of years of slavery in the islands. (And it preceded slavery’s abolition in the United States by three decades.)

The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago was first to initiate a national holiday, and Jamaica, St. Lucia, Guyana (though not an island), St. Vincent and the Grenadines followed suit. They all celebrate on Aug. 1 this year.

A number of others celebrate the holiday on the first Monday in August.

Barbados makes a whole season of it from April through August, commemorating not just the abolition act but also the uprisings and unrest that precipitated it.

Joseph Burgess and Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.

W.H.O. Says Outbreak of Ebola Virus is Outpacing Control Efforts

ABUJA, Nigeria — In an ominous warning as fatalities mounted in West Africa from the worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus, the head of the World Health Organization said on Friday that the disease was moving faster than efforts to curb it, with potentially catastrophic consequences including a “high risk” that it will spread.

The assessment was among the most dire since the outbreak was identified in March. The outbreak has been blamed for the deaths of 729 people, according to W.H.O. figures, and left over 1,300 people with confirmed or suspected infections.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the W.H.O. director general, was speaking as she met with the leaders of the three most affected countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — in Conakry, the Guinean capital, for the introduction of a $100 million plan to deploy hundreds more medical professionals in support of overstretched regional and international health workers.

“This meeting must mark a turning point in the outbreak response,” Dr. Chan said, according to a W.H.O. transcript[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/dg/speeches/2014/ebola/en/] of her remarks. “This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.”

She called the outbreak “by far the largest ever in the nearly four-decade history of this disease” and said it was “caused by the most lethal strain in the family of Ebola viruses.”

“It is taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks. Cases are occurring in rural areas which are difficult to access, but also in densely populated capital cities,” she said.

She added that “the outbreak is affecting a large number of doctors, nurses and other health care workers, one of the most essential resources for containing an outbreak.”

“Constant mutation and adaptation are the survival mechanisms of viruses and other microbes. We must not give this virus opportunities to deliver more surprises,” she said, adding that “deep-seated beliefs and cultural practices are a significant cause of further spread and a significant barrier to rapid and effective containment.”

The gathering in Conakry came a day after West African leaders seemed to quicken the pace of efforts to combat the disease,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html] in what some analysts depicted as a belated acknowledgment that the response so far had been inadequate.

Indeed, before the meeting started, there were indications of discord. The leader of Guinea’s Ebola task force said that emergency measures in Liberia, where schools have been closed, and Sierra Leone could set back efforts to control the worst outbreak of the virus since it was identified almost four decades ago.

“Currently, some measures taken by our neighbors could make the fight against Ebola even harder,” Aboubacar Sidiki Diakité, the Ebola task force leader, told Reuters.

“When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse. It is part of what we will be talking about.”

Sierra Leone’s emergency measures include house-to-house searches for infected people and the deployment of the army and the police.

One person, traveling from Liberia, died in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, which introduced airport screening of travelers from the stricken region on Thursday.

“The scale of the Ebola outbreak, and the persistent threat it poses, requires W.H.O. and Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to take the response to a new level, and this will require increased resources, in-country medical expertise, regional preparedness and coordination,” Dr. Chan said in an earlier statement on Thursday.

According to the W.H.O., the $100 million plan “identifies the need for several hundred more personnel to be deployed in affected countries to supplement overstretched treatment facilities.”

Hundreds of international aid workers and W.H.O. specialists “are already supporting national and regional response efforts,” the statement said. “But more are urgently required. Of greatest need are clinical doctors and nurses, epidemiologists, social mobilization experts, logisticians and data managers.”

“The plan also outlines the need to increase preparedness systems in neighboring nations and strengthen global capacities,” the statement said. The new strategy is intended to stop the transmission of the Ebola virus within the most affected countries and prevent the spread of the virus to neighboring countries across the region’s largely porous borders.

Part of the plan would involve improved communication “so that people know how to avoid infection and what to do if they fear they may have come into contact with the virus,” the statement added. “Improving prevention, detecting and reporting suspected cases, referring people infected with the disease for medical care, as well as psychosocial support, are key.”

As the alarms about the outbreak grew, so, too, have concerns that the disease will be carried further afield by travelers from the stricken countries. The African Union, for instance, announced on Friday that it was postponing a routine rotation of its peacekeeping force in Somalia for fear that new soldiers arriving from Sierra Leone could be infected.

The outbreak has raised concerns far beyond Africa, despite official efforts to tamp down such fears.

The Philippines said Friday that it was introducing health travelers from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, who would be screened when they arrived and monitored for a month. Lebanon was reported to have suspended work permits for residents of the same three countries, news reports said. Dubai’s Emirates airline said it was suspending flights to Conakry as of Saturday.

At the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Moses Sesay[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/commonwealth-games-athletes-ebola-quarantine-3945603], a cyclist from Sierra Leone, told the British tabloid The Daily Mirror that he had been quarantined for four days and tested for Ebola after feeling ill. He has since been pronounced healthy.

“I was sick. I felt tired and listless,” he said. “All the doctors were in special suits to treat me — they dressed like I had Ebola. I was very scared.”

Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for the games, told reporters on Friday: “Just to be really clear, there is no Ebola in the athletes’ village, there is no Ebola virus in Scotland.”

Ms. Brock-Doyle said there had been no confirmation of newspaper reports that a second athlete from Sierra Leone, the mountain biker Mohamed Tholley[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/11005108/Sierra-Leones-mountain-biking-champion-vanished-from-Commonwealth-Games-after-teammate-tested-for-Ebola.html], had gone missing in Scotland.

Only weeks after the beginning of the outbreak, the Italian authorities tightened health checks at airports and on ships from West Africa. But epidemiologists in Italy suggested there was little risk that the hundreds of unauthorized migrants that reach southern Italy every day, often after long boat journeys from North Africa, were carrying the virus.

“Migrants cross the desert in journeys that take weeks, if not months, before getting on a boat to Europe. They would manifest the disease long before arriving,” Dr. Massimo Galli, a specialist in infectious diseases at University Hospital in Milan, said in a telephone interview. “The incubation time is about a week. No one would survive the trip on land.”

“The only way in which a sick patient could spread the virus is if he or she gets on a plane to Europe,” he said. “With such an emergency level, it’s extremely unlikely.”

The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Thursday that the United States was considering a medical evacuation to bring home American aid workers diagnosed with Ebola. Two health workers who were infected in Liberia were in grave condition, according to a statement on the website of the organization Samaritan’s Purse.

Adam Nossiter reported from Abuja and Alan Cowell from London. Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome.

If Ebola and climate change and the threat of wars aren’t making you paranoid enough, the National Geographic Channel stands ready to help. Its ridiculously overheated “Urban Jungle,”[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/urban-jungle/] a special in three parts (all on Sunday night), is eager to convince you that animals are massing against us, preparing to retake the planet. Yes, similar to that sci-fi movie with the apes.

The program serves up disconnected vignettes suggesting that our cities, suburbs and more remote outposts are overrun with elephants, snakes, mites, sloths, raccoons, bats.

A tracker named Boone Smith[http://www.boonesmithwildlifecapture.com/] drops in on some of these places and uses night-vision gear to show the movements of these supposed invaders: coyotes in Chicago, bears in Lake Tahoe, leopards in Mumbai. These vignettes are supplemented with amateur footage — a man being trampled by a moose, wild dogs surrounding a pedestrian — that is intended to terrify but receives little elaboration.

Then there’s the narration, delivered in urgent, ominous tones. It’s big on statistics, without context or citation. Here’s a sampler:

“No one really knows how many rats live in New York. Some say eight million — one for every human. But there could be even more.”

“Some backyards can see up to 50 raccoons a night.”

“There are more creatures living in a single human house than there are people on earth.”

“A 10th of the weight of an average pillow isn’t pillow, but bug.”

There are worthwhile lessons in all this about thoughtless development and about human habits, whether garbage disposal or golf course building, that invite animals. As the narration puts it, “When we create a world better than the wilderness, the wild is sure to move in, whether we like it or not.”

But education isn’t the point here. The point is to make the world seem scarier than it really is.

Health
Ebola Vaccine Possible, But Many Doubts Persist

Even as federal health officials announced plans to speed development of an Ebola vaccine, scientists who study the virus warned that the task would be arduous and that success is hardly guaranteed.

The Ebola virus is “a survivor,” said John Dye, chief of the viral immunology branch at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases[http://www.usamriid.army.mil/]. “It does what it can to avoid the human immune system.”

The government plans to fast-track development of a vaccine shown to protect macaque monkeys, aiming to test it in humans as early as next month.

If the vaccine proves effective, it may be given to health care workers and others at high risk for infection sometime in 2015, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases[http://www.niaid.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/Pages/default.aspx].

But the development effort depends on several contingencies: fast regulatory approval of the trial, the first of its type in healthy humans; results proving the vaccine is safe and provokes an immune response; and, perhaps most critically, attracting the interest and investment dollars of the pharmaceutical industry.

Assuming the necessary Food and Drug Administration approvals are obtained, Dr. Fauci said, about 20 volunteers will receive the experimental vaccine beginning in mid-September.

“You’ve got to be really careful,” he said. “This is the first time this will be put in a human.”

Some scientists have called the fast-track approach aggressive and optimistic, warning that human trials inevitably encounter stumbling blocks, including adverse reactions, and that it often takes many recalibrations to figure out the optimal dosages.

Researchers have been studying the Ebola virus for decades, and vaccine efforts have begun to bear fruit with the development of several new strategies for priming the immune system to recognize and attack the virus after exposure.

But Ebola is strangely elusive, raging through populations like wildfire before disappearing. Unlike viruses that attack only the respiratory system or only the gastrointestinal system, Ebola attacks almost every cell in the human body.

But it does not persist long-term in the bodies of the infected, as does H.I.V.

Since it was first identified[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&modref=HPGraphicRefer&module=second-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] nearly 40 years ago, Ebola has infected fewer than 5,000 and killed fewer than 3,000 in Africa, home to 1.1 billion people. By contrast, more than 35 million people worldwide are infected with H.I.V., and close to 39 million have died of its complications.

Development of an Ebola vaccine should not be as challenging as developing an H.I.V. vaccine, scientists say. Yet the unpredictable and sporadic nature of this infection has made an Ebola vaccine an unattractive goal for drug makers.

“It’s not really a good target for a pharmaceutical company,” said Kartik Chandran[http://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/10768/kartik-chandran/], an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York who researches Ebola. “It’s not clear you could even earn back your investment.”

Even if an effective vaccine were developed, it is unclear who should receive it.

“Ebola is like lightning strikes,” Dr. Dye said. “How would you predict what area, what village, what country to vaccinate? Is it realistic to think we could vaccinate the whole continent of Africa?”

The vaccine to be tested in humans relies on a benign virus that carries a two proteins from the surface of the Ebola virus. The proteins help the virus penetrate human cells.

If successful, the immune system will be trained to recognize the proteins and to mount a strong response should it encounter the virus.

“The immune system says, ‘Hey, we’ve seen this before.’ The plans have been leaked,” Dr. Chandran said.

The initial human trial is intended to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and to see whether it induces an immune response similar to the one produced in the monkeys.

The immunized animals were deliberately exposed to the Ebola virus and survived. But human volunteers will not be exposed to the virus under any circumstances, Dr. Fauci said.

That means the protective value of the vaccine in the real world may not be known for many years, several scientists noted.

“The monkey models that we use are the closest approximation to a human. However, we are different from monkeys, so we don’t know exactly how it would work,” Dr. Dye said.

There are other unanswered questions, he noted. What doses should be used? How long would the protection last? Would people need booster shots?

Given the sporadic nature of Ebola outbreaks, some experts believe a vaccine is not the answer. Instead, they say, it would be more pragmatic to focus on drugs that can be administered soon after people are exposed.

One such therapy relies on antibodies drawn from monkeys that survived infections with the Ebola[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/] and Marburg[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/marburg/] viruses in the laboratory. In subsequent trials, other monkeys were treated with the antibodies two days after exposure to the viruses and survived.

Cocktails of antibodies from mice injected with an Ebola protein have also protected monkeys.

Efforts to develop vaccines and treatments to counter the Ebola virus have been underway for more than a decade, but recent international alarm[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/africa/african-leaders-and-who-intensify-effort-to-combat-ebola-virus.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSumSmallMediaHigh&module=second-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] has infused new urgency into the research.

“The threat that this will go from one country to another has galvanized attention and a realization that these bizarre exotic diseases are real,” Dr. Fauci said. “This is a public health imperative.”

Congress: The Road to Roads

Well, all I can say is thank God we’ve got that Highway Trust Fund fixed.

Congress raced for its August break in a mad scramble, with many complaints about voting on legislation nobody had ever seen (“What bill are we talking about?”) and plaintive cries of: “We can do better than this!”

There is actually no evidence whatsoever that the current Congress can do better than this. But good news! The House and Senate made a last-minute agreement to keep the nation’s road-building programs going for a few more months by putting some cash into the exhausted Highway Trust Fund.

The money will mainly come from “pension smoothing.” Perhaps you have never heard of pension smoothing. It involves allowing businesses to put less than the required amount into their pension funds, thus creating more profits for the companies, which leads to more tax revenue for the government. Until later, when the whole thing turns into geysers of red ink.

I think I speak for us all when I respond: “Say what?”

“It’s traditional that if you’re trying to fund something and you don’t have the funds, you screw around with pensions,” sighed Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. The current session seems to have nearly exhausted Ornstein’s capacity for shock and awe, but he did call the Highway Trust Fund gambit “outrageous.”

House Republicans rejected an attempt by the Senate to drop the pension smoothing. I would not be wowed by the Democrats’ high sense of fiscal integrity on this point, since they did try to use the very same maneuver earlier this year, in an unsuccessful attempt to extend unemployment benefits. On the other hand, the Democrats are not the party that spends all of its time yelling about unfunded entitlements.

In a perfect world, Congress would figure out a serious, long-term plan to fix bridges, improve roads and update airports. We now make about half as much effort as Europe does on these matters. You may be tired of hearing people ask why we can’t have day care like Sweden. But it does not seem too much to demand a Spanish level of commitment to infrastructure repair.

The best way to get the things back on track would be by raising the gas tax. Such a plan was proposed in the Senate by Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee. This fine, bipartisan effort went nowhere whatsoever.

(Simultaneously going nowhere: 26 State Department nominations, which Senate Republicans are holding up because they are irked about something Harry Reid did last year. One would be ambassador to Sierra Leone, one of the places the Ebola virus is breaking out.)

But thanks to Congress, the Highway Trust Fund lives! For a minute. And in another burst of action, the Senate and House approved a $17 billion bill for veterans’ health care. Without, once again, actually financing it.

“Who doesn’t love veterans?” said Bob Corker, who was one of only three no votes in the Senate. “But I think anything that’s important enough to have is important enough to pay for.”

Boy, this has been quite a week for Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. “I’ve been here seven and a half years,” he said in a phone interview. “We have not solved one single problem since I’ve been here. It’s just so frustrating.”

Speaking of not solving problems, there was the border. President Obama, as you know, asked Congress for $3.7 billion to take care of the crisis created when tens of thousands of children from Central America’s most violence-ridden countries began crossing over and asking permission to stay.

So the Senate:

A. Took up a bill to give the president $2.7 billion for the border. The White House seemed pretty satisfied, since half a loaf is now regarded as the height of near-unattainable bipartisan statesmanship. The bill also included $615 million to fight wildfires and $225 million for Israeli defense systems.

B. Killed the bill on a 50-to-44 vote when Republicans demand changes in the law that guarantees those children immigration court hearings. We will try not to dwell on the fact that the law in question was passed during the Bush administration to combat child sex trafficking.

C. Failed to approve the nomination of an ambassador to Guatemala, one of the countries at the center of the current crisis. Because, you know, Harry Reid.

D. Rallied at the last minute and passed the part about Israeli defense systems.

And what, you may be asking, about the House? At its highest moment of functionality, the House was considering a $659 million border bill that turned the Senate’s half a loaf into a crouton.

From there things slid downhill. During a deeply depressing and meaningless debate about deporting children, Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York, complained that all the House had done in its last week was vote to “sue the president and deregulate pesticides.”

Not true. Highway Fund. Highway Fund. Highway Fund.

American Doctor With Ebola Arrives in U.S. for Treatment

ATLANTA — The first of two American aid workers infected with Ebola while working in West Africa arrived in the United States on Saturday aboard a private air ambulance specially equipped to isolate patients with infectious diseases and was quickly admitted to a hospital here.

The jet carrying Dr. Kent Brantly, who is believed to be the first patient with the virus ever to be treated at a hospital in the United States, landed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base around 11 a.m.

With news helicopters flying overhead, a police-escorted ambulance carrying Dr. Brantly arrived less than 90 minutes later at Emory University Hospital, which has a containment unit for patients with dangerous infectious diseases. The unit was built more than a decade ago with consultation from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has its headquarters nearby.

Not long after the ambulance pulled into a service entrance at Emory, it left the hospital, its driver wearing a white hazardous materials suit. Security was tight at the hospital: Ahead of Dr. Brantly’s admission, law enforcement officers were posted around the building, and a police canine unit performed an inspection.

Although Emory, citing health privacy laws, declined to identify the patient, the Christian aid organization Samaritan’s Purse said it was Dr. Brantly. He and the other infected American aid worker, Nancy Writebol, were working at a hospital in Liberia that was treating patients suffering from Ebola.

Samaritan’s Purse said Ms. Writebol would return to the United States ”within the next few days” for treatment at Emory.

At a news conference on Friday, Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, an infectious disease specialist at Emory who will be involved in their care, said, “The reason we are bringing these patients back to our facility is because we feel they deserve to have the highest level of care offered for their treatment.”

Both patients will receive what Dr. Ribner described as “supportive care” focused on maintaining their vital functions, like blood pressure and breathing.

“We depend on the body’s defenses to control the virus,” he said. “We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection.”

Dr. Ribner said Emory would have a robust roster of medical workers handling the care of Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol, including four infectious disease doctors, a rotating cast of nurses and, as needed, subspecialists.

Dr. Alexander P. Isakov, the executive director of Emory’s Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response, said in an interview that the staff in the containment unit had volunteered to work there, and that some who were supposed to be on vacation had offered to cancel their plans to take care of the new patients.

Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol will be housed in a unit that is small and positioned well away from other patients at the sprawling hospital. They will probably have limited contact with visitors, Dr. Ribner said, communicating with nonmedical personnel through telephones and an intercom system. A sheet of glass will separate the ill from the healthy.

Dr. Isakov said the unit had been used only three to five times since it was built, in each case for patients suspected of having serious diseases like SARS, but who turned out not to have those illnesses. This is the first time the unit will house patients who are truly infected with a dangerous disease.

Dr. Ribner said, “We have far more training exercises than we do activations because of patients with these pathogens.”

Although the State Department said it had been involved in facilitating the evacuations from Liberia, Emory said that Samaritan’s Purse was paying for the transportation and care of the workers. Dr. Ribner said that Emory officials had communicated with state and county regulators about the patients, but that the air ambulance service, the Phoenix Air Group, had been responsible for securing the necessary clearances to bring the two to the United States.

Dr. Ribner was among those who dismissed rising fears, often appearing online, that the arrivals of the two patients would spread the infection here.

“From the time the air ambulance arrives in the metropolitan Atlanta area, up to and including being hospitalized at Emory University Hospital,” he said, “we have taken every precaution that we know and that our colleagues at the C.D.C. know to ensure that there is no spread of this virus pathogen.”

The director of the disease centers, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, agreed that the patients posed little risk to others. And he added: “These are American citizens. American citizens have a right of return. I certainly hope people’s fear doesn’t trump their compassion.”

Although social media sites have been replete with misgivings about Emory’s plan, many people near the hospital said it did not bother them, partly because the disease centers and their high-security laboratories have long been part of the Atlanta landscape.

“We’ve already got smallpox and all that other crap at the C.D.C.,” Joey Voll, who works at a bookstore near the hospital, said with a shrug soon after Dr. Ribner’s news conference on Friday.

Nearby, Sukru Aydin, who runs a computer repair shop, said he trusted Emory and wondered if fears of the virus spreading in the United States were overblown.

“To me, it’s nothing different than AIDS or some disease that this country has,” he said.

And Elaine Peek, a psychology student at Georgia State University who once interned at the disease centers, said she was confident health officials would be careful.

“The C.D.C. is about a mile from here,” she said at the pottery studio where she works, “and I feel like they also have labs with stuff, so I’m not really worried about it.”

She added, “This is a really serious issue, and they know it’s contagious, so they’re going to take every precaution necessary.”

American with Ebola back in U.S.; Doctor who was infected treating African victims is ‘improving,’ official says

The first of two American aid workers infected with Ebola while working in West Africa arrived in the United States over the weekend aboard a private air ambulance equipped to isolate patients with infectious diseases, and was quickly admitted to a hospital here.

The jet carrying Dr. Kent Brantly, who is believed to be the first patient with the deadly virus to be treated at a hospital in the United States, landed at Dobbins Air Reserve Base around 11 a.m. on Saturday.

With news helicopters flying overhead, a police-escorted ambulance carrying Dr. Brantly arrived about 90 minutes later at Emory University Hospital, which has a containment unit for patients with dangerous infectious diseases. The unit was built more than a decade ago with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has its headquarters nearby.

Not long after the ambulance pulled into a service entrance at Emory, television video recorded from helicopters showed Dr. Brantly, dressed in protective gear, walking inside with assistance. The ambulance left the hospital, its driver wearing a white hazardous materials suit.

On Sunday, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Dr. Brantly ‘‘appears to be improving, and that’s encouraging.’’

Dr. Frieden, speaking on ‘‘Fox News Sunday,’’ also said that the Ebola outbreak might ‘‘get worse before it gets better,’’ adding that ‘‘we will stop the outbreak in Africa, but it’s not going to be quick, it’s not going to be easy, and it’s quite possible we’ll see it get worse before it gets better. But we can turn it around. We know how to stop Ebola.’’

In another interview on Sunday, on the CBS program ‘‘Face the Nation,’’ Dr. Frieden conceded that it was possible that a traveler could bring Ebola into the United States. But he said there were two reasons that would be unlikely to lead to a widespread outbreak.

The problems in Africa, he said, arose first in hospitals with inadequate infection control, and second, ‘‘in burial practices where people are touching the bodies of people who have died from Ebola. So it’s not going to spread widely in the U.S.’’

He said the White House should ‘‘absolutely not’’ cancel the summit meeting bringing the leaders of nearly every African country to Washington this week. The leaders of at least two of the hardest-hit countries, Sierra Leone and Liberia, have canceled their trips to deal with the crisis at home.

‘‘We’re not going to hermetically seal this country,’’ Dr. Frieden said. ‘‘What we can do is put in place sensible screening procedures.’’

Dr. Brantly and the other infected American aid worker, Nancy Writebol, were working at a hospital in Liberia that was treating patients suffering from Ebola.

The Christian Aid organization Samaritan’s Purse said Ms. Writebol would return to the United States ‘‘within the next few days’’ and be taken to Emory. Emory said Samaritan’s Purse was paying for the transportation and care of Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol.

At a news conference on Friday, Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, an infectious disease specialist at Emory who will be involved in their care, said, ‘‘The reason we are bringing these patients back to our facility is because we feel they deserve to have the highest level of care offered for their treatment.’’

Both patients will receive what Dr. Ribner described as ‘‘supportive care’’ focused on maintaining their vital functions, like blood pressure and breathing. ‘‘We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection,’’ he said.

Dr. Alexander P. Isakov, the executive director of the Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response at Emory, said in an interview that staff members in the containment unit had volunteered to work there.

Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol will be housed in a unit that is small and positioned well away from other patients at the hospital. They will probably have limited contact with visitors, Dr. Ribner said, communicating with nonmedical personnel through telephones and an intercom system. A sheet of glass will separate the ill from the healthy.

Dr. Isakov said the unit had been used only three to five times since it was built; all of the patients were suspected of having serious diseases like SARS, but turned out not to be infected. This is the first time the unit will house patients who truly have a dangerous disease.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Monday:

• Partial cease-fire is underway in Gaza.

A seven-hour pause in fighting began at 10 a.m.[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28635031] local time to allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, though many seemed hesitant to do so.

The cease-fire does not apply to the southern town of Rafah, where a U.N. school was hit Sunday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-conflict.html], killing 10 people and wounding 35 others.

In language that was rare in its directness, the U.S. said it was “appalled”[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/03/us/politics/ap-us-united-state-israel.html] by Israel’s “disgraceful” attack. The State Department statement noted that the school had been designated a protected location.

• Happy birthday, Mr. President.

Mr. Obama, who turns 53 today, will spend his birthday preparing for the inaugural U.S.-Africa leaders summit,[http://www.whitehouse.gov/us-africa-leaders-summit] which starts today in Washington.

Secretary of State John Kerry, Treasury Secretary John J. Lew and Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, will also address the trade and investment summit before it ends on Wednesday.

• Ukraine grows more tense.

Russia started military exercises[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/04/world/europe/ap-eu-ukraine.html] involving bombers and fighter jets today, in a show of strength near the border with Ukraine.

Fighting has intensified, and Ukraine’s forces are closing in on two of the main rebel-held cities in eastern Ukraine.

• Earthquake recovery in China.

More rain and thunderstorms are expected today as officials in southwest China look for survivors of a 6.5-magnitude earthquake[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/asia/deadly-earthquake-in-southwest-china.html] on Sunday that left about 400 dead and injured more than 1,800[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/03/world/asia/ap-as-china-earthquake.html].

• Syria’s spillover.

Thousands of Lebanese civilians and Syrian refugees are fleeing [http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/04/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html]an eastern Lebanon border town that was overrun by militants in Syria.

• A second ebola victim coming to the U.S.

Tonight, an American nurse who treated ebola victims will be the second American flown[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/03/us/ap-ap-us-ebola-americans.html] in a specially outfitted plane from Liberia to be treated for the deadly virus.

She will be treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the doctor on her team was transferred on Saturday. His condition seems improved[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/03/us/politics/ap-us-ebola-americans-frieden.html].

• A civil rights inquiry.

The Rev. Al Sharpton plans to travel to Washington today to urge the Justice Department to start an investigation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/nyregion/after-recording-eric-garner-chokehold-ramsey-orta-gets-charged-with-gun-possession.html] after the arrest on Saturday of a witness in the chokehold death of a New York man by police officers last month.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are rising. European shares are uneven, and Asian markets ended widely mixed.

• Banco Espírito Santo, the Portuguese bank, will be shut down[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/business/international/banco-espirito-santo-of-portugal-appears-headed-for-a-bailout.html] and its healthy businesses turned into a new bank as part of a €4.9 billion rescue plan, European officials said today.

• A trial begins in Manhattan today to determine how much Samuel Wyly, the founder of Michaels stores, will have to pay[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/29/us-sec-wyly-idUSKBN0FY2CZ20140729] the Securities and Exchange Commission after he was found guilty of fraud in May.

OVER THE WEEKEND

• Britain temporarily evacuated[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/royal-navy-libya-rescue-uk-nationals-tripoli] its embassy in Tripoli, Libya, this weekend after fighting between militias for control of the city’s airport left 22 dead on Saturday.

• “Guardians of the Galaxy” brought in $94 million[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/guardians-of-the-galaxy-leads-weekend-box-office/] in theaters this weekend, making it the top film at the weekend box office and the third-largest film opening of the calendar year.

• The German magazine Der Spiegelreported Sunday[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/israel-intelligence-eavesdropped-on-phone-calls-by-john-kerry-a-984246.html] that Israel was listening in on Secretary of State John Kerry’s unsecured phone calls last year when he was negotiating for peace in the Middle East.

• Michael Strahan, Derrick Brooks and Andre Reed were among the inductees[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000373543/article/top-moments-during-the-hall-of-fame-enshrinement] to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.

NOTEWORTHY

• A century after the fight began.

The British declared war against Germany 100 years ago today, thereby entering World War I, and the royal family will attend a variety of commemorating events.

Prince William, his wife, Catherine, and Prince Harry head to Belgium for commemorations.[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/first-world-war-centenary-mondays-events] It was the Germans’ “unsatisfactory reply” to the British request that Belgium remain neutral that prompted Britain to enter the war.

• Star lawyer takes on tenure.

David Boies, the acclaimed trial lawyer who helped lead the legal charge that overturned California’s same-sex marriage ban, is becoming chairman of a group challenging teacher tenure[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/celebrated-trial-lawyer-david-boies-to-head-group-challenging-teacher-tenure.html] in courts.

The Partnership for Educational Justice organizes parents and students to bring lawsuits against states with strong tenure and seniority protections.

• Remembering the resignation of a president.

Richard Nixon became the only U.S. president to resign 40 years ago this Saturday. HBO looks back at the event tonight with “Nixon by Nixon: In His Own Words” (9 p.m. Eastern).

Mike Hale, one of our television critics, calls it [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/arts/television/nixon-by-nixon-in-his-own-words-on-hbo.html] “a strange little documentary” but says it’s “engrossing in spite of itself.”

BACK STORY

Eighty years ago this week, Adolf Hitler became the absolute ruler of Germany.

On Aug. 2, 1934, President Paul von Hindenburg died at age 86. Hitler, already the head of Germany’s government and hungry for more power, seized the moment.

A willing cabinet eliminated the presidency and named Hitler as Führer und Reichskanzler, meaning “leader and chancellor of the empire.”

The position brought with it full control of the nation’s military, state and legislative powers. In a vote held three weeks later, nearly 90 percent of Germany’s population endorsed the move.

“No other ruler has so widespread powers nor so obedient and compliant subjects,” our correspondent Frederick T. Birchall wrote[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/mobile/nytnow/aug-19-1934hitler.pdf] at the time, calling Hitler’s unchecked supremacy “unequaled in history since the days of Genghis Khan.”

His rule ended with his suicide in 1945 as World War II wound down.

The noun Führer is no longer used for political leaders in Germany.

Victoria Shannon, Stacy Cowley and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.

Agency Issues Ebola Warnings The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/quarantine/air/managing-sick-travelers/ebola-guidance-airlines.html] to airlines in response to the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 800 people in western Africa. People exposed to the disease are asked not to travel for 21 days, and the C.D.C. suggests that airlines consider using their legal authority to deny boarding to sick passengers suspected of carrying the virus. The C.D.C. has also advised Americans to avoid nonessential travel[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html?_r=0] to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three countries most affected by the outbreak.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Ebola cases prompt out two distinct reactions.

The repatriation of two Americans infected in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa has prompted an angry[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-keep-ebola-victims-out-us-1459564] response.

“All kinds of people are saying on the Internet, who let this happen?” says Denise Grady, a Times science reporter who is following the fears that the lethal disease could spread to the United States.

But there’s another kind of reaction, too.

At the isolation unit at Emory University in Atlanta that is treating one of the victims, and will receive the second on Tuesday, staff members have volunteered to cancel or curtail vacations.

“There’s a sense of mission and a desire to take care of people,” Ms. Grady says. “A sense of duty and doing their jobs.”

“You see hospital people do this all the time,” she says. “Like the Gabrielle Giffords shooting[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html] — the emergency room people just poured back into the hospital.”

• She’s in control.

“Beyoncé is very good at giving you a peek into something without showing you anything,” says Jon Caramanica, our pop music critic.

That’s exactly what she did, he says, with a single line in a remix of “Flawless”[http://flawless.beyonce.com/] that dropped early Sunday morning addressing tabloid headlines that have dogged her since May.

That’s when her husband, Jay Z, scuffled with her sister, Solange, on a hotel elevator, which led to speculation about family unhappiness.

The line: “Of course sometimes stuff go down when it’s a billion dollars on an elevator.” (Uh, O.K., she didn’t say “stuff.”)

“The line is not that revealing,” Mr. Caramanica says, but still, it made a splash.

Beyoncé is known for tightly controlling her image, he says, but it seems she felt compelled to step outside her comfort zone and address the incident, however opaquely.

“It’s not common for her to put her business in the streets.”

• Explaining the Great War.

It is a simple matter to dig up press archives to commemorate the “war to end all wars”[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/27/world/legacy-of-world-war-i.html] 100 years on.

But it is not so easy for the young people of Europe to grasp what that war was all about.

So says Stephen Castle, our correspondent in London, who has been observing the public recollection of World War I going on across Britain and the Continent.

World War II, he says, is more easily explained, with readily identified villains and victors — and even some survivors.

To today’s youth, its predecessor “is distant history,” he says.

“My 16-year-old daughter says they study World War II much more than the first in secondary school,” he says.

“The main reflection on the First World War today seems to be how you can accidentally trigger a global conflict with a series of events that weren’t foreseen,” Mr. Castle says.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed up. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.7 percent.

TONIGHT

• Wannabe heroes.

The second season of “The Awesomes,” an animated series about a group of crime-fighting, replacement superheroes, adds the voices of Amy Poehler, Will Forte, Maya Rudolph and Kate McKinnon (streaming, hulu.com[http://www.hulu.com/the-awesomes]).

• Back in the game.

The makers of “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” have culled contestants from a multitude of seasons, selecting the most memorable to come back for “Bachelor in Paradise[http://abc.go.com/shows/bachelor-in-paradise]” (8 p.m. Eastern, ABC).

The show is billed as an opportunity for contestants (25, in all) who left “with broken hearts” last time around to “get a second chance to find their soul mates.”

• A mismatch.

A wealthy lawyer (Kelsey Grammer) is forced to pair up with one who works from his home (Martin Lawrence) in “Partners[http://www.fxnetworks.com/partners/],” a new comedy that, if it meets a specific ratings target in its first 10 episodes, will get an order of 90 more.

If our critic Neil Genzlinger[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/arts/television/martin-lawrence-and-kelsey-grammer-team-up-in-partners.html] had to decide now, 10 episodes would probably be more than enough (9 and 9:30 p.m. Eastern, FX).

• Special summer food fight.

Ice cream connoisseurs compete to create the best taste and look on “King of Cones[http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/summer-series-king-of-cones-0225004.html].” To make it interesting, they have to use a mandatory ingredient, like stinky cheese or olives (8 p.m. Eastern, Food Network).

• If you’re staying up …

On “Conan”: The cast of “Orange Is the New Black[http://nflx.it/1tNsrSk]”; a performance by the country music singer Nikki Lane[https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nikki-lane/id446885355] (11 p.m. Eastern, TBS).

“The Tonight Show”: Helen Mirren, whose film “The Hundred-Foot Journey” is out this week; James Cameron, who is releasing a documentary about his record dive to the Mariana Trench; and the rock band Spoon, whose new album is released Tuesday[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/they-want-my-soul/id883793887] (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC).

TOMORROW

• Campaign season never ends.

Congress may be on break, but four states have congressional primaries: Kansas, Michigan, Washington and Missouri.

The most prominent name facing a challenge[http://wapo.st/1p4sq9q] is Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas.

But his campaign doesn’t seem very worried about a long-shot Tea Party primary challenger, Milton Wolf, a radiologist who is a distant cousin of President Obama’s.

Health
Symptoms of 3 New York Patients Raise Concerns About Ebola

Heightened concern about the Ebola virus has led to alarms being raised at three hospitals in New York. But so far, no Ebola cases have turned up.

The latest episode involved a man who had recently been to West Africa, and who went to the emergency room at Mount Sinai Hospital[http://www.mountsinai.org/] in Manhattan late Sunday with a high fever and gastrointestinal problems, the hospital reported on Monday. He is being kept in isolation at the hospital while tests are being done for Ebola, a deadly disease, but also for other illnesses that could cause his symptoms.

But the city health department issued a statement on Monday saying that after consulting with Mount Sinai and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, “the health department has concluded that the patient is unlikely to have Ebola. Specimens are being tested for common causes of illness and to definitively exclude Ebola. Testing results will be made available by C.D.C. as soon as they are available.”

At NYU Langone Medical Center[http://www.med.nyu.edu/] last week, a patient who went to the emergency room with a fever and who mentioned a recent visit to West Africa was given a mask and moved to a secluded area, said Dr. Michael Phillips, the hospital’s director of Infection Prevention and Control. But further questioning revealed that the patient had not visited any of the affected countries, “so we stopped right there,” Dr. Phillips said.

At Bellevue Hospital [http://www.med.nyu.edu/patients-visitors/our-hospitals/bellevue-hospital-center]Center[http://www.med.nyu.edu/patients-visitors/our-hospitals/bellevue-hospital-center] last week, a patient was placed in isolation, but it quickly became clear that he did not have Ebola.

An Ebola outbreak centered mainly in three West African countries — Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia — has infected more than 1,300 people and killed more than 700 of them. American health officials have advised against nonessential travel to the three countries, and have urged doctors to be on high alert for people who return from the region with symptoms like fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

A Mount Sinai spokeswoman, Dorie Klissas, said that to protect the patient’s privacy the hospital was declining to make public his occupation, which country he had been in, whether he had been exposed to a patient with Ebola there, or whether he had close contacts like family members, friends or co-workers who were also at risk. Officials said they expected the results of the tests for Ebola within 24 to 48 hours.

In a statement to employees, hospital officials said that Ebola was spread only by direct contact with bodily fluids, and that infection control measures were being employed to protect patients and staff members.

In the Bellevue Hospital Center case, Dr. Ross Wilson, the chief medical officer at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, said that the man had symptoms also found in Ebola patients. He had arrived at Kennedy Airport from West Africa and was being detained by security personnel at the airport for an unrelated matter when he fell ill.

“He developed a headache and fever,” Dr. Wilson said. He was transported to Bellevue, but the people who brought him there did not suspect Ebola.

“We immediately put the dots together,” Dr. Wilson said.

Following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every patient entering one of the city’s 11 hospitals who has fever, headache and other symptoms associated with Ebola (as well as countless other ailments), is asked two new questions.

“Have you traveled to or from West African countries in the last 10 days? Have you been in contact with an Ebola patient or with anyone who has been in contact with an Ebola patient?”

When someone is suspected of having the infection, there are three key things that doctors rely on to make the diagnosis, Dr. Wilson said.

First, the history of travel and contacts is critical. Second is whether the symptoms match those of Ebola.

Finally, there are blood tests. There are only two facilities in the country that can perform these kinds of blood tests, including at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The blood tests are exceedingly complicated, he said, and there are different tests depending on the degree of sickness of the patient. Generally, he said, a 100 percent confirmation can take several days.

The house was supposed to be under strict quarantine. Meals were to be delivered by the health department. Nobody was to go in or out.

But the enforcement, part of the government’s tough new measures to contain Ebola, was light. Two police officers hung about chatting, out of sight of the house. Visitors came and went, including family members and well-wishers who were not supposed to be there. On the front porch sat the suspected Ebola victim’s father and mother, in whose arms the young woman had died.

They had handled her body, a serious medical risk. But days after her daughter’s death, Anna Conté left to fill her plastic teapot from the communal water tap used by dozens of others. Her government minders seemed not to notice.

Alarmed by the world’s worst outbreak of Ebola, West Africa leaders have declared extraordinary measures to fight the spread of the virus in recent days, including closing schools and authorizing house-to-house searches for infected people. Here in Sierra Leone, the nation hit hardest by the disease, the government has decreed a state of emergency — telling families to stay at home on Monday for ‘‘reflection, education and prayers’’ — and ordering strict measures, including the quarantine edict.

‘‘The very essence of our nation is at stake,’’ President Ernest Koroma said in a televised speech.

But that tough stance may be undermined by a looseness in follow-through — sharply in evidence in the impoverished Kissi neighborhood in this dense seaside capital —that is deeply worrying to doctors and health care workers.

‘‘Ebola doesn’t permit a halfway engagement,’’ said Walter Lorenzi, the Doctors Without Borders mission chief here. His group, the only international organization effectively battling the disease on the front lines, has declared the Ebola epidemic out of control in Sierra Leone and its West African neighbors.

‘‘It’s not astonishing that it is spreading,’’ Mr. Lorenzi added.

As of July 30, 826 people had died in the region, easily the highest Ebola death toll ever. In only two days, from July 28 to July 30, 58 more deaths were reported.

Sierra Leone has recorded the world’s highest number of cases, 574, according to the World Health Organization. On Monday, the news media in Nigeria reported a second case there, announced by the authorities, after the death of a Liberian-American in Lagos last week. To stem the dangers of infection by handling the bodies of Ebola victims, Liberia has ordered the corpses cremated.

The streets of Freetown were empty and eerily quiet Monday for the government’s ‘‘stay at home day.’’

There is no cure. The only hope of stopping the disease is strict isolation of victims and monitoring of those in their immediate orbit. But that was not happening in the household of the Koromas, who are not related to the president. Five of its members were supposed to be under quarantine. But there were at least eight people on Sunday afternoon on the tiny veranda overlooking a muddy slope leading to Cline Bay.

‘‘The neighbors were there,’’ said a nutritionist from the government Health Ministry, who had come to deliver the family’s meals — placing food on the veranda, along with disposable plates and plastic utensils. ‘‘That’s the concern. They are not isolated. The family, the neighbors, they come to sympathize; they don’t understand.’’

She declined to give her name, saying she was not authorized to speak with reporters.

At least three other houses in Freetown are supposed to be under the quarantine measure, the official said. So far, the capital has been spared — one of the Koroma family’s children, Saudatu, is the only suspected death in the city — but the disease rages in Sierra Leone’s east: 252 deaths, the second highest total after far more populous Guinea, where the epidemic started.

Since arriving in this country, the center of the disease has now shifted to this small impoverished land on the West African coast. In the city of Kenema, where the government has attempted to set up a treatment center, some 15 to 20 health care workers, including the country’s lead doctor, have died.

But the problem is not just with the government’s enforcement of its own measures. The very existence of Ebola continues to be challenged by the population it is afflicting.

‘‘It was not Ebola that killed her,’’ said Sule Koroma, of his 32-year-old sister, Saudatu, who was angry about being confined to the house. ‘‘She did not die from Ebola. It was witch-gun business,’’ he said. ‘‘They fire’’ on his sister, said Sule, 24. ‘‘Put a curse on her, so this embarrassment come up.’’

The other family members all agreed: It was not Ebola that killed Saudatu, they said. Just up the street, a government warning poster on Ebola had been mostly ripped from the wall; a few blocks away a Health Ministry truck with loudspeakers warned the residents of its dangers. But nobody on the bustling street Sunday paid any attention.

That disbelief informed the Koroma family’s handling of Saudatu’s final days, which achieved notoriety in the local news media here. She was being treated in a Freetown hospital when the family, despairing at her worsening condition, came and took her out. Her removal sparked alarm in the city.

‘‘We told the doctor we are going to go,’’ said Sule, seated on the veranda in Kissi Sunday. ‘‘He said go and do what you want to do,’’ Sule said. The doctors had initially told them Saudatu was suffering from malaria or typhoid fever.

‘‘So we removed our sister, so we could go on to the native side,’’ Sule said. ‘‘Because we have tried the English way. And it did not work.’’

Saudatu’s condition worsened. The family put her in an ambulance, back to the hospital. ‘‘On the way going then, the lady died,’’ Sule said..

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Tuesday:

• A Mideast truce?

Israel and Hamas appear to be respecting the latest cease-fire[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/world/middleeast/israel-gaza.html], which began at 8 a.m. local time today.

During what is supposed to be a 72-hour truce, Egypt will host negotiations aimed at working out a long-term deal.

President Obama signed a bill giving an additional $225 million[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/04/us/politics/ap-us-obama-iron-dome.html] in American taxpayer dollars for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system.

• The Ebola outbreak.

The World Bank says it is giving $200 million[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28652083] in emergency assistance to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and the World Health Organization.

An infected American nurse is arriving in Atlanta[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/05/us/ap-us-americans-ebola.html] today, joining a doctor who is being treated[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/kent-brantley-nancy-writebol-ebola-treatment-atlanta.html] at an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital.

• The president’s day.

Ebola will also be a topic for discussion for President Obama on the second day of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit meeting in Washington.

He’ll speak at the U.S.-Africa Business Forum this afternoon before hosting nearly 50 African heads of state for dinner at the White House.

• Summer polling.

The Tea Party has a 43-year-old radiologist, a distant cousin of President Obama[http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/10/09/230978346/obama-has-a-tea-party-cousin-and-hes-running-for-senate], on the ballot today against a three-term senator in a Republican primary in Kansas.

Primary voters also go to the polls[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/05/us/politics/ap-us-primary-election.html] in Michigan (races for governor, United States Senate, and 14 members of the House of Representatives); Washington State (10 House seats); and Missouri (eight House contests).

• Formula One trial close to settlement.

German prosecutors today accepted a 100 million euro offer[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28656050] by Bernie Ecclestone, the head of the Formula One car-racing empire, to end his trial on bribery charges.

• Trial in front-porch shooting.

A homeowner who fatally shot an unarmed woman in Detroit is expected to be back on the stand today.

On Monday[http://www.freep.com/article/20140804/NEWS02/308040114/Theodore-Wafer-Renisha-McBride], he told the court: “I didn’t want to be a victim in my own house.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are edging ahead. European indexes are gaining, and Asian markets ended mixed.

• Shares in the Chinese owner of Smithfield Foods, WH Group, jumped 6.5 percent[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/shares-of-chinese-pork-producer-soar-in-trading-debut/] in their debut in Hong Kong today. Last year’s $4.7 billion purchase of the biggest U.S. pork producer was the biggest ever Chinese buyout of an American company.

• The appeal of old-fashioned print newspapers will be tested today when Tribune Publishing, owner of dailies like The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

• Mercedes-Benz offices in Shanghai were raided by the Chinese antitrust authorities, the latest Western company to be targeted. Qualcomm and Microsoft were named in investigations last week.

NOTEWORTHY

• Te da, gi and po.

Those are some of the 5,000 new words[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/scrabblers-rejoice-5000-new-words-are-way] being added to “The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,” Merriam-Webster announced.

• “Having a beer with Nixon.”

From today through Saturday, portions of tapes in which President Richard M. Nixon describes his fall from power will be released.

“This is as close to what anybody is going to experience sitting down and having a beer with Nixon, sitting down with him in his living room,” a former aide said[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/05/us/ap-us-nixon-resignation-tapes.html].

• Those other college rankings.

Princeton Review announced its list of party schools[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/syracuse-university-ranks-party-school-24834468], and Syracuse University is top of the class, followed by the University of Iowa (last year’s winner), the University of California at Santa Barbara, West Virginia University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

• Showing the money.

The World’s Fair of Money, among the largest gatherings of coin collectors[http://www.worldsfairofmoney.com], begins today in Chicago.

The numismatists gather a day after five ancient Greek coins[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/nyregion/ancient-coins-returned-to-greece-ending-us-ordeal.html] worth around $200,000 that had nearly been sold at auction at the Waldorf-Astoria were returned to the Greek government.

• Greenlighted for history.

At the intersection of 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, the first electric traffic light was installed 100 years ago today.

The signal had red and green lights and a buzzer to alert drivers to a light change, and was operated manually from a nearby control booth.

BACK STORY

In 1976, a 27-year-old doctor in Belgium examined a blood sample from the former Belgian Congo, where a mysterious disease had broken out.

“We saw a gigantic wormlike structure — gigantic by viral standards,” Peter Piot told the BBC[http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28262541]. It was his first look at what would become known as Ebola.

Dr. Piot then led a medical team to a village in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Tracing every case, they identified a connector: a small hospital run by a Belgian Catholic priest and nuns. Transmission was linked to the reuse of needles at a clinic for new mothers, as well as contact with the bodies of the dead.

Quarantines halted the outbreak, but not before several hundred people had died. Debates over the source of the virus continue, with bats now seen as the likeliest reservoir.

The Belgian medical team had to name the virus. They didn’t want to stigmatize the village, Yambuku, so they took out a map, Dr. Piot said.

The nearest river they could see was the Ebola.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Friend or foe?

The major general who was fatally shot[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/world/asia/afghanistan-attack.html] by an Afghan soldier may be the highest-ranking member of the United States military to be killed in conflict in decades.

But the way he died has been anything but rare in Afghanistan, says Matthew Rosenberg, our correspondent in Afghanistan.

“It’s a persistent fact of life for American and allied NATO service members,” he says. “One day, an Afghan soldier might turn around and shoot them.”

Insider attacks have diminished from a 2012 peak, but it’s difficult to keep increasing precautions without further alienating the Afghan soldiers whom coalition forces are responsible to train.

The Afghans, Mr. Rosenberg says, “see that as an insulting thing, that they’re all in body armor, hanging out with them in casual situations.”

• Help for a few.

An experimental drug[http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/health/experimental-ebola-serum/index.html], never tested in humans, appears to be helping an American doctor and nurse infected with Ebola in Liberia, who are now being treated in Atlanta.

But that wasn’t an option for the almost 900 people who have died in the epidemic spreading in West Africa. Hundreds more are sick.

“One could see how Africans would look at the fact that foreigners got access to the drugs, and it would look like preferential treatment,” says Lydia Polgreen, a deputy foreign editor who was previously posted in Africa.

That would fit in with the African experience of subjugation from the slave trade, colonialism and apartheid.

But receiving an untested Ebola treatment could stir memories of unethical medical experiments[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/opinion/31washington.html] by whites or Westerners on “less-than-willing or not-well-informed subjects,” she tells us.

“Some might wonder if they were being used as guinea pigs.”

• Money walks.

The German news media was quick to seize on the disconnect after the billionaire head of Formula One settled his bribery trial in Munich today by offering to pay $100 million[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/world/europe/formula-one-chief-settles-bribery-case-for-100-million.html].

John F. Burns, who covers Formula One auto racing for The Times, says one leading newspaper called it an “obscene deal.” Another said it was a “corruption” of the German Constitution.

The charge stemmed from a $44 million payment that Bernie Ecclestone, who runs the racing empire, made in 2006 to a German banker. The banker was jailed. For his part, Mr. Ecclestone said he had been blackmailed.

Many Germans, however, see “a kind of justice available only to people as wealthy as Mr. Ecclestone,” says Mr. Burns.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed down. The S.&P. 500 lost 1 percent.

TONIGHT

• Taking to the streets.

It’s National Night Out[http://natw.org/about/], with events held in hundreds of cities around the country to bring residents out to meet the police and learn about anticrime efforts.

The night out falls every year on the first Tuesday in August, except in Texas, which has its events on the first Tuesday in October.

• A mini-binge opportunity.

Six 22-minute episodes of “Sequestered[http://www.crackle.com/c/sequestered?cmpid=4268&gclid=CO_ErKGD_L8CFSpo7Aodug0A9w],” a series revolving around a California murder trial, are available to stream at Crackle.com.

Our television critic Neil Genzlinger says[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/arts/television/8216sequestered8217-on-the-streaming-service-crackle.html] “you can watch it the way you read a beach novel: quickly, looking for the next plot rush, not taking anything very seriously.”

• Have you heard of Little Big Town?

They’re[https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/little-big-town/id513770] the Country Music Association’s Vocal Group of the Year and the hosts of the three-hour special “C.M.A. Music Festival: Country’s Night to Rock[http://abc.go.com/shows/cma-music-festival].”

The show is a collection of highlights from a four-day party, with the genre’s hottest acts, that took place in Nashville in early June (8 p.m. Eastern, ABC).

• Inside the huddle.

Each football season, the “Hard Knocks[http://www.hbo.com/hard-knocks#/]” unscripted series follows a professional team through its five-week training camp. This year’s team is the Atlanta Falcons. Some believe that being on the show is a curse[http://grantland.com/features/the-questionable-perils-training-camp-microscope-offseason-stories-matter/] (10 p.m. Eastern, HBO).

• If you’re staying up…

On “The Daily Show”: Helen Thorpe, the author of “Soldier Girls: The Battles of Three Women at Home and at War[http://books.simonandschuster.com/Soldier-Girls/Helen-Thorpe/9781451668100]” (11 p.m. Eastern, Comedy Central).

“The Tonight Show”: Clive Owen, star of the new TV series “The Knick[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937900/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3]”; Nina Dobrev of the CW’s show “The Vampire Diaries[http://www.cwtv.com/shows/the-vampire-diaries]”; the Head and the Heart[http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/filters/guests/9361] perform (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC).

“Jimmy Kimmel Live”: Ted Danson; Eva Green of the forthcoming “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458481/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1]” and the show “Penny Dreadful[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2628232/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2]”; and a performance by Jake Owen[https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jake-owen/id128412737] (11:35 p.m. Eastern, ABC).

TOMORROW

• The Ebola crisis.

The World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/] convenes an emergency committee meeting in Switzerland.

• Weapon of mass destruction.

The Enola Gay, an American bomber, dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima 69 years ago tomorrow. (A second was dropped on Nagasaki three days later.)

The bombing destroyed an area of about six square miles, killing as many as 80,000 people instantly and igniting fires that burned for days, killing many more. In all, 135,000 people died.

• United against unwanted phone calls.

About 10,000 computer whizzes will descend on the Rio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas for the Defcon 22[https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-index.html] convention.

One anticipated competition, sponsored by the Federal Trade Commission, challenges hackers[http://www.ftc.gov/zapping-rachel] to build a device that lures in robocallers so it can figure out how to block them.

There is $17,000 in cash prizes, but more important, the chance to earn the gratitude of all humanity.

City Room
N.Y. / Region
New York Today: On Alert for Ebola
By ANNIE CORREAL

Good morning on this hot Tuesday.

On Monday, a patient was treated at Mt. Sinai Hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/health/patient-at-mount-sinai-has-ebola-like-symptoms-hospital-says.html] for a fever and gastrointestinal issues.

Because he had recently been to West Africa, where Ebola has claimed around 800 lives[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html?], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were called in.

The man was kept in isolation, his personal details guarded like state secrets.

In the evening, the city’s health department announced, “the patient is unlikely to have Ebola,”[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-city-hospital-treating-potential-ebola-patient/story?id=24838232] concluding that he was probably suffering from a more common condition.

The case highlights the difficulty of pinning down a disease that shares its most common symptoms[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html] with everyday illnesses such as food poisoning.

It also shows that the city is on high alert.

Here’s where things stand:

• Quarantine officers[http://nypost.com/2014/07/30/airports-on-high-alert-for-fliers-with-ebola-symptoms/] are stationed at Kennedy and Newark airports.

• The health department has developed a plan to transfer patients arriving at Kennedy with Ebola-like symptoms to hospitals.

• All major hospitals in the city have at least one room designed to handle patients with Ebola or any other highly infectious disease.

• The city has told hospitals and doctors to consider Ebola when treating any ill patient who has traveled in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Nigeria and to notify the health department.

• Adding to the collective concern, the city held its largest ever emergency drill[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/pr2014/pr025-14.shtml] on Friday, preparing 1,500 city workers for bioterrorism and outbreaks.

But the timing appeared to be coincidental.

The health department wrote on Twitter[https://twitter.com/nycHealthy/status/495304909042900993] last week that the exercise “was secretly in the works for months.”

“Those wings are saying Seth is flying by, Seth lives here,” she said.

Since spring, several countries in West Africa have been affected by the largest Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A5%22%7D] outbreak ever recorded. Denise Grady[https://twitter.com/nytDeniseGrady], a science reporter, has been covering the outbreak for The Times. We asked Denise to suggest reading for those interested in learning more about the disease.

Denise Grady:

The book “Spillover,” by David Quammen, has gotten very good reviews within the past year or so. “Virus Hunter: Thirty Years of Battling Hot Viruses Around the World,” by C.J. Peters, a famous infectious-disease expert, is also very good. It’s a bit older, but “The Hot Zone,” by Richard Preston, is also good. All three are quite compelling to read, and full of fascinatingly scary information that is presented in a really clear, understandable way.

I wrote a New York Times book for young readers, called “New York Times Deadly Invaders: Virus Outbreaks Around the World, From Marburn Fever to Avian Flu,” about scary, viral diseases, and it has a lot of information on Ebola and the closely related and very deadly virus called Marburg.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/index.html] and World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/en/] both have excellent information about Ebola on their websites.

Obama’s Africa Summit

Even as the Ebola virus serves as a reminder of Africa’s manifold challenges, a much brighter future for the Continent was on display in Washington this week, where more than 40 African heads of state are attending a summit meeting led by President Obama. Done right, with sufficient follow-through, the event should strengthen American ties to a continent that is expected to outpace China and India in population by 2040 and is widely viewed as the world’s last major economic frontier.

The event is a determined, and splashy, initiative by Mr. Obama to push back against other countries doing business there, especially China, which is investing heavily in infrastructure projects and using Africa as a source of vital oil and metals. It is also an opportunity to counter critics who say he has devoted insufficient attention to the continent.

Administration officials have been eager to persuade Africa that America’s democratic capitalistic system can offer advantages that China’s authoritarian system cannot. As Susan Rice, the national security adviser, said last week, “We don’t see Africa as a pipeline to extract vital resources, nor as a funnel for charity.” She described a broader vision in which the United States is committed to being a partner to create jobs, resolve conflicts and develop the human capital needed to build a better future.

To that end, the summit meeting was preceded by a gathering[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/28/remarks-president-town-hall-washington-fellowship-young-african-leaders] of 500 participants in Mr. Obama’s Young African Leaders Initiative. Other events included forums on women, health, trade, food security and civil society. Still others brought together American corporate executives with African leaders. The summit schedule will end with meetings with Mr. Obama on Wednesday.

The world has largely associated Africa with desperate struggles against war, poverty, famine and dictatorial leaders. But there are positive trends, too. Africa is home to six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, an emerging middle class and markets that are increasingly open to foreign investment. In short, there is money to be made there.

There is also a growing threat from militants in some countries. And, as human rights groups point out, the summit meeting’s focus on trade, investment and counterterrorism cannot be allowed to dilute the Obama administration’s willingness to press for good and honest governance, fair elections and human rights, all essential for long-term stability and growth.

Atlanta Hospital Admits Second American With Ebola

Correction Appended

ATLANTA — The North Carolina missionary who contracted the Ebola virus while working in Liberia arrived in Georgia on Tuesday and joined another aid worker in the specialized isolation ward of a hospital here.

Emory University Hospital admitted the missionary, Nancy Writebol, early Tuesday afternoon, after she was flown to Georgia aboard a private air ambulance that landed at a military base northwest of Atlanta. She arrived at the hospital in a motorcade that included an ambulance and an array of police vehicles. Onlookers crowded a nearby skywalk, and television news helicopters recorded footage that showed Ms. Writebol being pushed into the hospital on a stretcher.

Emory said that Ms. Writebol and Kent Brantly[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/kent-brantley-nancy-writebol-ebola-treatment-atlanta.html], a doctor who was working for the relief organization Samaritan’s Purse in West Africa, where Ebola has killed more than 800 people in recent months, were being treated in a unit built 12 years ago to isolate and care for patients with especially threatening infectious diseases.

“We are tremendously relieved that our mother is back in the U.S.,” one of Ms. Writebol’s sons, Jeremy Writebol, said in a statement. “We know that she will receive the best medical care possible at Emory University Hospital. We’re grateful to everyone who has joined us in praying for this moment.”

Bruce Johnson, the president of SIM USA, the Christian group with which Ms. Writebol is affiliated, said at a news conference that he had been told she was “very weak” but improving. He said that before the private jet departed Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, Ms. Writebol had eaten yogurt and walked, with assistance, to the plane.

“A week ago, we were thinking about making funeral arrangements for Nancy,” Ms. Writebol’s husband, David Writebol, said Tuesday, according to Mr. Johnson. “Now we have a real reason to be hopeful.”

Dr. Brantly’s wife, Amber Brantly, said Tuesday that she had visited her husband every day since he had arrived here on Saturday and that he “continues to improve.”

In a statement from Emory about Ms. Writebol’s admission, the hospital did not comment on the conditions of Dr. Brantly or Ms. Writebol, who are believed to be the first two people ever treated for Ebola at a hospital in the United States. Their admissions have drawn widespread scrutiny, and Emory doctors and public health officials have repeatedly countered speculation that Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol could easily infect others in the United States.

“Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient,” the hospital said in a statement on Tuesday. “The standard, rigorous infection-control procedures used at Emory protect the patient, Emory health care workers and the general public.”

Ebola is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, and the people assisting Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol have worn suits intended to prevent contamination.

“We have a specially designed unit, which is highly contained,” Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, a specialist in infectious diseases at Emory, said last week. “We have highly trained personnel who know how to safely enter the room of a patient who requires this form of isolation. We have control over everything coming out of the unit, so that everything is made noninfectious before any materials come out.”

He described the protocols as “an inordinate amount of safety.”

Doctors elsewhere in the United States were on alert for the possibility of Ebola cases. At Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, an ill man who had recently returned from West Africa was being kept in isolation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/health/patient-at-mount-sinai-has-ebola-like-symptoms-hospital-says.html] while doctors investigated the cause of his fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The hospital said Tuesday that the man had been “stable overnight and in good spirits.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based here, was working to determine whether the man had contracted Ebola, but New York City officials were optimistic.

“Looking at his history, we think it’s highly unlikely that he has Ebola, but we’re going to await the tests from the C.D.C.,” Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city’s health commissioner, said.

Dr. Ribner said last week that he was planning a regimen of “supportive care,” while waiting for the patients’ immune systems to fight off the virus. “We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection,” he said.

The two received doses of an experimental serum before they left West Africa, but Mr. Johnson, whose organization has spent about $1 million for care and monitoring since Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol were found to have Ebola, said he was unsure whether Emory would continue to use that drug protocol.

Marc Santora contributed reporting from New York.

Sierra Leone Deploys Troops in Ebola Crisis

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Faced with a widening crisis over the spread of the deadly Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus, Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s government said Tuesday that it would deploy hundreds of troops and police officers to ensure that patients and family members who may be infected remain isolated.

A battalion — 750 soldiers — will be sent to clinics housing Ebola patients in areas where the disease is most virulent, and the police presence will be reinforced at homes where family members are at risk of having contracted it, said Abdulai Baratay, a government spokesman.

Sierra Leone has become the center of the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola, which has instilled fear across West Africa and has spread to four countries. Sierra Leone, a country of 5.7 million people and the size of South Carolina, has recorded the highest number of cases, 646, and the second-highest deaths, 273.

The mortality rate is so high — up to 90 percent — that many across the region simply refuse to accept that Ebola is present. Several cases have been recorded here of families entering clinics to snatch away relatives with the disease and not abiding by new rules quarantining households — forbidding the coming and going of visitors — where there have been Ebola patients.

The deployment of soldiers and police officers announced Tuesday is intended to combat this wave, government spokesmen said.

It also appears to be a sign of the increasing anxiety of officials here, faced with a deadly tide that is intensifying, not diminishing. Monday was decreed a “stay at home day” in Sierra Leone, an interruption of normal life to bring home to a resistant population that it faces a deadly challenge.

“Where there is a serious situation, the president can invoke military assistance to civil power,” Unisa Sesay, the president’s director of communications, said in an interview. “You have to understand that there has been a lot of lawlessness connected to this Ebola business.”

Mr. Sesay noted that “family members have forced their way into these medical facilities and removed” patients “and taken them home, and overpowered the workers.”

He said the “infection rate” was increasing, precisely because of this lack of respect for the rigorous isolation measures that the disease demands. The troops will be deployed especially in the major outbreak centers of Kenema and Kailahun, in the country’s east, he said.

On the streets of the capital, people have made a joke of a “no handshake” rule counseled by some. But there were signs that the seriousness of the epidemic was taking hold. “Everyone is worried,” said Kingsley Sesay, 21, an automobile repairman in the Cline Town district. “Some are believers, and some do not believe. I’m worried, because it is a killer disease.”

The United States Agency for International Development announced Tuesday that it would deploy a team to West Africa, including some representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], to help coordinate the American government’s response to the outbreak, which has so far killed 887.

African Leaders Sit Down With American Investors

WASHINGTON — President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] convened a giant game of “Let’s Make a Deal” between the United States and Africa on Tuesday, bringing together nearly 50 African leaders with American investors for what he promised would be a long-term partnership that went beyond extracting “minerals from the ground for our growth.”

For Mr. Obama, the son of a Kenyan economist, it was the centerpiece of a three-day summit meeting of African leaders — some close allies of the United States, others barely on speaking terms — that is the president’s most ambitious attempt to cement his legacy as an American leader who cares about the African continent.

“Our entire trade with all of Africa is still only about equal to our trade with Brazil,” the president said. “I want Africans buying more American products; I want Americans buying more African products. I know you do, too, and that’s what you’re doing today.”

The African leaders seemed gratified by Mr. Obama’s sales pitch, which was echoed by a roster of boldface names from the business world, including the chief executives of General Electric, Coca-Cola and IBM and private-equity titans from Blackstone and the Carlyle Group.

But the chamber of commerce vibe was disrupted just before Mr. Obama spoke when some of the African leaders took umbrage to questions about the Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] in West Africa and the security threat from Boko Haram[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/world/africa/boko-haram-targets-political-figures-in-string-of-attacks.html] and other Islamic militant groups.

“It’s an unfair vision of Africa,” said President Macky Sall of Senegal, referring to Western news reports about the outbreak. “Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is not an African disease,” he said, speaking in French. “It is necessary to confront Ebola as a threat to humanity.”

Tanzania’s president, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, noting that his country is in East Africa, said that too often “the whole of the African continent is perceived as if everywhere, everybody is suffering from Ebola.”

The presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone canceled their visits to the summit meeting to deal with the outbreak. On Monday, American health officials met quietly at the State Department and with African officials from the affected countries to discuss their responses to the virus.

Mr. Kikwete also played down a question from Charlie Rose, the CBS News anchor, about the threat posed by militants, saying that Africa’s two major trouble spots, Somalia and Darfur, Sudan, had calmed down. That drew a sharp retort from President Moncef Marzouki of Tunisia, who cited continuing violence in Sudan and northern Mali.

“We have to face the problems, but we have to work together,” said Mr. Marzouki, who returned from exile in France to run for president after Tunisia’s autocratic leader, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/zine_elabidine_ben_ali/index.html?], was ousted in the opening days of the Arab Spring in 2011.

Mr. Obama steered clear of the Ebola outbreak or Islamic militancy — not to mention his own personal links to Africa. Instead, his speech focused heavily on creating the right conditions for American companies to invest in Africa. He made a couple of announcements to jump-start the effort, including $12 billion in new funding for the administration’s Power Africa initiative, which aims to provide electricity to households across sub-Saharan Africa. With $26 billion in funding, Mr. Obama said he had tripled the program’s goal of reaching 60 million households.

He also promoted $14 billion in new investments by American companies in Africa, including $5 billion from Coca-Cola. Heeding requests from African leaders, he said the White House would work with Congress to extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act[http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43173.pdf], which grants trade preferences to sub-Saharan countries and expires next year.

With a narrative that has shifted from war and poverty to growth and development, Mr. Obama extolled Africa as an enticing opportunity for the United States. Though he did not mention China, he drew a clear distinction between the American approach and that of China, which has spent lavishly in Africa to lock up sources of minerals.

“We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,” Mr. Obama said. “We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and their potential.”

But if Mr. Obama sought to distance the United States from China, he delivered only a gentle admonition to the leaders about the need to curb corruption and install cleaner governments. “People should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hiring someone’s cousin,” he said.

The conference was co-sponsored by the Commerce Department and the foundation of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/michael_r_bloomberg/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York, who told reporters: “It has become unfashionable to be a business person in the U.S. And Africa desperately wants to build a business class because that’s where the jobs are going to come from.”

While the mood at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel was buoyant, a few guests turned the tables on the United States. Mo Ibrahim, a Sudan-born cellphone tycoon, complained that American companies used legal techniques to dodge taxes in African countries where they have operations.

“Can you please also pay your taxes?” he said. “If you want to succeed long-term, you have to do clean business.”

With its combination of marquee panelists and ironclad security, the meeting felt like a cross between the World Economic Forum at Davos and a Group of 20 summit meeting. Corporate chieftains, and celebrity guests like former President Bill Clinton, mixed easily with African leaders, while reporters covering the conference were penned behind a rope and allowed to move around only under escort.

None of the African leaders will get one-on-one meetings with Mr. Obama, but the White House arranged for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to meet with the leaders of South Africa and Nigeria.

On Tuesday evening, however, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, welcomed all the leaders to the South Lawn of the White House, where they were serenaded by Lionel Richie and served a dinner of grilled beef with coconut milk, and cappuccino fudge cake with Madagascar vanilla-scented papaya.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Wednesday:

• Trying to contain Ebola.

Experts at the World Health Organization began a two-day emergency meeting in Geneva today, where they will decide whether to call the deadly outbreak a global health emergency.

The move could involve imposing travel restrictions and border closures on affected countries in West Africa.

• Quiet skies over Gaza.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are returning home[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28669031], many to find nothing left, on the second day of a three-day cease-fire.

A donor conference to raise funds for Gaza’s $6 billion reconstruction is being organized, and negotiations in Cairo[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/06/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html] on a long-term truce are expected this week.

• Gay marriage bans get scrutiny.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, is hearing arguments today in six gay marriage cases[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/06/us/ap-us-gay-marriage-cases.html] from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.

Each case deals with whether statewide gay marriage bans violate the Constitution. Gay marriage is now legal in 19 states and in Washington, and there are legal challenges[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/06/us/ap-us-gay-marriage-state-lawsuits.html] to overturn all the remaining state bans.

• Executed.

A Missouri man was put to death[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/06/us/ap-us-missouri-execution.html] early this morning for raping and killing a college student in 1995.

He is the first prisoner killed since a lethal injection last month in which an inmate in Arizona took nearly two hours to die[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/us/a-prolonged-execution-in-arizona-leads-to-a-temporary-halt.html].

• You might want to reset your password.

A Russian crime ring has amassed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/technology/russian-gang-said-to-amass-more-than-a-billion-stolen-internet-credentials.html] 1.2 billion user name and password combinations and more than 500 million email addresses, security researchers say.

If you’re worried, here’s what you can do[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/05/technology/what-you-need-to-know-with-russian-hack.html].

• Focus on Africa.

On the third and final day of a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit meeting, President Obama gathers with 50 African heads of state for discussions on investment, trade, development and counterterrorism, at the State Department.

Mrs. Obama and the former first lady Laura Bush host a symposium[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/04/first-lady-michelle-obama-and-former-first-lady-laura-bush-host-symposiu] with the African leaders’ spouses focused on public-private partnerships to pursue health, education and economic growth.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are flat to slightly higher. European shares are down moderately, and Asian indexes slipped.

• Two suitors give up: Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/murdoch-withdraws-bid-for-time-warner/] pulled the plug on its offer for Time Warner, and Sprint withdrew[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/sprint-and-softbank-said-to-abandon-bid-for-t-mobile-us/] its bid for T-Mobile US.

• But Iliad, a French telecommunications upstart, is reportedly in talks to bolster[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/05/us-tmobile-iliad-idUSKBN0G525A20140805] its $15 billion bid for 57 percent of T-Mobile US.

• Apple and Samsung , in another cease-fire, agreed to drop[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/apple-and-samsung-drop-patent-fights-outside-the-united-states/] their patent lawsuits outside the United States. But the U.S. cases, their biggest, will continue.

• Walgreen’s, too, is waving a white flag, apparently giving up its plan[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/walgreen-is-said-to-near-a-deal-to-buy-out-british-drugstore-chain-but-without-an-inversion/] to move its headquarters abroad to cut corporate taxes.

That came after Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said his department was preparing options to wipe out the economic incentive[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/business/Action-in-washington-on-corporate-inversions.html] for such “inversions.”

Still, Walgreen’s appears to be close to a deal to take over the British pharmacy retailer Alliance Boots, even without a change in tax domicile.

• Both Fox and Time Warner release their latest earnings today.

NOTEWORTHY

• That’s about $45,500 a minute.

Three stars of the hit TV comedy “The Big Bang Theory” agreed to three-year contracts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/business/media/big-bang-theory-stars-renew-their-contracts.html] worth $1 million per episode for each actor, putting them on the salary level of the actors on “Friends”[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/12/business/friends-deal-will-pay-each-of-its-6-stars-22-million.html] from last decade.

Production on the eighth season, which had been delayed, is to begin today.

• Shattering the glass backboard.

The N.B.A. champion San Antonio Spurshave hired[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/sports/basketball/spurs-hire-becky-hammon-as-nbas-first-full-time-female-coach.html] the league’s first female full-time coach.

Becky Hammon[http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/becky_hammon/], 37, will retire this month from the W.N.B.A. after a 16-season playing career before joining the Spurs as an assistant coach.

• Best and brightest.

The 15 global finalists in the Google Science Fair, an online competition for teenagers[https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/], will be announced today. The grand prize, which includes a trip to the Galápagos Islands and a $50,000 scholarship, will be announced Sept. 22.

Entries include a device to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, a prototype of a wheelchair controlled by eye movements, and electricity-harvesting footwear.

BACK STORY

Corporate spinoffs are all the rage these days: Gannett just announced[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/gannett-to-spin-off-its-print-business/] it would spin off its newspaper division, following similar moves by Tribune Co. and Time Inc., also in the media business, and many others across all industries.

How does dividing up a company into narrower, separately traded parts help?

In Gannett’s case, explains Michael de la Merced, a Times finance reporter, “spinning off newspapers means removing a slow-growing business, letting the company focus its time and money on better-performing assets like television stations.”

A benefit for company owners is that it’s a relatively tax-free transaction, as opposed to selling the division outright.

For investors, a spinoff gives them stock in two companies, letting them target the one they think has more potential.

While many spunoff companies tend to be slower-growing, Mr. de la Merced says, they also generate enough cash that they can pay handsome dividends.

For employees, the benefits aren’t as clear.

“The new companies have to be viable businesses, but the fact remains that they are smaller and have less of a financial cushion to fall back on,” he says.

In “What You Need to Know About the Ebola Outbreak,” [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] The Times sums up, in words and images, key information about this virus.

HOW many people have been infected since March?

WHERE are the affected areas?

WHEN was the virus discovered?

WHEN was the second-most deadly year for Ebola?

HOW does Ebola spread?

WHO are at high risk?

WHAT do people in some parts of West Africa believe about saying the word “Ebola” aloud?

WHAT are the symptoms and WHEN do they appear?

HOW does an Ebola patient actually die?

WHAT can physicians do for Ebola patients?

WHY did scientists rule out gorillas as the originators of this virus? WHAT creatures do they now believe to be the natural reservoirs?

For Higher-Order Thinking

Two American aid workers infected with Ebola while working in West Africa have been brought to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. WHY, according to this article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/kent-brantley-nancy-writebol-ebola-treatment-atlanta.html], have doctors there dismissed fears that their Ebola could spread?

Ebola Outbreak Hits Home for New York’s West African Immigrants

Gwendolyn Davis has never traveled to West Africa and does not know anyone who has contracted the deadly Ebola virus, but she is not taking any chances.

She makes sure not to hug or shake hands. She steers clear of coughing, and tries to avoid touching anything or anyone when riding the bus.

“There are people that come here from all over the world,” said Ms. Davis, 63, a retired teacher, as she folded clothes in a laundromat in the Bronx on Tuesday afternoon. “I don’t know what they’ve got.”

The Ebola virus has emerged as a new worry for some New Yorkers this week after a patient admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday was tested for Ebola, though doctors have emphasized that the probability that the test results will be positive is small. Some are worried for themselves; others are concerned about loved ones in West Africa, where a widening outbreak of the virus has already claimed the lives of more than 800 people. Two Americans who had been doing missionary work there are being treated at an Atlanta hospital. Ebola, which has no cure, is spread through contact with bodily fluids.

West African immigrants make up a small but growing part of New York City’s population. In 2012, there were 71,397 residents born in West African countries, including Ghana and Nigeria, up from 47,885 in 2000, according to an analysis of census data by the Queens College sociology department. About half of them — or 36,112 residents — live in the Bronx, but they are represented in every borough. There are 13,304 West African immigrants in Brooklyn; 10,142 in Queens; 7,636 in Manhattan; and 4,203 on Staten Island.

Many of these immigrants have closely followed the news coverage of Ebola, fearful that it has, or will, spread to the towns and cities they left behind.

“It’s like a shared panic,” said Kelvin Richards, the vice president of the Staten Island Liberian Community Association. He added that his mother, who runs a bread factory in Monrovia, Liberia, recently closed it rather than risk having a customer infect the workers.

“It’s like a ghost town in Monrovia,” he said. “Everybody’s freaking out, you can’t tell who has what because the symptoms are so general. It’s very crazy.”

In the Clifton neighborhood on Staten Island, which is known as Little Liberia, about 200 people gathered at a Lutheran church on Sunday to start raising money to help the Ebola victims, Mr. Richards said. Afterward, they set up a Facebook page, “Staten Island Against Ebola.” “We just came from a 14-year civil war, and now we have a virus killing people,” he said.

At outdoor tables in Clifton on Tuesday, women in floral print dresses recalled their anguish at not being able to reach family and friends back home, or their relief and joy when they did. “People are dying,” said Bettie Arkoi, 74, who spoke to several of her children and siblings by phone over the weekend. “Sometimes I sit down and cry, it’s so horrible. I’m asking God to protect them because I don’t think they are able to protect themselves.”

Rufus Quaye, 38, who has relatives in Grand Bassa, Liberia, stared at a news report on Ebola on a storefront television. “This affects us spiritually,” he said. “We have no idea the depths of how it’s affecting our families in Africa. It makes us go to God to ask for divine intervention.”

In the Bronx, the Islamic Cultural Center on East 166th Street has added Ebola victims to its prayers and plans to take up a collection to send to their families. The center serves hundreds of families from West Africa, many of them recent immigrants.

“I know a lot of people in these regions,” said Bakary Camara, a member of the center from Gambia. “There are some places where people don’t have enough to even eat and clothe their family. If they become infected, what happens to the family? They are destroyed.”

Mr. Camara, 49, a real estate agent, said the center had also urged its members to take precautions, if necessary, around people who had recently returned from West Africa. He added that their Islamic faith and teachings have helped them prepare for Ebola. For instance, he said, members always wash their hands and feet before they gather for prayer. They are also taught that if they live in a region with a plague, they should try not to go to another region unless they have an emergency, to avoid spreading it, he said.

“Nothing new surprises Islam,” he said. “We pray that this disease ends soon without taking many more victims.”

Outside the Royal A.M. African Market a few blocks away, Foulaba Jaloah, 49, recalled that when he was growing up in Sierra Leone and other West African countries in the 1960s and 1970s, the fear was catching malaria, which, he said, he contracted several times.

Mr. Jaloah, who has not returned to West Africa in years, said that he did not worry that he would contract Ebola in New York. But he said that others might. Already, he said, he has noticed a change when he meets people for the first time.

“I tell them, ‘I’m from West Africa,’ and they say, ‘Oh, Ebola,'  ” he recalled. “Everybody is afraid of everybody right now. When the scare comes, there is no friendship anymore.”

W.H.O. Weighing Emergency Decree on Ebola

Scrambling to get ahead of the worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, the World Health Organization announced Wednesday that it was considering the declaration of an international public health emergency and would convene a panel of experts in coming days to explore the use of experimental treatments for the incurable disease.

The announcements came as fears spread that a Saudi citizen may have brought the Ebola virus home to Saudi Arabia, which is still reeling from a mismanaged epidemic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that has killed nearly 300 people in the last two years. Saudi news media[http://www.arabnews.com/news/featured/612411] said that the citizen, a businessman in his 40s, died on Wednesday at King Fahd Hospital in Jidda after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, and that Saudi health officials had submitted biological samples from the patient to laboratories in the United States and Germany.

The Saudi accounts emphasized that the illness had not yet been identified, and they did not specify where the patient got sick. But Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said in an email that the patient appeared to have been in Sierra Leone on business in some of the affected areas.

The organization also announced[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_06_ebola/en/] 108 new Ebola cases recorded from Saturday to Monday, bringing the total to 1,711, with 932 deaths. Nearly all are in the three afflicted West African countries at the epicenter of the outbreak: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

But in a sign of the spread of the disease internationally, the organization listed five new cases in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, bringing the Nigerian total to nine. The virus was discovered to have leapfrogged there by plane last week, carried by an American who had been working in Liberia and died in a Nigerian hospital.

The health organization said an emergency committee of international experts was evaluating whether the Ebola outbreak constituted a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” a classification that has only rarely been invoked to combat deadly contagions. The classification gives health authorities greater powers that include quarantining people in affected areas. The committee’s recommendations are expected by Friday.

In a separate announcement[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ethical-review-ebola/en/], the organization said it was convening a panel of medical ethicists to explore the use of experimental treatments for Ebola, which has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent. The virus, which causes high fevers, aches and severe internal bleeding, is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was first discovered in 1976.

“We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak,” Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the organization’s assistant director general, said in the announcement. “We have a disease with a high fatality rate without any proven treatment or vaccine.”

She said “we need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is.”

Several experimental options are under development, including an untested drug that was administered to two American health workers from Samaritan’s Purse[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/samaritans-purse-doctor-serving-in-liberia-west-africa-tests-positive-for-ebola/], a Christian relief group based in Boone, N.C. They had been treating Ebola patients in Liberia and contracted the disease. Both were flown in recent days to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and have been showing signs of improvement, causing an international debate over why Americans were given the drug when hundreds of Africans have died without access to it.

The World Health Organization’s announcement also cited the Samaritan’s Purse workers’ apparent response to the drug, saying it had “raised questions about whether medicine that has never been tested and shown to be safe in people should be used in the outbreak and, given the extremely limited amount of medicine available, if it is used, who should receive it.”

Business Day
An Obscure Biotech Firm Hurries Ebola Treatment
By ANDREW POLLACK

Inside special isolation units at an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the two Americans infected with Ebola in West Africa, appeared to be responding to an experimental medicine devised by an obscure biotechnology company with ties to the Defense Department.

In West Africa, the estimated death toll from the outbreak kept rising, to 932, by the latest official count.

How and why Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol received the drug, ZMapp, is one of the many mysteries surrounding what has been called a “secret serum,” including the big one: Does it really work? The Americans are the only two patients who have been treated with the medicine, out of perhaps thousands who might have benefited so far, raising old questions about who does — and does not — have access to medications, including experimental drugs.

But the San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical[http://mappbio.com/], the primary developer of the drug, was consumed Wednesday with how to manufacture more of it with an eye to providing the drug to more patients, probably in the form of clinical trials.

“It’s absolutely overwhelming,” Larry Zeitlin, the president of Mapp, said in an interview Wednesday. “We are discussing with the F.D.A. the right path to make the drug available to people as quickly and safely as possible,” he added, referring to the Food and Drug Administration.

There were signs that efforts to increase production were beginning. Caliber Biotherapeutics, a Texas company established with funding from the Defense Department to respond to biological threats, has received inquiries from the government about whether it could help manufacture ZMapp, said R. Barry Holtz, the company’s chief science and technology officer.

The World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/] said it would convene a panel of medical ethicists early next week to explore the use of the experimental treatment in the outbreak in West Africa. Currently, neither ZMapp nor any other medicine or vaccine is approved for treatment of the virus, but there are several experimental options under development.

How quickly the drug could be made on a larger scale will depend to some extent on the tobacco company Reynolds American. It owns the facility in Owensboro, Ky., where the drug is made inside the leaves of tobacco plants. David Howard, a spokesman for Reynolds, said it would take several months to scale up.

Mapp was started in 2003 by Dr. Zeitlin and Kevin J. Whaley. They have worked together for many years, starting at Johns Hopkins University, on research that uses crops to produce immune system proteins to treat diseases in people.

Dr. Whaley, the chief executive of Mapp, and Dr. Zeitlin have not spoken much publicly since the news of the treatment broke on Monday, saying they are too busy and want to avoid the limelight. The privately held company has only nine people and has been financed solely by government grants and contracts, they said.

They say that major decisions on how to proceed are in the hands of public health authorities.

“We definitely would like to ramp up to have an impact on the Ebola epidemic,” Dr. Whaley said. But he added, “We’re not decision makers on many of these issues. There are regulatory and legal issues that have to be addressed.”

The drug had never before been tried in people, though it and some predecessor drugs had been tested in monkeys, showing some effectiveness. Mapp was only now gearing up to start the larger animal toxicity studies typically needed before testing it in humans, with an eye to doing the first human safety studies in healthy volunteers next year. For that reason there were very few doses available when the Ebola outbreak started.

Now the company is trying to move faster and it is likely the drug will be tested in patients rather than healthy volunteers.

ZMapp uses an approach called passive immunotherapy. Instead of having a vaccine stimulate the immune system to make antibodies that attack the virus, passive immunotherapy simply supplies the antibodies to the patients. For some infectious diseases, these antibodies are extracted from the blood of patients who have survived the infection and presumably have effective antibodies.

ZMapp instead consists of antibodies that are made by exposing mice to a key Ebola protein and harvesting their antibodies. Those antibodies are then genetically modified to make them more like human antibodies and therefore less likely to provoke an immune reaction if injected into people.

The gene for each antibody is then introduced into the leaves of tobacco plants using a system developed by Icon Genetics, a German company. The leaves then produce the antibody.

In one study published last year, three out of seven monkeys treated with antibodies developed by Mapp survived being infected with Ebola, even though treatment did not start until four days after the infection. Both animals in the control group died. The treatment worked even better in another study when begun earlier after exposure to the virus.

It turns out another tiny company, Defyrus, based in Toronto, was independently developing a similar treatment with the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The companies agreed to combine the best of their antibodies into a single cocktail called ZMapp, which is what the two American aid workers received. The data for ZMapp in monkeys has not been published but is said to be substantially better than for the predecessor drugs.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was “too early to make any conclusions about how effective this intervention is,” since it was tested in only two people.

Still, there is interest in scaling it up.

Monoclonal antibodies produced by pharmaceutical companies for use in treating cancer or other diseases are typically made in genetically engineered cells of mammals grown in vats. But Mapp chose to use plants instead because large quantities can potentially be produced more quickly and cheaply.

About 15 years ago, it was thought that genetically engineered crops would be widely used to produce human proteins for use as drugs. When Dr. Whaley and Dr. Zeitlin were both researchers at Johns Hopkins University in 1998, they published a paper with Monsanto scientists about a soybean genetically engineered to produce an antibody against genital herpes. But that idea has largely been abandoned, especially when it comes to using food crops, because of concerns that drugs produced in crops might inadvertently get into someone’s cornflakes.

Even so, research has continued, funded by the Defense Department, on quickly producing proteins in tobacco plants that are grown inside buildings.

“You can start making protein within a matter of days,” said Robert L. Erwin, president of iBio, another company that is working on this technology.

Still, it seems that this product will take several months to produce in any quantity. The capacity of the Kentucky facility is small, meant to support only the small scale human safety tests that Mapp had been planning. The tobacco plants have to be grown for about a month before they can be infected with the antibody gene and the proteins have to be harvested and purified.

“Starting from zero and going to 60 is not so easy, but once you’re at sixty you can keep going at that rate,” Dr. Whaley said. He would not say how many doses could be made and how quickly.

Dr. Fauci of the infectious diseases institute said officials had been told it would be a moderate amount even after several months. “You’re not talking about thousands of doses or even hundreds of doses,” he said.

But there are some other companies that can also make drugs in tobacco, including Caliber, which has a larger capacity than the Kentucky facility. So the government is exploring using them to supplement production.

“We told them we have the capacity and are ready,” said Dr. Holtz of Caliber. He said that together Caliber and the Kentucky facility of Reynolds could produce large quantities in six months.

Dr. Michael V. Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has responded on the ground to Ebola outbreaks, said the use of ZMapp for the two Americans raised some concerns given the limited existing supply. “What was the prioritization that allowed these patients to be treated?” he said.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the reason was that Samaritan’s Purse, the organization that employed one of the aid workers, contacted the Centers for Disease Control, which in turn referred them to National Institutes of Health, which in turn referred them to Mapp.

Doing clinical trials in Africa will likely require approvals from authorities there. And treating large numbers of patients with ZMapp, which needs to be given intravenously, could be difficult.

“What can you give in an austere treatment environment where there is very little nursing care?” asked Dr. Callahan. Authorities, along with the San Diego biotech company, are trying to figure it all out. Dr. Zeitlin said, “We’re kind of in uncharted territory here.”

Fighting Ebola for Us All

On July 23, Dr. Kent Brantly woke up with a fever. He immediately quarantined himself, and three days later a test confirmed his nightmare. He had the Ebola virus.

Brantly, 33, emailed a friend and said that he was “terrified,” for he knew better than anyone the horror of the virus. He had been treating patients in West Africa with it for many weeks, watching as they vomited, hemorrhaged internally and sometimes bled from multiple orifices — then weakened and died.

Some people have blamed Brantly and another American missionary infected, Nancy Writebol, for bringing the danger to themselves, even objecting to their return to Atlanta to be treated for the disease at Emory University Hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/us/nancy-writebol-kent-brantly-ebola-atlanta.html]. For example, Donald Trump argued that Brantly and Writebol should not be brought back to the United States because of the risks involved.

“People that go to far away places to help out are great — but must suffer the consequences!” Trump said on Twitter[https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/495379061972410369].

On the contrary, this Ebola outbreak underscores why we have not only a humanitarian interest in addressing global health, but also a national interest in doing so. Brantly and Writebol are moral leaders in this effort and underscore the practical imperative of tackling global contagions early on. They deserve our gratitude and admiration because in Liberia they were protecting us as well as Liberians.

The human mind is very sensitive to threats from the likes of Al Qaeda. We are less attuned to public health threats, even those that claim more lives: Some 15,000 people with AIDS still die in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s better to address a contagious disease at its source rather than allow it to spread.

“If we don’t fight to contain it there, we’re going to fight to contain it somewhere else,” notes Ken Isaacsof Samaritan’s Purse[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/samaritans-purse-doctor-serving-in-liberia-west-africa-tests-positive-for-ebola/], the Christian aid group for which Brantly works.

The World Bank has pledged $200 million[http://www.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/en/news/press-release/2014/08/04/ebola-world-bank-group-mobilizes-emergency-funding-for-guinea-liberia-and-sierra-leone-to-fight-epidemic] to try to control the Ebola outbreak, but a tiny fraction of that sum might have contained it early on.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., cites an American-backed program in Uganda to train health workers to diagnose and contain Ebola. It worked. In 2011, a 12-year-old girl there caught the Ebola virus and died from it[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/9/11-1536_article] — but no one else was infected. It was an exceptionally rare Ebola episode that stopped after just a single case.

A similar program in West Africa might likewise have limited the human and financial cost of this outbreak, Frieden noted, adding: “An outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere.”

This isn’t true only of the Ebola virus. Frieden recalls caring in New York for a patient from India with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, a complex case that cost $100,000 to cure. Later, a program was set up in the patient’s native village that could have resolved the case early for $10.

New York hospitals have been on alert for Ebola[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/new-york-hospital-patient-tests-negative-ebola], but diagnosis and segregation are complicated. I know because I was once such a suspected case.

Years ago, when I lived in Japan, I returned to Tokyo from Congo at the time of an Ebola outbreak there. One night a week later, I came down with a high fever[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/30/weekinreview/correspondence-sick-in-tokyo-i-lived-to-tell-about-japan-s-medical-miracle.html]. It felt like malaria, so I made inquiries about what hospital in Tokyo could best treat malaria the next day.

The health authorities heard “Congo” and “fever” and sent an ambulance staffed with people in what looked like spacesuits to rush me to a hospital. My neighbors were taken aback by the scene.

But, at the hospital, the emergency room night doctor knew nothing about tropical diseases. He poked me a bit, shrugged and told me to go home. (The next day, I confirmed that it was malaria.)

So don’t see Brantly and Writebol as reckless curiosities who somehow brought Ebola upon themselves. See them as leaders on the front line of an effort to help and protect Americans and Africans alike. We sometimes forget that health workers can brave significant risks — of infection with H.I.V., with tuberculosis, or even with the Ebola virus. Indeed, the staff treating Brantly and Writebol in Atlanta volunteered for that duty[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/kent-brantley-nancy-writebol-ebola-treatment-atlanta.html], and some offered to cancel vacation plans to help.

Bravo to them, and to so many health workers in Africa[http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20010218mag-ebola.html] and America who try to halt the spread of disease — because it’s where humanitarian interests and national interests coincide.

“It’s natural to feel sorry for Kent” Brantly, a former medical school professor of his, Richard Gunderman, wrote in The Indianapolis Star[http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2014/08/01/fighting-survive-ebola-doctor-indy-answered-call-serve/13466427/]. “But I wonder if Kent wouldn’t turn this around. Instead, he might feel sorry for some of us, at least those of us shaking our heads in dismay at anyone who would travel halfway across the world to do what he did. A ship may be safest in harbor, but that is not what ships are for.”

Ebola worries intrude on Africa summit; Obama vows partnership as continent’s leaders meet American investors

The giant game of ‘‘Let’s Make a Deal’’ that President Obama convened here has brought together nearly 50 African leaders with American investors for what he promised would be a long-term and mutually beneficial partnership. ‘‘Africa,’’ the president said on Wednesday, ‘‘will help shape the world as never before.’’

But Mr. Obama also addressed a cloud that had been hanging over the conference, the Ebola outbreak that has hit West Africa hard. He said the United States and its partners would ‘‘continue to do whatever we can’’ to help, and ‘‘stand with the people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.’’

The summit meeting, lasting three days, is the first in Washington dedicated to African leaders. And as the gathering neared its end, former President George W. Bush also made a rare return to the capital, on the sidelines of the gathering, to rally leaders behind a public-health campaign to conquer killer diseases in Africa and to forecast what he called ‘‘the beginning of the end of AIDS.’’

For Mr. Obama, the son of a Kenyan economist, the event represented his most ambitious attempt to cement his legacy as an American leader who cares about the African continent.

‘‘Our entire trade with all of Africa is still only about equal to our trade with Brazil,’’ the president said in a session on Tuesday. ‘‘I want Africans buying more American products; I want Americans buying more African products. I know you do, too.’’

The African leaders seemed gratified by Mr. Obama’s sales pitch, which was echoed by a roster of boldface names from the business world, including the chief executives of General Electric, Coca-Cola and IBM, and private-equity titans from Blackstone and the Carlyle Group.

But some of the African leaders took umbrage to questions about Ebola and the security threat from Boko Haram and other Islamist militant groups.

Tanzania’s president, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, noting that his country is in East Africa, said on Tuesday that too often ‘‘the whole of the African continent is perceived as if everywhere, everybody is suffering from Ebola.’’

The presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone canceled their visits to the meeting to deal with the outbreak. On Monday, American health officials met quietly at the State Department and with African officials from the affected countries to discuss their responses to the virus.

Mr. Kikwete played down a question from Charlie Rose of CBS News about the threat posed by militants. That drew a sharp retort from President Moncef Marzouki of Tunisia, who cited continuing violence in Sudan and northern Mali, saying, ‘‘We have to face the problems, but we have to work together.’’

Mr. Obama, keeping his focus on investment, announced $12 billion in new funding for the administration’s Power Africa initiative, which aims to provide electricity to households across sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. Obama said he had tripled the program’s goal of reaching 60 million households.

Electric demands have been soaring amid strong economic growth in several countries. President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana, where economic growth has exceeded 7 percent, said in an interview that power demand there was growing by 10 percent a year.

With a narrative that has shifted from war and poverty to growth and development, Mr. Obama extolled Africa as an enticing opportunity. Though he did not mention China, he drew a clear distinction between the American approach and that of China, which has spent lavishly in Africa to lock up sources of minerals.

‘‘We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,’’ Mr. Obama said. ‘‘We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents.’’

While the mood at the conference was buoyant, some guests turned the tables on the United States. Mo Ibrahim, a Sudan-born cellphone tycoon, complained that American companies used legal techniques to dodge taxes in Africa.

‘‘Can you please also pay your taxes?’’ he said. ‘‘If you want to succeed long-term, you have to do clean business.’’

Mr. Bush’s public-policy institute teamed up with Michelle Obama and the State Department to host a daylong forum Wednesday on education and health with the spouses of African leaders. Mr. Bush has made fighting AIDS in Africa one of his biggest priorities; his wife, Laura, also took part in the program at the Kennedy Center.

He said the battle against AIDS could be focused with better data, better treatment options and better prevention to ‘‘reach and help the highest-risk regions and groups.’’ He also urged African leaders to avoid discrimination that makes public-health efforts harder, although he did not specifically mention laws like the one overturned by a court in Uganda last week criminalizing homosexuality.

Sierra Leone to deploy military to enforce Ebola quarantine

Faced with a widening crisis over the spread of the Ebola virus, Sierra Leone’s government has said it will deploy hundreds of troops and police officers to ensure that patients and family members who may be infected remain isolated.

A battalion, consisting of 750 soldiers, will be sent to clinics housing Ebola patients in areas where the disease is most virulent, and the police presence will be reinforced at homes where family members are at risk of having contracted it, Abdulai Baratay, a government spokesman, said on Tuesday.

Sierra Leone has become the center of the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola, which has instilled fear across West Africa and has spread to four countries. Sierra Leone, a country of 5.7 million, has recorded the highest number of cases, 646, and the second-highest deaths, 273.

The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the death toll in the four West African countries — Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria — had risen to at least 932, The Associated Press reported. Among the latest fatalities was an unidentified Nigerian nurse who treated an Ebola patient, the second death from the disease in Nigeria.

Also on Wednesday, the Spanish Defense Ministry said a medically equipped Airbus 310 was preparing to fly to Liberia to bring home a Spanish missionary priest, Miguel Pajares, who had tested positive for the virus and was being kept in isolation in a Monrovia hospital, The A.P. said.

The mortality rate from the disease is so high, up to 90 percent, that many across the region refuse to accept that Ebola is present.

Several cases have been recorded here of families entering clinics to remove relatives with the disease and not abiding by new rules quarantining households — forbidding the coming and going of visitors — where there have been Ebola patients. The deployment of soldiers and police officers is intended to combat such actions, government spokesmen said.

The military and police mission also appears to be a sign of the increasing anxiety of officials here, faced with a deadly tide that is intensifying, not diminishing. Monday was decreed a ‘‘stay at home day’’ in Sierra Leone, an interruption of normal life to bring home to a resistant population that it faces a deadly challenge.

‘‘Where there is a serious situation, the president can invoke military assistance to civil power,’’ Unisa Sesay, the president’s director of communications, said in an interview. ‘‘You have to understand that there has been a lot of lawlessness connected to this Ebola business.’’
