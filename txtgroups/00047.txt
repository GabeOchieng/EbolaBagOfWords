DAKAR, Senegal -- The little girl who became Mali's first Ebola case has died after a bus journey across two countries that likely exposed dozens of people to the virus, her family, officials and Malian news websites said Friday afternoon.

Shortly before her death was announced, the World Health Organization warned that the 2-year-old girl had been bleeding from the nose when her grandmother picked her up in Guinea for a trip across hundreds of miles to Mali. That trip, health officials suggested in unusually blunt language, poses a significant risk for both nations, but especially Mali, which has now become the sixth West African nation to record a case of the disease.

''W.H.O. is treating the situation in Mali as an emergency,'' the agency said in a news release Friday afternoon. ''The child's symptomatic state during the bus journey is especially concerning, as it presented multiple opportunities for exposures -- including high-risk exposures -- involving many people.''

Dozens of contacts are now being traced, but it is unlikely that everybody who encountered the child on public transportation will be identified.

In addition, Mali, one of the poorest nations in one of the world's most impoverished regions, is as ill-prepared to contain Ebola as its regional neighbors already battling the disease. It has weak institutions and infrastructure, made worse after two years of upheaval, which forced tens of thousands of citizens to flee their homes. Many citizens are still displaced. A coup in 2012, an Islamist takeover of much of the country, foreign military intervention, and renewed questions about the probity of the new government leave Mali potentially exposed to an extensive outbreak of the disease.

The girl's grandmother had traveled from Mali to attend a funeral in Kissidougou in Guinea's Forest Region, the cradle of the current outbreak. The funeral was possibly for the girl's mother, who might have died of Ebola, according to the W.H.O.

The stock market closed out its best week in nearly two years on a positive note Friday, helped by strong quarterly earnings from Microsoft and other big companies.

After weeks of speculation over the fate of Europe's economy, Ebola fears and plunging oil prices, investors appeared to get back to basics. Wall Street is in the middle of one of the busiest times of the year -- when companies report their quarterly results. What drives stock prices higher is the potential for a company to earn more, so higher profits generally mean higher stock prices.

''What matters most to the market are earnings expectations and corporate fundamentals, and so far they're looking pretty good,'' said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.

Profits for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are up 5.6 percent from a year ago this earnings season, according to FactSet. That growth is better than the 4.6 percent increase the market was expecting.

Quarterly results from Microsoft and UPS helped lift stocks Friday, but there have been other strong reports this week. Caterpillar, 3M and Apple have come in well above expectations.

Microsoft's sales and profits were also well above analysts' forecasts. Cloud services, a business the company has focused on, also grew. Microsoft rose $1.11, or 2.5 percent, to $46.13.

UPS also reported strong results and expected December shipments to rise 11 percent from a year ago. Many investors consider UPS a bellwether for the health of the economy, particularly during the crucial holiday shopping season. UPS rose 11 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $100.59.

Investors were even able to set aside the dismal third-quarter results from Amazon, which reported a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss despite soaring sales. The company has been unable to deliver profits even as it gains ground as one of the world's largest retail companies. Amazon fell $26.12, or 8 percent, to $287.06.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 127.51 points, or 0.8 percent, to 16,805.41. The S.&P. 500 added 13.76 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,964.58. The Nasdaq rose 30.92 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,483.72.

The S.&P. 500 rose 4.1 percent for the week, its biggest gain since January 2013. But volatility can go both ways. The market plunged just as sharply last week as it rose this week. The index is still down 0.4 percent for October.

''We've seen the market sell off and we saw people buy on the bounce, and that looks like it will continue,'' said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial.

Investors are turning their focus to next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting for hints about the future of the central bank's bond purchases and its short-term interest rates.

The bond-buying program has kept long-term rates extremely low to encourage investment and hiring. Recent mixed signals about the strength of the recovery have prompted speculation that the Fed might let the program continue for longer than previously anticipated.

The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32 to 100 29/32, and its yield fell to 2.27 percent from 2.28 percent Thursday.

Investors will also get more quarterly results from American companies next week, when 159 members of the S.&P. 500 report. Those companies include Merck, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Visa.

The price of oil fell Friday on further evidence of ample supplies and weak demand. Benchmark United States crude fell $1.08 to close at $81.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, fell 70 cents to close at $86.13 in London.

When Dr. Thomas M. Kerkering of Virginia Tech's Carilion School of Medicine returned in late September after volunteering at an Ebola treatment clinic in Sierra Leone, he adhered closely to the routine established by other medical professionals.

He checked his temperature twice a day and avoided shaking hands with people and hugging even family members. But he also went out for hamburgers with his wife, bought groceries and browsed at a bookstore.

Now, that code of behavior -- cautious but hardly constrained -- is being second-guessed by elected officials and others as the authorities scramble to respond to news that a New York City doctor contracted the deadly virus while working in Guinea and traveled around the city after his return.

On Friday, in a surprising move, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey imposed a mandatory quarantine on individuals arriving at two area airports who have had direct contact with those infected with Ebola, including health workers.

Among medical professionals who have been fighting Ebola in West Africa, the restrictions only intensified the debate. While a few of those interviewed said an overabundance of caution was welcome, the vast majority said that restrictions like those adopted by New York and New Jersey could cripple volunteers' efforts at the front lines of the epidemic.

Although the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sets the baseline for recommended standards on Ebola, state and local officials have the prerogative to tighten the regimen as they see fit.

Dr. Rick Sacra, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was flown back to the United States to be treated in September, said he believed that the new rules in New Jersey and New York would reduce the number of people willing to volunteer their time to treat Ebola patients.

He said many doctors and nurses who volunteered would spend about three weeks in Africa and then return to their regular jobs. The requirement that they be quarantined at home upon their return ''will effectively double the burden on those people, on the loss of productive time,'' Dr. Sacra said.

''They are the authorities,'' he added. ''They have their rationale. They sometimes can't base their decisions only on the science.''

Part of the issue, several doctors said in interviews on Friday, is that there is no standard protocol for health care workers returning from Ebola-affected countries. Some doctors returned to seeing patients, while others were told to stay away from their hospitals in large metropolitan areas for 21 days, which is believed to be the maximum incubation period for the virus.

The group Doctors Without Borders requires all health care workers returning from affected countries to follow a series of instructions, in hopes of identifying the illness as soon as it develops: Returning staff members must take their temperatures twice a day; be on the lookout for symptoms of Ebola; stay within four hours of a hospital with the ability to isolate patients with the disease; and finish their course of preventive malaria treatment, because symptoms of malaria can mimic Ebola's.

But beyond that, returning workers are permitted to resume their normal activities, since a person without symptoms of the disease cannot transmit it. ''Self-quarantine is neither warranted nor recommended when a person is not displaying Ebola-like symptoms,'' the organization said in a statement on Thursday.

Doctors Without Borders does ask workers not to return to work for 21 days, however, both because they need to rest and because of the risk of contracting an illness that could generate symptoms easily mistaken for Ebola.

In a statement on Friday, the group said it was still reviewing the New York and New Jersey guidelines.

The International Medical Corps, which has about 300 workers caring for patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone -- including 30 who come from outside West Africa -- follows similar guidelines. Health care workers are given a thorough medical examination before they leave for West Africa, to ensure they are healthy enough to go. They are closely monitored while they are working, to be sure they follow the proper safety protocols. They are assessed for risk before returning to the United States. Once they are back, the workers are asked to monitor their temperatures and be alert for symptoms for 21 days. But they need not confine themselves to home.

Some groups have adopted more restrictive measures. SIM USA, a Christian aid group that had two workers who contracted Ebola and survived, has been temporarily housing returning personnel in an RV park on the grounds of its campus in Charlotte, N.C. Three of those workers were quarantined because they had known contact with one of the people who contracted Ebola, but the others -- about a dozen -- stayed there out of caution.

Kelly Sites, 48, a registered nurse from Central Michigan who does disaster response work for another group, Samaritan's Purse, is in her second stint in Liberia, helping to open a clinic in the southern part of the country to treat Ebola patients. She came back from her previous trip, working in an Ebola isolation unit in Monrovia, in July.

Ms. Sites, who is married and has 16-year-old twins, said that when she returned from Liberia the last time, she underwent a ''mandatory 21-day isolation.'' She lived at home and could talk to and even hug family members, but nothing more.

Ms. Sites said she thought a quarantine period was ''probably necessary to keep people safe.''

''You don't mess around with Ebola,'' she said in an email.

But Dan Kelly, 33, an infectious disease doctor and a founder of Wellbody Alliance, a nonprofit organization working in Sierra Leone, criticized the governors' response as knee-jerk.

''I think we are just digging the grave deeper,'' he said in a telephone interview from Freetown, the capital. ''Come on, that's exactly the move to push people away from going to Sierra Leone and other affected areas. It's going to escalate the epidemic and not help solve the crisis.''

He added: ''If we're going to get in front of it, we need health care workers from abroad. They cannot feel shunned or discriminated against.''

Putin Lashes Out at U.S. for Backing 'Neo-Fascists' and 'Islamic Radicals'

MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday unleashed perhaps his strongest diatribe against the United States yet, using an international meeting of Russia experts to sell Moscow's view that American meddling has sparked most of the world's recent crises, including those in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Instead of supporting democracy and sovereign states, Mr. Putin said during a three-hour appearance at the conference, the United States supports ''dubious'' groups ranging from ''open neo-fascists to Islamic radicals.''

''Why do they support such people,'' he asked the annual gathering known as the Valdai Club, which met this year in the southern resort town of Sochi. ''They do this because they decide to use them as instruments along the way in achieving their goals, but then burn their fingers and recoil.''

The goal of the United States, he said, was to try to create a unipolar world in which American interests went unchallenged.

Since Russia granted asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the American intelligence contractor, and the crisis in Ukraine, President Obama has increased pressure on the Kremlin, lumping Russia together with Ebola and terrorism as key threats to world stability. Washington has pushed its Western allies for a series of economic sanctions against Russia, resulting in cuts to financing from Western banks and halted oil exploration projects.

''We are at a dangerous point where on both sides, unilateral grievances have thoroughly spilled over into very, very emotional policies toward each other,'' said Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based risk analysis organization, who was at the meeting.

''I think it is on a new level of acrimony,'' Mr. Kupchan said of Mr. Putin's speech. ''I think this is a genuine message that 'Enough is enough, and I don't like being grouped with Ebola and I don't like these sanctions.' ''

Russia is often accused of provoking the crisis in Ukraine by annexing Crimea, and of prolonging the agony in Syria by helping to crush a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, Moscow's last major Arab ally. Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Putin seeks to restore the lost power and influence of the Soviet Union, or even the Russian Empire, in a bid to prolong his own rule.

Mr. Putin, however, specifically denied trying to restore the Russian Empire. He argued Russia was compelled to intervene in Ukraine because that country was in the midst of a ''civilized dialogue'' over its political future when the West staged a coup to oust the president last February, pushing the country into chaos and civil war.

''We did not start this,'' he said. ''Statements that Russia is trying to reinstate some sort of empire, that it is encroaching on the sovereignty of its neighbors, are groundless.''

Mr. Putin also disagreed with remarks by a senior Kremlin aide that Russia could not exist without the president, comments that provoked a mocking reaction on social media and elsewhere.

Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a deputy chief of staff, had told the conference that any attack on Mr. Putin was an attack on Russia. ''There is Putin, there is Russia,'' Mr. Volodin was quoted as saying in the Russian news media during a closed session at Sochi. ''No Putin, no Russia.''

The president himself rejected the formula, saying in response to a question about it, ''Russia will, of course, do without the likes of me.''

Speaking in Sochi, Russia, to a panel of Russia experts, President Vladimir V. Putin, center, blamed the United States for prompting the recent crises in Ukraine and the Middle East. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MIKHAIL KLIMENTIEV/RIA NOVOSTI/KREMLIN)

Officials Soothe Fears, While Workers Sanitize Infected Doctor's Path

Less than 24 hours after the first diagnosis of Ebola in New York City, worries about a public panic were already giving way to a desire to restore order as quickly as possible.

While city officials were doing their best, through words and deeds, to allay fears, health officials and cleaning crews were rushing to reopen the businesses that Dr. Craig Spencer had patronized since his return last week from treating Ebola patients in Guinea. At the apartment building in Harlem where he lives with his fiancée, workers in protective suits removed personal items and placed them in big, blue barrels set on a gray tarpaulin in the hallway.

City Councilman Mark Levine, who represents that part of Harlem, said that the crew was trying to make the apartment habitable by Friday night. He said a contractor hired by the city was sanitizing the rooms and disposing of sheets, towels and toothbrushes as if they were medical waste.

''It's a pretty involved process,'' Mr. Levine said in an interview. ''Speaking optimistically, when Dr. Spencer gets better and/or if his fiancée chooses to come home, the goal would be that the apartment would be ready for someone to live in as soon as tonight.''

A neighbor who lives across the hall from the couple, Ricqui Lawrence, 54, said the cleanup crew had told residents it was safe to stay in the building. But Mr. Lawrence said he had taken some precautions of his own: He cleaned the floor in the hallway with bleach, as well as the elevator buttons, Dr. Spencer's doorknob and his own doorknob.

''Beyond that,'' Mr. Lawrence said, ''I'm not going to freak out about it. I was a germaphobe, so I'm still a germaphobe. That's not going to change.''

But he added that at least one of his neighbors on the fifth floor had temporarily moved out of the building. ''She has two small children,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''That's reasonable.''

On Friday evening, Dr. Spencer remained in isolation on the seventh floor at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. His fiancée, Morgan Dixon, and two of their friends were under quarantine, city health officials said.

The governors of New York and New Jersey announced on Friday afternoon that anybody who had had direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa would be quarantined upon arrival at Kennedy or Newark Liberty International Airports.

But most New Yorkers were sticking to their routines and looking forward to the weekend -- even at places Dr. Spencer had visited before he fell ill. Health officials said Dr. Spencer traveled by subway to the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on Tuesday and walked on the High Line elevated park. On Wednesday, they said, he went to the Gutter, a bowling alley in Brooklyn.

At the Blue Bottle Coffee stand on the High Line, where Dr. Spencer stopped on Tuesday, several people were queued up for coffees. An employee, who declined to identify himself, would say only, ''We're all fine here.''

At the Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village, where officials said Dr. Spencer ate on Tuesday, a sign on the door announced that the restaurant was closed for lunch. David Brand, 27, a social work student at New York University, said he could ''see the headlines writing themselves already,'' given the spherical theme of the bowling alley and the meatball shop and the phonetic likeness of bowling and balls to Ebola.

''It's too bad for those businesses that it's become a circus,'' he said. ''People don't have information, and that just exacerbates the problem and'' -- he pointed to the pack of reporters and cameras outside the Meatball Shop -- ''that doesn't help.''

A spokesman for the restaurant said that the health department had assured the owners that Dr. Spencer's visit posed no health risk, but just to be safe, it closed voluntarily ''while it was cleaned and sanitized.'' The Meatball Shop intended to reopen for business on Friday night.

Across the East River, the Gutter also had closed upon learning that Dr. Spencer had been there shortly before getting sick. Around midday Friday, a doctor from the city's health department, Don Weiss, stood with the Gutter's owner, Todd Powers, in front of the bowling alley's entrance to declare that ''there is no risk of Ebola here.''

''We came to see that there was no exposure -- meaning there was no bodily fluids that were here. We confirmed that,'' Dr. Weiss said.

Mr. Powers said he would have the Gutter thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. ''Once that's taken care of, we'll open the doors to the public and we hope the mayor and governor come down and bowl,'' he said. He did not specify when the Gutter would reopen.

Health Officials Expect to Start Vaccine Trials in West Africa as Early as December

Public health authorities said on Friday that they hoped to begin trials of Ebola vaccines in disease-ravaged West Africa as early as December and could know around April whether they were effective, clearing the way for possible mass inoculations to stem the epidemic.

''Vaccine is not the magic bullet,'' Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny of the World Health Organization said at a news conference in Geneva. ''But when ready, they may be a good part of the effort to turn the tide of this epidemic.''

Dr. Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation for the organization, spoke on Friday about the conclusions of a meeting the day before where government officials, drug companies and others discussed how to test and possibly deploy vaccines most effectively.

Trials in December would be a month earlier than Dr. Kieny had indicated earlier this week. Manufacturers have committed to having millions of vaccine doses available in 2015, with hundreds of thousands ready halfway through the year, she said.

''All previous plans are changing from week to week, and always to a greater involvement and a greater mobilization of all efforts to have more vaccine available more quickly,'' Dr. Kieny said.

Some health experts say that an effective vaccine might now represent the best hope because it has been difficult to slow the spread of the disease using conventional public health measures like isolating patients and tracing their contacts. Efforts are being made to intensify those conventional methods, however, such as building new treatment centers to handle more patients.

Dr. Kieny said a decision to start mass vaccinations later in 2015 would depend on whether one or more vaccines proved safe and effective, whether there would be enough vaccine available and whether that strategy would be necessary.

Two experimental vaccines are already being tested for safety in healthy volunteers in the United States and other countries outside the outbreak region. One is being developed by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline and the other by the Canadian government and NewLink Genetics. At least five other vaccines could begin human testing in early 2015, Dr. Kieny said.

If the two most advanced vaccines prove safe in initial testing, trials would begin in Liberia and Sierra Leone to see if the vaccines could actually prevent people from getting Ebola.

Dr. Kieny's announcement provided few details of the trials, which she said were still subject to change. But her comments were consistent with plans discussed Thursday by a United States government official who requested anonymity.

Participants in the trials would include health care workers, who are at high risk of getting infected. But a trial in Liberia would likely include others at high risk, such as burial workers or family members caring for those with Ebola.

The study in Liberia would randomize volunteers to receive the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, the NewLink vaccine or a vaccine for some other disease -- essentially a placebo in terms of preventing Ebola. About 9,000 volunteers would participate in each of the three arms of the study, the federal official said.

In the Sierra Leone trial, everyone at a particular site would be offered vaccination. But different centers would receive the vaccines at different times, allowing comparison of disease rates between sites based on when they received the vaccination. In that trial no one would receive a placebo.

That trial, being planned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is expected to test the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine but might include others.

Dr. Kieny said that at some point there would also be a trial in Guinea, the third of the three countries most affected by the outbreak.

Some critics have said it would be unethical to offer health care workers treating Ebola patients a placebo. But others have argued that because it is unknown whether the vaccine works, there is no advantage to getting the vaccine instead of the placebo.

Dr. W. Ripley Ballou, who heads the Ebola vaccine effort at GlaxoSmithKline, said that a randomized trial against placebo ''gets a definitive answer as quickly as possible'' about whether a vaccine is effective, which is in the best interest of the community as a whole.

The meeting Thursday also included discussions of how to pay for the trials and possible vaccine deployment. Dr. Kieny said money could come from donor countries like the United States and Britain, from the World Bank and others. She added that there was a ''broad understanding that money will not be an issue.''

Dr. Kieny said that discussions were also under way about indemnifying vaccine manufacturers, because the vaccines would be deployed with much less than the usual testing. That might be a fund to compensate people who suffer side effects from a vaccine, so manufacturers would not bear that financial risk.

The Robot in the Cloud: A Conversation With Ken Goldberg
By QUENTIN HARDY
1095 words

NYT Blogs

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
Ken Goldberg has been thinking hard about robots for almost three decades.

His work ranges from over 170 peer-reviewed papers on things like robot algorithms and social information filtering to art projects about the interaction of people and machines. A professor at the University of California, Berkeley, he is establishing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/science/new-research-center-aims-to-develop-second-generation-of-surgical-robots.html?_r=0] a research center to develop medical robots to assist in surgery. That is just the latest development in what he thinks will be one of the great technology breakthroughs of our age: the fusing of robotics and cloud computing. He talks about it in this edited and condensed conversation.

Q.

What is cloud robotics?

A.

Cloud robotics is a new way of thinking about robots. For a long time, we thought that robots were off by themselves, with their own processing power. When we connect them to the cloud, the learning from one robot can be processed remotely and mixed with information from other robots.

Q.

Why is that a big deal?

A.

Robot learning is going to be greatly accelerated. Putting it a little simply, one robot can spend 10,000 hours learning something, or 10,000 robots can spend one hour learning the same thing.

Q.

How long has this been around?

A.

The term “cloud robotics” was coined[http://isdlab.aet.ntnu.edu.tw/roboticscloud/references/Robots%20With%20Their%20Heads%20in%20the%20Clouds.pdf] in 2010 by James Kuffner, who was at Carnegie Mellon and then went to Google. I had been doing robot control over the Internet since the mid-90s, with a garden people could connect to, then plant seeds or water their plants.

The cloud is different from my Internet “telegarden,” though. The cloud can have all the computation and memory stored remotely. That means all of the endpoints can be lightweight, and there is a huge collective benefit. These robots can address billions of behaviors and learn how to do important things quickly.

Q.

What are some examples of this?

A.

Google’s self-driving cars are cloud robots. Each can learn something about roads, or driving, or conditions, and it sends the information to the Google cloud, where it can be used to improve the performance of other cars.

Health care is also very promising: Right now radiation treatments involve putting a radioactive seed next to a tumor, using a catheter that has to push through other tissue and organs. The damage could be minimized if the catheter worked like a robot and had motion planning to avoid certain objects. Tedious medical work, like suturing a wound, might be done faster and better. Giving intravenous fluids to Ebola patients is difficult and risks contamination; some people are looking at ways a robot could sense where a vein is and insert the needle.

Another area is household maintenance, particularly with seniors. Robots could pick up clutter, which would help elderly people avoid falling and hurting themselves.

Q.

Where are some of the most interesting developments?

A.

In about a year Google bought eight robotics companies. No one knows what they are doing. For sure, it’s not connected with cars; I have students in both the robotics and the self-driving car teams, and they’re not allowed to talk with each other. They may be trying to build a core operating system for robots, but that’s just a guess. They have collected some of the best minds in the field.

Another thing is Microsoft’s Kinect sensor[http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/kinect], which can sense and model objects in three dimensions. It costs about $100 and is getting cheaper. Very soon we’ll see 3-D sensors in every laptop, following your motions and modeling human faces. If lots of that information is shared in the cloud, it will be used to make robots more perceptive, able to deal with sensing and space better.

Q.

What are the risks?

A.

There are a lot. Obviously, if your household robot is hacked, you could have all of your personal data, like your house layout and where your valuables are, sent out around the world. Privacy is a worry there, too, particularly if you consider who may be selling the robots. War robots worry me, too. A drone attack in the U.S. would be terrifying.

Q.

Isn’t that how war works elsewhere already?

A.

Yes. But if it happened here, and people knew there were drones in the sky monitoring them, maybe able to take them out at any moment, everyone would feel vulnerable.

Q.

What are some things you learned about robots early on, which are still true?

A.

The telegarden had an insight I didn’t appreciate at the time, which was how social it was. There was a chat room and people interacting in the garden. More than 100,000 people visited. They could have planted seeds on top of each other, or over-watered someone’s plant, but mostly they didn’t. They watered for other people when those people went on vacation. Maybe that was because it was a garden.

More important was a philosophical question it raised. A student asked, “How do I know there is a garden there?” since that kind of thing can be easily spoofed. That’s when we got into the idea of tele-epistemology — how do we know that remote things, things done via robot, are true?

Q.

And?

A.

We don’t. It’s kind of like when the telescope was invented and people saw the moons of Jupiter, or the microscope showed microorganisms living on your hand. People began to wonder what else they didn’t see. The Internet garden reinvigorated that sense of doubt.

Q.

Are you saying we can learn from robots, too?

A.

For a robot, the world is uncertain and jagged. When it gets new information, it has to change what it thinks is true. You could say it’s good with doubt. Robots could teach us a lot about never finally believing your own perceptions.

Q.

Can we program a robot to behave ethically?

A.

I don’t think so. An ethical conflict is an exception. The idea that we can program a single answer is a mistake. There will still have to be human oversight. The hope is that realizing robots are prone to ethical failures will help us remember that we need to be careful, too.

Q.

Are there things robots will never be able to do?

A.

Since the first case of the Ebola virus in New York City was reported on Thursday, state, local and city officials have been scrambling to help contain the spread[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/new-york-ebola-case-craig-spencer.html] — and ease the fears — of the deadly disease.

7:01 P.M. | Ebola Patient’s Condition Worsens

Dr. Craig Spencer’s condition had deteriorated by Saturday evening, though he remained awake and communicative, health officials said[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patient-enters-next-more-serious-phase-of-illness-officials-say.html?ref=nyregion].

A spokeswoman for the city’s public hospital system said in a statement that Dr. Spencer, 33, was experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, which indicated he had entered “the next and more serious phase of his illness.”

The statement was careful not to convey any pessimism, and experts say that patients undergoing treatment can worsen before they recover.

In a brief telephone interview with The Times from his room at Bellevue, Dr. Spencer said simply, “I’m still undergoing treatment.”

Dr. Spencer has been in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center since Thursday, when he reported a 100.3 degree fever. Here is the timeline of his illness[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/ebola-patient-timeline.pdf] that was released by the city.

6:34 P.M. | Ebola Patient’s Fiancée Returns Home

Dr. Craig Spencer’s fiancée, Morgan Dixon, arrived at her home on West 147th Street shortly after 6:30 p.m. on Saturday.

Ms. Dixon, 30, had been at Bellevue Hospital Center since Thursday.

Two unmarked police cars escorted a sedan in which Ms. Dixon was riding to the building and three people led her inside. They were not wearing protective gear.

Ms. Dixon was one of three people quarantined because they had had close contact with Dr. Spencer, who tested positive for Ebola on Thursday. The other two people are Dr. Spencer’s friends.

Earlier on Saturday, the mayor told reporters that all three patients were not showing symptoms of the virus.

Ms. Dixon will remain under quarantine at her home through Nov. 14, officials said.

4:56 P.M. | Cuomo Responds to the Quarantined Nurse

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo dismissed the criticism of a nurse who was quarantined at a New Jersey hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-tests-negative-for-ebola.html?] after working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.

Cuomo on complaints from nurse quarantined in Newark: “None of this is pleasant. It’s not going to be pleasant for anyone.”

— Thomas Kaplan (@thomaskaplan)[http://www.twitter.com/thomaskaplan]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/thomaskaplan/status/526104886849851392]

The nurse, Kaci Hickox, complained about her treatment in an essay published on the website of The Dallas Morning News[http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece?] on Saturday.

Ms. Hickox characterized the quarantine as an overreaction, after an initial test found that she did not have Ebola. “I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa,” she wrote.

4:51 P.M. | Meet the “Reassurer in Chief”

On Saturday, The Times published a profile of Dr. Mary Travis Bassett[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/in-new-york-bringing-a-comforting-message-during-a-chaotic-time.html?ref=nyregion], the city’s health commissioner. Just nine months into her biggest job yet, Dr. Bassett had to announce the arrival of Ebola in New York City on Thursday.

Her message: The average New Yorker has nothing to fear from the virus.

3:39 P.M. | What Can You Do? Get a Flu Shot

The mayor urged New Yorkers to get flu shots to help reduce the number of false alarms as the city copes with Ebola:

Mayor de Blasio again asks NYers to get flu shots to take “false indicators off the table” and help narrow focus on possible Ebola cases.

— Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg)[http://www.twitter.com/mattfleg]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/mattfleg/status/526087138241417217]

3:29 P.M. | Advice From Cuomo: ‘Go About Your Business’

A day after announcing the new Ebola policy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo continued to campaign in Queens.

After a rally in Long Island City, Governor Cuomo was asked whether he was playing to people’s worst fears as the election approached.

This drew an unhappy response: “I said the exact opposite,” he said. “I took the subway yesterday to say, take the subway, it’s safe. I said there’s nothing to worry about. Go about your business. I’m going about my business today. Right? I’ve said it 11 times.”

Cuomo says it’s “obnoxious,” “irrational” and “irresponsible” to suggest he might be using the Ebola scare to his political advantage.

— Thomas Kaplan (@thomaskaplan)[http://www.twitter.com/thomaskaplan]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/thomaskaplan/status/526065213133447168]

He also said that officials had not discussed the possibility of travelers facing criminal charges if they refused to be quarantined.

— THOMAS KAPLAN

3:19 P.M. | Ebola Patient’s Close Contacts Showing No Symptoms

The mayor offered an update on the status of Dr. Spencer’s three close contacts.

Three close contacts of Dr. Spencer who were quarantined are not showing any Ebola symptoms, Mayor de Blasio says.

— Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg)[http://www.twitter.com/mattfleg]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/mattfleg/status/526079846607499265]

3:08 P.M. | De Blasio Defends Ebola Patient’s Behavior

“We’re having a meatball experience,” Mayor de Blasio said as he ate at the Meatball Shop with his wife and the city’s health commissioner.

After they ate, the mayor and the health commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett answered questions outside.

The mayor defended Dr. Craig Spencer’s behavior, despite Mr. Cuomo’s suggestion on Friday that he had failed to follow guidelines.

“Here is a doctor who volunteered to go into the medical equivalent of a war zone,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Dr. Bassett said that Dr. Spencer received antiviral drugs on his second day of hospitalization.

(There is also a plan in place for the administration of plasma, she said.)

Asked about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie’s announcement of new quarantine provisions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/new-york-ebola-case-craig-spencer.html] on Friday, the mayor said he was not consulted.

“There is inherent flexibility built into the approach,” he said of the governors’ plan, without directly answering a question about whether he supports it.

He said that “it’s a fair concern” as to whether the quarantine plan will have a chilling effect on healthcare workers volunteering.

— MATT FLEGENHEIMER

2:34 P.M. | The Mayor Repeats: Ebola Is Not Airborne

Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to soothe concerns over the presence of Ebola in the city by visiting the restaurant where Dr. Craig Spencer said he ate and offering “a reminder about some core truths about Ebola.”

“It cannot be contracted through casual contact. It is not an airborne disease,” he said, adding, “We’ve got to keep making clear to people, this is not the common cold, this is not the flu.”

— MATT FLEGENHEIMER

1:51 P.M. | De Blasio Arrives at the Meatball Shop

At around 1:45 p.m., Mayor Bill de Blasio strolled into the Meatball Shop with his wife, Chirlane McCray; the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett; and a group of aides, to meet with the restaurant’s owner and grab a bite.

Despite the crush of cameras, the establishment’s outdoor lunch crowd appeared unbothered: Many looked up briefly from their plates, before resuming their meals. The restaurant closed on Friday afternoon but reopened on Friday night at 6 p.m.

On Friday, a spokesman for the restaurant told The Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/from-bellevue-hospital-center-to-brooklyn-feeling-ebola-anxiety.html] that the health department had assured the owners that Dr. Spencer’s visit posed no health risk, but that it had closed voluntarily, just to be safe.

— MATT FLEGENHEIMER

1:31 P.M. | All Quiet at the Meatball Shop

1:28 P.M. | De Blasio Dispels Rumors About Bellevue

The mayor reassured the public that Bellevue Hospital Center was properly staffed.

Thank you to the staff at Bellevue Hospital for their commitment and professionalism. Contrary to media hype, the hospital is fully staffed.

— Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio)[http://www.twitter.com/BilldeBlasio]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/526058874575388674]

12:18 P.M. | The White House Speaks on Ebola

On Saturday, the president’s weekly address was about Ebola.

“I’ve assured Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio that they’ll have all the federal support they need.” —Obama: http://t.co/TeRHtxNr8B[http://t.co/TeRHtxNr8B] #Ebola

— The White House (@WhiteHouse)[http://www.twitter.com/WhiteHouse]25 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/526033041043374081]

11:49 A.M. | The Mayor and the Meatball Shop

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that on Saturday he would visit the Meatball Shop in the West Village, where Dr. Craig Spencer, the Ebola patient in New York, said he ate earlier this week.

Additionally on Saturday, disease investigators continued their search for anyone who had come into contact with Dr. Spencer.

11:26 A.M. | Nurse Tests Negative

Under the new order, a nurse who had recently worked with Ebola patients in West Africa was placed under quarantine shortly after she landed in Newark on Friday. She has tested negative for the Ebola virus, New Jersey officials said on Saturday.

11:21 A.M. | New Policies for Newark and J.F.K.

According to a new policy announced late Friday afternoon by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, all people entering the country through Newark Liberty and Kennedy International Airports will be quarantined[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/new-york-ebola-case-craig-spencer.html] if they had direct contact with Ebola patients in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Ask Well: Ebola Testing for All New Arrivals?

Q. Why isn’t everyone who arrives from West Africa immediately tested for Ebola? Why don’t we look at their blood under a microscope?

A. Unlike malaria and other diseases caused by worms, eggs and parasites, diseases like Ebola are caused by viruses, which are far too small to be seen under a conventional microscope.

There are blood tests for Ebola, but they are imperfect. And giving them to everyone arriving from West Africa might well backfire, some experts argue, because some new arrivals could pass the strictest test and then still fall ill days later. Because they had tested negative once, they could easily assume that symptoms like fever, nausea and diarrhea were just a flu. They could then potentially spread Ebola until they became so ill that they were forced to go to an emergency room. Because early treatment is important, it could also endanger their lives.

The difficulty is that Ebola has a relatively long incubation period.  Although most people show symptoms within four to seven days after infection, some do not show them for up to 21 days. Dr. Craig Spencer,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patient-enters-next-more-serious-phase-of-illness-officials-say.html] the physician who arrived in New York on Oct. 17, might have been able to pass an Ebola test that day. He did not detect a fever — a classic, although imperfect, warning sign — until Thursday.  Kaci Hickox[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-to-be-allowed-to-finish-ebola-quarantine-at-home-christie-says.html], the nurse who was forced into quarantine at Newark airport on Friday, despite having had a negative Ebola test, might still develop Ebola — or she might never.

There are rapid, cheap tests for Ebola, based on detecting antibodies to the virus, but they work only when a victim has already been ill for several days. Antibodies are produced by the body’s counterattack on the virus, and are therefore not detectable until that counterattack is well underway. By that time, the victim might have infected others.

A test called an RT-PCR, for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, detects bits of the RNA of the virus itself, so it can be used much earlier in the infection. In some cases, a very sensitive PCR test may detect the virus two days before fever and other symptoms appear. But there is no way to know which people will develop enough virus in their blood to detect soon after they are infected, and which will take many more days.

To be sure, people like Ms. Hickox would have to be tested every day or perhaps every other day until about 19 days after their last possible contact with an Ebola carrier.

That could be cumbersome and expensive. The tests cost $60 to $200 each and typically take about six hours, according to Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, an oncologist at Columbia University Medical School and author of “The Emperor of All Maladies,” who favors wider use.

On Saturday, the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval to a new PCR test that takes only an hour. But the machines that run it, and the disposable cartridges that blood samples are placed in, are not yet widely distributed.

Also, PCR tests are less than 100 percent accurate, so each test should be run twice — ideally by different laboratories.

Until recently, only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a few other medical school laboratories could do Ebola tests. Now every state health department laboratory can, and more hospitals are getting them.  But the tests are not something to be done on tabletops in airports by laypeople.  PCR tests are notorious for cross-contamination errors, and the blood of actual Ebola victims is extremely dangerous and must be treated as a biohazard.

Cuomo, Shifting His Policy on Outbreak, Opens Up Public Rift With de Blasio

Correction Appended

On Thursday night, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] sat beside Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per] at Bellevue Hospital Center as they offered soothing words to worried New Yorkers: New York City’s first case of Ebola, they said, was no reason for panic.

Less than 19 hours later, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, joined the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per], and struck a starkly different tone. The governors announced Friday that medical personnel returning to New York after treating Ebola patients in West Africa would be automatically subject to a 21-day quarantine.

The risk, Mr. Cuomo said, was grave. Offering an ominous hypothetical, he raised the precise situation that the mayor and the city’s health commissioner had tried to play down the night before: the danger of Ebola spreading through the subway system.

“In a region like this,” Mr. Cuomo said, “you go out one, two or three times, you ride the subway, you ride a bus, you could affect hundreds and hundreds of people.”

Beyond New York City, the Ebola outbreak has prompted Republicans to argue that it is further evidence of the Obama administration’s incompetence, and candidates like Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, to call for a ban on travel from the affected countries to the United States.

Within the city, an unexpected policy shift by Mr. Cuomo on Friday appeared to open up a public divide between the governor and the administration of Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett, was not informed in advance of the Cuomo-Christie mandatory quarantine order and was “furious,” a senior city official who spoke to her said.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, Melissa DeRosa, said city officials were not consulted about the quarantine policy because it pertained to airports that are run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Mr. Cuomo’s shift came just 11 days before he will be on the ballot seeking a second term, and on a day when his long-shot Republican challenger, Rob Astorino, seized on the city’s Ebola case to assail the governor for not closing the New York airports to travelers from affected West African nations.

Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, said Mr. Cuomo, along with President Obama, was “playing Russian roulette in the nation’s most clustered population center.”

Mr. Cuomo has prided himself on his handling of emergencies and other situations in which commanding leadership is called for. Before the current Ebola scare, Mr. Cuomo had started talking often about the threat of terrorism, an issue that he also has teamed with Mr. Christie to confront.

On Friday, after making the rounds of the morning news shows, Mr. Cuomo rode the subway to his news conference with Mr. Christie in Lower Manhattan, where he all but invited voters to judge him by his handling of the Ebola outbreak.

“For four years, I have erred on the side of caution whenever it has come to dealing with a crisis, and that has served the state well,” Mr. Cuomo said. He added that he was in the midst of “a situation that truly tests the capacity and the ability of government to perform.”

But Mr. Cuomo’s remarks at times veered beyond the facts, as when he criticized the New York patient with Ebola, Dr. Craig Spencer, accusing him of having failed to follow the protocols set by his organization, Doctors Without Borders.

“He’s a doctor, and even he didn’t follow the guidelines for the quarantine, let’s be honest,” Mr. Cuomo said. In fact, Doctors Without Borders said, Dr. Spencer had followed its guidelines. And he was not under quarantine.

(Earlier in the day, Dr. Bassett, the health commissioner, said in an interview that Dr. Spencer had “handled himself really well,” adding, “I don’t want anyone portraying him as reckless.”)

Outside New York, the Ebola outbreak is exacerbating the partisan fault lines that have defined President Obama’s second term.

The diagnosis in Dr. Spencer’s case produced a new round of calls to shut the country off from the source of the Ebola infection, and health care workers themselves have been criticized. At a House hearing on Friday, some lawmakers called for an immediate 21-day quarantine period for all doctors and service members who return to the United States after helping with the Ebola response in West Africa.

House Democrats asked administration officials whether they had committed enough military resources to the outbreak in Africa, while some Republicans questioned whether the military should be involved at all. Democrats defended the appointment of a Democratic adviser to manage the crisis; Republicans denounced him as unqualified.

Even the discussion of how to balance risk among those who have been exposed seemed politicized. Many on the left called for compassion and admiration for medical workers toiling in the field, while some on the right, including a doctor speaking on Fox News, argued that mixing with the public too soon after exposure was a public health menace.

The partisan divide over how to respond to Ebola stands in stark contrast to previous public health threats over the last decade, including the anthrax attacks after Sept. 11, 2001, the West Nile virus, the avian flu and the tuberculosis outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s. In those cases, public health officials worked largely in concert with elected ones to maintain calm and disseminate consistent information.

But there was no partisan divide between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie, who recounted on Friday how often they had spoken about the Ebola outbreak.

“I’m just happy that I have a partner like Governor Cuomo who understands these issues,” Mr. Christie said.

Correction: October 28, 2014, Tuesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s change in tone on handling potential Ebola cases referred incorrectly in some editions to an appearance by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mr. Cuomo at a news conference in Lower Manhattan on Friday night. Mr. Christie met Mr. Cuomo in Lower Manhattan; they did not ride the subway together to the event.

Ebola’s Information Paradox

ON Aug. 28, 1854, a 6-month-old girl known to history as “Baby Lewis” fell ill with cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in the London neighborhood of Soho, at that point one of the most densely populated, and poorest, neighborhoods in the city. Bacteria from her stool contaminated a well on Broad Street, and within a matter of days, the most terrifying outbreak of cholera in the history of London had erupted. By the time it ended, several weeks later, one-tenth of the neighborhood’s population had died.

The story of the Broad Street outbreak is perhaps the most famous case study in public health and epidemiology, in large part because it led to the revolutionary insight that cholera was a waterborne disease, not airborne as most believed at the time. But there is another element of the Broad Street outbreak that warrants attention today, as popular anxiety about Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] surges across the airwaves and subways and living rooms of the United States: not the spread of the disease itself, but the spread of information about the disease.

It was a full seven days after Baby Lewis became ill, and four days after the Soho residents began dying in mass numbers, before the outbreak warranted the slightest mention in the London papers, a few short lines indicating that seven people had died in the neighborhood. (The report understated the growing death toll by an order of magnitude.) It took two entire weeks before the press began treating the outbreak as a major news event for the city.

Within Soho, the information channels were equally unreliable. Rumors spread throughout the neighborhood that the entire city had succumbed at the same casualty rate, and that London was facing a catastrophe on the scale of the Great Fire of 1666. But this proved to be nothing more than rumor. Because the Soho crisis had originated with a single-point source — the poisoned well — its range was limited compared with its intensity. If you lived near the Broad Street well, you were in grave danger. If you didn’t, you were likely to be unaffected.

Compare this pattern of information flow to the way news spreads now. On Thursday, Craig Spencer, a New York doctor, was given a diagnosis of Ebola after presenting a high fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and the entire world learned of the test result within hours of the patient himself learning it. News spread with similar velocity several weeks ago with the Dallas Ebola victim, Thomas Duncan. In a sense, it took news of the cholera outbreak a week to travel the 20 blocks from Soho to Fleet Street in 1854; today, the news travels at nearly the speed of light, as data traverses fiber-optic cables. Thanks to that technology, the news channels have been on permanent Ebola watch for weeks now, despite the fact that, as the joke went on Twitter, more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died in the United States from Ebola.

As societies and technologies evolve, the velocities vary with which disease and information can spread. The tremendous population density of London in the 19th century enabled the cholera bacterium to spread through a neighborhood with terrifying speed, while the information about that terror moved more slowly. This was good news for the mental well-being of England’s wider population, which was spared the anxiety of following the death count as if it were a stock ticker. But it was terrible from a public health standpoint; the epidemic had largely faded before the official institutions of public health even realized the magnitude of the outbreak.

We hear it said constantly that modern society is uniquely vulnerable to the threat of a pandemic because of the global connectedness of air travel. Yet we rarely pause to consider the other side of our global connectedness: the speed of information, which has been increasing at a much faster rate over the past few decades than the speed of airplanes has. With the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, for instance, a virulent new strain of the flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] was identified in a rural Mexican community, and within a matter of days health organizations around the world had been notified, and were trained to identify the new virus.

Thanks both to technology and to the essential work of institutions like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we can alert the world to potential threats from a single smartphone. This is particularly true in countries, like the United States, with mature public health institutions, but it is also true in countries like Nigeria that were able to act quickly on early information about Ebola victims and contain the outbreak within weeks.

So this is the strange paradox of the modern epidemic: The speed of information is both our greatest defense against a true epidemic in a city like New York, and it is the source of constant, nagging anxiety that creates the — entirely incorrect — sense that we live in unusually perilous times. A New Yorker or Londoner is far less likely to perish from an epidemic disease than he or she would have been 150 years ago. We are vastly less at risk and at the same time we are more worried — for the same reason.

Information travels faster than viruses do now. This is why we are afraid. But this is also why we are safe.

Bellevue Hospital Center has long been on the front line of global health crises. But rising to the challenge of New York City’s first Ebola case may be the biggest test of the grit and adrenaline that saw it through the AIDS crisis, the Sept. 11 attack and Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

No place is better suited to the task of handling Ebola safely than the seventh-floor isolation unit where Dr. Craig Spencer, the Ebola patient, is being treated, according to doctors familiar with that special locked ward at Bellevue, a sprawling 22-story building in Manhattan that is the flagship of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the nation’s largest public hospital system.

The isolation ward was set up over 20 years ago amid a New York epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and its high-powered ventilation system, special antechambers and highly trained staff were key factors in rapidly containing the spread of TB in the city. Its success was part of what made the reputation of Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, now director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and then the head of the city health department’s TB bureau.

“They created an environment where it was safe to take care of these people,” said Dr. Eric Manheimer, formerly Bellevue’s medical director and the author of a recent book about the hospital. “They have a highly professional staff, dedicated people who aren’t scared of infectious disease.”

But for many of Bellevue’s 5,400 employees, anxiety about Ebola was still palpable on Friday. Georgiana Ochilly, 59, a veteran nurse, said the news that a highly trained doctor had failed to protect himself against the disease had some employees so worried that a few nurses sought to opt out of working on the seventh floor.

“We’re wondering how Ebola is being spread. Is it airborne? There is a lot of concern about it,” said Ms. Ochilly, of St. Albans, Queens, who was finishing a 12-hour shift around 8:30 a.m.

Unlike tuberculosis or flu, the Ebola virus is not airborne and is transmitted only through bodily fluids when an infected person begins to show symptoms. The hospital has a policy that no employees will be forced to work with a patient with the disease against their wishes, officials said, and so far none of the workers on the unit have opted out. Nurses are working in teams of two, one serving as a buddy watching the other, and taking turns in that role.

“We are limiting their work with protective gear to two to four hours max, depending on the job they are doing and their level of comfort,” Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said in an email.

Some of the anxiety comes from workers who have not received training because they will not be involved in Ebola patient care, said Lisa Baum, the occupational health and safety representative for the New York State Nurses Association, the nurses’ union, who has been working with management to prepare for Ebola for months.

In a telephone interview after a meeting of hospital managers and health care workers on Friday, Ms. Baum emphasized that the fear the disease provokes is understandable.

“While the Ebola virus is not as easy to get as, say, the flu virus, it is so dangerous and virulent that it is particularly frightening,” she said. “We want to make sure that workers have the optimum protection possible and that they are trained to a level of proficiency to where they feel safe.”

Ms. Baum said management had been very open to hearing from front-line workers who might point to ways that protocols could be improved, especially in preparing for more cases that could show up in the emergency room.

One suggestion from the union now under consideration, she said, is the hospital’s provision of dormitories for health care workers treating Ebola patients if they prefer to stay away from their families.

“Up to this point, things have gone very well,” she said.

For some, though not all employees, that openness has helped repair the distrust left in the aftermath of the hurricane two years ago, when Bellevue failed to evacuate ahead of the flood and gave rosy accounts of the situation at a time when staff members were carrying patients down dark stairwells, with river water lapping in the basement.

In an emailed statement, Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, the union that represents about 1,900 Bellevue employees, including nurse’s aides, laboratory and blue-collar workers, struck a note of pride.

“Our members have been on the job at New York City’s public hospitals and health care facilities during past public health emergencies — from the early days of AIDS and multidrug-resistant TB to Sept. 11, 2001, and most recently during Hurricane Sandy,” Ms. Roberts said. “As trained and seasoned health care employees, they have worked in difficult conditions before and are prepared to do so again now as part of their mission to safeguard the health of all New Yorkers.”

A building conceived in the 1950s, built in the ’60s and opened in the ’70s needs more than health care workers to keep it going, Dr. Manheimer said. It needs operations employees like the 25-year-old man who admitted that on Friday, “I woke up and said, ‘Do I go to work today?’ ”

But he did.

“One thing about Bellevue,” Dr. Manheimer said, “there’s a tremendous esprit under stress.”

A nurse who had recently worked with Ebola patients in West Africa and was placed under quarantine shortly after she landed in Newark on Friday under a new order by the governors of New York and New Jersey has tested negative for the Ebola virus, New Jersey officials said on Saturday.

The nurse, who had no symptoms when she landed at Newark Liberty International Airport[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/newark_liberty_international_airport_nj/index.html?inline=nyt-org] but developed a fever while quarantined there, will have additional tests to confirm that finding, the New Jersey Department of Health said in a statement. She was taken to University Hospital in Newark from the airport and will remain under mandatory quarantine for 21 days in accordance with the policy announced late Friday afternoon by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York and Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey.

The governors ordered quarantines for all people entering the country through Newark Liberty and Kennedy International Airport[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/kennedy_international_airport_nyc/index.html?inline=nyt-org] if they had direct contact with Ebola patients in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The announcement signaled an immediate shift in mood, since public officials had gone to great lengths to ease public anxiety after a New York City doctor received a diagnosis of Ebola on Thursday.

The new measures go beyond what federal guidelines require and what infectious disease experts recommend. They were also taken without consulting the city’s health department, according to a senior city official.

But both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie portrayed them as a necessary step. “A voluntary Ebola quarantine is not enough,” Mr. Cuomo said. “This is too serious a public health situation.”

In New York City, disease investigators continued their search for anyone who had come into contact with the city’s first Ebola patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, since Tuesday morning. Three people who had contact with Dr. Spencer, 33, have been quarantined, and investigators have compiled a detailed accounting of his movements in the days before he was placed in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center on Thursday.

He remained in stable condition on Friday, and doctors were discussing the use of various experimental treatments. He was able to talk on his cellphone and was even well enough to do yoga in his room, according to friends.

The new protocols at the airports, outlined by the governors in an afternoon news conference, raised a host of questions, including how the screening process would work and whom it would target. The two airports in question are Kennedy International and Newark.

Officials from New York and New Jersey said they were still working out many details, including where people would be quarantined, how the quarantine would be enforced and how they would handle travelers who do not live in either of those states.

The mandatory quarantine for nonsymptomatic travelers will last 21 days, the longest documented period it has taken for an infected person to show symptoms of the disease.

On Friday, the White House sidestepped questions about whether a nationwide quarantine of returning health care workers was being considered. Instead, officials defended the procedures the administration has put in place, including enhanced airport screenings and the monitoring of people arriving from Ebola-afflicted countries.

There was immediate concern that the move by New York and New Jersey might have an adverse effect on getting workers to West Africa, where more than 4,500 people have died of the virus and medical workers are in short supply.

The United Nations emergency Ebola mission says that 19,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics are needed by Dec. 1 and that it is nowhere near that number.

“We will not hesitate to take any action that we feel has the potential to fortify us against additional imported Ebola cases,” a senior Obama administration official said. “At the same time, we must do so in a manner that is coordinated and that minimizes any unintended consequences, including those that would hinder our ability to eliminate this threat at its source in West Africa.”

Mr. Christie, a Republican, said he and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had decided to take action because the federal guidelines were not strict enough. “We are no longer relying on C.D.C. standards,” he said, referring to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The C.D.C., in a terse statement, said that it would make its decisions based on the best available science but that the states were within their legal rights to institute the measures.

In New York City, health officials said that initial reports were incorrect when they indicated that Dr. Spencer had a 103-degree fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] when he notified the authorities of his ill health. He actually had only a 100.3 fever. Officials attributed the mistake to a transcription error and said the lower temperature made it highly unlikely that he could have spread the disease before going to the hospital. Still, out of caution, they were tracing his contacts back to Tuesday, the day he began feeling fatigued. Dr. Spencer had been working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, treating Ebola patients, before leaving Africa on Oct. 14 and returning to New York on Oct. 17.

Since March, three international staff members and 21 locally employed staff members of Doctors Without Borders have fallen ill while battling the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, according to the group. Thirteen have died.

As a hazardous material team arrived at Dr. Spencer’s apartment in Harlem to sanitize the residence, public officials took to the airwaves seeking to reassure wary residents that the risk to the general public was exceedingly small.

“New Yorkers who have not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference.

“We have the finest public health system, not only anywhere in the country but anywhere in the world,” he added.

Much of the public’s concern focused on the movements of Dr. Spencer the night before he reported feeling ill.

On Friday, officials added some new details about those movements. He traveled on the A and L subway lines to Brooklyn, where he went bowling in Williamsburg and took a taxi back to Manhattan on Wednesday evening. He assured officials that he did not have symptoms at the time.

Earlier in the day, he went for a three-mile jog along Riverside Drive. On Tuesday, the day Dr. Spencer first began to feel sluggish, he visited the High Line and ate at the Meatball Shop in the West Village.

Health workers are in the process of visiting every location Dr. Spencer visited, said Dr. Mary Travis Bassett, the city health commissioner.

Dr. Bassett praised the work Dr. Spencer was doing in Africa to combat the disease. She also sought to insulate him from criticism about his activities before falling ill, saying he followed all the proper protocols.

“There’s this young guy who went over there, really doing the right thing, the courageous thing, and he handled himself really well,” she said. “I don’t want anyone portraying him as reckless.”

She spoke before the governors’ news conference, in which Mr. Cuomo incorrectly said Dr. Spencer had violated a quarantine; he had not been under quarantine.

Though Doctors Without Borders and the health department said Dr. Spencer followed protocols, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said Dr. Spencer probably should have stayed home beginning on Tuesday.

“At that point I would have locked myself in, and I would have started checking my temperature hourly,” he said.

Dr. Schaffner also said he saw no need for an automatic 21-day quarantine or isolation period for people arriving from West Africa, not even health workers. There is no medical reason for it, he said, because people are not contagious until they develop symptoms.

Dr. Bassett, in a Twitter post, suggested that the new quarantine policy might discourage American doctors and nurses from helping to contain the disease in Africa. “People who go and volunteer, we have to look at how the new quarantine policy would impact them,” she said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey also raised an issue. “We understand the importance of protecting the public from an Ebola outbreak,” it said in a statement, but the mandatory quarantine actions “raise serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its police powers by detaining people who are exhibiting no Ebola symptoms.”

As the disease continues to spread, killing thousands in West Africa and popping up in a growing number of cities around the world, there have been competing pressures on American officials. They are trying to do all they can to prevent the spread of the disease here, while at the same time trying not to take steps that might impede the fight against the virus in West Africa. They are also trying to manage widespread public anxiety.

Officials both national and local conspicuously conveyed the idea that the public should not overreact. President Obama was photographed in the Oval Office hugging Nina Pham, the Dallas nurse who was just declared Ebola-free after being in isolation since Oct. 16. Mayor de Blasio rode the subway, to demonstrate that the virus could not be spread through casual contact, like holding a subway pole.

The Ebola virus can be transmitted to other people only through bodily fluids when an infected individual begins to show symptoms. At the onset of illness, the amount of virus in the body is generally low, so the risk of infection is also considered small.

As the disease progresses, the amount of virus in the body multiplies and so does the risk of contagion.

Dr. Spencer’s fiancée, Morgan Dixon, has been quarantined at Bellevue Hospital Center. Officials said she would be allowed to return to the apartment she shared with Dr. Spencer, which has been cleaned, and carry out the rest of her quarantine there.

Two other friends whom he had contact with have also been quarantined. None of them have shown any symptoms of illness.

Health officials said there was no risk to patrons at any of the businesses Dr. Spencer visited, though one of them, a bowling alley in Williamsburg called the Gutter, said on its Twitter feed[https://twitter.com/thegutter] Friday night that it was still waiting for a cleaning crew to arrive and had not yet reopened.

The officials decided that subway cars did not need to be taken out of service and disinfected, since Dr. Spencer rode the trains before he developed a fever and, in any case, the virus can survive only a few hours on a surface.

“There is the pure science and the protocols that must be put in place based on that science, in terms of what we know and what can come from that,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and a special adviser to Mayor de Blasio. “On the other end of the spectrum, there is the world of abundance of caution. Public officials are constantly trying to find the right balance.”

Correction: November 7, 2014, Friday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 25 about quarantines proposed by the governors of New York and New Jersey in response to Ebola misidentified the organization that raised the issue of constitutional concerns surrounding a mandatory quarantine for people who have shown no symptoms. It is the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, not the American Civil Liberties Union.

My Mother’s Stroke

Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
My mother, Milli, is 87 and has been cheerfully planning her exit for years. Living will, executed power of attorney, key to the safe deposit box and the names of the lawyer, doctor and financial planner were sent to me decades ago, along with jolly “Death to me is just another adventure” missives. My name has been on her checking account for 20 years, so that I can start paying the bills before rigor mortis sets in, a Depression-era concern I have never been able to dispel.

“What do you care if they get the electricity check a few weeks late?" I say to my mother. “You’ll be dead."

“The checks are in the bottom drawer in the computer room,” Ma says. “You won’t have any problems.”

Of course, when that check-writing day arrived late last month and I got the call that my mother had had a major stroke at her home in Daytona Beach, Fla., my right arm was in a cast because I had shattered my wrist in a bike accident three weeks earlier.

Yes, folks, the person my mother designated to write her checks now can’t write checks for herself (and that is why my column has been on hiatus since Sept. 14). “Man plans, God laughs,” the expression that makes me regret being an atheist. I can’t drive, either. But it was off to join my two younger brothers at the hospital to see what was left of our mother.

“You gonna write about this?” Ma says when I arrive a few days later. “You should. You got plenty of material.”

Sounds O.K. Then she’s instantly off the tracks.

“They’re torturing me,” she says. “They stole my orange. I had it on the bottom of the refrigerator and they stole it. I’m gonna sue when I get out. I’m thinking 10 G’s. That sound right to you?”

She cannot stand, let alone walk. Her right arm and leg are not moving. When the doctor asks what year it is, she says 1914. Her politics, however, remain intact.

“Who’s the president, Mrs. Wadler?” the doctor asks.

“Obama, the big liar,” Ma says.

Her personality has also remained essentially unchanged. She wants all the medical people who walk into the room to read an article I wrote about a road trip we took in California that stars her and was recently reprinted in Reader’s Digest. She’d had one of my brothers bring it from the condo, along with her Book of Psalms.

This is very flattering: King Solomon and me, neck and neck, though in Ma’s head it is more likely King Solomon and her, neck and neck. She even recommends the story to me, on one of the days she does not recognize me.

“There’s a funny story in that magazine over there,” she says. “You should read it.”

“I wrote it, Ma,” I tell her. “But thanks.”

This has to be one of the modern circles of hell, stroke. Or should we call it our plague? One day my mother is walking two miles on the beach and doing crossword puzzles in ink. The next day her brain explodes and she is talking about a new way to do CT scans, with a cat on her chest, hahaha.

Friends from the condo and the synagogue and the ham radio club come in, and you can read the fear of the future in their eyes as they take it in.

Stroke. Again. Oh, boy, and it’s bad. We sat next to each other at the opera club and now she doesn’t even know me.

Sometimes they drag me into the hall, hoping to stave off fear with good news from the miracle workers. What are the doctors saying? Subtext:

Will she always be like this? When it’s my turn, will I be like this? Please, God, let mine be mild. A little weakness in my arm, I can live with that. Just don’t touch the brain.

“They’re torturing me here,” my mother tells them, as Fox News, to which she has fallen asleep for years, plays silently in the background. “I’ve got Ebola. I have ISIS.”

My best friend, Herb, who has flown in from New York after my brothers have to leave, to drive me to the hospital and Ma’s financial planner and the Publix and to forge my signature on checks, figures it out. The crawl on Fox is shooting out scare words and Ma’s brain has them linked.

“ISIS isn’t a disease, it’s a terrorist group, Milli,” says Herb, who has known my mother for 40 years.

“I’ve got ISIS,” Ma insists. “I’m gonna make them test me.”

Which is not to say the basic personality has disappeared. It’s just a little rawer. I always thought Ma was pure id, saying whatever came into her head, but now we are really down to bedrock. Sitting in a visitors’ lounge or the dining hall, she shouts out news about her digestive tract that you would hesitate to confide to your primary physician.

On good days she’s close to the old Ma, joking with Herb, saying that the applesauce in the cafeteria is the only thing they haven’t managed to kill. On bad days she doesn’t recognize him or tells me about the batch of kittens that somebody dropped off at the hospital, and I sit on the floor out of her line of vision and cry.

Herb and I stay at Ma’s condo, a shrine to off-brand peanut butter and ’70s orange sheets and towels with ducks on them. Two days in, my guts are frozen and I am getting up in the middle of the night, every night. I set about organizing Ma’s walk-in closet.

I throw out interconnected, corroded, vertical skirt hangers that make the closet look like a World War I barbed-wire no man’s land. I remove wadded-up tissues and hidden $20 bills from cracked plastic handbags. I get skinny, bright pink and velvety black Velcro hangers and separate silky synagogue blouses and casual knit tops, trying to hang things up perfectly with my one good hand.

I throw out shelves jerry-built from plastic milk cartons and scraps of plywood. I make Herb drive to the malls, where I buy even more Velcro hangers, dozens and dozens. When my bad hand starts to throb, I sit down on the floor and admire how beautifully the closet is coming along.

Four a.m., 6 a.m., left to right: knit shirts, pedal pushers, casual skirts, dress skirts, good pants, synagogue blouses, good suits. Lower level, cold-weather clothes for going north. Boxes on opposite wall, waist level; shorts, because you wear a lot of shorts in Florida. Shoes where Ma can easily see them, though I have to get them where she can more easily reach them, off the floor.

“What are you doing?” Herb asks one daybreak, hearing me.

“I’m making it nice for her when she comes home,” I say.

Then I amend it.

“I’m trying to fix it,” I say. “I’m trying to make believe it can be fixed.”

OSLO — THE movie “Titanic” was more than just a doomed romance for Yeonmi Park.

Ms. Park, 21, said she was a young teen living in North Korea when she watched a bootleg copy of the blockbuster. The tale of love found and lost helped her begin to shake off the psychic grip the Kim dynasty had on her.

“It was fascinating to me that anyone would make a movie about such a shameful story,” she said during a speech last week at the sixth Oslo Freedom Forum[https://oslofreedomforum.com/], a gathering of activists and dissidents from around the world. “How could they release such a movie? I was so curious.”

Before, Ms. Park had believed that “dying for the regime was the most honorable thing you could do,” and she and her sister had vowed to die for the Kims if necessary. But in “Titanic,” she saw “people dying for love, a man willing to die for a woman. It changed my thinking,” she said, adding, “It gave me a taste of freedom.”

For a conference dedicated to human rights, there was a lot to talk about this year. The Freedom Forum, which showcases and celebrates the stories of dissidents, had an abundance of offerings at a time when the world’s problems seem to keep multiplying. This is a place you can come to and get depressed about a lot more than Ebola and the Islamic State, and then wash your worries away with wine and reindeer served several ways — it is Norway, after all.

The speakers kept prodding the audience to remember their corners of the world. But there are so many dark corners that it was easy to feel discouraged, even among such a display of courage.

“Things are unquestionably getting worse, and that is not embellishment or melodrama,” said Thor Halvorssen, 39, the forum’s founder, of the state of human rights. His group has helped smuggle activists[http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/13/fleeing-bahrain-a-bloggers-desperate-escape/] out of repressive countries, provided many with broader exposure and connected others with prominent financiers and technologists. Nico Sell[http://fortune.com/2014/04/10/10-questions-nico-sell-co-founder-and-ceo-wickr/], the chief executive of Wickr, a communications app that promotes its privacy, helpfully handed out Faraday cages, which shield cellphones and other devices from digital snoops.

“People say the truth will win out,” Mr. Halvorssen said, but “it’s hard for truth to win out when on the other side there is an enormous machinery of propaganda or of lawyers threatening defamation suits. Truth will win out, but it needs a little help.”

For Mr. Halvorssen, a Venezuelan with some Norwegian lineage, the conference was personal; his uncle had been killed only a few days earlier in what appeared to be a random act of violence in a country where crime has spiraled out of control and little attention is paid.

Tales of horror and oppression stretched from Sri Lanka to Swaziland, China to Cuba.

From Russia, there was a contingent of former prisoners; Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova from Pussy Riot; and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian billionaire turned dissident, who set aside his own story to tell those of Russians jailed for trying to protest at Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square in 2012, on the day before President Vladimir V. Putin’s latest inauguration.

From Egypt, there was Bassem Youssef, his country’s Jon Stewart, talking about his show being canceled under pressure from the latest military regime. “I have no idea why you listen to an unemployed bum like me,” he quipped.

From Turkey, there was Erdem Gunduz, a dancer and the so-called standing man, who stood motionless in silence during the Taksim Square protests. When he accepted an award at the forum, he said the life of Sisyphus, rolling a rock up a mountain, didn’t look so bad in his view. “It is a job,” he said, “and maybe he’s happy because he’s employed.”

Pleas for attention kept coming. Janet Hinostroza, an Ecuadorean journalist, talked of the hypocrisy of her country’s leader, Rafael Correa, providing asylum to Julian Assange while assailing journalists in his country. “Please talk about this story,” she said. Yulia Marushevska, a Ukrainian student who starred in a protest video that went viral on YouTube, projected a map of her country because she said many didn’t know where it is. “I ask you to stay with us in this fight,” she said.

The Harvard professor Steven Pinker urged attendees to view the long game. Yes, he called recent events “mildly discouraging” and cited statistics showing that civil liberties were on the decline[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2014].

On the other hand, he said: “What were the first governments like? Archaeologists and historians tell us they were extraordinarily unfree. Basically, all of the first centralized governments were led by despots.

“These were men who could impose their will on their countries, who could kill with impunity and who kept large harems of women,” he added. “So that was our starting point.”

And now?

“Modernity is increasing the forces that tend historically to push human rights along — communications, education and reason,” he said. “If history is a guide, these trends militate towards long-term expansion of freedom and rights.”

This much is clear from last week’s gathering: There is no shortage of people committed to pushing human rights along. And they seemed to draw strength from one another.

“They are really optimistic,” Ms. Park said of her fellow travelers. “They have hope, and I have hope, too.”

New York Ebola Response: Polar Opposite of Dallas’s

This time was different.

When Craig Spencer, a young doctor just back from treating patients with Ebola in Guinea, fell ill with the virus in New York on Thursday, the paramedics who went to get him were dressed in protective suits. He entered Bellevue Hospital through a rear door, far from the busy emergency room, and was taken to a state-of-the-art isolation ward that was locked and guarded.

The carefully planned response was a world apart from the scene that unfolded in a Dallas hospital last month when a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, became the first person to test positive for Ebola in the United States.

It was Ebola’s first surprise encounter with a modern medical system, and it was, by all accounts, a bumpy one. Mr. Duncan lay in an emergency department room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital for hours, with a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and frequent diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], while other patients in nearby rooms were treated by the same doctor and nurses, medical workers said. A lab technician had to comb through his inbox to find an email from the government on procedures for Ebola blood samples, only to find that he had handled them improperly, the workers said.

Rules for protective gear seemed to change with the weather, and some of Mr. Duncan’s nurses, unsure of what to wear, resorted to looking for help on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], according to a health worker involved in the response.

The often rudderless response lasted two weeks, and in the end, two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson, fell ill with the virus. Both have recovered, but the searing experience stunned experts, and shook Americans’ confidence in their health care system.

“I’m just gobsmacked,” said David P. Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University and a fellow at Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security. “Ebola was supposed to be something we could handle easily.”

The response also prompted a national reckoning, both by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal agency that contributed to the wobbly response in Dallas, and among hospitals nationwide that are now scrambling to prepare, having learned from mistakes in Texas that many say could have happened to any of them.

“There had to be a first hospital, and unfortunately for Texas Presbyterian, it was them,” said Dr. Sean P. Elliott, medical director of infection prevention at the University of Arizona Health Network. His Tucson hospital, Dr. Elliott said, is now “burning through our supplies of protective gear and putting in tons of people hours” to prepare.

“Dallas has touched a very sensitive nerve,” he said.

Dallas also shattered the fundamental assumption among most American health officials that almost any large American hospital could safely treat Ebola. Many of the procedures that have been put in place in New York and elsewhere since Dallas reflect that change in thinking — for example, the designation of specific hospitals, like Bellevue or Dr. Elliott’s, as point places for Ebola treatment.

If there was ever a moment for redemption, Dr. Spencer’s case was it. Even before the result of his Ebola test, a C.D.C. team was on its way to New York from the agency’s base in Atlanta. It was whisked there on a Defense Department plane, which turned right around with a sample of Dr. Spencer’s blood that it delivered to a C.D.C. lab around 4 a.m. More C.D.C. disease trackers followed on Friday morning for a total of seven people.

The initial team that deployed to Dallas last month was bigger — 10 people — but was hampered by inconsistent protocols for gear at the hospital and a lack of leadership on the ground, for which the team itself was partly responsible. And far from being zipped to a lab on a military flight, the blood sample for Mr. Duncan did not arrive at a state laboratory in Austin until almost 48 hours after he got to the emergency room.

What is more, the C.D.C. arrived in Dallas only after Mr. Duncan’s test came back positive, on Sept. 30, two days after the hospital first called the agency. It is too soon to tell whether the response to Dr. Spencer’s infection will continue as smoothly as it began. And because he is a doctor who was diligently monitoring his own temperature, his case was always going to be different from that of Mr. Duncan, a welder from Monrovia visiting the United States, who showed up unannounced and told health workers that he had not been exposed.

Even so, Dr. Spencer’s case, as it unfolded across New York, with disease detectives chasing his trail from a Brooklyn bowling alley to his Harlem apartment, seemed to ring in a new era.

“We are all much smarter now,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “We have all learned from the Dallas episode.”

Shifting Protocols

The first time Mr. Duncan went to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian feeling ill, shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Sept. 25, a nurse noted in his record: “Patient recently came from Africa.” But that did not raise any flags.

A series of tests was ordered, and at 3:18 a.m., Mr. Duncan was released.

But three days later, on Sunday, shortly after 10 a.m., he was back, this time in an ambulance. Its crew had been warned by one of Mr. Duncan’s relatives that he might have an infectious disease.

“Nurses were saying: ‘No. Could it be Ebola? No,’ ” said one hospital nurse, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about job repercussions.

The next 72 hours would be crucial. According to the C.D.C. it was during this time that Ms. Pham and Ms. Vinson most likely became infected.

The hospital had been assuring the public that it was ready. Dr. Edward Goodman, an epidemiologist at the hospital, said on Sept. 30: “We have had a plan in place for some time now.”

But a review of hospital records and interviews with hospital workers, federal officials and relatives of Mr. Duncan evoke a picture of worry and uncertainty in which health workers, in the absence of any training and facing rules that were constantly changing, had to improvise while racing to try to save Mr. Duncan’s life. “We’d see pictures of Dr. Frieden in Africa, and we were like, ‘If this is Ebola, we shouldn’t be wearing gowns, right?’ ” one nurse said, referring to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., who traveled to West Africa in August. “We were looking at these pictures and seeing what other people were wearing and saying, ‘We’re not wearing anything like that,’ ” said the nurse, who asked not to be identified because the hospital told employees not to speak with reporters.

“There was no training, no explanation, nobody around to help them,” said Dr. Pierre Rollin, an Ebola expert at the C.D.C. who arrived on Oct. 12 to help train the nurses after Mr. Duncan’s death. “They had the impression that they were running after the ideal personal protective equipment, and they didn’t have it. It was like a race.”

Mr. Duncan’s first days in the hospital’s intensive care unit, where he was moved at 4:40 p.m. on Monday, more than 30 hours into his hospital odyssey, highlighted the problem. That first night in the I.C.U., nurses wore two gowns to cover front and back, shoe covers, a surgical mask and a face shield that went to the chin, one nurse said. By the next night, after Mr. Duncan tested positive for Ebola, they added Tyvek suits with hoods and respirators. Then came plastic aprons and triple layers of bootees and gloves. The C.D.C. later said too much gear actually increases risk.

The hospital says it was consulting with Emory University Medical Center in Atlanta, which had treated Ebola patients, as well as county health officials and the C.D.C. on protective gear.

Wendell Watson, a hospital spokesman, said in an email that the hospital immediately isolated Mr. Duncan from other patients when he arrived in the emergency room, and that it emptied an entire 24-bed unit to dedicate to Mr. Duncan’s care once he was admitted, even erecting temporary walls around his hallway for better protection. Ebola training had recently started when the virus struck, Mr. Watson said.

Ms. Pham, who spent two hours watching over Mr. Duncan on his first night in the I.C.U., also cared for him in the days that followed.

By Wednesday the patient felt better, so much that he asked to watch an action movie. But after midnight on Saturday, his organs failing, Mr. Duncan was intubated and put on a respirator.

On Monday, Mr. Duncan’s eighth day at the hospital, his mother, sister and nephew arrived in Dallas, having driven through the night from their North Carolina home. They hurried to the hospital, which arranged for them to see and talk to Mr. Duncan, at that point in a medically induced coma[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/consciousness-decreased/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], via Skype.

From a different floor of the hospital, the relatives recalled last week, they glimpsed Mr. Duncan in his bed, his head elevated on a pillow. His mother, Nowai Gartay, told him to be strong as she looked at his face for the last time.

“I’m ready to hug you right now, my baby,” she told him. “Can you hear me?”

Less than two days later, on Oct. 8, Mr. Duncan was dead.

Late on the night of Oct. 11, Ms. Pham tested positive for Ebola, sending shock waves through the hospital, and jolting the government into action.

Dr. Frieden immediately sent 16 more experts, including Dr. Rollin. Dr. Frieden reflected publicly a few days later that he wished he had sent a bigger team sooner.

“That was for me the moment at which something that we had hoped would not happen, had happened,” he said in an interview. “The protocols that we had recommended and that the hospital had tried to implement, had not worked.”

One problem was that its protective gear protocols had been developed for use in field hospitals in Africa, where patients are given only basic care, like intravenous fluids, not for use in intensive care units of hospitals in modern medical systems, where large teams perform high-risk procedures that can involve lots of bodily fluids. The agency has substantially rewritten those protocols.

“This is an entirely different setting,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/allergies/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and Infectious Disease, which treated Ms. Pham and on Friday released her. “Nobody realized that when the patient was admitted.”

Another crucial question — who was in charge — seemed to have no answer, with several layers of government and the hospital all playing roles.

Even with “the best-laid plans,” Dr. David L. Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an interview, “you see how they are being implemented on the ground during the events and you have to make hard, real-time decisions on gaps that you see.” One thing he learned, he added, was the importance of “having someone in charge.”

The hospital has started a new system in its emergency department to immediately move high-risk patients to an isolation unit. And the C.D.C., with other federal agencies, has been in talks with manufacturers of the moon suits, which were not originally designed for medical care, to make them safer to take off, for example by placing the zipper across the shoulder with a large ring that makes it easy to tug in gloves.

Testing New Skills

Bellevue, New York City’s flagship public hospital, had started preparing for the possibility of Ebola patients in July, after an alert from the C.D.C. But after Mr. Duncan tested positive in Dallas, the city intensified its preparations, ordering 911 emergency service workers to screen callers for travel to West Africa and to ask whether they had come into contact with someone sick with the virus.

On Oct. 16, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that eight hospitals statewide, including Bellevue, had volunteered to be Ebola treatment centers. Ebola drills would also be conducted in subways and on other mass transit, he said, as well as college campuses. The city sent testers posing as Ebola patients into emergency rooms to determine whether staff members would respond appropriately. Hospital employees practiced putting on and taking off protective gear, and officials reached out to West African communities like “Little Liberia,” on Staten Island, trying to build relationships.

At Bellevue, officials set up four single-bed isolation rooms to receive high-probability or confirmed Ebola cases. Those rooms were carved out of a tuberculosis ward, which is equipped with decontamination rooms and cameras that can monitor patients remotely, to avoid unnecessary trips into the rooms.

“Unfortunately, we have an advantage from watching what happened in Dallas,” Mr. Cuomo told thousands of health care workers Tuesday at an Ebola training session at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. “Because Dallas didn’t have a chance to prepare like we have a chance to prepare.”

Two days later, his boast was put to the test, as Dr. Spencer, 33, reported a fever of 100.3.

A day later, Dr. Spencer was in stable condition and in good enough spirits to be talking to his family and friends by cellphone. Doctors were maintaining his electrolyte balance and checking his vital signs, but had not found it necessary to move to more drastic treatment.

Still, it was far from clear that he would get better rather than worse, and the possibility that experimental treatment could be needed was being discussed. Through it all, officials have been working hard to tamp down fear. City workers handed out informational leaflets in English and in Spanish on his block and near subway stations in his neighborhood.

Mark Levine, the city councilman for the neighborhood, said the campaign would have been much harder without advance planning.

“After the Texas incident, they reviewed every procedure from top to bottom,” Mr. Levine said. “New York City could not have been more prepared for an incident like this.”

N.Y. / Region
In New York, Bringing a Comforting Message During a Chaotic Time

Dr. Mary Travis Bassett is not a specialist in fighting infectious diseases. She is nine months into a job larger than any she has held before. And, until Thursday evening, she had never had to appear before a national television audience to announce that an exotic, dangerous virus was present in the heart of the country’s biggest metropolis.

Yet when the cameras blinked on, Dr. Bassett, the New York City health commissioner, stood out as a palpable force of calm, delivering potentially hair-raising information with the easy, earthy cadence of a comforting relative. Her message, conveyed in notably plain words, was clear but not clinical, firm but warm: The average New Yorker had nothing to fear from Ebola.

Social media took notice, praising her performance, and so did City Hall, which quickly dispatched Dr. Bassett on a tour of Friday morning talk shows as the friendly, reassuring face of the government’s response. On MSNBC, asked about the Ebola patient’s fever of 100.3 degrees, she offered a matter-of-fact but informal take: “When I was an intern,” she said calmly, “we didn’t even really consider that a fever.”

Quelling fear in a crisis can be as much about communications as medical work, and Dr. Bassett, 62, a native New Yorker who has spent 30 years in public health, is still adjusting to her new role as reassurer-in-chief. In an interview on Friday, she confessed that she does not watch television and has never undergone media training, and marveled that her 86-year-old mother, who lives in the Catskills, was being called by reporters suddenly intrigued by her life.

“Anybody who knows me, knows that I am kind of a straight shooter,” Dr. Bassett said, as her city-issued sedan merged into traffic on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. “People need to feel like they are being given information, that things aren’t being kept from them, that they are being apprised of what’s known, and that we’re being honest.”

“Fear is a powerful thing,” she added, “and it’s often not rational. That’s when reliance on science and fact really has to be our North Star.”

With her actions under intense scrutiny, Dr. Bassett must balance public aplomb with the backstage tensions of overseeing the evolving response to the city’s first Ebola case.

A senior city official who spoke to Dr. Bassett said she was “furious” on Friday after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per], without consulting city officials, announced a mandatory quarantine for medical workers returning to New York after treating Ebola patients in Africa.

In the interview, which took place hours before Mr. Cuomo’s announcement, Dr. Bassett spoke passionately of her concerns that public fears of Ebola could undermine the work of volunteers fighting the virus in Africa. She said she did not want anyone to describe the patient in New York, who had followed guidelines set by his organization, Doctors Without Borders, as having been “reckless.”

“It would be just such a disservice to the mission that he clearly embraced,” Dr. Bassett said. “It would be really a pity if we somehow threatened that impulse, which is so heroic.” 

Dr. Bassett does not have the typical resume of a big-city health commissioner. She grew up in Washington Heights, the daughter of a white mother and a black father steeped in activism. At 17, Dr. Bassett organized a takeover of the administration building at the Fieldston School, which she attended on scholarship, to protest a dearth of minority students.

“We don’t want any more nice chats with the administration — we’ve had plenty of those,” she told The New York Times, which reported on the episode[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/03/24/76720949.html?pageNumber=33], in 1970. (In response, the Fieldston faculty agreed to enroll more black and Latino pupils.)

She earned degrees from Harvard and Columbia, and after a stint at a Harlem hospital, left for Zimbabwe, where she spent 17 years, raising two daughters, teaching and confronting the ravages of AIDS. Returning to New York in 2002, she became a top deputy to the health commissioner, Thomas C. Frieden, now director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

Dr. Bassett’s tenure as health commissioner, which began in January, was mostly quiet until Thursday, when the city confirmed the Ebola case. But if her entry into the spotlight was abrupt, it also earned near-universal praise, including from some critics of the de Blasio administration: Howard Wolfson, a deputy to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, called her a “natural.”

“She projected just the right mix of authority and compassion,” he said on Friday. “You want somebody who can be reassuring and factual and empathetic, and I think she conveyed all of that.”

In the interview, Dr. Bassett said the arrival of Ebola in New York had not fazed her. “We always knew that we would never know when, where, or who,” she said. “This is not going to be a sprint, it’s a marathon. We’re going to have to remain vigilant for months until we bring the epidemic in West Africa under control.”

Until then, Dr. Bassett knows she will be getting less sleep than she prefers — “I’m one of those people who needs eight hours a night” — and that her days will no longer be routine.

One of her daughters is visiting this week from Zanzibar, where she lives, but the two have not been able to spend much time together. Dr. Bassett had hoped on Friday to attend a jazz concert by one of her favorite musicians.

Stepping out of her car, outside the Health Department headquarters in Queens, Dr. Bassett offered a lopsided smile. The concert, she said, “is beginning to seem a little distant.”

What Are You So Afraid Of?

A TIME of year when we celebrate and indulge in what frightens us may be a good moment to consider how fear begins. It could be anything: a sound, a dog’s bark or bite, some infant terror of being left alone, darkness, a taste, some memory, the unknown, the unseen, the known, the seen. Almost always, its origins are unclear.

My own fear of snakes might have started when I was 3, in a garden in Bangkok, in the klong, a rainwater ditch where I was playing. A highly venomous, six-foot banded krait glided alongside me. My mother, watching from a balcony above, was unable to reach me, but she called for my older brother, who picked me up and lifted me out of the trench. I remember nothing of this. But my mother told me the story.

I wonder if my enduring panic half a century later at the rustle of even the smallest garter snake in the grass is based on some suppressed memory of the event, or on the story of the event. Or is it possibly some genetic inheritance of the fear that centuries of humans have had of the reptile world? Or is it some combination of all of these?

Fear, arriving in layers in which genetic legacy converges with personal experience, is vital to our survival. When we freeze, stop in our tracks or take flight, it is a biological response to what we sense as near and present danger. All the same, it observes its own absurd hierarchy, in which we often harbor an abiding anxiety for the wrong things. A childhood accident causes a friend of mine to become white and shake at the sight of broken glass. But she is a chain smoker as well, and has little worry about her pack-a-day habit. And surely the recent alarm over the Ebola virus among Americans who are not fully attentive to the need for flu shots suggests a reluctance to recognize genuine threats to public health.

We have clear directives about what is really worth our fear. Participants in the real parade of horrors include radical changes in the carbon cycle, the rate of species extinction, extreme weather, genetically modified food, institutional financial misconduct that puts our security at risk. The archive of very real menaces threatening us now is so full, it would seem we hardly know how to choose what to be scared of.

Except that we do choose, and what we choose are generally the ordinary fears such as heights, public speaking, insects, reptiles. They are all things that have about as much chance of harming us as the characters behind some of this season’s top trending scary costumes: zombies, werewolves and cast members from “Duck Dynasty.”

The biologist E. O. Wilson has observed that while we fear snakes, spiders, darkness, open spaces and closed spaces, we do not fear the more likely instruments of danger — knives, guns, cars, electrical sockets — because, he says, “our species has not been exposed to these lethal agents long enough in evolutionary time to have acquired the predisposing genes that ensure automatic avoidance.” Which is to say, fear, real fear, deep fear, the kind that changes our habits and actions, is not something on which we are likely to follow sensible instruction.

At this time of year, when I venture into the basement of our old farmhouse, I find that it is, as always, a horror chamber of the first order: damp, dark and musty, with dirt floors, vast cities of cobwebs and black alcoves. Yet it’s not the decrepit furnace with its ravenous craving for fuel that causes me the moment of panic, nor the behemoth oil tank, nor even the insanity of the soaring cost to fill it. Though I am loath to admit it, the lethal agents that set my heart racing are, instead, the sudden rustle and the glint of pearly snakeskin that flashes in the ancient stone foundation wall behind the boiler. The more dire menaces at that particular moment seem to be: black rat snake, milk snake, grass snake, garter snake. None of which are poisonous. Still, the question looms: How can I get out of here as fast as possible?

The paths that human fear can take, and its often ridiculous and pointless detours, are surely worth considering now. At a moment of such social, political and environmental urgency, I would like to think it is possible to tap into human fear to change behavior in some fundamental and strategic way. Yet what seems more likely to me is the possibility that fear is simply an unpredictable rogue impulse that all too often remains indifferent to the genuine threats around us. And that may be the scariest thing of all.

GENEVA — The number of people infected with Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in three West African countries has exceeded 10,000, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] reported Saturday.

A total of 10,141 people had contracted the disease worldwide, the organization said in its latest update on the progress of the epidemic, and the number reported to have died rose to 4,922. The W.H.O. acknowledged that its figures understated the reality of Ebola’s spread.

All but 27 of the infections and all but three of the deaths have occurred in the West African countries of Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], according to report.

A fourth country, Mali[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/mali/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], has reported its first confirmed Ebola case, the death of a 2-year-old child from the disease on Friday.

The group said it was treating the situation as an emergency because the child was displaying symptoms when he rode hundreds of miles by public bus from neighboring Guinea, which presented “multiple opportunities for exposures — including high-risk exposures — involving many people.”

Malian authorities have isolated 43 people, including 10 health care workers who had contact with the child in the town of Kayes, where she was taken for treatment, the W.H.O. said.

But the authorities face the daunting task of tracing other people who were exposed to the child during her lengthy journey, which included a stopover of several hours in Mali’s capital, Bamako.

Mali, one of Africa’s poorest nations, had appeared to be highly vulnerable to a spillover of the Ebola virus from neighboring countries still struggling to contain the epidemic, which began nine months ago. It has limited infrastructure and a fragile central government weakened by years of internal conflict.

Before the case was reported, the W.H.O. had sent two staff members to Mali to help bolster preparations for dealing with the disease in countries bordering Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mali and Ivory Coast were considered priorities. Six of the eight Guinean and Liberian districts bordering Ivory Coast have reported cases of people infected with the Ebola virus.

The World Health Organization said Friday it would soon send a rapid-response team to Mali, including epidemiologists and experts in clinical management, contact tracing and social mobilization campaigns.

Dr. Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director-general for the World Health Organization, said that the situation in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was still of “great concern.” | Reuters | Rui Gama Vaz, a World Health Organization representative in Nigeria, and the country’s health minister, Dr. Onyebuchi Chukwu, discussed the news that the country was free of the Ebola virus.

The Shifting Politics of Cuba Policy

There was a time, not too long ago, when any mainstream politician running for statewide or national office in Florida had to rattle off fiery rhetoric against the Cuban government and declare unquestioning faith that the embargo on the island would one day force the Castros from power.

For generations, among Cuban-Americans, once a largely monolithic voting bloc, the embargo was a symbol of defiance in exile — more gospel than policy.

That has changed dramatically in recent years as younger members of the diaspora have staked out views[https://cri.fiu.edu/research/cuba-poll/2014-fiu-cuba-poll.pdf] that are increasingly in favor of deepening engagement with the island. Cuba still looms large in Florida politics, and to an extent nationally. But it is far from the clear-cut issue it once was.

That evolution has allowed a growing number of seasoned politicians to call the embargo a failure and argue that ending America’s enmity with Cuba represents the best chance of encouraging positive change on the island. Several prominent Cuban-American businessmen who were once strong supporters of the embargo have changed their stance and become proponents of engagement. The pro-embargo lobby raises a fraction of the money it once did. President Obama now receives more correspondence from lawmakers who favor expanded ties than from those who want to keep robust sanctions.

••

The shift has not been lost on the White House, where officials are deliberating over how much progress they might be able to make on President Obama’s longstanding interest in expanding ties with Cuba. Mr. Obama supported repealing the embargo[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjOQ6xz1b8] when he was running for the United States Senate in 2004 but backtracked as a presidential candidate[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/politics/24campaign.html], saying in 2008 that the embargo gave Washington leverage over the Cuban government.

No bold move on Cuba policy would be risk-free. But the political backlash Mr. Obama would face by taking steps to normalize relations is likely to be manageable, even in the Cuban-American community, and well worth the opportunities there would be for expansion in trade, communications and relationships between Americans and ordinary Cubans.

Charlie Crist, the former governor of Florida who is in a tight race for his old job, recently said he was interested in traveling to Cuba[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/charlie-crist-calls-off-visit-to-cuba-next-month/2185575], an idea he later scrapped, blaming a busy schedule. Mr. Crist, however, has emphatically said[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article3214665.html] he has come to see the embargo as a relic that must be shelved. Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote in her memoirs[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/marc-caputo/article1967638.html], and repeated in a recent interview[http://fusion.net/video/3275/hillary-clinton-thinks-the-cuban-embargo-has-been-a-failure/], that she now favors repealing the embargo, which she called a failure, because it has “propped up the Castros.”

In Florida, members of Congress have staked out positions on Cuba that once would have been considered political suicide. Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Tampa, traveled to the island last year and made a strong appeal for an end to the sanctions, saying the United States was failing to capitalize on economic reforms[http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/us-rep-kathy-castor-lift-cuba-embargo-travel-restrictions/2113832] underway on the island. She feels that far from hurting her politically, the stance has made her more popular among constituents, including Cuban-Americans, who want to play a role in the island’s future.

Even in Miami, where old-guard positions remain popular among older exiles, who are largely Republicans, there have been notable changes. In 2012, Joe Garcia became the first Cuban-American Democrat from Miami[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/democrats-breaking-gops-long-lock-cuban-vote] to be elected to the House. While he publicly supports the embargo, Mr. Garcia holds views significantly different from other South Florida members of Congress. For instance, he has called for clinical trials[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article1955994.html] in the United States of a Cuban diabetes treatment that has shown great promise. He also favors easing travel restrictions[http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/10/joe-garcia-carlos-curbelo-disagree-on-expanding-cuba-travel-future-of-cuban-adjustment-act.html] to the island.

Still, ending the embargo, which requires congressional action, remains challenging because a small but passionate group of Cuban-American lawmakers is adamant about maintaining the status quo. The most vocal defenders of the embargo are Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey; Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida; and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, both Miami Republicans.

In April, during the height of the crisis set off by Russia’s invasion of Crimea, Mr. Menendez, the son of Cuban immigrants who moved to the United States in 1953, delivered a long, impassioned speech[http://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/chairman-menendez-floor-speech-on-cuba] on the Senate floor, arguing that despite the myriad foreign policy crises in the world, Washington needed to focus on the abuses of “a Stalinist police state” 90 miles away. He displayed photos of dissidents and warned that expanded travel by Americans to Cuba was enabling a despotic state. White House officials fear that Mr. Menendez, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, could hold up confirmation of federal nominees in retaliation for further moves to ease the embargo.

Mr. Menendez’s loathing of the Cuban government has only increased because he believes[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-robert-menendez-seeks-probe-of-alleged-cuban-plot-to-smear-him/2014/07/07/e9ba25a0-efe8-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html] the island’s intelligence service sought to destroy his career by planting a fabricated story in the media suggesting that he had patronized underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.

White House officials are less concerned about pushback from Republicans, who are reflexive about criticizing the president on foreign policy. While a growing number of her congressional colleagues have traveled to Cuba, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who is among the most ardent supporters of the embargo, seems to be strikingly out of touch with what is happening on the island.

In a recent interview[http://startingpoint.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/09/rep-ros-lehtinen-on-beyonce-and-jay-z-trip-to-cuba-no-one-is-above-the-law/] deploring a visit to Havana by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen expressed outrage that the celebrities had stayed in hotels where Cubans aren’t allowed to stay, even if they could afford it. As it happens, the Cuban government lifted that ban in 2008[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/03/31/cuba.hotels/].

As the electorate has shifted on Cuba, some Cuban-American politicians have begun to call for a review[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/08/us-usa-immigration-cuba-idUSBRE9170F920130208] of the policy that puts newly arrived Cubans on a fast track to citizenship, probably because new immigrants support closer ties with the island and grew up despising the embargo.

••

Politics aside, the issue remains deeply personal for the holdouts, Cuban-Americans of that generation say, because it continues to evoke raw feelings about ancestry, homeland and loss. Those sentiments, which have lasted for more than 50 years, cannot be ignored. But they should not continue to anchor American policy on a failed course that has strained Washington’s relationship with allies in the hemisphere, prevented robust trade with the island and offered the Cuban government a justification for its failures.

Los cambios electorales respecto a Cuba

En tiempos pasados, no muy lejanos, todo candidato político creíble haciendo campaña en Florida para elecciones estatales o nacionales obligatoriamente debía recitar denuncias contra el gobierno cubano y proclamar su fe en que el embargo a la isla finalmente sacaría a los Castro del poder.

Durante generaciones, para los cubanoamericanos, un grupo que anteriormente fue altamente monolítico a la hora de votar, el embargo representó un símbolo de desafío, más credo que política.

Eso ha cambiado drásticamente en los últimos años, a medida que los más recientes miembros de la diáspora se han manifestado a favor de fomentar lazos estrechos con la isla. Cuba sigue siendo un tema político importante en Florida y, hasta cierto punto, a nivel nacional. Pero el tema se ha vuelto mucho más complejo.

Esa evolución ha permitido que un creciente número de políticos destacados puedan llamar el embargo una política fallida, y argumentar que ponerle fin a la era de enemistad con Cuba representa la mejor oportunidad para fomentar un futuro más próspero en la isla. Muchos industriales cubanoamericanos que defendieron el embargo en el pasado se han convertido en partidarios de establecer nuevos nexos con la isla. El lobby pro-embargo, hoy en día, recauda una fracción de los fondos que colectaba en años anteriores. El Presidente Obama recibe actualmente más correspondencia de legisladores que están a favor de reanudar la relación, que de aquellos que aún quieren mantener sanciones.

El cambio ha sido percatado en la Casa Blanca, donde los asesores del presidente están considerando cuánto progreso pueden lograr al ampliar lazos con Cuba, una aspiración que Obama ha tenido hace mucho tiempo. El presidente se pronunció a favor de abolir el embargo cuando era candidato al Senado en 2004, aunque se retractó durante la contienda presidencial, argumentando en 2008 que las sanciones permitían que Washington ejerciera presión sobre el gobierno cubano.

Cualquier giro significativo en política exterior respecto a Cuba sería riesgoso. Pero la reacción de quienes se oponen a normalizar la relación sería tolerable, aún en la comunidad cubanoamericana, si se tienen en cuenta las oportunidades que una expansión del comercio, comunicación y relaciones interpersonales representaría para empresas norteamericanas y cubanos en la isla.

Charlie Crist, el antiguo gobernador de Florida, quien se ha postulado para regresar al cargo, recientemente dijo que estaba dispuesto a viajar a Cuba durante la campaña. Abandonó la idea, diciendo que su agenda estaba demasiado apretada. Sin embargo, Crist ha dicho enfáticamente que el embargo es una política obsoleta que debe ser abandonada. Hillary Rodham Clinton escribió en su autobiografía recién publicada, y lo reiteró en una entrevista, que hoy en día está a favor de terminar el embargo, llamándolo una estrategia fallida que le ha dado legitimidad a los Castro.

En Florida, los congresistas han planteado posiciones respecto a Cuba que, en otra época, hubieran representado un suicidio político. Kathy Castor, una representante Demócrata de Tampa, viajó a la isla el año pasado y, a su regreso, hizo un fuerte llamado por terminar el embargo, diciendo que Estados Unidos no estaba sacando provecho de las reformas económicas que el gobierno Cubano había implementado. Ella piensa que, lejos de que esto le haya costado políticamente, su posición ha sido aplaudida por miembros de su electorado, incluidos los cubanoamericanos, que quieren influir en el futuro de la isla.

Incluso ha habido cambios destacables en Miami, donde el embargo aún cuenta con el apoyo de la comunidad tradicional de cubanoamericanos, un electorado predominantemente Republicano. En 2012, Joe García fue el primer cubanoamericano Demócrata de Miami elegido a la cámara baja del Congreso. Aunque apoya el embargo, García tiene diferencias significativas respecto a las posiciones de otros congresistas del sur de Florida. Por ejemplo, está a favor de estudios clínicos en Estados Unidos sobre una terapia para la diabetes, desarrollada en Cuba, que ha generado muchas expectativas. También quiere flexibilizar las restricciones para quienes desean viajar a la isla.

Aún así, acabar el embargo exigirá mayores giros en la opinión pública, dado que se requiere acción en el Congreso, y hay un pequeño pero apasionado grupo de legisladores de ascendencia cubana quienes abogan por mantener el embargo. Los defensores más visibles son el Senador Robert Menéndez, un Demócrata de Nueva Jersey; el Senador Marco Rubio, un Republicano de la Florida; y dos congresistas Republicanos de Miami: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen y Mario Díaz-Balart.

En abril, durante el auge de la crisis que desató la invasión rusa de una provincia de Ucrania, Menéndez dio un largo y vehemente discurso en el Senado, argumentando que, a pesar del sinnúmero de crisis a nivel mundial, Washington debía tomar nota de los abusos de un “estado policial estalinista” a 90 millas de Estados Unidos. Menéndez, hijo de padres cubanos que emigraron en 1953, mostró fotos de disidentes en la isla, y advirtió que ampliar oportunidades de viaje a Cuba empodera a un estado déspota. Funcionarios de la Casa Blanca temen que Menéndez podría usar su posición al mando del Comité de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado, frenando la confirmación de postulaciones a cargos federales, como represalia, si Obama toma medidas para flexibilizar el embargo.

El repudio que Menéndez siente frente al gobierno cubano ha incrementado, ya que el senador cree que el servicio de inteligencia de la isla intentó destruir su carrera, al difundir en los medios una noticia falsa implicando al senador de haber tenido relaciones sexuales con prostitutas menores de edad en República Dominicana.

A la Casa Blanca le preocupan menos los ataques de legisladores Republicanos, ya que suelen criticar su política exterior reflexivamente. Mientras varios de sus colegas han viajado a Cuba recientemente, Ros-Lehtinen, una de las más fervientes defensoras del embargo, parece estar desinformada del día a día en la isla. Durante una entrevista reciente, al criticar la visita a La Habana de Beyoncé y Jay-Z, Ros-Lehtinen expresó indignación de que la pareja de artistas se hubiera hospedado en un hotel lujoso al cual los cubanos no tienen acceso, aún si tuvieran dinero. Resulta que el gobierno cambió esa regla en 2008.

A medida que el ámbito electoral respecto a Cuba ha cambiado, algunos políticos cubanoamericanos han comenzado a pedir que se evalúe la ley que permite que los cubanos que llegan a Estados Unidos se vuelvan ciudadanos norteamericanos de manera expedita. Esto parece ser a raíz de que muchos de los nuevos inmigrantes desean mantener vínculos cercanos con la isla y crecieron detestando el embargo.

Más allá de política, para los que no quieren abandonar el embargo, el tema es visceralmente personal, ya que evoca sentimientos de ancestro, patria y pérdida. Dado que han persistido más de medio siglo, esos sentimientos no pueden ser ignorados. Pero no deben seguir anclando la política exterior estadounidense en un curso errado que ha generado tensión en las relaciones de Washington con sus vecinos, ha inhibido el comercio con la isla y le ha proporcionado al gobierno cubano una excusa para justificar sus fallas.

New Hampshire’s Tight Senate Race Keeps Focus on Baggage

LONDONDERRY, N.H. — Since he became the Republican Senate candidate in New Hampshire, Scott Brown[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per], a former United States senator from Massachusetts, has hammered one theme: that the Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen, has been a rubber stamp for President Obama, “voting with him 99 percent of the time.”

He mentions this several times a day. At a factory tour here recently, Mr. Brown was so eager to make the point that he upped the ante and blurted out to reporters that Ms. Shaheen voted with the president “over 100 percent of the time.”

It was a small but telling moment. Mr. Brown has gained traction by lashing Ms. Shaheen to the president, who won New Hampshire twice but whose job approval ratings here are lower than ever: 37 percent approve, while 60 percent disapprove, according to a poll[http://www.uml.edu/News/press-releases/2014/nh-poll-2014.aspx] released Thursday by the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

Mr. Brown’s tactics have brought him results. Though Ms. Shaheen, 67, is a well-liked, longtime fixture in state politics who was governor before she was elected to the Senate in 2008, Mr. Brown, 55, who has lived full time in the state for less than a year, is now tied with her in the polls. Most polls show Ms. Shaheen ahead by two or three percentage points, but the differences fall within the margins of sampling error, and analysts call the race a tossup. It is one of a handful that could determine which party controls the Senate next year.

A Democratic loss here would be significant, because Ms. Shaheen is better positioned than some of her fellow Democrats in close Senate races. Polls show she is benefiting from support from women. And she has a well-organized effort to bring voters out on Election Day.

She is banking on that as she faces an aggressive challenge from Mr. Brown, who is seeking to resurrect his national political career. It began with his upset victory[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/us/politics/20election.html] in heavily Democratic Massachusetts in 2010, when he captured the Senate seat that Edward M. Kennedy had held for nearly a half-century, and it was cut short there in 2012, when he lost[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-senate-scott-brown.html] to the populist Democrat Elizabeth Warren.

Late last year, under pressure from national Republicans, Mr. Brown, a proven fund-raiser who excels at retail politics, moved[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/scott-brown-plans-new-hampshire-move] to his longtime vacation home in New Hampshire, a less Democratic and more libertarian state that he believed could be more receptive to him than Massachusetts.

That set up what has become one of the hardest fought and most contentious political races of the year. The infusion of cash goes far beyond anything New Hampshire has seen in a Senate race, with more than $10 million spent on television ads alone, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

Mr. Brown has tried to nationalize the race, framing everything in relation to Mr. Obama. He casts both the president and Ms. Shaheen as having left the country vulnerable to the Ebola virus and terrorism, both of which he says could easily cross the unsecured Mexican border. In fact, he told Fox News, referring to the militant group in Iraq and Syria that calls itself the Islamic State, “There’s deep concerns that there are members of ISIS actually coming through the border right now.”

Polls suggest the anti-Obama tack may work. Half of likely voters in New Hampshire say they do not trust the federal government to handle the Ebola crisis properly. And a majority opposes Mr. Obama’s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, which Ms. Shaheen supports and Mr. Brown wants to repeal.

Laura Gamache, 30, a real estate agent in Bedford, said she was voting for Mr. Brown because he had met with people in her office and she liked his ideas about how to grow a business. “He spent 45 minutes with us and was easy to talk to,” she said. “And I do think we need to do something about border security.”

Mr. Brown casts himself as an independent who would work with both parties to break the gridlock in Washington. When Ms. Shaheen accused him in a debate of having voted to outsource jobs, he accused her of having “outsourced her independence” by voting with Mr. Obama 99 percent of the time.

Ms. Shaheen’s campaign theme is that she “puts New Hampshire first.” She promotes issues like lowering the costs of student loans[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/student_loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and child care, and extending unemployment benefits.

She says Mr. Brown is “fear-mongering” and “grandstanding,” partly to distract from his record of supporting big oil companies and Wall Street banks, and partly to scare voters.

“The Republican strategy is to target Democratic women and suggest we’re not tough enough on national security,” she said in an interview.

Later, in a debate, making a point about her toughness, she said, “I was asking questions about ISIS before my opponent ever moved to New Hampshire.”

Ms. Shaheen frequently refers to Mr. Brown’s move to New Hampshire, calling it opportunistic. She says that he does not really understand the state and that it is “not a consolation prize.”

After noting in her stump speech Mr. Brown’s membership on the board of a company, Kadant, that outsourced jobs[http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/politics/1044518-476/browns-270k-income-from-mass.-company-exporting.html], she includes this applause line: “We don’t need to import a senator who will outsource American jobs.”

This matters to voters like Rich Derby, 49, a postal worker, who went to a labor rally for Ms. Shaheen in Hooksett.

“Jeanne Shaheen is very supportive of New Hampshire,” he said. “I don’t like the out-of-state person coming in. He lost in Massachusetts and is now just trying to find a seat for himself.”

But if this is a wave election, the campaigns may have little control over the outcome.

“Obama could sink Shaheen,” said Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. “If we get five Ebola cases, if the stock market drops 500 points, if the Baghdad airport falls to ISIS, that will determine who wins and who loses.”

Ms. Shaheen was hit by a wave election in 2002, when, after three successful two-year terms as governor, she lost in her first try for the Senate. President George W. Bush was still popular after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and 2002 was one of the few midterm elections in the last century in which the party in the White House — then, the Republicans — gained seats in Congress.

Asked at a recent debate what lessons she had learned from that loss, Ms. Shaheen said: “That sometimes there are factors beyond your control, and there are things happening in the country that affect a race. I think we’re seeing this now in this race.”

On Campaign Road, Uneasy Democrats Show Obama Their Tail Lights

WASHINGTON — Bracing for a difficult election in just over a week, when they could lose control of the Senate, Democrats exasperated with the White House are already moving to pin blame on President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per], whom Republicans have made the centerpiece of the campaign.

Even optimistic Democrats say they have little more than a 50-50 chance to retain their Senate majority. Senior elected officials, strategists and donors have begun to openly criticize Mr. Obama, contending that his low popularity and some ill-advised remarks have proved toxic for candidates trying to distinguish themselves from the president to appeal to swing voters.

“It is all Republicans are running on,” Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas said. “It’s not necessarily the national environment as it is mismanagement by the White House, real and imagined.”

Mr. Obama’s loyalists argue the opposite, namely that the president could have helped increase the turnout among the coalition of young voters, women and minorities that he built during his campaigns. They fault this year’s political map, heavy on races in states the president lost, as primarily responsible for Democrats’ fortunes. And the president’s inner circle also says that if Democrats do hold the Senate, it will be because of money the president toiled to raise and of the few states — Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina — where his campaigns invested millions to develop organizations.

“If he gets blamed for some of the losses, I hope he also gets credit for developing some of the get-out-the-vote apparatus that could help save some of these seats,” said David Axelrod, a political adviser to Mr. Obama.

The rift represents a larger dispute about the party’s future going into the 2016 presidential race. It pits strategists who believe Democrats must carve out an identity independent from Mr. Obama to win over centrist voters against those who say turning out the president’s coalition is the new formula for success.

For now, though, the pre-emptive recriminations have begun. Tensions are growing between the White House and the party’s congressional leaders. Both sides are reluctant to air the dispute publicly, especially a week before the balloting, but some are acknowledging it exists.

“We have disagreements with the White House, but we also have a lot of things we agree on,” said David Krone, chief of staff for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.

Democrats were angered when Mr. Obama said in an Oct. 2 speech in Illinois[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/politics/in-illinois-speech-obama-trumpets-economic-successes.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias&] that his economic policies were on the ballot, and they were stunned last week when he said[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-MnDPirnrQ] on Al Sharpton’s radio show that Democratic candidates who have done so much to distance themselves from him “are all folks who vote with me.”

Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, said he was puzzled over how a president who so appreciates the power of words could have been so careless.

“This is Politics 101: Always make it about the voters, not about yourself,” Mr. Begala said. “I don’t understand it. It was an unforced error at a time we can ill afford them.”

Even some of the president’s closest associates were troubled that the address he delivered at Northwestern University this month was a statistics-laden argument about how the economy had improved rather than a jeremiad against Republican policies that could frame the election.

Mr. Obama, accustomed to adoring rallies during his presidential bids, is plainly disappointed that he has not been sought out more to fire up Democratic voters. It has been a decade since he confidently declared, hours before his Democratic National Convention debut[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/26/politics/campaign/26obama.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A11%22}], “I’m LeBron, baby. ... I got some game.”

When he has gotten out on the stump, Mr. Obama has conceded he is rusty. Last Sunday in his hometown, Chicago, at a rally[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/us/back-on-trail-obama-aids-maryland-democrat.html] for Gov. Pat Quinn — just his second campaign event of the day — Mr. Obama lost his voice.

“You can tell I’m out of practice,” he told the crowd of more than 6,000.

Backstage, he told Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a longtime ally, “I’ve got to do this more, get back into fighting shape.”

He is scheduled to attend a handful of campaign rallies between now and Election Day, for candidates for governor in Wisconsin, Maine, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Michigan, where he will also campaign in a Senate race that national Republicans are no longer contesting.

Mr. Obama is resigned to the diminished role, his allies say.

“Here’s the reality — he knows it, we know it — and that is that off-year elections are historically not kind to incumbent presidents,” Mr. Durbin said.

Yet at times, Mr. Obama’s actions and those of his political team have seemed off key to the point of damaging to fellow Democrats. Many of them cringed this month when the first lady, Michelle Obama, traveled to Iowa to campaign for Bruce Braley, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, in one of the nation’s closest races and referred to him repeatedly as “Bruce Bailey.” She returned to the state on Tuesday[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/22/?entry=3231&_php=true&_type=blogs&ref=politics] and joked about the mistake, but when the White House distributed the transcript of her remarks, it referred to Mr. Braley as a candidate for governor.

To some Democratic operatives, the White House detachment and belief that Mr. Obama’s presence in the race could offer a significant boost with the party base is all too reminiscent of the last election featuring an unpopular president in his sixth year.

“The same thing was happening in 2006,” said Ben Barnes, a Democratic donor, likening President George W. Bush’s attention to foreign affairs to Mr. Obama’s focus on issues such as the Islamic State and Ebola. “Everybody said Bush was ignoring the domestic front and the only thing he was focused on was Iraq.”

And, Mr. Barnes added, “Republicans were very nervous.”

Just as it did six years ago, that anxiety has partly manifested itself in pleas to keep the president out of the most competitive states. In one remarkable instance of political history’s repeating itself, former Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, who is running to regain the job as a Democrat, is now avoiding an appearance with Mr. Obama just as he did with Mr. Bush in the final days of the 2006 election when running as a Republican.

In some ways, though, Mr. Obama’s treatment by his own party has been even harsher, with a few candidates refusing to acknowledge whether they voted for him. Former President Bill Clinton has even devised a refrain emphasizing how Mr. Obama is a lame duck who will be gone when the senators running this year still have four years left on their terms.

“The cuts seem unkinder now than they’ve ever been,” said Jeff Shesol, a Democratic speechwriter.

If the language is barbed, it is because Democrats are uneasy. “Everybody is concerned,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. “Voters are unhappy with the president, but they are even more unhappy with Republicans in Congress.”

Democratic candidates, by distancing themselves from Mr. Obama, are responding to the political marketplace, party strategists say. “The public has forgotten — and this is not Iowa-specific but includes Iowa — the love affair it had with President Obama and the mess he inherited,” said Jerry Crawford, an Iowa Democratic activist.

And Republicans, putting aside their differences, have relentlessly sought to make Mr. Obama the defining issue of the campaign.

“Every Republican is running against Obama,” said Mr. Beebe, adding with a touch of amazement: “They’re talking about guys that were mayors who helped Obama as mayors.”

Former Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, recalled a conversation with a Republican official in his home state who said the party’s campaign against Senator Mary L. Landrieu could be captured in two words: “Obama bad.”

“Well, every single Senate candidate we have you can summarize the race by saying: ‘Obama bad,’ ” Mr. Breaux said.

New York Ebola Patient Enters Next, More Serious Phase of Illness, Officials Say

The condition of New York City’s first Ebola patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, worsened on Saturday, though he remained awake and communicative, health officials said.

Dr. Spencer, 33, was “entering the next and more serious phase of his illness, as anticipated with the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms,” Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the city’s public hospital system, said in a statement. Dr. Spencer has been in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center since Thursday, when he reported having a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of 100.3 degrees.

The statement was careful not to convey a sense of pessimism, and patients undergoing treatment can worsen before they recover. In a brief telephone interview from his room at Bellevue, Dr. Spencer spoke of his sickness in a neutral tone that seemed stripped of illusions: “I’m still undergoing treatment,” he said.

Dr. Spencer said he had received “about 200 calls from reporters and 300 emails.” Adding that he did not mean to offend, he said, with a touch of wry humor, that he had other priorities: “When you have Ebola, not the best way to spend your time.”

Asked how he was feeling at that moment, Dr. Spencer brightened, saying that, in spite of everything, “I am feeling well.”

Part of the usual course of the disease is the onset of diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which can cause patients to lose an enormous amount of fluids and electrolytes. That, in turn, can shut down their kidneys and disrupt the heart’s rhythm. The key to treating Ebola patients is supportive care, experts say, so that they can stay alive long enough to allow their immune systems to fight off the virus, which usually begins two to three weeks into the illness.

The Bellevue team caring for Dr. Spencer is in constant communication with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well with as hospitals that have successfully treated Ebola patients, including Emory University Hospital and the Nebraska Medical Center, according to Ms. Marengo’s statement. Like other Ebola patients, Dr. Spencer has been receiving both antiviral and plasma therapy, the statement said.

While the statement did not elaborate on the nature of the plasma therapy, some researchers believe that transfusing blood products from Ebola survivors into infected patients may help fight the virus, and the treatment has been used experimentally.

After Dr. Spencer was taken to the hospital on Thursday, the city began tracing all of his contacts back to Tuesday, when he first began feeling fatigued, though not feverish.

Over those two days, Dr. Spencer went jogging in his Harlem neighborhood and walked the High Line. He dined out and, the night before he developed a fever, went bowling in Brooklyn. He took three subway lines and a taxi.

City officials have been quick to reassure the public that people exposed to Ebola are not contagious until they are symptomatic, with one of the initial symptoms of infection being fever. The virus, experts say, is transmitted only through close contact with bodily fluids like blood, saliva, sweat or vomit, and does not live for long on surfaces like a subway pole. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have ridden the subway to show that it was safe.

After criticizing Dr. Spencer on Friday for not following the guidelines for quarantine — he had been monitoring his temperature, but not while under quarantine — Mr. Cuomo appeared to retreat from those remarks on Saturday.

“I didn’t mean to be critical of Dr. Spencer, and I hope that’s not the way it was interpreted,” Mr. Cuomo said. “He was a hero. I mean, these people go, leave this country, go to West Africa to help people with a terrible disease.” He added: “I think what he did was great.”

For his part, Mr. de Blasio continued to defend Dr. Spencer while speaking to reporters on Saturday, calling him “a soldier who goes into battle to protect us.”

The mayor played down the lack of notice city officials received from Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, before they ordered that travelers exposed to the virus be quarantined upon arriving at Newark Liberty International and Kennedy International Airports, despite opposition from many medical experts.

“In an atmosphere of crisis, we respect the chain of command,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said.

When the city health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett, was asked what she thought of the quarantine order, Mr. de Blasio stepped in, saying, “This is not about personalities.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its own statement on Saturday expressing support for health care workers like Dr. Spencer and Kaci Hickox, a nurse being held in quarantine at a hospital in Newark after returning from treating Ebola patients Sierra Leone, even though tests showed she did not have the virus.

“The epidemic there won’t end without them, and without their work, the U.S. will be at increased risk,” the C.D.C. said. "We must protect their health, safety and well-being and treat them with respect when they return home while continuing to take action to protect Americans so Ebola does not spread here.”

My Mother's Stroke

My mother, Milli, is 87 and has been cheerfully planning her exit for years. Living will, executed power of attorney, key to the safe deposit box and the names of the lawyer, doctor and financial planner were sent to me decades ago, along with jolly ''Death to me is just another adventure'' missives. My name has been on her checking account for 20 years, so that I can start paying the bills before rigor mortis sets in, a Depression-era concern I have never been able to dispel.

''What do you care if they get the electricity check a few weeks late?'' I say to my mother. ''You'll be dead.''

''The checks are in the bottom drawer in the computer room,'' Ma says. ''You won't have any problems.''

Of course, when that check-writing day arrived late last month and I got the call that my mother had had a major stroke at her home in Daytona Beach, Fla., my right arm was in a cast because I had shattered my wrist in a bike accident three weeks earlier.

Yes, folks, the person my mother designated to write her checks now can't write checks for herself (and that is why my column has been on hiatus since Sept. 14). ''Man plans, God laughs,'' the expression that makes me regret being an atheist. I can't drive, either. But it was off to join my two younger brothers at the hospital to see what was left of our mother.

''You gonna write about this?'' Ma says when I arrive a few days later. ''You should. You got plenty of material.''

Sounds O.K. Then she's instantly off the tracks.

''They're torturing me,'' she says. ''They stole my orange. I had it on the bottom of the refrigerator and they stole it. I'm gonna sue when I get out. I'm thinking 10 G's. That sound right to you?''

She cannot stand, let alone walk. Her left arm and leg are not moving. When the doctor asks what year it is, she says 1914. Her politics, however, remain intact.

''Who's the president, Mrs. Wadler?'' the doctor asks.

''Obama, the big liar,'' Ma says.

Her personality has also remained essentially unchanged. She wants all the medical people who walk into the room to read an article I wrote about a road trip we took in California that stars her and was recently reprinted in Reader's Digest. She'd had one of my brothers bring it from the condo, along with her Book of Psalms.

This is very flattering: King Solomon and me, neck and neck, though in Ma's head it is more likely King Solomon and her, neck and neck. She even recommends the story to me, on one of the days she does not recognize me.

''There's a funny story in that magazine over there,'' she says. ''You should read it.''

''I wrote it, Ma,'' I tell her. ''But thanks.''

This has to be one of the modern circles of hell, stroke. Or should we call it our plague? One day my mother is walking two miles on the beach and doing crossword puzzles in ink. The next day her brain explodes and she is talking about a new way to do CT scans, with a cat on her chest, hahaha.

Friends from the condo and the synagogue and the ham radio club come in, and you can read the fear of the future in their eyes as they take it in.

Stroke. Again. Oh, boy, and it's bad. We sat next to each other at the opera club and now she doesn't even know me.

Sometimes they drag me into the hall, hoping to stave off fear with good news from the miracle workers. What are the doctors saying? Subtext:

Will she always be like this? When it's my turn, will I be like this? Please, God, let mine be mild. A little weakness in my arm, I can live with that. Just don't touch the brain.

''They're torturing me here,'' my mother tells them, as Fox News, to which she has fallen asleep for years, plays silently in the background. ''I've got Ebola. I have ISIS.''

My best friend, Herb, who has flown in from New York after my brothers have to leave, to drive me to the hospital and Ma's financial planner and the Publix and to forge my signature on checks, figures it out. The crawl on Fox is shooting out scare words and Ma's brain has them linked.

''ISIS isn't a disease, it's a terrorist group, Milli,'' says Herb, who has known my mother for 40 years.

''I've got ISIS,'' Ma insists. ''I'm gonna make them test me.''

Which is not to say the basic personality has disappeared. It's just a little rawer. I always thought Ma was pure id, saying whatever came into her head, but now we are really down to bedrock. Sitting in a visitors' lounge or the dining hall, she shouts out news about her digestive tract that you would hesitate to confide to your primary physician.

On good days she's close to the old Ma, joking with Herb, saying that the applesauce in the cafeteria is the only thing they haven't managed to kill. On bad days she doesn't recognize him or tells me about the batch of kittens that somebody dropped off at the hospital, and I sit on the floor out of her line of vision and cry.

Herb and I stay at Ma's condo, a shrine to off-brand peanut butter and '70s orange sheets and towels with ducks on them. Two days in, my guts are frozen and I am getting up in the middle of the night, every night. I set about organizing Ma's walk-in closet.

I throw out interconnected, corroded, vertical skirt hangers that make the closet look like a World War I barbed-wire no man's land. I remove wadded-up tissues and hidden $20 bills from cracked plastic handbags. I get skinny, bright pink and velvety black Velcro hangers and separate silky synagogue blouses and casual knit tops, trying to hang things up perfectly with my one good hand.

I throw out shelves jerry-built from plastic milk cartons and scraps of plywood. I make Herb drive to the malls, where I buy even more Velcro hangers, dozens and dozens. When my bad hand starts to throb, I sit down on the floor and admire how beautifully the closet is coming along.

Four a.m., 6 a.m., left to right: knit shirts, pedal pushers, casual skirts, dress skirts, good pants, synagogue blouses, good suits. Lower level, cold-weather clothes for going north. Boxes on opposite wall, waist level; shorts, because you wear a lot of shorts in Florida. Shoes where Ma can easily see them, though I have to get them where she can more easily reach them, off the floor.

''What are you doing?'' Herb asks one daybreak, hearing me.

''I'm making it nice for her when she comes home,'' I say.

Then I amend it.

''I'm trying to fix it,'' I say. ''I'm trying to make believe it can be fixed.''

Finding Visible Hope Amid Ebola’s Invisible Danger

Video Journalist Ben C. Solomon has been covering the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone and Liberia for The New York Times since August. Working with Sheri Fink, a New York Times reporter and a physician, and Daniel Berehulak[http://www.danielberehulak.com/], a photographer, he recently did a video on an American-run clinic in rural Liberia. Earlier this month, he documented[http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/africa/100000003161313/fighting-ebola-outbreak-street-by-street.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As] an ambulance crew as it picked up sick patients — and dead bodies — in Monrovia.

Mr. Solomon spoke with James Estrin from Monrovia. Their conversation has been edited.

Q.

Tell me about the people you’ve been covering.

A.

I’ve met health workers who are very brave and very dedicated and overwhelmed a lot of the time. In their stories you find some of the most amazing acts of courage and dedication. I’m proud to be able to share those. And you meet people who are sick and people who survived.

When you talk to people about their families you find out quickly it’s never just one person in a family that gets sick. It’s always a group. Ebola is a family virus and it preys on intimacy. So when people are close, when people are together, it spreads among them. It’s so sad to see people get the disease from just trying to comfort a sick mother or sick son.

There are a lot of stories of people trying to do the right thing, but who don’t get the right education on taking the proper precautions to protect themselves.

Q.

You’ve done risky assignments before, like covering Libya[http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000001034034/a-survivor-in-libya.html] and Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/world/middleeast/Syrian-Refugees-in-Lebanon.html] and Ukraine[http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000002749138/confrontation-in-crimea.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As]. How does this compare?

A.

The danger is invisible. You never know when you are around something that could kill you. You really have to stay vigilant every time you’re outside working. This is a different kind of risk factoring process. It’s hard because it requires a lot of focus and a lot of dedication, but at the same time it’s really rewarding work.

The courage of some of the people I’ve met is really moving and inspiring so whenever you get the chance to give them the coverage they deserve it’s a really endearing thing.

Q.

What do you wear? Full protective clothing must be very hot.

A.

Each situation requires a different set of clothing and safety measures. We don’t walk around all the time in the same protective suits you see in a lot of the pictures.

There are times in dangerous situations when we have to wear those hazmat suits which are called P.P.E., or personal protective equipment. You have to judge each scenario differently — make your best picks for the places you are going.

If you wear those things all the time, people won’t talk to you because you’re just a big white-covered robot. At the same time, you need to protect yourself and factor in how you can get intimate with people and get people to understand you’re human and you’re compassionate. It’s a delicate balance.

Q.

How is this different from your previous assignments?

A.

This is the most stressful. When you’re covering a war or conflict where there is shooting or bombing you can usually leave and go back to a safer place to sleep. You can exhale and kind of relax. But here you never know if you’re safe. There is always the worry that you came in contact with the virus.

Many nights I wake up in the middle of the night and check my temperature and worry about what I’ve done the previous days. There’s always the question of whether you’re doing things right or not.

Q.

Many people would not choose to cover Ebola because of the danger. Why do you want to do this? On a certain level it almost seems irrational.

A.

I think my mom would agree with you.

It’s very easy to look at this story on the basis of numbers and how it’s spreading to Western countries and the hysteria that goes with that but on the ground it’s a very different story.

People are suffering and in very human ways going through some of the most difficult things you can experience. They can’t touch family members who are sick and this leads to these very sobering moments of how to express love when you can’t even be close to someone who you really value. So to me it’s really worth it.

Even if it is extremely dangerous, which it is, you can manage yourself, manage your safety and manage your stress. And if you do succeed in sharing these human stories it’s really valuable.

I’ve never been in a place where I’ve seen so much humanity and so much courage and hope.

As president of the United States Fund for Unicef, or Unicef USA, Caryl M. Stern travels the globe at a frenetic fund-raising pace, most recently to combat Ebola in Africa and to assist Syrian refugees. Halloween month, when the children's poverty organization sends cardboard trick-or-treat boxes to schools, is typically the busiest. This fall, Ms. Stern is also promoting her memoir, ''I Believe in Zero: Learning From the World's Children.'' She and her husband, Donald LaRosa, live in Bayside, Queens, with their youngest son, James LaRosa, a high school student. Their middle son, Lee, is a college sophomore. Brian, their eldest, and his wife, Cara, have two children, making Ms. Stern a grandmother at 57. And then there is Chip, the 11-year-old chow-shepherd mix.

TEA IN BED Sleeping late in my house means you get to sleep to 8 o'clock. By 7 a.m., my husband usually can't stand it anymore that he's the only one up and he will start talking to me. Frankly, he's very sweet. He'll usually bring me a cup of tea in bed. I am addicted to Lipton tea with milk and Sweet'N Low. He will pick up the newspaper and bring it upstairs with my tea.

EGGS ALL AROUND As soon as I'm awake enough, I head down to the kitchen. Our dog literally sits in front of the stove and he barks at me. His egg ration is dependent on whether anyone else is awake yet. Donald and I will have three eggs between two of us. If the kids are up, it depends on whether they're having French toast, and he'll get whatever eggs are left. The dog gets at least one egg, often closer to two. He likes them with cheese.

COOK FOR THE WEEK We have a book in our house and I will write down things for the week: what days I'm going to be away and what's everybody going to eat when I'm away. So Sunday becomes a cooking day. I bake for my kid who's away at college. I will usually bake him muffins. I'm baking for my son for the same reason I'm making eggs for the dog: He knows he's being thought of. It's a mom moment for me. Last week I made lasagna, I made chili and I made beef stew.

CARYL TIME It's not even supermom. I really like to cook. Cooking is really cathartic for me. I don't use recipes, I just taste, so I eat half of what I'm cooking. It's just so different from what I do the rest of the week, and it's something I do by myself. That hour to two hours I'm going to spend cooking and baking is really Caryl time.

GROCERY BONDING My friend Ilyne Rabinowitz is a nurse and she helps runs a home health care agency. Her life is as busy as mine, so the way we see each other is we go grocery shopping together. I tend to do most of my shopping at Waldbaums. We are pushing our wagons together, and while we're shopping, we talk.

TRICK, TREAT or DONATE We decorate our house for Halloween. We put a scarecrow out. We have a pumpkin planter. Part of the décor for my house is a big trick-or-treat box for Unicef. This year, in addition to a box, you can virtually trick or treat by creating your own fund-raising page.

POWER WOMEN ON PRIMETIME It is the only night that everyone in the house knows, if I'm watching a show on Sunday night, leave me be.

Sunday night I like to watch ''60 Minutes.'' And then I like to watch Tea Leoni's show because she's a Unicef ambassador but she's also a personal friend. I'm convinced in another life she would have been a secretary of state. She's a very bright woman, very quick in her thinking and very independent. And yet she has this crazy, kooky sense of humor.

Then I am addicted to ''The Good Wife.'' If I miss ''The Good Wife,'' then you can be sure I'm on-demanding it when I get back.

PUTTING OUT FIRES; THEN TO BED I rarely am asleep before midnight. In between everything I described, there will be 17 calls that come in, 100 emails that will show up in my inbox. Right now the world has more Level 3, which is the highest level, emergencies than I have seen in my career. There are five simultaneous Level 3 emergencies. I've been in Sierra Leone. I'm heartbroken. I've spent time in the refugee camps in Jordan.

BUT FIRST, REFLECT Part of my day is dedicated to thinking about everything we are doing and what more can we do. Even though we get to enjoy our Sundays, every day 17,000 kids die of causes we can prevent, and we're just not reaching them yet.

Morgan Dixon always had a plan, and it never involved staying in Cincinnati. Even in high school, she thought far beyond her hometown, writing officials in developing countries as part of the school's Amnesty International club and urging them to stop violating human rights. ''You have the world to explore!'' her parents wrote next to her picture in her 2002 yearbook. ''Enjoy Life!''

So Ms. Dixon explored -- China, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ghana, Burundi. She met her future fiancé, Craig Spencer, in a language immersion course in Henan Province in China in 2006 or 2007. He shared her passion for helping others less fortunate.

This week, after learning that Dr. Spencer had brought Ebola home to New York from Guinea, Ms. Dixon also checked herself into the hospital and was put in quarantine as a precaution. She returned home Saturday evening and will continue her quarantine there.

Ms. Dixon appeared to take the initial news with grace.

''She literally was like, 'This is amazing, being in a privileged position in a well-resourced country,' '' said a longtime friend, Shalva Wise, who said she spoke to Ms. Dixon by phone on Friday afternoon. ''She was also thinking about the folks over there who he left behind.''

Ms. Dixon was driven back around 6:30 p.m. on Saturday to the apartment she shares with Dr. Spencer on West 147th Street; she is expected to stay there until 9 a.m. on Nov. 14. Two unmarked police cars accompanied a sedan carrying Ms. Dixon. Three people escorted her inside; none of them wore protective clothing.

Dr. Jay Varma, a New York City deputy health commissioner, said that a health department official would be stationed at all times outside her door. The city's Human Resources Administration will supply Ms. Dixon with food and essentials, he said.

Though Ms. Dixon will be prohibited from receiving visitors, she will be able to contact friends and family through a tablet computer provided by the city, Dr. Varma added.

Ms. Dixon, 30, is a development associate at the Hope Program in Brooklyn, which helps homeless and other disadvantaged adults find and keep jobs.

Friends described her as ''liberal'' and ''flowing.'' She has been a vegetarian for years and she is enough of a fan of thrift stores that she uses ''thrift'' as a verb.

''I would describe her in a nutshell, she's about as liberal and earthy as you get,'' said Christopher Wintrode, 30, who was a class officer along with Ms. Dixon at Beloit College in Beloit, Wis. ''I was the head of the Young Republicans group on campus. It was good, I was really conservative, and she was really good at getting me outside of my box.''

While attending Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, she ran long distance as part of the Cross Country Killers, helped run the Amnesty International club and was chosen as the ''most creative'' graduating female student in her class.

Sera Dixon, Ms. Dixon's sister, said in a text message Friday night that her family would soon release a statement about Ms. Dixon and Dr. Spencer through Doctors Without Borders. ''They are both incredible humanitarian individuals and my personal heroes,'' she said.

In college, Ms. Dixon studied sociology and ecologically sustainable development while pursuing her interests in performing arts. Soon after graduating, she moved to China, where she taught English at the School of Foreign Language of Henan University in Kaifeng. She also studied a Chinese dialect -- and met Dr. Spencer, who, she told friends, was picking up the language much faster than she was.

The two dated between their travels, with Dr. Spencer pinballing around the world, always working to help with some disease somewhere. Sometimes they traveled together, going to Ghana in 2011, when Ms. Dixon worked on a poverty program.

Dr. Spencer asked Ms. Dixon to marry him on a camping trip with friends this summer.

While Dr. Spencer was in Guinea, he sent Ms. Dixon a photo essay showing how he changed into his protective gear: First, he wore his normal clothes, and then the next layer and the next. ''Eight layers later, you can't even tell who he is,'' Ms. Wise said. ''I'm just perplexed how this happened. Now no one's going to want to go there and treat people.''

Ms. Dixon had joked about how she might have to research ''What to do when your partner comes home from treating people with Ebola.'' But she was not panicked, Ms. Wise said.

On Thursday night, Ms. Dixon checked herself into quarantine at Bellevue. On Friday, she told Ms. Wise that the hospital staff had brought her colored pencils. Ms. Dixon also wanted to make sure that Ms. Wise had details for a show on Saturday night, a ''whodunit cabaret'' in Brooklyn, that Ms. Dixon and Dr. Spencer were supposed to attend. Ms. Dixon sent Ms. Wise a text message first.

''She said, 'Call me when you get this,' '' Ms. Wise said. ''She said, 'Craig and I are O.K.' ''

N.Y. / Region
Tested Negative, Nurse Criticizes Her Quarantine

A nurse who was being quarantined at a New Jersey hospital after working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone criticized her treatment on Saturday as an overreaction after an initial test found that she did not have the virus.

“I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa,” the nurse, Kaci Hickox, wrote in an essay [http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece] on the website of The Dallas Morning News, in collaboration with a friend who works for the paper. “I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear, and most frightening, quarantine.”

She described being held in isolation for about seven hours at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday, left alone for long stretches and given only a granola bar when she said she was hungry.

Ms. Hickox, 33, was placed in quarantine under a new policy announced Friday by the governors of New York and New Jersey. All people entering the United States through Newark Liberty and Kennedy Airports will now be quarantined for 21 days if they had direct contact with Ebola patients in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, even if they show no symptoms of infection.

On Friday night, New Jersey health officials said the nurse had developed a fever after landing, but on Saturday, they said her blood had tested negative for Ebola. Additional tests will be conducted to confirm the finding.

Ms. Hickox disputed that she had had a fever. She wrote that at the airport, a forehead scanner showed her temperature to be 101, but that came after four hours during which she had not been allowed to leave.

“My cheeks were flushed, I was upset at being held with no explanation,” she wrote. “The female officer looked smug. ‘You have a fever now,’ she said.”

She was eventually escorted by eight police cars to the hospital and taken to a tent outside the building. An oral thermometer showed her temperature to be 98, she wrote. A forehead scan taken around the same time read 101, she wrote, suggesting that it was not a reliable instrument to determine fever.

She wrote that the doctor felt her neck and rechecked the temperature. “ ‘There’s no way you have a fever,’ he said. ‘Your face is just flushed.’ ”

Her complaints served as a broadside against the new quarantine policy, which goes further than recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new policy has raised concerns among some health experts and doctors that it will discourage people from going to West Africa to try to contain Ebola at its source. The World Health Organization reported on Saturday that there were more than 10,000 suspected or confirmed cases [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137185/1/roadmapupdate25Oct14_eng.pdf?ua=1] in the three hardest-hit countries.

The C.D.C. calls for self-monitoring for travelers who have had contact with Ebola patients, but not isolation, because a patient is not believed to be contagious until symptoms appear. But C.D.C. officials said that states had the right to go beyond its recommendations.

On Saturday, in a sign of growing concern about the virus, Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, the home of another major travel hub, O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, began a quarantine program similar to the one in place in New York and New Jersey. Connecticut, which enacted a similar policy on Oct. 7, has quarantined nine people who have so far showed no symptoms.

New Jersey officials did not immediately respond on Saturday to the nurse’s complaints about her treatment and about the policy. The C.D.C., which is involved in the monitoring of travelers at the airport, did not immediately answer questions about how she had been handled.

On Friday, the day after a New York City doctor who had worked in Guinea through Doctors Without Borders tested positive for Ebola, the governors of New York and New Jersey described the quarantines as a necessary caution.

After a rally for his re-election campaign in Port Chester, N.Y., on Saturday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said aid groups had told him that their volunteers would want to be quarantined if they believed they might have been infected with Ebola. (Doctors Without Borders said on Saturday that “there is a notable lack of clarity about the new guidelines,” and that it was concerned about the treatment of Ms. Hickox, who worked with the organization.)

“They are responsible when it comes to health care,” Mr. Cuomo said of the aid groups. “You’re not going to have a health care professional come back and say, ‘I may have been infected, let me go run around and possibly expose people until we know.’ ”

Later, on his campaign bus, Mr. Cuomo said many details of the quarantine were still being figured out. “We’re learning,” he said. “None of us have been here. It’s an iterative process.” He added: “There is no written ‘Ebola Policy 2014.’ So you learn, you adjust.”

The doctor, Craig Spencer, 33, remained in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan on Saturday, and three people he had recently had contact with, including his fiancée, had been quarantined.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, seeking to tamp down fears, continued his reassurance tour on Saturday, sampling most of the menu at a meatball shop in Manhattan that Dr. Spencer had visited last week as “a reminder about some core truths about Ebola.”

“It cannot be contracted through casual contact. It is not an airborne disease,” he said, adding, “We’ve got to keep making clear to people, this is not the common cold, this is not the flu.”

In Brooklyn, the borough president, Eric L. Adams, went bowling at an alley that Dr. Spencer had visited the night before he reported a fever of 100.3.

In New Jersey, health officials did not say how long Ms. Hickox was to be kept at University Hospital. A hospital spokeswoman, Stacie Newton, said the nurse was in one of four extended treatment areas “in a building that’s part of the hospital.”

The nurse’s mother, Karen Hickox, said her daughter called her on Saturday morning crying. “She felt like you would treat a dog better than she’s been treated,” she said in an interview.

Kaci Hickox grew up in Texas and worked for the C.D.C. in Las Vegas until recently, when she moved to Fort Kent, Maine, her mother said. She has worked in several African countries with Doctors Without Borders.

In her essay, she described her last night at an Ebola management center in Sierra Leone, when she gave crushed Tylenol and anti-seizure medicine to a dying 10-year-old girl as her body jolted in bed. “It was the hardest night of my life,” she wrote.

“We need more health care workers to help fight the epidemic in West Africa,” she wrote. “The U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity.”

If Ms. Hickox was asymptomatic and not contagious, said Udi Ofer, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, he would have serious questions about the legality of her quarantine.

“Mandatory quarantine of people exhibiting no symptoms and when not medically necessary raises serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its police powers,” Mr. Ofer said. “Ebola is a public health issue, and the government’s response should be driven by science and facts and not by fear.”

Nicolas P. Terry, director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at the McKinney School of Law at Indiana University, said Ms. Hickox could challenge her quarantine on the grounds that she was being held without cause. But he said if the order was directed only at travelers in countries affected by Ebola and did not say they had to be symptomatic, then her only choice would be to challenge the validity of the order itself.

“If she fits the definitions and the symptoms of the New Jersey emergency regulation, they can keep her,” Mr. Terry said.

Kaci’s mother said she had sent Kaci a text message asking her daughter if she thought she would be detained when she returned home: “She texted back: LOL that’s not going to happen.”

Coalition Seeks to Send North Korea to International Court Over Rights Abuses

Correction Appended

UNITED NATIONS — Seven months after a groundbreaking report [http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/coidprk/pages/commissioninquiryonhrindprk.aspx] documenting how North Korea [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] tortured and starved its citizens, a broad coalition of countries is pushing for the first time to refer Pyongyang to the International Criminal Court [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_criminal_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org] for prosecution of crimes against humanity.

Japan and the European Union circulated a draft resolution last week among United Nations [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] member states that encourages the Security Council to refer North Korea to the tribunal in The Hague; 43 countries have so far signed on in support. The move builds on Secretary of State John Kerry’s bid last month to raise the profile of rights violations in North Korea by hosting an unusual session devoted to the issue on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s annual conclave.

On Wednesday, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, furthered that effort by presenting an award to the chief author of the landmark report, Michael D. Kirby, a retired Australian judge.

The efforts are a breakthrough for human rights advocates who have long urged world powers to scrutinize reported rights abuses in North Korea, and not just focus on its nuclear arms. The momentum has built since the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva called last March for accountability [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/asia/un-north-korea.html] after reviewing Mr. Kirby’s harrowing report [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/un-panel-finds-crimes-against-humanity-in-north-korea.html], compiled after interviews with 240 victims and witnesses who had escaped the country.

The report did not allege genocide, but said there had been crimes of “extermination” committed, as well as murder, enslavement, torture and rape. The testimony included allegations that pregnant women in the gulags were sometimes so badly beaten that they miscarried and that one woman had been forced to drown her baby.

If the diplomatic buildup reaches the Security Council in the coming months, it will most certainly ratchet up the pressure on China, which is Pyongyang’s chief ally, at a time when Beijing is seeking to bolster its international standing. It is clear to many diplomats here that China, which as one of five permanent members of the council holds veto power, is not likely to readily go along with a plan to refer North Korea to the court. And on Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said as much, stating that rights disputes should be handled through “dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.”

But, Mr. Kirby said, “we continue to hope that China, as a great power, will act as a great power.”

The efforts at the United Nations echo ones this year to refer Syria to the criminal court. Its ally, Russia, vetoed the measure, but was diplomatically isolated, and Western envoys later speculated that might have helped persuade Russia to go along with a measure to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid into opposition-held areas of Syria.

In any case, North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated and opaque countries, seems to be taking the threat of at least some action seriously. Its envoys have struck back in recent weeks with a mix of unusual diplomatic concessions, hard-line rhetoric and propaganda videos, handed out to reporters like Halloween candy in the corridors of the United Nations. Earlier this month, North Korea even circulated a draft measure of its own, calling on the United Nations to conduct an “unbiased reassessment” of its human rights record; it regards Mr. Kirby’s commission of inquiry as a Western plot.

Mr. Kirby, 75, with thinning hair and a slow gait, has emerged as a somewhat improbable standard-bearer in the movement to hold North Korea accountable for its reported rights violations.

Speaking last week to diplomats at an event organized by several countries’ delegations, Mr. Kirby urged diplomats to push the Security Council to refer North Korea to the international court — only to get into a spirited row with the diplomat representing Pyongyang.

Kim Song, a counselor from the North Korean mission, described the commission as “a political conspiracy by the United States and hostile forces.” Mr. Kirby sharply urged the diplomat to listen to the testimonies himself. Unbowed, the North Korean said the witnesses who testified were criminals.

Mr. Kirby’s voice shook a little in answering. “The truth in this report is very concerning to the world community,” Mr. Kirby shot back, “and your country has to face up to it.”

When the meeting finished, Mr. Kim, wearing the portrait of his supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, on his lapel, began handing out CDs entitled “Lie and Truth.” He said they told the true story of a prominent defector.

As part of its campaign against new scrutiny, North Korea has also released its own human rights report, claiming that it enjoys robust human rights including freedom of speech and protection from torture. In a diplomatic concession, it has agreed to subject itself to a periodic review of its human rights performance by the United Nations.

On Monday, the North’s ambassador to the United Nations, Jang Il Hun, made a rare appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/asia/north-korea-challenges-un-report-on-violations.html] in New York. He dismissed the proposed United Nations resolution as a “plot” by the United States to overthrow the government and warned vaguely of consequences for any talks on its nuclear program.

“If such attempt to sabotage or overthrow our system is the policy of the United States administration, then we cannot but re-examine our overall policy towards the United States,” Mr. Jang told the audience. [http://www.cfr.org/north-korea/conversation-jang-il-hun/p33642]

The next day, his government released an American detainee, Jeffrey Fowle [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/world/asia/north-korea-frees-one-of-three-americans.html], one in a series of conciliatory gestures that analysts have read as an attempt to draw the United States into dialogue even as it continues to build its nuclear arsenal.

Unlike previous resolutions to punish North Korea, the one being circulated includes the language on the International Criminal Court and is likely to come up for a vote in the human rights committee in November. It would need a majority of votes in the 193-member General Assembly after that.

Diplomats say they expect China to lobby vigorously against the I.C.C. language, especially among African states that have their own grievances with the international court. Ultimately, an I.C.C. referral can be made only by the 15-member Security Council.

For all the diplomatic jockeying, a Council referral is hardly enough to result in a prosecution. The Council referred both Darfur and Libya to the court, but the prosecutor has been unable to gain custody of any of the leaders that it has indicted, including Omar Hassan al-Bashir [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/world/africa/05court.html], who remains president of Sudan.

As Ebola spreads, Asia senses vulnerability; Health officials scramble to ready medical systems for first potential cases

With hundreds of advanced infection-control hospital rooms left over from the fight against SARS, and with some medical professionals suggesting that the Ebola virus was inherently fragile and unlikely to spread in places with modern medical facilities, many doctors in Asia paid little attention to the disease until very recently.

But that confidence — some say complacency — was punctured two weeks ago when two nurses in Dallas and another in Madrid fell ill while treating patients who had contracted the Ebola virus in West Africa. Governments and doctors around Asia are now much more worried that the region’s densely populated cities and towns could be vulnerable if infected people start flying here from Africa.

‘‘What happened in the States took us by surprise,’’ said Louis Shih, the president of the Hong Kong Medical Association. ‘‘We were sort of feeling like, ‘Oh, don’t worry’ — the medical sector is now quite alarmed.’’

An analysis published online last week by The Lancet, a medical journal, reviewed International Air Transport Association data for flights from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31 this year out of the three countries in West Africa with the biggest outbreaks of Ebola virus: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It found that six of the top nine destinations for travelers from these countries were elsewhere in Africa. The others were in Europe: Britain, France and Belgium.

But the 10th-largest destination was China. India was 13th. (Mali, a West African country that reported its first Ebola death on Friday, was 11th, and the United States was 12th.)

No other Asian countries appeared in the top 20, and there have been no publicly confirmed cases of Ebola yet in Asia.

Senior officials in China and India have been scrambling to prepare their countries’ medical systems to cope with possible cases. In India, top officials overseeing policy on health, civil aviation, shipping and other related issues met on Oct. 16 to coordinate plans. In China, the National Health and Family Planning Commission has called for medical institutions across the country to upgrade infection-control precautions by the end of this month.

‘‘The first thing at the top of their minds now is Ebola,’’ said Malik Peiris, director of the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, after meeting on Friday with senior Chinese doctors and officials from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dr. Peiris, who is best known as a leader in the fight against SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2003, said that flight and trade patterns between Asia and West Africa meant that five cities in the region would be at the front line in preventing Ebola from spreading: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in mainland China; Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory; and Mumbai in India.

Mainland China and Hong Kong have one unusual advantage in dealing with Ebola: their experience with the 2003 outbreak of SARS and their subsequent experience in coping with a series of outbreaks of rare strains of human and avian influenza viruses. Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing have all responded with lavish investments in hospitals equipped with the latest infection control equipment, much of which is made in China anyway.

Hong Kong, for example, only had several dozen hospital beds at the start of SARS that were designed for patients with highly infectious diseases. That total has rapidly expanded to 1,400 beds in a construction frenzy over the past decade. Fewer than 100 of those beds are used on any given day for patients with influenza or other infectious diseases. The rest of the beds are used by people with other ailments but are available on very short notice for advanced infection control.

The special biocontainment hospital rooms in Hong Kong, with one or two beds apiece, were built with features like negative air pressure and outdoor venting in case of another severe outbreak of a highly infectious respiratory ailment — features of little value in dealing with a disease like Ebola that is spread by contact with bodily fluids. But each special room in Hong Kong also has an anteroom that is designed for the safe donning and removal of personal protection equipment, making them well suited for coping with Ebola, Dr. Peiris said.

While some health care professionals in Spain have criticized a government decision there to allow a Spanish citizen with Ebola to be brought back to Madrid for treatment, Dr. Shih predicted that there would be no serious objections from doctors and nurses in Hong Kong if any Hong Kong citizens needed to be flown back from Africa to Hong Kong for advanced treatment. ‘‘I would be surprised if there would be any significant voices saying that here,’’ Dr. Shih said.

Doctors and nurses in Hong Kong stayed at their posts during SARS, even though dozens became infected and seven died, with bronze busts of them later placed in a memorial in a downtown park. By contrast, Taiwan in particular had a problem during SARS when medical professionals there stopped reporting for work or took other measures in efforts to avoid treating SARS patients.

‘‘We have the SARS experience, and I believe doctors in Hong Kong will be more aware of their protective gear than in other countries, including the United States,’’ Dr. Shih said.

Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China, has been a particular concern for an Ebola virus outbreak because it is the host of the Canton Fair, which is held twice a year and is the world’s largest trade exposition. It attracts 200,000 foreign buyers to each session, with up to a 10th of them from Africa. At the current session of the Canton Fair, which began on Oct. 15 and runs until Nov. 4, officials have been screening everyone arriving at the site for fevers, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.

But while the biggest mainland Chinese cities have advanced hospitals — Shanghai’s are particularly elaborate — health facilities are far less sophisticated elsewhere in China, and often rudimentary in villages. Buyers and other businessmen from Africa tend to stay in major cities when they travel to China, but there are also tens of thousands of Chinese workers in Africa who come home for annual vacations.

Many of these workers went overseas to flee the desperate poverty of their rural Chinese villages and go straight home to them. Chinese officials have said that they are screening travelers but have stopped short of announcing a comprehensive ban or quarantine on trips home by Chinese workers in Africa.

The main season for workers to return to China is the Lunar New Year, which falls in the middle of February next year.

The SARS and influenza outbreaks that prompted China’s heavy investment in infection-control facilities largely bypassed India. But if the Ebola virus reaches India, it could pose an even greater challenge to manage there than it would in China, Dr. Peiris said.

India is already struggling to manage an outbreak of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, that is reaching epidemic proportions. The analysis of flight information in The Lancet showed that India has less than one-fifth of China’s health care spending per person. India also has less than a fifth as many hospital beds per 1,000 people as China.

Any widespread transmission of Ebola in Asia would be a humanitarian disaster. But even a handful of cases could also bring economic disruption to a region that is heavily dependent on trade.

Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist who has long specialized in China’s trade ties with the Middle East and Africa, warned in a speech on Oct. 20 in Hong Kong that Asia was especially vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. Very large numbers of Asian nationals now work overseas and come home regularly, and very large numbers of business travelers come to the region, particularly China, from practically every country in the world, said Mr. Simpfendorfer, who is the managing director of Silk Road Associates, a Hong Kong consulting firm.

‘‘This region is particularly vulnerable to pandemics,’’ he said, ‘‘because of the number of people flying to here and from here.’’

Wikipedia Is Emerging as Trusted Internet Source for Information on Ebola

As a fresh wave of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fear grips the American public, the Internet is rife with conspiracy theories, supposed miracle cures and Twitter posts of dread.

But amid the fear mongering are several influential sites that are sticking to the facts about Ebola. Millions have come to rely on these sites, including those run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and Wikipedia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/wikipedia/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

Wikipedia? The online encyclopedia’s Ebola Virus Disease[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease] article has had 17 million page views in the last month, right up there with the C.D.C.’s Ebola portal and the W.H.O.’s Ebola fact sheet[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/], as well as the Ebola coverage of prominent health care brands like WebMD and the Mayo Clinic[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebola-virus/basics/definition/con-20031241]. Once the butt of jokes for being the site where visitors could find anything, true or not, Wikipedia in recent years has become a more trusted source of information — certainly for settling bar bets, but even for weighty topics like Ebola.

“It is because Wikipedia is such a recognized brand — obviously the C.D.C. is still much more authoritative than we will ever be — that people will click on that link,” said Dr. Jacob de Wolff, 37, an internist at Northwick Park Hospital in London, who founded Wikiproject Medicine in 2004 and has seen it go from obscurity to mockery to acceptance.

On Oct. 15, when it was announced that a second nurse in Dallas had tested positive for the virus, traffic for the Ebola Virus Disease article on English Wikipedia’s site reached a peak of 2.5 million page views — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 3.5 million page views that day of its Ebola content, while the Mayo Clinic Ebola content had about 200,000. Search engines, no doubt, drive such traffic totals. An “Ebola” Google search had put Wikipedia’s article above the C.D.C.’s portal. But this weekend Google highlighted the C.D.C. material and moved it to the top. Bing uses Wikipedia’s article for its Ebola summary. 

The initial skepticism about Wikipedia was mainly structural: how could you trust an article in an “encyclopedia that anyone can edit?” The growing confidence in the site — certainly when it comes to public health articles — in part reflects the fact that much of Wikipedia is not edited by just “anyone.”

“Wikipedia is a do-ocracy,” said Dr. James Heilman, an emergency room doctor from British Columbia, Canada, who leads the Wikiproject Medicine that keeps close watch on the most important public health articles, like Ebola Virus Disease. “Those who do the most, do have a greater influence.”

Many impediments exist to someone casually editing the Ebola article. Only registered Wikipedia editors with at least some experience are permitted to edit the page, and the requirement for sourcing is much more rigorous than for other Wikipedia entries. Newspaper articles, for example, do not cut it.

“A key group of us keep an eye on articles that have become more popular to make sure that Wikipedia’s most-read content is of a reasonably high standard,” Dr. Heilman said.

Other health care sources have adapted to the intense interest in Ebola. UpToDate[http://www.uptodate.com/contents/ebola-the-basics], a subscription service mainly used by doctors and owned by the Dutch company Wolters Kluwer, has made its Ebola information free to the public, including a summary of the basics of the disease written from a patient’s point of view. The publicly traded WebMD said[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ebola-fever-virus-infection] that since the beginning of October millions of people have searched the virus on the site, and the site has produced articles, slide shows and even a quiz to reinforce best practices.

“We pride ourselves on not being sensationalist,” Dr. Michael W. Smith, the chief medical editor at WebMD, said in an interview. “If you are turning to credible sources of information, you would not panic.”

The editors of Wikipedia’s Ebola page say they earned a place as one of those credible sources. To protect against misinformation, potential editors must suggest adds or changes to the article on a separately maintained[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ebola_virus_disease] page, where editors, frequently Dr. Heilman, review them and decide whether to incorporate them.

Dr. Heilman, 35, the head of the emergency medicine department at East Kootenay Regional Hospital in Cranbrook, B.C., said that since January he had taken fewer shifts at the hospital so he could keep tabs on things and contribute to Wikipedia’s medical articles. He is unabashed about his goals: to emphasize that Ebola does not get transmitted through the air; to call out unproven treatments; and to make sure the language is as simple as possible, in part so it can be more easily translated into other languages.

“We don’t need to write for experts, experts have lots of excellent sources,” he said.

On the public page where changes to the Ebola article are discussed, you can see suggestions that never made it. One user objected on animal rights grounds that the article calls for killing infected animals rather than quarantining them. Another said a Thai doctor had made progress on a cure, citing a few newspaper articles.

Periodically, the article will be criticized for being too simplified — there will be arguments over whether “hemorrhage” is the same as “bleed”and if the article should point out that there are multiple strains of the Ebola virus. Others wonder why it includes so little discussion about the current outbreak. It is covered in a separate article.

“My position is that people come to Wikipedia for an overview, for the background picture and by taking an article on a disease and skewing it to the outbreak we are doing a disservice,” Dr. Heilman said.

The 300 or so core editors of Wikipedia’s medical articles tend to be highly educated, Dr. Heilman said. A recent survey, he said, found that half of that core group work as, or are studying to be, health care providers and 85 percent have completed college.

That well-schooled contributor pool is only going to get bigger starting on Monday, when the University of California, San Francisco, begins an elective class for fourth-year medical students that focuses on Wikipedia editing.

The teacher, Dr. Amin Azzam, a health sciences associate clinical professor at the medical school, said 17 students had enrolled, a large increase from the five who took the introductory version of the class in December.

He said he was not certain whether any of his students would work on the Ebola article, but that it was possible they would urge other students concentrating on infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to contribute to it.

“I now believe it should be our professional duty to contribute to Wikipedia — one of the fastest ways we can improve the health of our entire planet!” he wrote by email.

Under Pressure, Cuomo Loosens Policy for Ebola Quarantines in New York

Facing fierce resistance from the White House and medical experts to a strict new mandatory quarantine policy for all medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] said Sunday night that people quarantined in New York who do not show symptoms of the disease would be allowed to remain at home and would receive compensation for lost income.

Mr. Cuomo’s decision came after a weekend in which administration officials urged him and Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey to reconsider the mandatory quarantine they announced on Friday. Aides to President Obama also asked other governors and mayors to follow a policy based on science, seeking to stem a steady movement toward more stringent measures in recent days at the state level.

The announcement by Mr. Cuomo seemed intended to draw a sharp contrast — both in tone and in fact — to the policy’s implementation in New Jersey, where a nurse who arrived Friday from Sierra Leone was swiftly quarantined in a tent set up inside a Newark hospital, with a portable toilet but with no shower.

It was the second striking shift in Mr. Cuomo’s public posture on the Ebola crisis in 72 hours; after urging calm Thursday night, then joining Mr. Christie to highlight the risks of lax policy on Friday, Mr. Cuomo on Sunday night appeared to try to stake out a middle ground.

He said his decision balanced public safety with the need to avoid deterring medical professionals from volunteering in West Africa. “My number one job is to protect the people of New York, and this does that,” he said. Those quarantined at home will be visited twice a day by local authorities, he said. Family members will be allowed to stay, and friends may visit with the approval of health officials.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, sitting beside Mr. Cuomo, nodded in approval, and praised the governor for developing a set of more flexible quarantine guidelines that, the mayor said, would show proper respect to those required to abide by them.

Throughout the weekend, the quarantine orders by Mr. Christie, a Republican, and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, drew withering criticism from many medical experts, who said they would discourage aid workers from volunteering to help eradicate the disease at its source. By midday Sunday, Kaci Hickox, the nurse who became the first person isolated under the new protocols in New Jersey, emerged as the public face of the opposition, calling the treatment she received “inhumane” and disputing Mr. Christie’s assertion a day earlier that she was “obviously ill.”

“If he knew anything about Ebola he would know that asymptomatic people are not infectious,” Ms. Hickox told CNN.

Even some who acknowledged the states’ authority to enact the policy took issue with its implementation in New Jersey.

“We have to think how we treat the people who are doing this noble work,” said Mr. de Blasio, who was not consulted by Mr. Cuomo or Mr. Christie before their Friday announcement, though his administration is overseeing the care of an Ebola patient. At a late afternoon news conference, he said Ms. Hickox’s treatment was “inappropriate,” adding: “We owe her better than that.”

Yet amid heightened public anxiety about the government’s handling of the crisis, state authorities have increasingly calculated that the mandatory quarantines will prove prescient. Since the governors’ announcement, two more states, Illinois and Florida, have said they were instituting similar measures.

“I think this is a policy that will become a national policy sooner rather than later,” Mr. Christie said in an interview on Fox News Sunday.

The Cuomo and Christie administrations began seriously considering a quarantine on Tuesday, aides said, after federal officials decreed that travelers returning from Ebola-stricken countries in West Africa could enter the United States only at five designated airports, including Kennedy and Newark.

Mr. Cuomo had long suspected the virus would arrive in the area, his office said, and privately voiced this belief after the Ebola patient in Dallas, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on Oct. 8, an aide said.

In New Jersey, officials said, Mr. Christie had grown increasingly frustrated by mid-October over the failure of medical professionals to properly isolate themselves on a voluntary basis after returning from West Africa.

Mr. Christie and his team were startled to learn that Dr. Nancy Snyderman, an NBC News correspondent who had traveled to Liberia and whose cameraman had contracted Ebola, left her home in Princeton, N.J., on Oct. 9 to pick up food at a favorite local restaurant.

When a doctor, Craig Spencer, tested positive in New York City on Thursday, the two governors watched as city officials strained to trace his every movement — on the subway, at a bowling alley, at a meatball shop.

What appeared to be a triumph of meticulous forensic work by New York City health officials, in retracing Dr. Spencer’s every step late last week, looked like a potential nightmare to governors who suddenly contemplated having to repeat such an exercise over and over, across their states, should more individuals violate voluntary isolation guidelines.

Over a series of phone conversations starting on Thursday night, shortly after Dr. Spencer was diagnosed, and continuing Friday morning, Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo decided to impose the mandatory quarantines, officials said — essentially declaring that neither state trusted those potentially exposed to the deadly disease to wall themselves off from the rest of society.

Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the notion of a mandatory quarantine had always been considered as an option to contain the virus, and that the plan had been quietly vetted by attorneys and some public-health officials.

Neither governor notified the White House.

It did not take long for a test case to walk through the doors of Newark Liberty International Airport[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/newark_liberty_international_airport_nj/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Ms. Hickox, who had treated Ebola patients in West Africa, arrived at around 1 p.m. Friday, and immediately became ensnared in the new regime.

In a way, the NBC episode worked to New Jersey’s benefit. Because of it, Mr. Christie and his aides had already developed a legal framework for mandatory quarantines, which they applied to Ms. Hickox.

The benefits, supporters said, were clear: soothing public concerns with more aggressive monitoring at the front end and sparing officials from exhaustive retracing after the fact.

For Mr. Cuomo, though, embracing the policy proved somewhat complicated. Earlier this month, he cast decisions on screening procedures as “a federal issue.” In a news conference announcing Dr. Spencer’s positive test on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo appeared beside Mr. de Blasio and health officials to urge calm. (The city said Sunday that Dr. Spencer “looks better than he looked yesterday.” He remained in serious but stable condition.)

By Friday, at his announcement with Mr. Christie, the tone had changed starkly.

“In a region like this,” Mr. Cuomo said, “you go out one, two or three times, you ride the subway, you ride a bus, you could affect hundreds and hundreds of people.”

City officials, who were not consulted on the two governors’ decision, learned of it as the public did: on television, on Twitter and in breaking news clips that begin filling their inboxes, administration officials said. A room-to-room scramble began at City Hall: Who, senior aides asked, had been briefed about this? The answer was no one.

Mr. de Blasio has been careful to say that states were within their rights to set such policies. But administration officials, including Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the health commissioner were livid. Others close to the mayor said Mr. Cuomo had recklessly pierced the fragile calm the city had worked to establish in the immediate aftermath of Dr. Spencer’s positive test and took particular issue with the governor’s comments about public transportation.

At the White House, Obama administration officials said they sought repeatedly to persuade Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo to walk back the quarantines, which they viewed as not just unnecessary but likely counterproductive. (Mr. Christie insisted on Sunday that he had “gotten absolutely no contact” from the White House at a fund-raiser in Florida.)

The decisions by the states, White House officials and others warned, could hamstring the effort to staff up to 17 Ebola treatment units that American military personnel are building in Liberia. American health officials had already been facing the difficult task of finding volunteers to go to the hardest hit countries to staff the hospitals, and have accepted help from foreign nationals, including Cuba, to aid the effort.

“It’s a big concern,” said James P. Mitchum, chief executive officer of the charity Heart to Heart International, which has begun training workers at the International Medical Corps treatment unit in Bong County, Liberia. “Every time someone tightens that noose, health workers from the United States say, ‘Well, I’m not sure it’s worth that sacrifice.’”

A senior official, who spoke on background to discuss private discussions with state officials on the issue, called the governors’ plan “uncoordinated, very hurried, an immediate reaction to the New York City case that doesn’t comport with science.”

But Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie were not out on their own for long. Late Friday, Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, a Democrat, issued a mandatory quarantine order for “high-risk” individuals who have come in contact with patients in West Africa. On Saturday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, signed a similar order.

On Sunday morning, Mr. Christie predicted on Fox News that federal officials would adopt the same standards “sooner rather than later.”

The Obama administration suggested otherwise. Officials said the quarantine rules could create “a system of perverse incentives,” encouraging health care workers to fly into a different airport, like Atlanta or Washington Dulles, that is not located in states that have adopted new policies.

On Sunday afternoon, President Obama gathered top advisers for a meeting at the White House to work on a new, nationwide standard for returning health care workers. That policy is likely to advise against a total quarantine of those returning workers, a senior administration official said.

A group of scientists, public health experts and other opponents of the mandatory quarantine addressed a letter on Sunday to Mr. Cuomo, urging him to end the policy.

Ms. Hickox, the nurse, has retained a civil rights lawyer to challenge the quarantine order and get her out of isolation. In the interview with CNN, Ms. Hickox said officials had not informed her what they planned to do next or why they were isolating her despite her showing no symptoms.

As States Look to Halt Ebola, Restrictions Prompt a Debate

It was nearly 100 years ago that an influenza pandemic led to sweeping quarantines in American cities, and it was more than two decades ago when patients in New York were forced into isolation after an outbreak of tuberculosis.

In modern America, public health actions of such gravity are remarkably rare, and the decisions by New York and New Jersey on Friday to quarantine some travelers returning from the Ebola zone in West Africa are taking public officials into unfamiliar legal and medical territory.

From public health advocates and civil liberties lawyers has come sharp criticism, and the first person to be detained under the new protocol, a nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey upon returning from Sierra Leone, lashed out on Sunday at Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] as her lawyer said he would mount a legal challenge to her confinement.

Mr. Christie on Sunday defended his policy, and Florida and Illinois have ordered similar restrictions. In Connecticut, nine people who may have been exposed to Ebola have been confined to their homes under an order signed by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on Oct. 7.

But on Sunday night, barely two days after his joint announcement with Mr. Christie, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York announced his state would not go as far as New Jersey has.

The nurse, Kaci Hickox, said on Sunday in an interview with CNN that she felt her “basic human rights have been violated.”

Donna E. Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the most restrictive protocols are far too broad.

“The current order is sweeping in individuals who are asymptomatic and who may never develop symptoms,” Ms. Lieberman said. “I think there is a serious question as to whether the governor has the authority to impose the broad quarantine that he has imposed,” she added.

The quarantine by New Jersey of medical workers returning from Ebola-afflicted areas of West Africa is virtually without precedent in the modern history of the United States, public health and legal experts said on Sunday.

“This is, I think, pushing the envelope quite a bit and is highly counterproductive,” Lawrence Gostin said, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University who has studied the legal issues around quarantining Americans. “I can’t think of a situation where any jurisdiction in the United States in modern times has simply quarantined a whole class of people.”

In a new era of mass travel and global pandemics, public health officials have seen the utility of quarantines to rein in outbreaks that appear to be spiraling out of control. But the approach, experts said, is an extreme one.

“It doesn’t seem like we’re to that stage yet,” said Steven D. Gravely, who helped Virginia rewrite its laws on quarantine to make it easier for the state to respond quickly to disease outbreaks. Instead, he said, “there’s so much anxiety right now, that’s become the problem.”

Government officials, he added, need to explain “why are you doing this, what do you hope to accomplish. Because otherwise people read into it things that are not there.”

The power to impose quarantine derives from the general police power granted to states in the Constitution. But over the last century, state and federal authorities have moved away from blanket applications of categories of people, said Dr. Gostin, adding that one would have to reach back to the influenza pandemic of 1918 to find a parallel for the sort of blanket approach being employed in response to Ebola in New Jersey.

Since then, public health officials moved away from general quarantines — seen as having only limited effectiveness even when employed against the flu a century ago — as antibiotics and other new treatments were developed to more directly address the contagious without affecting those who might have been exposed but display no sickness.

At the height of the AIDS epidemic, quarantines were advocated from some quarters, but no such measure was ever adopted. Similarly, there were no Americans quarantined or isolated during recent pandemics of H1N1 or SARS.

The last time patients in New York City were forced into isolation came with the outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the early 1990s, said Wendy E. Parmet, professor of health policy and law at Northeastern University School of Law. In those cases, officials targeted those recalcitrant patients who refused to take their medications, she said, rather than every person who tested positive, and even that practice faced court challenges. The approach resulted in the less restrictive “directly observed therapy,” in which patients were forced to take medications in front of officials, she said.

“I’m very troubled by what we’re seeing and not seeing,” said Dr. Parmet. “Coming down hard makes good press but it doesn’t make good public health.” She added: “Treating nurses like criminals is not the way to go,” she added.

While Governor Cuomo provided the first details of New York’s plans, New Jersey has provided little information about how it plans to carry out its quarantine process.

“I’m very worried about it, said Mr. Gostin. “We used to think that we had balanced public health and civil liberties, but I think in this case we have forgotten that balance. And I’m one who thinks that we should always privilege public health. I’m not a civil libertarian.”

Udi Ofer, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_civil_liberties_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org] in New Jersey, said the policy of quarantining health care workers like Ms. Hickox, a nurse, raised serious concerns “about the state abusing its powers” and could spread the very fear that the order appeared aimed at counteracting.

“By forcibly detaining people we are also frightening the public and may deter genuinely sick people who fear quarantine from seeking the treatments they deserve,” Mr. Ofer said in an email.

The quarantine announced by the governors on Friday has pitched the country into largely uncharted legal waters.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which formulates and advices on policies such as infection control, does not have regulatory authority over domestic health emergencies. That falls to the states. However, the policy announced on Friday relates to international movement, a realm that legal experts say is solidly within the bounds of federal authority.

“If the feds thought the quarantine imposed by the three states interferes with federal authority over international or interstate movement, they could challenge what the states have done,” said David Paul Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University and an expert on quarantine.

Perhaps more likely, he said, would be that a returning health worker forced into quarantine challenges that action in federal court as a violation of their constitutional rights. The federal court would either strike down the quarantine altogether, because of existing facts, such as no evidence of spread in the community, or rule more narrowly on the individual’s case.

White House and Governors Clash Over Ebola Response

Good Monday morning from Washington. With eight days until the midterm elections, Republicans’ chances of winning control of the Senate[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/upshot/a-republican-edge-with-more-stability.html?src=twr&abt=0002&abg=0] have risen to 68 percent, as Democratic dreams of a South Dakota upset have faded. Mitt Romney and Bob Dole are stumping together in Kansas, while the Bush family is embracing a Jeb Bush run for president and President Obama is at the White House honing his Ebola strategy.

The last time a disaster brought together the Obama administration and the governors of New York and New Jersey — that would be Hurricane Sandy — everyone sang “Kumbaya.”

With the Ebola crisis, it’s another tune entirely.

The announcement by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York that health care workers would be quarantined[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html?ref=politics] when they returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa directly contradicts advice from President Obama‘s top health officials.

That disagreement was laid bare on Sunday, with administration officials sending Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to the Sunday talk shows to express dismay about what the governors had done.

Privately, administration officials were working with the governors to get them to modify the policy, at least until Mr. Obama’s team rolls out a new nationwide approach. On Sunday night, Mr. Cuomo clarified his order to allow for monitored self-isolation in some cases.

The federal-state conflict is rare because it concerns a nonpolitical crisis that usually unites politicians.

Mr. Obama convened his team on Sunday in the hopes of developing a policy that everyone might ultimately back. Aides said that policy could be ready in the next few days, a development that could help Mr. Obama seize the initiative from the two governors.

Ebola Crisis Brings Out the Best and Worst of Christie

Ebola has captured all that is refreshing and infuriating about Gov. Chris Christie.

Herewith, a guide.

Christie knows best: The governor who once told New Jersey residents to “get the hell off the beach” is essentially telling medical professionals who might have been exposed to Ebola to get the heck out of public. It’s classic Christie candor, infused with overt paternalism but communicated with just enough compassion to avoid sounding cruel. Mr. Christie has offered tender words for the medical workers who have risked their lives to stop the epidemic.

He doesn’t need your permission: A central pillar of the Christie brand is liberation from traditional and (to his mind) calcified sources of authority, like labor unions, or, say, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He trusts his gut, and you should, too. Ergo, when he debated whether to order the new quarantine regimen, he did not convene a blue ribbon commission or even consult with the White House. “I did not let them know,” he told us on Sunday in Florida.

He’s right, you’ll see: He has unwavering faith in the wisdom of his own judgment. Which explains why, on Sunday, he predicted that skeptics would wake up one morning and realize that he was correct, not them. “I think the C.D.C. eventually will come around to our point of view on this,” he told Fox News.

He reads the public mood: To many Americans, the quarantine sounds like an eminently reasonable action that cuts through the highfalutin debate. By Sunday, two states – Florida and Illinois – had followed his lead, instituting similar policies.

Torture Report’s Fate May Hinge on Results of Midterms

The increasing prospect of a Republican takeover of the Senate is raising questions about the fate of a long-delayed report revealing C.I.A. torture of detainees suspected of terrorism, as the White House and the Senate Intelligence Committee continue to haggle over the review.

Many Senate Republicans were strongly opposed to the report, which was written by Democrats and is known to be highly critical of the Bush-era tactics. It remains caught up in a dispute over how much the Obama administration has censored the document.

But if Republicans take over the Senate before the report is released, the Intelligence Committee’s new majority will have the opportunity to drag out the release, or bury it.

The current fight is just about the 400-page executive summary; a push to declassify the entire 6,000-page study would no doubt incite an uproar.

One Republican played down the possibility of added delays, noting that Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, now the panel’s the top Republican and a leading critic of the report, would soon be out of Congress. But influential Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona will still be there, and Mr. McCain wants the report made public.

Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee chairwoman for now, is pushing to wrap up the negotiations and release the report during November’s lame-duck session. The primary sticking point is the Obama administration’s insistence that the pseudonyms of C.I.A. officers mentioned in the report be blacked out. Democrats on the committee claim that by not using the names, which are not the intelligence officers’ actual identities, the report’s narrative is distorted.

McConnell’s Nightmare: G.O.P. Wins Control of a Senate He’s Not In

For Senator Mitch McConnell, a politician who has spent much of his life pursuing the dream of becoming Senate majority leader, the prospect of guiding Republicans back into power only to lose his own seat would amount to a heartbreaking coda to a remarkably ambitious career.

“I think that would be devastating,” said Bob Bennett, a former Utah senator and McConnell confidant. “He eats, breathes, sleeps, drinks politics.”

Mr. Bennett recalled traveling with former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, once a majority leader himself, during the 1996 presidential campaign — when Mr. Dole was the Republican nominee — and coming to the conclusion that he “had no life outside of politics.”

“And I thought that ‘Well, that’s a little sad.’ ”

He said the same was true of Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who was also a Senate majority leader, “and some of the other leaders.”

“McConnell loves University of Louisville sports, and he loves Elaine Chao [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/us/politics/girding-for-a-fight-mcconnell-enlists-his-wife.html],” Mr. Bennett continued, referring to Mr. McConnell’s wife. “And other than that – ha – politics is his life. And I think it would be very, very, very, very tough on him.”

But, Mr. Bennett added, “I do not expect it to happen.”

If You Built a White House Moat, Wouldn’t You Need a Drawbridge?

Buffer zones; bigger, better, higher fences; more dogs, off the leash.

But a moat?

Michael Palumbo, a West Coast architect, says it’s not that outlandish of an idea. He has, in fact, already designed about half a dozen moats for wealthy clients.

“In the old days, you would put an alligator or dragon in it,” Mr. Palumbo said, half-jokingly (dragons?). The modern-day deterrents include electric currents, netting and sensors that set off alarms if anyone tries to ford the moat.

The cost? Accounting for the size of the property, a moat that is 15 feet deep and 20 feet wide would probably cost about $15 million and take two years to complete, he said.

The biggest obstacle, Mr. Palumbo said, would be political: “It would take an act of Congress.”

Good morning on this crisp Monday.

Ebola continues to dominate the news this morning.

A 5-year-old boy who recently returned from Guinea is being tested at Bellevue Hospital Center[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/5-year-old-new-york-ebola.html] after developing symptoms consistent with the disease, city officials said.

And the nurse quarantined in New Jersey will be released[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-to-be-allowed-to-finish-ebola-quarantine-at-home-christie-says.html] from the hospital to complete her quarantine at home in Maine.

In the case of the boy, blood test results should be known by early afternoon, said Mary T. Bassett[https://twitter.com/DrMaryTBassett/status/526714479393144833], the city’s health commissioner.

He was taken to Bellevue on Sunday and developed a fever while there, around 7 a.m. today, the city said.

Ram Raju, head of the city’s public hospitals, said[https://twitter.com/ChrisCuomo/status/526703014237966336] that the authorities are still putting together a contact history for the boy.

The New York Post reported[http://nypost.com/2014/10/27/5-year-old-boy-being-tested-for-ebola-in-new-york-city/] that five members of his family are quarantined in their apartment in the Bronx.

The nurse in New Jersey, Kaci Hickox, who was quarantined in a tent behind a Newark hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/nurse-who-spoke-out-about-quarantine-felt-a-calling-for-health-care-friends-say.html] on Friday after returning from Sierra Leone, will be released today pending federal approval, our colleagues Michael Barbaro and Marc Santora report this morning.

Ms. Hickox, who has tested negative for Ebola, became the voice of opposition to mandatory quarantine after she criticized her treatment[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-tests-negative-for-ebola.html?ref=nyregion] as “inhumane.”

In other Ebola developments:

• On Sunday, the governors of New York and New Jersey, under pressure from President Obama and medical experts, eased restrictions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html] on travelers returning from West Africa.

Both governors announced that people, including medical workers, who have had contact with Ebola patients but are asymptomatic could be quarantined at home, not at hospitals.

• Craig Spencer, the doctor being treated for Ebola at Bellevue, remains in serious but stable condition.

His condition worsened over the weekend[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/nyregion/new-york-ebola-patient-enters-next-more-serious-phase-of-illness-officials-say.html] but had improved by Sunday.

On this date in 1904, under the ground near City Hall, Mayor George B. McClellan grabbed a silver controller and set the city’s subway system in motion.

The train ran a nine-mile, 26-minute route to Grand Central and Times Square and up the West Side to 145th Street.

All along the way, The Times wrote[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06EFD71230EE32A2575BC2A9669D946597D6CF], “crowds of excited New Yorkers were collected around the little entrances talking about the unheard trains that they knew were dashing below, and waiting eagerly for the first passengers to emerge from the underground passageways at their feet.”

By the end of the day, more than 125,000 passengers had boarded, “amid the tooting of whistles and the firing of salutes, for a first ride in a subway which for years had been scoffed at as an impossibility.”

“They’re completely inhuman,” says Justin Richards. “They have an eye but it doesn’t look anything like an eye, and they’ve got a hand of sorts but it doesn’t look anything like a hand, and they have no legs. So it’s something totally different from what we’re used to either in the real world or in science fiction.”

That’s how Mr. Richards, author of the new book “Doctor Who: The Secret Lives of Monsters[http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062348869/doctor-who-the-secret-lives-of-monsters],” explains the appeal of the Dalek. He credits the iconic mutants in mechanical cases with making monsters such an integral part of “Doctor Who.” “Once the Daleks appeared and were really successful,” he told Op-Talk, the BBC “realized that monsters and aliens were something that could grab the public’s attention and imagination.”

Part of that appeal may lie in the way monsters recast collective anxiety in fictional form. “One of the major functions that monsters provide for us is they let us process our fears about the real world without having to look at them too directly,” says David J. Skal, author of “The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror[http://us.macmillan.com/themonstershow/davidjskal].” He and others who study the monstrous say that we can read the dominant worries of an era in its monster stories — and that while those stories can sometimes help us deal with those worries, they can also make things worse.

Ancient Greek and Roman monsters tended to be inspired “by xenophobic fears of the other,” Stephen T. Asma, a philosophy professor and the author of “On Monsters: An Unnatural History of Our Worst Fears[http://global.oup.com/academic/product/on-monsters-9780195336160;jsessionid=8FD4599E2FB2F620145126AEF45EB41F?cc=us&lang=en&],” told Op-Talk. As Greeks and Romans came into contact with other cultures through trade, they told stories of groups of people born with only one leg or with human bodies but the heads of dogs.

Medieval monsters were often “supernatural demons that come out of Christian theology.” Christians in medieval Europe were “worried about temptation and pleasures of the flesh” and believed that “if you’re weak morally and impure, if you give in to your carnal desires, then that opens the door for the demon to enter and take you over,” he said. “If you let your guard down at all, this evil realm is just waiting.”

Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” meanwhile, came out at a time when experiments like Galvani’s with electricity were challenging previous ideas about the basis of life. “People were really nervous because it looked like, ‘well, that’s all there is to life — it’s not really miraculous, it’s just a material machine,’” said Dr. Asma. “So Frankenstein comes out of that anxiety.”

According to Mr. Skal, Lon Chaney’s disfigured characters of the 1920s reflect a fear of those marked by World War I: “Unprecedented numbers of wounded and maimed soldiers were coming back and being reintegrated into American society very uneasily — we didn’t like to look at them.” Chaney never played a wounded veteran, said Mr. Skal, “but on one level that’s all he played.”

Tod Browning’s “Dracula” and James Whale’s “Frankenstein” both came out in 1931, and Mr. Skal believes “these classic movie monsters served as kind of lightning rods for free-floating fears and anxieties” in the depths of the Great Depression. Dracula, he said, was “this mysterious, draining presence, the wolf at every door. And the Frankenstein monster in his work clothes and asphalt-spreader boots, he was like this mute, pathetic representation of displaced workers abandoned by their masters.”

Fears of nuclear war may have inspired monsters, too. Ishiro Honda’s 1954 “Godzilla,” Dr. Asma noted, “deals heavily with the kind of anxieties that you would have after Hiroshima and Nagasaki.” Mr. Richards pointed out that the Daleks, who “evolved out of nuclear devastation” on their home planet, made their TV debut in 1963, soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

And today’s pre-eminent monster is the zombie, says Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, an English professor who has studied the relationship between monsters and culture. The zombie “has been our ascendant monster” for nearly a decade, he told Op-Talk, and “it shows no sign of declining in interest.”

Zombies aren’t new, he said: “There is a monster that every single culture shares, and it’s the body that comes back. So every culture has it, almost every time has it.” And the word “zombie” first entered American literature in 1938, he said, with Zora Neale Hurston’s book “Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica[http://zoranealehurston.com/books/tell-my-horse].”

The current American version of the zombie, though, emerged around the time of the most recent financial crisis: “Zombies make good figures for things like creditors or debtors or people reduced in an abject state that they can’t get out of.” And now, he’s concerned that zombies will become even more dominant, as an expression of our fears about Ebola.

“A lot of the rhetoric around how to deal with Ebola is the rhetoric of how to deal with a zombie apocalypse,” he said, “and if those potentially carrying the virus get treated as monsters, we’ve already lost a valuable battle by doing that.”

“All the stuff we know about zombies is not going to help us to be more humane to help people who have Ebola,” he added. “We still have to treat them. They’re not a contagion to be managed.”

And monsters don’t just reflect what we’re feeling, he said. They can influence us too: “Once they’re out there, they bring stuff with them.” His concern about “using the knowledge we have about zombies and not being upfront about the ways in which we’re figuring Ebola as a kind of zombie plague, is that then we bring in a whole set of assumptions that we’re probably better off talking about rather than just assuming.” Monsters, he added, “actually do cultural work, and sometimes that cultural work is kind of icky.”

But it doesn’t always have to be. He pointed to the vampire novels of Anne Rice: “They were about creatures with a blood disease, at a time of AIDS,” but they offered “an argument that the vampire is not a thing to be feared but in some ways to be even envied or celebrated.” Ms. Rice’s work, he said, was “about overcoming homophobia without really even talking about that.”

“It wasn’t necessarily reflecting a tolerant society,” he argued, “but it was envisioning one and I think trying somewhat successfully to help bring that about.”

Dr. Asma believes monsters can offer catharsis. Horror films, he explained, can give us a controllable way to experience “these deeper fears that we ordinarily repress.” We can “take our monsters off the chain, let him howl at the moon a little bit, and then you can put him back on the chain after the movie’s over,” he said. “I think monster culture has therapeutic aspects to it.”

And maybe monsters can help us confront some of our anxieties about ourselves. Mr. Richards sees the Daleks today as speaking to the feeling “that as a society we’ve become more and more reliant on technology.”

“These are creatures who’ve become overdependent on technology and they can’t survive without it,” he explained. “The Dalek is in effect a life support machine which the creature lives inside.”

“With all the best monsters,” he added, “you can see something of yourself in them.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Keeping tabs on Ebola.

U.S. health officials today began monitoring [http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/media/releases/2014/p1022-post-arrival-monitoring.html]all passengers arriving from West Africa for the virus. The travelers’ temperatures will be taken daily for 21 days.

The White House and medical experts are trying to stem the movement toward mandatory quarantine policies [http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html]for medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa but do not show symptoms.

A 5-year-old boy with symptoms consistent with the disease is being tested[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/5-year-old-new-york-ebola.html] in New York.

More than 10,000 people have been infected with Ebola and nearly half of them have died, according to the latest figures[http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2014/10/25/who-number-ebola-linked-cases-passes/LipLWSppkAcSd84hDNHa1M/story.html] from the World Health Organization.

• Narrow races for governor.

Many governors’ races ahead of next week’s elections are still tight: 11 contests are within four percentage points, and six more are within 10 percentage points, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News/YouGov survey[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/upshot/democrats-seem-poised-to-pick-up-a-few-governors-seats.html].

That could lead to a wide range of results: Republicans keep their advantage — 29 states, versus 21 Democratic governors — or Democrats pick up a half-dozen seats.

• Sticking with the president in Brazil.

The main stock index in São Paulo dropped 5 percent today after Dilma Rousseffwas re-elected[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/world/americas/brazilian-presidential-election.html] in the tightest vote there in years after an acrimonious campaign.

In nearby Uruguay, the presidential race went to a runoff[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/27/world/americas/27reuters-uruguay-election.html].

• Second victim dies after school shooting.

Hospital officials in Washington State said that a 14-year-old girl who was shot by a high school classmate died late Sunday[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/washington-school-shooting-claims-another-victim-gia-soriano.html].

While investigators are looking for the shooter’s motive, Friday’s attack put a spotlight on gun-control measures[http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-marysville-shooting-20141026-story.html] that voters in the state will decide a week from Tuesday.

• Voters in Ukraine side with the West.

Pro-Western parties appeared to win[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/world/europe/ukrainian-parliamentary-elections.html] an overwhelming majority in Parliament, according to exit polls; the official count[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/world/europe/ukraine-election.html] is expected today.

The results would complete a transformation of the government that began in February when the former president fled after bloody street protests over his decision to align more closely with Russia.

• Islamist party lags behind.

A secular party appears to have won[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/world/africa/nidaa-tounes-ennahda-tunisian-parliamentary-election.html] the largest number of Parliament seats in Tunisia, the country that inspired the Arab Spring.

• Seeking answers.

Canada’s top security officials are expected to testify[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/27/world/americas/27reuters-canada-attacks.html] today before a parliamentary committee about threats facing the nation.

They’ll meet in the same building where a man opened fire last week, killing one soldier. The gunman made a video[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/world/americas/response-to-ottawa-attack-resembled-an-action-film.html] shortly before his attack.

• Toronto heads to the polls.

Doug Ford, who replaced his cancer-stricken brother, Mayor Rob Ford, on the ballot, is a contender in today’s race[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-mayoral-candidates-campaign-over-final-weekend-1.2813160] to become mayor of Canada’s largest city. Voting ends at 8 p.m. Eastern.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are slightly lower after Friday’s gains.

European stocks ended negative. The European Central Bankflunked 13 of 130 big banks[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/ecb-stress-test-finds-13-banks-fall-short/] — four of them Italian — in a test of their ability to withstand a financial crisis.

• Rite Aid and CVS disabled Apple’s new mobile payment system[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/technology/personaltech/2-drug-chains-disable-apple-pay-as-a-rival-makes-plans-.html] in their stores nationwide, apparently in an effort to favor their own system, which is not yet available.

• The banana producer Chiquita is going private[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/chiquita-and-brazilian-group-announce-takeover-deal/] in a takeover by two Brazilian companies.

• Twitter posts its earnings today.

• Hong Kong protest leaders canceled a vote[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/world/asia/pro-democracy-movements-vote-in-hong-kong-abruptly-called-off.html] over how to push for democratic concessions from China.

• The horror movie “Ouija” — slimmed down[http://www.thewrap.com/how-universal-took-ouija-from-risky-blockbuster-to-likely-low-budget-hit/] to a $5 million budget from at least $100 million — placed No. 1[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/ouija-responds-with-dollar-signs/] at the weekend box office.

• Jack Bruce, the bassist and lead vocalist for the 1960s rock group Cream, died[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/jack-bruce-creams-adventurous-bassist-dies-at-71.html]. He was 71.

• Catching up on TV: We have your episode recaps for “Boardwalk Empire[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/boardwalk-empire-finale-recap-golden-memories/],” “The Good Wife[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/the-good-wife-recap-how-to-make-will-gardner-go-away/],” “Homeland[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/homeland-recap-are-you-finding-carrie-a-little-creepy/]” and “The Affair[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/the-affair-recap-literary-pretensions-and-a-dead-man/].”

NOTEWORTHY

• Giants are one win away.

Madison Bumgarner threw a four-hit shutout in Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night, as San Francisco defeated Kansas City[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-madison-bumgarner-and-sf-giants-shut-down-kc-royals-and-close-in-on-title.html], 5-0, to take a three-games-to-two lead.

The Giants can pop the Champagne if they beat the Royals on Tuesday.

• Officially crossing over.

Taylor Swift, once known as a country music star, releases today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-1989-new-album-review.html] her first pop album, “1989.” She’ll be on ABC’s “Good Morning America” and join NBC’s “The Voice” at 8 p.m. Eastern as an adviser for the contestants.

Other albums out today: the Who’s 50th-anniversary greatest hits album[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/who-hits-50!-deluxe-edition/id924757882]; Barry Manilow’s “My Dream Duets[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/my-dream-duets/id919623602]”; and the Flaming Lips’ “Sgt. Pepper’s” tribute album[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/little-help-from-my-fwends/id877807687].

• The godfather of soul.

“Mr. Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown,” a documentary produced by Mick Jagger and directed by the Oscar winner Alex Gibney, chronicles the story[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/arts/television/mr-dynamite-the-rise-of-james-brown-on-hbo.html] of Mr. Brown’s journey from rhythm and blues to funk.

The film reflects on how he changed American music, and includes interviews with band members, TV appearances and never-seen-before concert footage (9 p.m. Eastern, HBO).

• Just in time for Halloween.

A medical study shows an antioxidant in chocolate appears to improve some memory skills[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/us/a-bite-to-remember-chocolate-is-shown-to-aid-memory.html] that people lose with age.

BACK STORY

Gerrymandering — the drawing of wacky-shaped voting districts to give one party an advantage — is one of the factors in next week’s midterm congressional elections.

It got its name in 1812, when the Massachusetts Legislature reconfigured state Senate districts, one of which snaked around the edges of a county.

The governor, Elbridge Gerry, signed the bill approving the map, which was ridiculed by a newspaper. It said the district looked like a salamander and published a cartoon, “The Gerry-mander[http://www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php?item_id=1765].”

State legislatures generally redraw congressional districts every 10 years, based on the new census. After the 2010 census, Republicans created favorable maps[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-six-states.html] in states like Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin and North Carolina[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-north-carolina.html].

It is one reason the party kept a 33-seat majority[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/16/us/politics/ap-us-gop-advantage-second-time.html] in the 2012 election despite Democratic House candidates receiving 1.4 million more votes than their Republican opponents.

Good evening.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• In the face of fear.

The worry stirred by New York’s first Ebola case has the patient’s mail carrier wearing a mask and gloves, the state adopting a quarantine,[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/ebola-live-blog-monday-updates/] and some even criticizing the health care workers who’ve helped in West Africa.

“We’re all scared of what we don’t know,” says Jim Dwyer, our About New York columnist.

“The idea that the person standing next to us, hanging onto the subway pole, has Ebola invisibly multiplying inside his body is pretty darn scary.”

But fear in the city is still running at a relatively low temperature.

“People in N.Y.C. used to get back and forth to work, to play, to life in general when there were more than 2,000 murders a year,” Mr. Dwyer says. (There were about 330 in 2013, a record low[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/new-york-today-murder-hits-record-low/].)

“They took routes that seemed safe to them, stood at the right door of the subway car, traveled on busy streets rather than deserted ones.”

“Meanwhile,” he adds, “people from just a few miles outside the city would never come near it.”

• A behavioral immune system?

Humans have built-in guards to defend against deadly diseases, namely the highly tuned immune system that has evolved over time to neutralize pathogens.

That may not be the only evolutionary protection, says Ezra Klein, writing on Vox[http://www.vox.com/2014/10/27/7078021/ebola-will-make-americans-more-xenophobic], the website he edits.

He says psychologists who specialize in adaptive behaviors say another might be “the development of behavioral responses — like the feeling of disgust when you smell rotted meat, or the shiver of fear you get when you see a rat — that helped us avoid carriers of infection.”

If so, Mr. Klein says, that could help explain the huge popularity of proposals “to shut down the borders and to quarantine anyone who has been anywhere near the foreigners.”

• Family ties.

One of our most popular stories today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/us/the-bushes-led-by-w-rally-to-make-jeb-45.html] details how the Bush family is putting its connections to work to help Jeb Bush — a son and brother of former presidents — into the Oval Office himself.

It raises the prospect of two dynasties facing off in 2016, and highlights the pros and cons of coming to the campaign with such a pedigree.

“Candidates like Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton start off with enormous advantages,” says Peter Baker, our White House correspondent.

He says they both have “nearly universal name recognition, families with established records in past elections and built-in vast networks of supporters and donors.”

“At the same time,” Mr. Baker notes, “they also inherit any baggage from their famous families.”

“As George W. Bush said about running for office after his father served as president, ‘I inherited half his friends and all his enemies.'”

(11:35 p.m. Eastern, CBS)

TOMORROW

On Monday, a nurse was released from quarantine in New Jersey and began making her way back to Maine. Kaci Hickox, the nurse who had been held in quarantine in a tent at a Newark hospital since Friday, was released in the early afternoon.

In the evening, a family from the Bronx – and possibly the entire city of New York – breathed a sigh of relief as a 5-year-old boy was cleared of Ebola by a blood test. The test came back negative, but city officials said the boy is being kept in the hospital, just to be safe.

The boy had been placed in isolation after he grew ill following a trip to Guinea.

That’s all for the day’s updates. We will be back with more should there be new developments.

6:56 P.M. | A Cheer Goes Up in the Bronx

The Bronx borough president, Rubén Díaz Jr., expressed joy at the news that a 5-year-old resident had tested negative for Ebola:

Good news! The five year old boy from The #Bronx with a possible #Ebola infection has tested negative for the virus! Spread the word!

— Ruben Diaz Jr. (@rubendiazjr)[http://www.twitter.com/rubendiazjr]27 Oct 14[https://twitter.com/rubendiazjr/status/526857362075033601]

6:00 P.M. | Boy Tests Negative for Ebola

A blood test for the 5-year-old boy taken to Bellevue Hospital Centercame back negative for Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/5-year-old-new-york-ebola.html?ref=nyregion], city health officials said. As a precaution, he will be kept isolated at Bellevue pending further Ebola tests.

In a statement, the city health department and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation said, “The result of the test is negative. Out of an abundance of caution, further negative Ebola tests are required on subsequent days to ensure that the patient is cleared. The patient will also be tested for common respiratory viruses. The patient will remain in isolation until all test results have returned.”

The child had recently returned from Guinea with his family. He was transported to Bellevue Hospital Center on Sunday night by emergency medical workers wearing protective gear and placed in isolation with his mother.

5:05 P.M. | Journal: Mandatory Quarantine “Unfair and Unwise”

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1413139?query=featured_home&&&] criticized the mandatory quarantine imposed in New York and New Jersey, saying it “is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal.”

4:50 P.M. | U.S. Government Issues New Guidelines

The federal government on Monday urged what it called “active monitoring” of health care workers or family members who have been in direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, the director of the Centers for Disease Control said.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/new-rules-coming-for-health-care-workers-returning-from-west-africa.html]

Drawing a sharp contrast with the policies in New York and New Jersey, which call for mandatory quarantine of anyone who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, the federal government will not automatically quarantine such people, but will rather rely on local health authorities to make contact with them every day to check on their health status or symptoms.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., said the new guidelines recommended restricting a person’s movement only if there is a specific indication that that person is at high risk of contracting Ebola — if, for example, he or she has been stuck by a needle used on an Ebola patient.

“We believe they are based on science,” Dr. Frieden said of the guidelines. “These add a strong level of protection and a strong level of reassurance.”

— MICHAEL SHEAR

4:24 P.M. | A Joke the Governor Did Not Make

Correction: An earlier update[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/ebola-live-blog-monday-updates/#cuomo-under-quarantine-read-my-memoir] about Governor Cuomo joking that quarantined health workers would have time to read his memoir mischaracterized one of the governor’s comments.

While he did (jokingly) recommend that quarantined people read his book, he did not say that the state could legally force anyone to read it.

Rather, he said — seriously — that the state could legally force health workers to obey a quarantine.

3:28 p.m. | Anxiety and Rumors on a Bronx Block

Outside the building in the Bronx that is home to the 5-year-old boy who is being tested for Ebola, police officers and health officials stood watch, reassuring residents who stopped to ask why so many reporters and camera people were gathered.

Outreach workers in blue jackets handed out fliers in English and Spanish to residents, who were dismayed to hear that the faraway disease might have come to their block of East 172nd Street in the Soundview neighborhood.

Though the fliers explained how difficult it is to contract Ebola, the news that the boy was being examined at Bellevue Hospital Center was enough to spread apprehension and rumors.

A few parents showed up at the elementary school building on the corner ahead of dismissal time to drag their children out early. People on the block said they had heard that the ailing boy attended school there.

“You will not be going back to school for a very long time,” one woman told the little boy she was hurrying along beside her.

The super of another building on the boy’s block, Manny Martinez, said that super of the boy’s building had told him that after the boy was taken to the hospital, he had asked the building’s management what to do.

The super said he was told to clean as usual, so he did — wearing no special protective gear but his regular gloves, Mr. Martinez said.

Mr. Martinez said that two ambulances and several Fire Department vehicles arrived at the building around 9:30 p.m. Sunday. An hour later, he said, two people in hazmat suits had emerged with the boy, who was almost entirely covered with only his eyes exposed.

“He looked like a mummy,” Mr. Martinez said. “They’re regular people. I feel sorry for that little kid. I hope he gets better.”

2:46 P.M. | Cuomo: Under Quarantine? Read My Memoir

Governor Cuomo bravely ventured a joke at a news conference on Monday about Ebola quarantines.

He said that for health care workers returning from treating Ebola patients in West Africa, a home quarantine is not overly onerous.

“Twenty-one days, in your home, with your friends and your family, and you’ll be compensated,” he said. “Read a book, read my book.”

He meant his new 528-page memoir, “All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and in Life,” which sold a total of 945 copies[https://twitter.com/amychozick/status/524931829468770304] in its first week.

“You don’t have to read my book,” he quickly added, “but stay home for 21 days.”

— NATE SCHWEBER

2:35 P.M. | Boy Was Sick and Feverish Last Night, Family Said

Relatives of the ailing 5-year-old boy from the Bronx first called 911 at 9:02 p.m. on Sunday and told the operator the boy was sick and had a fever, a law enforcement official said.

The boy had recently returned to New York from Guinea.

It took nearly three hours for the boy to reach Bellevue Hospital Center, the official said — reflecting the time it took for the responders to get suited up and bring one of the dedicated ambulances responding to potential Ebola cases.

City officials said this morning that when the boy arrived at Bellevue he did not have a fever but developed one around 7 a.m. today.

2:31 P.M. | At 5-Year-Old’s Bronx Building, Palm Cards and Caution

Ms. Hickox left University Hospital in a very small motorcade consisting of two black S.U.V.s, both headed for Maine, where Ms. Hickox lives, said Stacie Newton, a hospital spokeswoman.

Ms. Newton would not say whether the vehicles belonged to the State of New Jersey or who else was inside them.

1:37 | Nurse Subject to Quarantine in Maine

Kaci Hickox, the nurse who has been kept in isolation at a New Jersey hospital, will be subject to quarantine at home when she arrives in Maine, officials in Maine said on Monday. Ms. Hickox, who has been held in a tent despite having no symptoms, is expected to be transferred to Maine sometime today. Under guidelines established by Maine’s Department of Health, Ms. Hickox would be asked to remain at home until it was determined that she was no longer at risk for developing Ebola, which is usually 21 days from the time of exposure to the virus. Ms. Hickox returned on Friday to New Jersey after serving for a month in Sierra Leone with Doctors Without Borders, treating Ebola patients.

1:37 P.M. | U.S. Troops Quarantined in Italy After Leaving Liberia

The United States Army has isolated about a dozen soldiers returning from Liberia at a base in Italy, including the top general who oversaw the military’s initial response to the Ebola outbreak, even though none of them showed symptoms of infection, the Pentagon said on Monday.

The Pentagon said that Brig. Gen. Darryl Williams and 10 of his traveling party were being quarantined out of “an abundance of caution.”

Defense officials said the Pentagon protocol for American troops traveling to Liberia remains the same — those with low levels of risk will not be quarantined. But a military official said Monday that that protocol could change.

1:26 P.M. | White House Spokesman: ‘These Individuals Are Heroes’

Josh Earnest, the spokesman, said that it was disrespectful to Kaci Hickox, the nurse being held in Newark after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, to “confine her in a tent for two or three days.”

He said that health care workers who work with Ebola patients abroad “are putting themselves at risk to try to meet the needs of other people,” an act of great charity, he said, that is also in the best interests of the American people.

“These individuals are heroes,” Mr. Earnest said, “and their commitment to their common man and to their country is one that should be respected.”

He added, “We believe that we can both show them respect that they have earned while also showing that we have protocols in place to protect the American people.”

He urged that any quarantine rules imposed by states be based in science.

1:17 P.M. | Live Video: White House Briefing on Ebola

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://youtu.be/OCTpnwIvPlE]]

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will release new guidelines for medical workers who treat Ebola patients, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said this afternoon.

The guidelines are not mandatory and states are allowed to make their own guidelines, as New York and New Jersey have.

1:08 P.M. | Scrubbing Out Possible Traces of Disease

Read how a hazardous-materials crew cleaned[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/ebola-new-york-hazmat-workers.html] the Harlem apartment of Dr. Craig Spencer, the Ebola patient at Bellevue Hospital Center, and the inside of the bowling alley he visited — right down to the finger holes of the balls.

12:34 P.M. | Live Stream: Columbia Conference on Ebola

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://youtu.be/7-UZ-DsPC7M]]

The National Center for Disaster Preparedness and the Earth Institute at Columbia University are holding a conference today[http://ncdp.columbia.edu/microsite-page/ebola-conference-2014/] on the topic “The Ebola Crisis: What It Means for West Africa and the World.”

The conference describes itself as a “multi-disciplinary dialogue which will focus on how best to curb the epidemic, understand its impacts — particularly in terms of bioethical and sustainability implications — and mitigate future high-fatality events.”

Panelists include Dr. Jay Varma, the city’s deputy health commissioner for disease control, and Robert Klitzman, a medical ethicist at Columbia. See full program[http://ncdp.columbia.edu/microsite-page/ebola-conference-2014/].

The conference runs from 1 to 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

11:53 A.M. | No Evidence of Disease Spreading, Mayor Says

Mayor de Blasio stressed that although one patient is hospitalized with Ebola and another is being tested for it, “there’s no evidence of a pattern of spreading here that would cause us to have greater concern.”

11:51 A.M. | 5-Year-Old’s Mother Is With Him at Bellevue

As blood-test results are awaited on a 5-year-old boy recently back from Guinea who was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with Ebola-like symptoms, Mayor de Blasio said that the boy’s mother has shown no symptoms of the disease.

The boy’s mother is with him at the hospital, the mayor said, because, “by definition, we want her with the child, because we want the child to have the support of his mother.”

11:43 A.M. | Fiancée and Friends of Doctor With Ebola Are Not Sick

Mayor de Blasio said that the fiancée and friends of Craig Spencer, the doctor hospitalized for Ebola, are symptom-free. They remain under quarantine.

Dr. Spencer, the mayor said, remains in serious but stable condition this morning.

11:37 A.M. | Mayor Speaks on Ebola at News Conference

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://youtu.be/Jr9kO6pGIIc?t=1h5m15s]]

Mayor Bill de Blasio fielded questions about Ebola after a news conference on a new law lowering the city’s speed limit.

He declined to give details on what symptoms the 5-year-old boy showed that led him to be brought to Bellevue Hospital Center, citing privacy rules.

He said that the boy “very, very recently returned from West Africa” and that blood-test results would be made public “probably late in the afternoon.”

Christie on Ebola: ‘I Didn’t Reverse My Decision’

Gov. Chris Christie could not escape questions on his handling of Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/nyregion/nurse-in-newark-to-be-allowed-to-finish-ebola-quarantine-at-home-christie-says.html] during a campaign stop in Florida on Monday. Stumping for Gov. Rick Scott in Melbourne, Mr. Christie defended his decision to allow a nurse who was being quarantined in New Jersey to return home to Maine. Here are edited excerpts of his responses.

Q. But why did you reverse your decision initially?

A. I didn’t reverse my decision. Why are you saying I reversed my decision?

Q. Because now she gets to go home and yesterday you were saying she had to stay…

A. If she was continuing to be ill she’d have to stay. She hadn’t had any symptoms for 24 hours. And she tested negative for Ebola. So there was no reason to keep her. The reason she was put into the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic. So, if you live in New Jersey, we will quarantine you in your home. That has always been the policy. If you live outside the state and you are symptomatic, we’re not letting you go onto public transportation. It makes no common sense. The minute she was no longer symptomatic, she was released. And that’s a common-sense approach that the federal government wasn’t taking — that we took first in New Jersey and New York — has now been adopted by Chicago, has now been adopted by Maryland. As I said yesterday on the news, this will become national policy because it’s smart, tough, common-sense policy.

Q. Do you intend to speak with her?

A. No, I don’t. Listen, I have no reason to talk to her. My job is not to represent her — it’s to represent the people of New Jersey. And so she was ill. She was obviously ill enough that the C.D.C. and medical officials hospitalized her and gave her an Ebola test. They don’t that just for fun. That’s a very specific, difficult, expensive test to do. And so the fact is, I know she was upset and angry — she wanted to go home. Any of us have seen people who are traveling and they’ve been stopped, whether they are late for a plane or whatever they are doing, they get upset and angry. That’s fine. I have absolutely nothing but good will for her going forward. She’s a good person and went over and was doing good work over in West Africa, but she needs to understand that the obligation of elected officials is to protect the public health of all the people. And if that inconvenienced her for a period of time, that’s what we need to do to protect the public, that’s what we will continue to do.

So there’s been no reversal or change in any way of our policy or our approach. If people are symptomatic, they go into the hospital. If they live in New Jersey, they get quarantined at home. If they don’t, and they’re not symptomatic, then we set up quarantine for them out of state. But if they are symptomatic, they’re going to the hospital.

Q. What is your response to the nurse returning home?

A. Well, listen, first off, we’re very happy that she’s been released from the hospital this morning because she hasn’t had any symptoms for 24 hours. And New Jersey’s providing transportation for her back to her home in Maine, where the Maine officials will take over her care and monitoring from there. So remember, I understand she was uncomfortable. No one likes to be in the hospital, but she was under supervision by the C.D.C. and our health officials at all times, and I’m glad that she’s getting to go back home and hopefully her health will remain being good. If it is, that’s good for her and her family and everybody else, but we’re are not going to take any risks with the public health in New Jersey.

Q. You called her obviously ill. She took offense, as it turned out.

A. She took great offense at everything I did, Michael.

Q. How do you feel about Governor Cuomo’s easing the quarantine rule?

A. Governor Cuomo did not ease any restrictions at all. The same policies we put into effect on Friday are still the same policies now. That’s been reported incorrectly. I spoke to Governor Cuomo last night. He’s in the exact same position that’s he’s been all along. So I have no response to him because there’s nothing to respond to. And remember, Illinois has since adopted this policy. So has, now, the state of Maryland. So, I’m telling you guys this is going to become a national policy eventually. Eventually the C.D.C. will come around. And remember, they were late to the game in Texas, and we have people infected because of it.

Pat Roberts’s Latest Campaign Tactic: Guantánamo Fear-Mongering
By DAVID FIRESTONE

No detainees from Guantánamo are headed for the prisons of Leavenworth, Kan., anytime soon, if ever. But you wouldn’t know that from the campaign of Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican in a very tight race, who has made a terrorist-free state one of his most fervent campaign promises.

“Pat Roberts promises to keep terrorists out of Kansas,” says a newscaster in a clip included in one of his recent television ads. “Senator Roberts issuing a very blunt threat to the White House about inmates at Guantánamo Bay,” says another journalist. And finally the ad turns to Mr. Roberts himself, declaiming, in a voice loud enough to echo across the plains, “Not. On. My. Watch!”Congress, of course, has repeatedly prohibited President Obama from transferring any prisoners from Guantánamo to the United States (a decision The Times editorial board has called “outrageous”[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/close-guantanamo-prison.html]). Mr. Roberts was one of the leaders of those efforts. But earlier this month, after several news media reported[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/obama-weighs-options-to-close-guantanamo-1412899358] that Mr. Obama was considering ways to get around that ban, Mr. Roberts erupted again with a filibuster threat, in full view of the Kansas electorate.

“I stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth,” Mr. Roberts said[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/washwire/2014/10/10/senator-vows-ted-cruz-style-talkathon-to-block-guantanamo-plan/] at the state Republican headquarters. “I shall do it again, I shall do it again, and if he tries it, I will shut down the Senate.”

This is yet another example — most recently seen in the politicization of Ebola — of Republicans hyping a miniscule risk into a Great National Threat that makes them appear courageous in opposition. All the better if that threat has been underplayed, or even created by, the Obama administration.

The fact is that the 149 remaining inmates of Guantánamo pose no danger to the residents of eastern Kansas. The Leavenworth area is already home to five prisons that over the years have held some of the nation’s most violent criminals, including domestic terrorists and murderers. The Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, a maximum-security prison that has often been mentioned as a possible alternative to Guantánamo, currently houses (without difficulty) Major Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people and injured dozens more in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting.

(A member of the staff of Greg Orman, Mr. Roberts’s challenger for the Senate seat, ridiculed Mr. Roberts as a member of the “bedwetter’s caucus”[https://twitter.com/samedelen/status/520977803823828992] for his fear of a Guantánamo transfer.)

But just as Ebola is more frightening to people than far more infectious domestic diseases, foreign terror inmates rile up politicians more than violent domestic criminals. Real leaders work to calm their constituents when no threat exists. Officials like Mr. Roberts try to stir them up, hoping they’ll benefit from their outrage.

Nurse Who Spoke Out Felt a Calling for Health Care, Friends Say

Many students pursuing master's degrees in public health at Johns Hopkins University went home for the holidays. Kaci Hickox went to Uganda.

She spent a month at the end of 2010 caring for yellow fever patients through Doctors Without Borders, a group she had worked with several times before. She had long been passionate about providing medical care overseas, her classmate Chelsea Solmo said.

''It was more than just a hobby or an interest,'' Ms. Solmo said. ''She had these skills as a nurse, and she felt she had to use them.''

For the last month, Ms. Hickox, 33, was with the group in Sierra Leone, working with Ebola patients. She arrived back in the United States on Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport on the same day that the governors of New Jersey and New York began a mandatory quarantine for medical workers returning from West Africa, and became the first person affected by the new policy.

Frustrated that she was quarantined, even though she had no symptoms, Ms. Hickox took to national television on Sunday to criticize Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey about the policy.

Ms. Hickox's friends and family were not surprised that she decided to speak up.

''She's not a loudmouth activist,'' said Dr. Nora Rowley, a classmate at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. ''But she understands the contagiousness of the virus, and now she has to come back and be subjected to a policy that's not based on anything other than fear.''

Her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, a nursing student in Fort Kent, Maine, said that Ms. Hickox, who is being kept in an isolation tent with a portable toilet, but no shower or television, had not planned on speaking to the news media but changed her mind after Mr. Christie said on Saturday that she was ''obviously ill'' when she knew she was not.

''Now he's messed with the wrong redhead,'' he said of her frame of mind.

Ms. Hickox first shared her story on Saturday in an essay on the website of The Dallas Morning News. At the airport, a forehead scanner showed she had a temperature of 101, but she said that was because she was flushed and upset. A later reading by an oral thermometer recorded a normal temperature of 98.6.

On Sunday, Ms. Hickox told Candy Crowley of CNN that she did not have a fever or any symptoms and felt ''physically strong.''

Ms. Hickox attended high school in Rio Vista, Texas, a small town near Dallas, and studied nursing at the University of Texas at Arlington. The first time she applied to work at Doctors Without Borders, the group told her she did not have enough international experience. So she went to work for another organization, the International Medical Corps, in Indonesia.

''While the work there was difficult and challenging, both professionally and emotionally, it also made me feel alive in a new way,'' she wrote in an alumni profile on the university's website.

She eventually worked for Doctors Without Borders in Myanmar for two years. She managed three rural clinics that served about 100,000 people near the border of Bangladesh, the group said in an online post about her time there. She later worked for them in Sudan and Nigeria.

After receiving her master's degree in nursing and public health in 2011, she moved to Las Vegas to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of an epidemiology fellowship.

Her mother, Karen Hickox, said she worried for her daughter's safety when she told her she was going to Sierra Leone.

''Kaci's passion is serving others,'' she said. ''Of course, I'm a mother, so I was scared to death. I worried that she could come down with the disease herself.''

Before she was quarantined, Ms. Hickox planned to return home to Maine, where she had been living with her boyfriend and looking for a job, to recuperate from the grueling trip and to monitor herself for possible Ebola symptoms, her family said.

On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York came to her defense, calling her a hero and saying that the way she had been treated was shameful.

Ms. Hickox said in a brief statement on Sunday night: ''My human rights have been violated and we must react in order to ensure that other health care workers do not endure such injustice.''

She has retained a well-known civil rights lawyer, Norman Siegel, to challenge the quarantine order.

''Right now, she's sitting in a tent, and no one is telling her anything,'' Mr. Wilbur said.

For global health experts and public health workers involved with the effort to fight Ebola in West Africa, the blame cast on Dr. Craig Spencer, the first Ebola patient in New York City, for his activities in the city after returning from West Africa, as well as the forcible quarantining of Ms. Hickox, came as an affront.

Ms. Hickox's essay drew more than 5,000 comments, many of them critical, and some on social media said she should stop ''whining'' and consider the health of others.

''It is upsetting that some people have expressed dismay or disapproval about the actions of these health care workers, because they've done everything correctly,'' said Dr. Eileen Farnon, an infectious diseases specialist at Temple University School of Medicine who recently returned from consulting for the World Health Organization in Liberia. ''It's important for people to try for a minute to put themselves in the shoes of a responding health care worker and everything that they've been through.''

''Believe me,'' she added, ''they'll be on high alert for any signs and symptoms. They know best what a horrible disease it can be.''

Governors defend measures on Ebola; Public health officials say quarantine could hurt efforts in West Africa

The governors of New York and New Jersey said Sunday that they stood by their decision to force medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa into quarantine, even as the Obama administration questioned the wisdom of the policy, saying it could undermine efforts to fight the epidemic at its source.

The quarantines go beyond federal guidelines. The two states issued their order on Friday night, and Illinois and Florida followed the next day.

The first person affected was Kaci Hickox, a nurse who was ordered upon her return from Sierra Leone to Newark Liberty International Airport to spend 21 days in quarantine despite having no symptoms. She wrote a scathing criticism of how she had been treated and hired a lawyer to fight the quarantine.

‘‘I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa,’’ she wrote in an essay on the website of The Dallas Morning News, in collaboration with a friend who works for the newspaper. ‘‘I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine.’’

Ms. Hickox’s mother, Karen, said on Sunday that her daughter remained in isolation but still had no symptoms.

‘‘She finally got a little bit of sleep,’’ her mother said in a telephone interview from her home outside of Dallas. But her daughter still does not know when she might be able to leave the isolation tent where she is being quarantined at University Hospital in Newark.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey defended the quarantine on ‘‘Fox News Sunday’’ despite concerns such as those of Ms. Hickox and the lack of clarity about exactly how the plan would work.

‘‘We’ve taken this action and I have absolutely no second thoughts about it,’’ Mr. Christie said.

Federal officials spoke out about the negative impact the mandatory quarantines could have on the fight against the disease in West Africa and cautioned against stigmatizing those who are on the front lines of that battle.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, which treated Nina Pham, the nurse from Dallas who became infected from treating the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan, reiterated those concerns in remarks on CNN on Sunday.

‘‘There’s a big, big difference between completely confining somebody so that they can’t even get outside and doing the appropriate monitoring based on scientific evidence,’’ Dr. Fauci said. ‘‘The harm is that it is totally disruptive of their life. We want them to go because they are helping us to protect America to be over there.’’

Samantha Power, the United States’ ambassador to the United Nations, arrived in Guinea’s capital, Conakry, on Sunday on the first leg of a tour through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three West African nations hardest hit by the epidemic. She spoke out about the crucial need for more health care workers to join the fight against the outbreak.

‘‘All of us need to make clear what these health workers mean to us and how much we value their services, how much we value their contribution,’’ Ms. Power said Sunday on the NBC News program ‘‘Meet the Press.’’ ‘‘We need to make sure they are treated like conquering heroes and not in any other way.’’

Mr. Christie was dismissive of the concerns voiced by both the administration and public health officials.

‘‘It was my conclusion that we needed to do this to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey,’’ he said. ‘‘I have great respect for Dr. Fauci, but what he’s counting on is a voluntary system in which folks may or may not comply.’’

In a radio interview on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York also defended the quarantine policy, saying that it was important to be able to require people to monitor themselves under the force of law.

‘‘If you had someone who didn’t want to cooperate, you can enforce it legally, there’s no doubt about that,’’ he said on Radio 103.9, adding that it was ‘‘highly unlikely’’ that a health care worker returning from the affected West Africa nations would object.

Asked if the quarantine policy was meant to prod the Obama administration to adopt stricter rules to guard against Ebola, Mr. Cuomo said that was not the case.

‘‘I’m not sending anybody a message on anything,’’ he said. ‘‘Every state has to figure out what policy works best for that state.

‘‘I was not making any political statement to the White House.’’

Public health experts have pushed against measures like quarantining returning travelers without symptoms, arguing that such efforts are overkill and could actually serve to harm the effort in West Africa, where the disease is still exploding.

They say that controlling the virus where it is raging is the only way to reduce the risk to zero for Americans and that a new federal policy, set to take effect Monday, achieves the balance of precautionary measures that do not impede broader efforts in Africa.

Under that new policy, any traveler returning from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea will be required to report their temperatures to their local health authorities. They will also be required to give health officials names and addresses of their relatives and where they will be staying in the three weeks after they arrive, the approximate amount of time the disease takes to incubate.

‘‘If we do things that unintentionally make it harder to get that person in, or to get those supplies in, it’s going to become much harder to stop the outbreak at the source,’’ Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this month. ‘‘If that were to happen, it would spread for more months and potentially to other countries — that would increase rather than decrease the threat to Americans.’’

A person infected with Ebola is not infectious until he shows symptoms of the virus. The sicker someone becomes, the greater the risk of contagion. Ebola is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids like vomit, blood and feces, not through the air.

The new quarantine policy could have an immediate effect on people working for Doctors Without Borders, one of the private organizations that has been leading the effort the contain the spread of Ebola.

A total of 52 people from the United States have worked with Doctors Without Borders in West Africa on the Ebola response since it began in March, according to the organization Of these, 31 are currently at work in West Africa. Twenty of those 31 individuals are scheduled to return sometime in the next four weeks.

A Climate of Fear

LONDON — I don’t know about you, but I find dinner conversations often veer in strange directions these days, like the friend telling me the other evening that the terrorists calling themselves Islamic State could easily dispatch one of their own to West Africa, make sure he contracts Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], then get him onto the London Underground or the Paris Metro or the New York subway, squeezed up against plenty of other folk at rush hour, and bingo!

“I mean,” he said, “I can’t possibly be the first to have thought of this. It’s easy. They want to commit suicide anyway, right?”

Right: We are vulnerable, less safe than we thought.

A mouthful of pasta and on he went about how the time has come to blow up the entire Middle East, it’s done for, finished; and how crazy the energy market is right now with the Saudis trying to drive down prices in order to make costly American shale oil production less viable, which in turn should ensure the United States continues to buy Saudi crude even now that it has become the world’s largest oil producer.

But of course the Russians are not happy about cheap oil, nor are the Iranians, and the bottom line is it’s chaos out there, sharks devouring one another. Nothing happens by chance, certainly not a 25 percent drop in oil prices. Somebody would pay for this plot.

Not so long ago, I struggled to remind myself, this guy was brimming over with idealism, throwing in a big investment-banking job to go to the Middle East and invest his energies in democratic change, a free press, a new order, bending my ear about how the time had come for the region and his country in particular to join the modern world. Nothing in the Arab genome condemned the region to backwardness, violence and paranoia. His belief was fervid. It was married to deeds. He walked the walk for change. I was full of admiration.

Then a shadow fell over the world: annexations, beheadings, pestilence, Syria, Gaza and the return of the Middle Eastern strongmen. Hope gave way to fever. When Canada is no longer reassuring, it’s all over.

We are vulnerable and we are fearful. That is the new zeitgeist, at least in the West. Fanaticism feeds on frustration; and frustration is widespread because life for many is not getting better. People fret.

Come to think of it, our conversation was not encrypted. How foolish, anybody could be listening in, vacuuming my friend’s dark imaginings into some data-storage depot in the American desert, to be sifted through by a bunch of spooks who could likely hack into his phone or drum up some charge of plotting against the West by having ideas about the propagation of Ebola. Even the healers are being humiliated and quarantined, punished for their generous humanity, while the humanoid big-data geeks got soda, steak and a condo in Nevada.

There were cameras and listening devices everywhere. Just look up, look around. It was a mistake to say anything within range of your phone. Lots of people were vulnerable. Anyone could hack into the software in your car, or the drip at your hospital bed, and make a mess of you.

What has happened? Why this shadow over the dinner table and such strange fears? It seems we have the remorse of Pandora. The empowering, all-opening, all-devouring technological spirit we have let slip from the box has turned into a monster, giving the killers-for-a-caliphate new powers to recruit, the dictators new means to repress, the spies new means to listen in, the fear mongers new means to spread alarm, the rich new means to get richer at the expense of the middle class, the marketers new means to numb, the tax evaders new means to evade, viruses new means to spread, devices new means to obsess, the rising powers new means to block the war-weary risen, and anxiety new means to inhabit the psyche.

Hyper-connection equals isolation after all. What a strange trick, almost funny. The crisis, Antonio Gramsci noted in the long-ago 20th century, “consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.” Many people I talk to, and not only over dinner, have never previously felt so uneasy about the state of the world. There is something in the air, fin-de-siècle Vienna with Twitter.

Hope, of course, was the one spirit left behind in Pandora’s Box. One of the things in the air of late was a Google executive dropping to earth from the stratosphere, a fall of 135,890 feet, plummeting at speeds of up to 822 miles per hour, and all smiles after his 25-mile tumble. Technology is also liberation. It just doesn’t feel that way right now. The search is on for someone to dispel foreboding and embody, again, the hope of the world.

AIDS Activists Oppose Cuomo on Ebola Quarantines

Gov. Andrew Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s Ebola quarantine policy is drawing strong opposition from people who work closely with him on another infectious disease: AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

New York State’s imposition of a 21-day quarantine on health workers who have had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa “is not supported by scientific evidence” and “may have consequences that are the antithesis of effective public health policy,” according to a letter released Monday with signatures from over 100 H.I.V. activists, researchers and clinicians.

They consider the state’s quarantine policy unacceptable even though, as Governor Cuomo announced Sunday night, affected people will be able to serve their quarantines at home. Mr. Cuomo initially announced the quarantines on Friday, jointly with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. The quarantine policy has come under heavy criticism from public health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

“I’m disgusted and livid,” wrote Peter Staley, a prominent H.I.V. activist and one of the letter’s organizers, who was appointed just two weeks ago to a gubernatorial task force on H.I.V.

Mr. Cuomo has made the AIDS fight in New York a signature issue. Earlier this month, he appointed that task force[http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/10142014-AIDStaskforce] to find ways to cut the rate of new H.I.V. infections by three-quarters before 2020. Twelve members of the task force, Mr. Staley among them, have signed the letter criticizing his Ebola policies. Other prominent letter signers include Paul Cleary, the dean of Yale’s school of public health; Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, who runs the ICAP AIDS prevention research center at Columbia; and Kevin Frost, the chief executive of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.

Alphonso David, who serves as Mr. Cuomo’s Deputy Secretary for Civil Rights, has been in contact with the H.I.V. advocates over the last several days. “We appreciate the concerns they are raising,” he said. “We appreciate that the advocates are operating as advocates; they have a function to perform.”

Mr. David defended the quarantine policy, noting “the governor needs to make sure that we balance public safety and civil liberties.” But he also noted that the policy would continue to be refined as the state gathered new information and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidelines.

Mr. Staley said that while the advocates were even more shocked by actions in New Jersey, where a worker was quarantined in a tent for several days, they were focusing on Mr. Cuomo because “we have been asked to give advice on an illness that has a lot of stigma and fear affecting how we fight it, and this is our governor and we felt strongly that if we could get him to return to the national consensus on this, that in and of itself would put enormous pressure on Governor Christie.”

The letter expresses concern that quarantines will discourage American health care workers from going to fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. It draws parallels between what the signers call “hysteria” over Ebola in the United States and early panics around H.I.V., noting that policies that create a stigma around an infectious disease can interfere with efforts to contain that disease. For example, people might choose to conceal their possible exposure to Ebola for fear of being unnecessarily quarantined.

Federal guidance[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/hcp/monitoring-and-movement-of-persons-with-exposure.html] from the C.D.C. calls for twice-daily self-monitoring for Ebola symptoms and certain restrictions on travel, including avoiding commercial airliners; it does not call for people with potential exposure to the disease to be quarantined. Federal guidelines call for isolating patients who display Ebola symptoms; the virus cannot be spread by a person who is asymptomatic.

Mr. Cleary, the Yale dean, expressed concern that the quarantines in New York, and similar policies in New Jersey and Connecticut, would foster misconceptions about how Ebola is transmitted. “If you have a policy that says, ‘Oh my god, this person, even though they’re not symptomatic, we don’t trust them,’ that sends a signal that the information the scientists have been telling us is incorrect,” he said. He compared the quarantines to actions by local government officials in the 1980s that misconstrued H.I.V. risks, including the expulsion of Ryan White, a hemophiliac[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hemophilia/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] who contracted H.I.V. from contaminated blood products, from an Indiana middle school.

On Sunday evening, under pressure from public health experts (and, according to Obama administration officials[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html], the White House), Governor Cuomo held a news conference to make clear that quarantines in New York could be served at home and that health workers would be compensated for lost work. Governor Christie issued a statement indicating that New Jersey would also be conducting home quarantines. Illinois and Florida have also announced quarantines for returning Ebola health workers.

The day before, four top Cuomo administration officials, including Dr. Howard Zucker, who heads the state’s health department, Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority, and Mr. David had a conference call with H.I.V. activists to discuss the quarantines. Two of the letter signers, Gregg Gonsalves and Mr. Staley, described the call as tense.

“I yelled at Zucker, ‘You have shattered the public health consensus on this,’  ” Mr. Staley said.

Mr. Gonsalves, the co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale’s law and public health schools, said: "They tried to push us off the irrationality and unsubstantiated nature of the quarantine and talk about how to make it more humane. We don’t want to talk about how to make it more humane.”

On Sunday night, Mr. Cuomo attributed his policies to a desire to protect New Yorkers. He said that he did not see a need to quarantine those who are treating an Ebola patient at New York City’s Bellevue Hospital because Bellevue’s infection control procedures are solid, while those in West Africa are not necessarily reliable.

Unapologetic, Christie Frees Nurse From Ebola Quarantine

Even as New Jersey officials on Monday released a nurse they had kept quarantined in a tent since her return from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, an unapologetic Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] dismissed those who questioned his handling of the case and denied that he had reversed himself.

The nurse, Kaci Hickox, 33, who had previously been working with Doctors Without Borders, became the first public test case for a mandatory quarantine that both Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Friday.

One of Ms. Hickox’s lawyers, Steven Hyman, said she had been released midday from University Hospital in Newark. A hospital spokeswoman said that two black S.U.V.s with tinted windows were headed to Maine, with the patient as a passenger in one. The spokeswoman, Stacie Newton, declined to say where in Maine the convoy was going, or whose vehicles they were.

Fort Kent, Me., where Ms. Hickox lives, is on the northern border across from New Brunswick, Canada. It is about 640 miles from Newark, more than a 10-hour car ride.

A real estate broker contacted there on Monday afternoon said that the town was buzzing about Ms. Hickox’s imminent arrival, and that people did not seem to know whether there would be a public danger if she were to develop the disease.

The town is small, Mike Albert said, and there is only one hospital. “If anyone has any type of emergency, that’s where they’ll go,” he said.

The nurse’s departure, shrouded in secrecy, capped a whirlwind four days in which Ms. Hickox criticized Mr. Christie’s quarantine policy, hired a legal team to defend her civil rights and had the governor defending a policy that he announced in association with Mr. Cuomo.

The details of that quarantine seem to have evolved in both states since Friday.

“I didn’t reverse any decision,” Mr. Christie said from the Brevard Zoo in Melbourne, Fla., where he was campaigning for that state’s governor, Rick Scott, a fellow Republican. “She hadn’t had any symptoms for 24 hours. And she tested negative for Ebola. So there was no reason to keep her. The reason she was put into the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic.”

After Ms. Hickox landed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday, a forehead scan showed she had a temperature of 101, which prompted concern because fever is a symptom of the Ebola virus. Ms. Hickox later said that the reading came because she was flushed and upset. A later reading taken with an oral thermometer recorded a normal temperature, 98.6.

“If people are symptomatic they go into the hospital,” Mr. Christie said. “If they live in New Jersey, they get quarantined at home. If they don’t, and they’re not symptomatic, then we set up quarantine for them out of state. But if they are symptomatic, they’re going to the hospital.”

On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, relaxed New York’s mandatory quarantine, allowing New York resident health care workers to be at home and to be compensated for lost income.

But Mr. Christie remained adamant that there had been reason to quarantine Ms. Hickox in a tent equipped with a portable toilet but no shower or television. “She was obviously ill enough that the C.D.C. and medical officials hospitalized her and gave her an Ebola test,” he said on Monday. “They don’t do that just for fun. That’s a very specific, difficult, expensive test to do.”

Mr. Christie said he knew that Ms. Hickox was “upset and angry; she wanted to go home.” He then compared Ms. Hickox’s plight to that of any airline traveler.

“Any of us have seen people who are traveling and they’ve been stopped, whether they are late for a plane or whatever they are doing, they get upset and angry,” he said. “That’s fine. I have absolutely nothing but good will for her going forward. She’s a good person and went over and was doing good work over in West Africa.

“But she needs to understand that the obligation of elected officials is to protect the public health of all the people, and if that inconvenienced her for a period of time, that’s what we need to do to protect the public. That’s what we’ll continue to do.”

Mr. Christie said he had no reason to talk to Ms. Hickox. “My job is not to represent her,” he said. “My job is to represent the people of New Jersey.”

Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine said the state had worked out protocols for returning health care workers. “We certainly understand health care workers’ desire to get home after doing good work in West Africa,” said Mr. LePage, a Republican. “But we must be vigilant in our duty to protect the health and safety of all Mainers, as well as anyone who may come in contact with someone who has been exposed to Ebola.”

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that its policy would be to collaborate with an affected person to establish a quarantine at home for 21 days after the last possible exposure to the virus.

“This protocol for a higher-risk individual will be implemented for the first time when a health care worker who came into contact with Ebola-positive individuals returns soon from New Jersey,” the statement said, referring to Ms. Hickox. “Under this policy, Maine will make every possible effort to implement an agreed-upon in-home quarantine. We fully expect individuals to voluntarily comply with an in-home quarantine.”

Ms. Hickox’s treatment in New Jersey drew withering criticism from both public health officials and the nurse herself.

Ms. Hickox called her treatment inhumane and castigated Mr. Christie for saying she was “obviously ill” when she displayed no symptoms of Ebola.

The policy announced on Friday in New York and New Jersey raised concerns that quarantine might cause fewer people to volunteer to go fight the disease where they are needed most. On Sunday night, Mr. Cuomo offered more details about how the policy would work, easing off his earlier statements.

Norman Siegel, a prominent civil rights lawyer also representing Ms. Hickox, said that “medically and legally, the State of New Jersey had no justification to confine her.” Despite her release, the legality of the quarantines in New Jersey and New York still “remains to be addressed and resolved,” he said.

Frustrated that she was quarantined though she had no symptoms, Ms. Hickox took to national television on Sunday to criticize Mr. Christie about the policy.

Ms. Hickox’s friends and family were not surprised that she decided to speak up.

“She’s not a loudmouth activist,” said Dr. Nora Rowley, a classmate at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. “But she understands the contagiousness of the virus, and now she has to come back and be subjected to a policy that’s not based on anything other than fear.”

Her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, a nursing student in Fort Kent, said she had not planned on speaking to the news media but changed her mind after Mr. Christie said on Saturday that she was “obviously ill” when she knew she was not.

“Now he’s messed with the wrong redhead,” he said of her frame of mind.

Ms. Hickox first shared her story on Saturday in an essay on the website of The Dallas Morning News[http://www.dallasnews.com/ebola/headlines/20141025-uta-grad-isolated-at-new-jersey-hospital-as-part-of-ebola-quarantine.ece].

New Rules for Health Care Workers Returning From West Africa

WASHINGTON — The federal government on Monday announced a new set of monitoring guidelines for people arriving from West Africa that stopped short of the tough measures instituted in New York and New Jersey last week, an effort to bring uniformity to a messy patchwork of responses by states.

The new policy, which federal health officials said was an effort in an effort to strike a balance between safety and civil liberties, would require returning heath care workers, or people who had been near Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] patients, to submit to an in-person checkup and a phone call from a local public health authority.

That is looser than the stay-home quarantine policies in New York and New Jersey, and many believed that the long-awaited federal response would be unlikely to satisfy the governors of those states, who believe the government needs to be more proactive in preventing potential Ebola patients from spreading the virus.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who announced the new measures, said: "We believed these are based on science. These add a strong level of protection.”

But the C.D.C. does not have regulatory authority, and it will be up to states to implement the policy, and a number of states have already indicated that they believe stronger measures should be taken, including Illinois and Florida.

Approximately 100 people a day arrive to the United States from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, most of them American citizens or permanent residents. About 70 percent of the people arrive to six states – New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia. Dr. Frieden argued that his agency was in discussions with states, but did not specify which ones.

“We found that health departments generally do follow C.D.C. guidelines,” he said. “If they wish them to be more stringent, that is within their authority.”

Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said Monday that his state would begin to monitor travelers arriving from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone for having symptoms consistent with the Ebola virus, and might prohibit returning health workers from taking public transit or attending large gatherings for three weeks after their arrival.

Health workers who cared for Ebola patients in West Africa will also be required to sign agreements that restrict their activities, the state said. Those health workers who had “known breaches of protective protocol” will be required to stay at home for 21 days — with the possibility of mandatory quarantine, Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement.

Health care workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa will be “evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be restricted from public transportation, mass gatherings, and clinical care,” the statement said. All travelers arriving in Virginia from the three West African nations will be asked to take and record their temperature at least twice each day, with local health officials contacting them daily for three weeks to check on their condition.

Even if a traveler has tested negative for the virus, but develops symptoms that suggest Ebola has been contracted, Mr. McAuliffe said the traveler might be asked to remain at home for 21 days under the close supervision of state health officials.

In announcing the new policy for returning health care workers, federal officials are seeking to strike a delicate balance between getting the medical details right and making sure the public is comfortable with the approach the government is taking. This is important because, should the virus begin to spread, health workers will need the public to trust them enough to reveal information.

“If something is going to scare someone, an Ebola guy on the subway is a pretty good way,” said Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. “You have to be concerned with the public ramification of your actions.”

The differences between the federal government and the governors have already erupted into a political test of wills just days before the midterm elections. Administration officials over the weekend harshly criticized the quarantine plans in New York and New Jersey, saying they went too far and could have the unintended consequence of discouraging health care workers from going to West Africa.

But Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, and Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, have refused to back down, saying they are putting in place policies that they think are necessary to protect the public.

Mr. Christie on Monday did agree to allow a nurse who had been quarantined in a tent at a New Jersey hospital to travel to her home in Maine.

Entering the homestretch of a less-than-trying campaign, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per], a Democrat, returns to a bedrock economic talking point, lower taxes, softened by a fond, familial memory. A 30-second commercial, “Castle,” is tailored to present a sympathetic image of the governor, who has dominated news in recent days with his shifting response to New York City’s first Ebola case, while reminding viewers of a central fiscal focus of his administration. With a comfortable lead over his Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, such messages are meant to cement the mainstream appeal of Mr. Cuomo, who drew his strongest support in a recent Siena College poll from voters earning less than $50,000.

PRODUCER AKPD Message and Media.

SCRIPT Mr. Cuomo: “My grandfather, Andrea, built this castle 50 years ago for the yard in his first home. He was so proud. His home was his castle. But it’s getting harder and harder to live in New York, because our taxes are just too high. We have lowered the state income taxes dramatically, but local property taxes are the problem: the highest in the nation. It’s from the waste and duplication of our over 10,000 local governments. It’s time we fix that, because everyone should be able to afford their own castle.”

ON SCREEN After wearing a white sweater (matched by white pumpkins beside him) in another recent advertisement[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/nyregion/cuomo-with-a-daughters-help-tweaks-his-education-image.html], Mr. Cuomo here opts for a powder blue pullover. The ad includes several lingering shots of an ornamental stone castle with an American flag planted in its tower. (Originally constructed in Queens, it is now at Mr. Cuomo’s home in — no kidding — New Castle, N.Y., in Westchester, where he lives with the Food Network host Sandra Lee.) Mr. Cuomo shows affection for the child-size citadel, clutching its wall, before speaking directly to the camera about taxes. The ad ends with sun-dappled images of Mr. Cuomo, Ms. Lee, Mr. Cuomo’s daughter Michaela and several more pumpkins, this time in the traditional orange.

ACCURACY The advertisement makes several claims about taxes, including that the governor has reduced “state income taxes dramatically.” Mr. Cuomo did cap local property taxes and cut corporate income tax, and the top personal income and effective tax rates in the state have declined since he took office in 2011. But whether taxes have fallen “dramatically” may depend on the size of one’s income. The claim of “over 10,000 local governments” is an exaggeration, if not a new one: The governor’s count includes thousands of special districts — for water, fire, and sewer services, for example — that do little but draw down tax revenue from residents. The office of the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, puts the number of actual governments, like towns, villages and counties, at closer to 3,200. Asserting that “waste and duplication” by those entities causes high property taxes is also debatable. Many such districts serve purely administrative functions, with little or no staff. But Mr. Cuomo argues that the sheer number of such bodies, acting as taxing entities, costs New Yorkers dearly.

SCORECARD His march toward a second term appearing largely unimpeded, Mr. Cuomo strikes a warm tone in the ad and stays clear of mentioning Mr. Astorino. Nor does he outline any concrete solutions to the problems he presents, saying only they should be fixed. With a week to go before the election, and a big lead, Mr. Cuomo looks very comfortable in the ad — and presumably hopes that will help voters feel the same way about him. JESSE McKINLEY

Wikipedia a go-to source on Ebola; Main article’s page views rival those of W.H.O. and U.S. disease centers

As a wave of Ebola fear grips the American public, the Internet is rife with conspiracy theories, supposed miracle cures and Twitter posts of dread.

But there are a few influential sites that are sticking to the facts. Millions of people have come to rely on these sites, including those run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and Wikipedia.

Wikipedia’s article on Ebola Virus Disease has had 17 million page views in the past month, right up there with the C.D.C.’s Ebola portal and the W.H.O.’s Ebola fact sheet, as well as the Ebola coverage of prominent health care brands like WebMD and the Mayo Clinic.

Once the butt of jokes for being the site where visitors could find anything, true or not, Wikipedia in recent years has become a more trusted source of information — certainly for settling bar bets, but even for weighty topics like Ebola.

‘‘It is because Wikipedia is such a recognized brand — obviously the C.D.C. is still much more authoritative than we will ever be — that people will click on that link,’’ said Dr. Jacob de Wolff, 37, an internist at Northwick Park Hospital in London, who founded Wikiproject Medicine in 2004 and has seen it go from obscurity to mockery to acceptance.

On Oct. 15, when it was announced that a second nurse in Dallas had tested positive for the virus, traffic for the Ebola Virus Disease article on English Wikipedia’s site reached a peak of 2.5 million page views. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 3.5 million page views that day of its Ebola content, while the Mayo Clinic Ebola content had about 200,000. Search engines, no doubt, drive such traffic totals.

An ‘‘Ebola’’ Google search had put Wikipedia’s article above the C.D.C.’s portal. But this weekend, Google highlighted the C.D.C. material and moved it to the top. Bing uses Wikipedia’s article for its Ebola summary.

The initial skepticism about Wikipedia was mainly structural: How could you trust an article in an ‘‘encyclopedia that anyone can edit?’’

The growing confidence in the site — certainly when it comes to public health articles — in part reflects the fact that much of Wikipedia is not edited by just ‘‘anyone.’’

‘‘Wikipedia is a do-ocracy,’’ said Dr. James Heilman, an emergency room doctor from British Columbia, Canada, who leads the Wikiproject Medicine, which keeps close watch on the most important public health articles, like Ebola Virus Disease. ‘‘Those who do the most, do have a greater influence.’’

Many impediments exist to someone casually editing the Ebola article. Only registered Wikipedia editors with at least some experience are permitted to edit the page, and the requirement for sourcing is much more rigorous than for other Wikipedia entries.

Newspaper articles, for example, do not cut it.

‘‘A key group of us keep an eye on articles that have become more popular to make sure that Wikipedia’s most-read content is of a reasonably high standard,’’ Dr. Heilman said.

Other health care sources have adapted to the intense interest in Ebola. UpToDate, a subscription service mainly used by doctors and owned by the Dutch company Wolters Kluwer, has made its Ebola information free to the public, including a summary of the basics of the disease written from a patient’s point of view. The publicly traded WebMD said that since the beginning of October millions of people have searched the virus on the site, and the site has produced articles, slide shows and even a quiz to reinforce best practices.

‘‘We pride ourselves on not being sensationalist,’’ Dr. Michael W. Smith, the chief medical editor at WebMD, said in an interview. ‘‘If you are turning to credible sources of information, you would not panic.’’

The editors of Wikipedia’s Ebola page say they earned a place as one of those credible sources. To protect against misinformation, potential editors must suggest adds or changes to the article on a separately maintained page, where editors, frequently Dr. Heilman, review them and decide whether to incorporate them.

Dr. Heilman, 35, the head of the emergency medicine department at East Kootenay Regional Hospital in Cranbrook, B.C., said that since January he had taken fewer shifts at the hospital so he could keep tabs on things and contribute to Wikipedia’s medical articles. He is unabashed about his goals: to emphasize that Ebola does not get transmitted through the air; to call out unproven treatments; and to make sure the language is as simple as possible, in part so it can be more easily translated into other languages.

‘‘We don’t need to write for experts — experts have lots of excellent sources,’’ he said.

On the public page where changes to the Ebola article are discussed, you can see suggestions that never made it. One user objected on animal rights grounds that the article calls for killing infected animals rather than quarantining them. Another said a Thai doctor had made progress on a cure, citing a few newspaper articles.

Periodically, the article will be criticized for being too simplified — there will be arguments over whether ‘‘hemorrhage’’ is the same as ‘‘bleed’’ and whether the article should point out that there are multiple strains of the Ebola virus. Others wonder why it includes so little discussion about the current outbreak. It is covered in a separate article.

‘‘My position is that people come to Wikipedia for an overview, for the background picture and by taking an article on a disease and skewing it to the outbreak we are doing a disservice,’’ Dr. Heilman said.

Nurse quarantined in U.S. will be allowed to go home

A nurse who recently returned from West Africa and was quarantined for three days at a New Jersey hospital despite having no symptoms associated with Ebola will be allowed to return to her home in Maine, where it will be left to local health officials to determine how she will monitor her health to ensure she is not infected with the virus.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, in a brief interview, said that he expected the nurse, Kaci Hickox, to be transferred later Monday after doctors and federal officials signed off on the plan.

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services’ Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement saying that officials would ‘‘work collaboratively with the affected individual’’ to establish an in-home quarantine protocol.

The nurse’s treatment in New Jersey had drawn withering criticism from both public health officials and the nurse herself.

After landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, a forehead scanner showed Ms. Hickox had a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit.

Ms. Hickox later said the reading had resulted from her being flushed and upset. A later reading by oral thermometer recorded a normal temperature of 98.6.

Since Friday, she has been kept at University Hospital in Newark, in an isolation tent with a portable toilet, but no shower or television.

Ms. Hickox called her treatment inhumane and castigated Mr. Christie for saying she was ‘‘obviously ill’’ when she displayed no symptoms of Ebola.

Her confinement coincided with the announcement by Mr. Christie and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Friday that they were ordering a mandatory quarantine of all health care workers returning from West Africa.

On Sunday, after facing fierce resistance from the White House and medical experts, Mr. Cuomo backed away from the announcement, saying that medical workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa but did not show symptoms of the disease would be allowed to remain at home and would receive compensation for lost income.

Also Sunday, a 5-year-old boy who recently returned to New York from Guinea was being tested for Ebola after he was taken to the hospital with symptoms consistent with the disease, health officials said.

The child was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center on Sunday night by emergency medical workers outfitted in protective gear and immediately placed in isolation.

Improvising on Ebola’s front lines; In Liberia, care involves few tools and prioritizing tasks with guesswork

Garmai Sayon endured more than anyone should have to bear. First, her husband died at the Ebola treatment center here, falling ill after rushing to help a stranger who had collapsed in their village. Five days later, their child — a 1-year-old boy whose two older siblings had been lost earlier to illness and accident — died in her arms while she was delirious from the disease.

Doctors and nurses tended to the young woman as she had fevers, suffered pains all over her body and lay listless, confused. ‘‘I just gave my heart to God,’’ Ms. Sayon recalled.

As her symptoms began to abate, her arm grew hot and swelled to twice its size, prompting fears of sepsis, an often deadly complication of infection. It most likely stemmed from where her intravenous line had been inserted but not changed as often as desirable because of risks, both to her and to the medical workers. Ms. Sayon had survived Ebola, but it was not yet certain that she would survive the treatment.

What level of care is possible for a disease with no cure being treated in wooden huts in the middle of a forest? How do medical workers prioritize which patients and tasks to focus on when they cannot do everything they were trained to do? Will their decisions determine who lives and who dies? And how would they even know?

‘‘You always want to do more, but it has to be balanced with what’s possible, with what makes sense for the context you’re working in,’’ said Pranav Shetty, the medical director at the center operated here by the humanitarian group International Medical Corps.

Because of the limited time they can spend in the sick wards in their stifling protective suits, the risks of certain procedures and even the amount of medicines available, health workers here and elsewhere in West Africa ration care, operating under constraints they often find frustrating. The mainstays of fighting the Ebola epidemic — isolation and basic treatment — have resulted in more dead than survivors among those infected, just like with Ms. Sayon’s family.

Nurses and doctors here improvise, taking small steps in hopes of improving the odds. They tie ropes to the rafters to hang IVs, then use blood-pressure cuffs to squeeze the bags of fluids into patients faster. Doctors prescribe a regimen of antibiotics and antimalarial medications to treat every patient for possible other illnesses coexisting with Ebola, because they do not have access to tests for them. ‘‘It’s surprising how much you can do without,’’ said Steve Whiteley, an emergency-medicine doctor from California, one of six physicians currently on rotation here.

But, he said, that is not nearly enough. So far, the clinic’s record appears similar to that of other treatment facilities in the countries hit hard by Ebola. Since mid-September, when the clinic opened, to Monday morning, 36 patients who tested positive for the disease died; 21 recovered; and others remained in treatment. Its fatality rate of 63 percent could change, as such measures tend to fluctuate.

Like others who have fought the disease close up, Dr. Whiteley and some colleagues here are pressing for more aggressive action. They are combing patient data for clues to what factors correlate with survival, and studying best practices with other treatment centers. They are debating everything from whether the center should install cooling systems, which might reduce dehydration among patients, to performing bedside testing and other interventions. Those could include experimental treatments, which the aid group Doctors Without Borders announced recently it would begin studying.

‘‘We help fewer than half, if help means save,’’ Dr. Whiteley said. ‘‘We do a lot, but we need to do more.’’

Treatment Perils

In the treatment wards, some of medicine’s most basic tools are hard to use. With their heads wrapped in protective coverings, the doctors and nurses do not use a stethoscope to listen for heart or breath sounds. Manual blood-pressure measurements present similar problems. Their hands sheathed in three pairs of gloves, the medical workers often struggle to find a vein by touch in order to draw blood. They do not keep detailed patient charts in the steamy wards — it is damp and difficult to see through fogged goggles — or remove notes because they would have to be disinfected.

The single lab test performed on patients here, a high-tech analysis that detects the virus, proved troublesome in the clinic’s first two weeks. A blood sample from Ms. Sayon, 23, for example, was drawn Sept. 28, the day after her arrival, but was lost after being handed over for shipment to a lab in the capital, Monrovia, more than four hours away. That experience was not uncommon, workers at the center said. Ms. Sayon was tested again five days later, after a mobile Ebola detection laboratory of the United States Navy opened near the treatment center, cutting from days to hours the time required for a diagnosis.

‘‘Is she the one who lost her baby and husband?’’ Steven Hatch, a volunteer from Worcester, Mass., asked during rounds one day at a whiteboard outside the wards, where staff members gathered after being sprayed down with a bleach solution and removing their protective suits. They wrote brief notes from memory about their patients.

The medical team later discussed the possibility of bringing scanners to copy and send notes from inside the wards, or using walkie-talkies to relay information to those outside. ‘‘It’s too hard to keep track of all the patients in your head,’’ Dr. Whiteley said.

He and others often rely on their instincts and experience. When Ms. Sayon’s second blood test for Ebola came back, the results were negative, but the doctors were wary of releasing her. She was bent over in a chair, shaking. Her eyes and cheeks were sunken. Keeping her in the ward for suspected cases risked infecting her with the virus, but the physicians reasoned she already had significant exposure from her family, and virus detection can sometimes lag symptoms by up to three days. (They also suspected there might have been a mix-up because of labeling problems that day with blood samples that the new center quickly worked to fix.)

‘‘Solomon would be on his knees after a week here,’’ Dr. Hatch said. ‘‘Every day there’s a new dilemma we haven’t considered.’’

Making Do

The risk-benefit calculus shapes almost everything. Before going into the treatment wards, one physician recently proposed setting clear priorities and one-hour limits. Drawing blood is vital, so Colin Bucks, an emergency doctor from Stanford University in California, improvised tube holders to make the process safer. Doctors and nurses operate blindly at times, so they are seeking more diagnostic tools. Some staff members cheered last week when Patricia Henwood, an emergency medicine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania volunteering here, announced that she hoped to get a portable ultrasound machine through a nonprofit she helped found. If one had been here already, doctors might have quickly ruled out a blood clot as the cause of Ms. Sayon’s swollen arm and been more certain that treating her with antibiotics for a possible life-threatening infection was the correct course.

The center dispenses drugs to alleviate Ebola symptoms, including anti-nausea medicine, a Tylenol-like painkiller that reduces fever and Haldol, an antipsychotic medication for patients writhing in delirium.

It also has a team of mental health professionals who provide counsel and comfort. (The center’s first movie night, with ‘‘The Lion King’’ projected on a sheet outdoors, drew even some of the sickest patients last week.)

A nurse gave a generic version of the sedative Valium to Ms. Sayon when she was feverish and appeared depressed. But with some supply shortages, staff members try to be prudent. ‘‘You have to be conscious of not just throwing everything at everyone,’’ Dr. Henwood said. If the center ran out of the sedative, and it was needed for a patient suffering a prolonged seizure, ‘‘You wouldn’t have medicine for them.’’

For several patients who seemed in agony, one doctor said he might have considered intravenous morphine. But International Medical Corps, a charity in Los Angeles, has not completed the requirements set by the Liberian authorities to administer the narcotic painkiller. Even if they could dispense it, several of the doctors were wary. Patients who were desperately ill sometimes made surprising recoveries, they warned, and too much morphine, which can depress breathing, could lead to an unnecessary death.

Perhaps the most potent tool the doctors and nurses have available for patients who cannot keep down liquids are IV fluids, to combat dehydration that can set off a deadly cascade: low blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances and organ failure. IV lines, though, pose certain risks. They require a needle, which can endanger health workers, and the insertion site should be changed frequently, which can harm Ebola patients vulnerable to bleeding. Also, the bag of fluids and the tubing are being removed when no nurses or doctors are present to prevent injury if a patient dislodges the apparatus. Like many others at the center, Ms. Sayon had begun receiving IV fluids soon after her arrival.

‘‘It would just be nice to have a better gauge of who needs it and how much,’’ said Dr. Whiteley, who practices at Kaiser Vallejo in Northern California. ‘‘I’d like to have more to go on than an educated guess.’’

One way to determine patients’ requirements would be to track their weights, but staff members had little time to do that, and some patients were too sick to step onto a scale, anyway. So doctors here used a cruder measure: They asked the patients whether they were drinking and urinating.

The most precise method, though, would require more drawing of blood and lab work. Miniature bedside lab units can provide data that would allow doctors to tailor daily treatments to each patient by adjusting levels of potassium or sodium, for example. That sort of tweaking is believed to have played a significant role in successfully treating health care workers with Ebola in the United States and Europe. And doctors here worried that low potassium in particular might be leading to some sudden deaths. Dr. Shetty, the medical director, said the center might consider acquiring the bedside units if administrators felt confident, given the additional risks, that the information the units produce would be used effectively.

In their debates, some of the medical workers reassure themselves that the center provides better care than some others in West Africa. The 48 beds in the center are not all occupied, which allows doctors, nurses and their assistants to offer patients a fair amount of attention. For a time, some overburdened treatment centers run by Doctors Without Borders did not even offer intravenous fluids because of the time and the risks involved. Dr. Hatch, for one, believes that IVs have made the difference for several patients he has treated.

But Dr. Whiteley sounded discouraged about the outcome of what he describes as compassionate, but bare-bones care. ‘‘Our mortality is horrible,’’ he said. ‘‘We all need to do more than we are doing if we think we are providing medical care consistent with modernity.’’

Going Home

Down a hilly road, over a wooden bridge that looked as if it was made of Popsicle sticks, to a cluster of mud-walled homes, Ms. Sayon traveled home, a new widow and childless mother.

Doctors at the center discharged her this month, sending her off with 10 days’ worth of antibiotics for abscesses on her arm and arranging for her to stop at a local doctor’s on the way.

Word traveled faster than the car, and the people of the village came to the roadside and raised their hands in greeting as it passed. Her mother and brother were missing, sick with Ebola in a Monrovia clinic; an aunt and her mother-in-law had died. But here was her mother’s tall brother, the imam of the village; her mother’s sister, with whom she would now stay; and her husband’s brother and his wife, who had also lost a child to Ebola.

The car stopped, and Ms. Sayon stepped out, cradling her sore arm. The district health officer, Francis Kollie, had accompanied her to assure the villagers that she was free of Ebola.

‘‘Accept her as a citizen,’’ he urged.

Villagers gathered around Ms. Sayon and began walking her toward her aunt’s home. The heavens opened up, and rain beat down. Her aunt draped a cloth over her head to shield her.

Two Governors’ Shifts on Ebola Are Criticized as Politics, Not Science

Shifting stances and a lack of clear standards from the governors of New York and New Jersey over their Ebola quarantine policy left critics and even some allies questioning on Monday whether the two men had fully worked through the details before they announced it.

In New York, local health officials said on Monday that they had not yet received any details of the three-day-old Ebola quarantine policy they are charged with enforcing.

In New Jersey, requests for such specifics were met with six sentences from a Friday press release.

The governors, Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York and Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey, said on Friday that they were imposing their strict new mandatory quarantine because standards from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] had been constantly shifting.

But on Monday, faced with criticism from the nurse who had been detained in Newark as the test case of the new quarantine, Mr. Christie said the C.D.C. — not New Jersey — had been responsible for hospitalizing her and giving her the Ebola test in the first place.

By Monday, the White House, the United Nations secretary general and civil-liberties groups, with varying degrees of anger, were accusing Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo of putting politics ahead of science, at the risk of deterring health care workers needed to treat the disease at its origin in Africa.

The governors, who recently appeared side by side to declare their combined resolve and strategy against the Islamic State, said on Friday that they needed clear policy to combat hysteria. But three days of apparent reversals — though both governors said there had been none — only helped to fan public confusion. (And a re-released, but inaccurate, transcript only compounded matters.)

“Unfortunately, this is a moving target,” said Dr. Gale R. Burstein, the health commissioner in Erie County, in western New York. “I really need to see something in writing to be able to determine what I think about their policy.” She added, “Right now it’s just a rumor.”

On Monday night, Mr. Cuomo’s office released an 11-page order from the acting state health commissioner, Dr. Howard A. Zucker, outlining the quarantine protocols. Dr. Zucker planned to present the protocols to county health officials on Tuesday.

The governors share not only a border but also a combativeness and a special relationship, which comes across as a nonaggression pact, if not an outright alliance: Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has refrained from commenting on the Christie administration’s role in the George Washington Bridge approach lane closings; Mr. Christie, the head of the Republican Governors Association, has declined entreaties to campaign for Mr. Cuomo’s Republican opponent in the Nov. 4 election.

Mr. Christie first issued an executive order on Ebola last Wednesday, and in a news conference that day said he was content with the screening and policies in place. Less than 48 hours later, he and Mr. Cuomo, at a hastily arranged news conference, dismissed federal standards as shifting and inadequate.

In what Mr. Christie called “tough, common-sense policy,” the governors on Friday outlined a mandatory 21-day quarantine for travelers who had direct contact with Ebola patients.

But on Monday, after fierce criticism from a nurse detained in Newark, Mr. Christie announced she was being released after four days of quarantine. He said that Maine, where she lives, would determine her treatment.

Revealing a new policy detail, Mr. Christie said that the nurse — who registered a fever on a forehead thermometer at the airport, but did not when her temperature was taken orally — could be released because she had not had a fever for 24 hours.

New Jersey officials would not say if 24 hours was the new standard for releasing someone from the hospital. Instead, the governor’s office issued a news release on Sunday and two on a Monday declaring that the policy had not changed.

Mr. Christie was defiant. “I didn’t reverse my decision,” he told reporters as he campaigned with Gov. Rick Scott, a fellow Republican, in Florida. “Why are you saying I reversed my decision? If she was continuing to be ill, she’d have to stay.”

Mr. Cuomo’s hard line alongside Mr. Christie on Friday came a day after he joined Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York City to urge calm.

Mr. Cuomo indicated at the outset that high-risk travelers not yet showing symptoms faced the prospect of quarantine “at a government-regulated facility.” On Sunday night, he put aside talk of confining asymptomatic people to institutions, and said those travelers would be able to stay in their own homes. But he, too, insisted on Sunday and again on Monday that he had not relaxed the quarantine policy.

Late Sunday night, his communications director, Melissa DeRosa, sent what she described as a “word for word” transcript of a portion of the news conference on Friday, which she said showed Mr. Cuomo had intended all along for the quarantine to take place primarily in private homes.

The transcript, however, which she also posted on Twitter, omitted language showing the governor agreed with Mr. Christie that some patients would be held in “designated facilities.”

In New Jersey, Nancy Foster Muñoz, a nurse and Republican assemblywoman whose son is a medical resident at the Newark hospital where the nurse was detained, said she understood that the governors had been reacting to outsize public panic.

But she said federal health officials’ recommendations were better balanced against the risk of deterring health workers from going to Africa, “because that’s where we need to stop this.”

Releasing the nurse after 24 hours, she said, did not meet the quarantine standards announced on Friday. But she agreed with the decision: “We can see that they’re adjusting the policy as they go along. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”

“I think maybe they learned something from this nurse,” she said, “which is that if she’s afebrile, asymptomatic, maybe that’s enough.”

Edwards, the public health director in Broome County, N.Y., along the Pennsylvania border, said she had emailed the State Health Department on Friday seeking guidance on complications that would result from quarantine. By Monday afternoon, she had not heard back. “This is new to all of us,” she said.

Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, all but said quarantine could be a time for rest and relaxation.

“Enjoy your family, enjoy your kids, enjoy your friends,” said the governor, also a recently published author. “Read a book. Read my book.”
