MONROVIA, Liberia — Soldiers and police officers in riot gear blocked the roads. Even the waterfront was cordoned off, with the coast guard stopping residents from setting out in canoes. The entire neighborhood, a sprawling slum with tens of thousands of people, awoke Wednesday morning to find that it was under strict quarantine in the government’s halting fight against Ebola.

The reaction was swift, and violent. Angry young men hurled rocks and stormed barbed-wire barricades, trying to break out. Soldiers repelled the surging crowd with live rounds, driving back hundreds of young men.

One teenager in the crowd, Shakie Kamara, 15, lay on the ground near the barricade, his right leg apparently wounded by a bullet from the melee. “Help me,” he pleaded, barefoot and wearing a green Philadelphia Eagles T-shirt.

“This is messed up,” said Lt. Col. Abraham Kromah, the head of operations for the national police, looking at the teenager and complaining about the crowd. “They injured one of my police officers. That’s not cool. It’s a group of criminals that did this. Look at this child. God in heaven help us.”

The clashes were a dangerous new chapter in West Africa’s five-month-old fight against the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record. The virus continues to spread, yet the total number of cases reported in the affected nations — Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone — is already higher than in all other Ebola outbreaks combined[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1409903?query=featured_home] since 1976, when the disease was first identified, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.

So far, the outbreak has mostly been concentrated in rural areas[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/world/africa/at-heart-of-ebola-outbreak-a-village-frozen-by-fear-and-death.html], but the disease has also spread to major cities like the Guinean capital Conakry[http://www.msf.org/article/msf-operational-update-ebola-outbreak-west-africa], and especially here in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. Fighting Ebola in an urban area — particularly in a neighborhood like this one, known as West Point, an extremely poor and often violent place that still bears deep scars from Liberia’s 14 years of civil war — presents challenges that the government and international aid organizations have only started grappling with.

The risks that Ebola will spread quickly, and the difficulties in containing it[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/dont-touch-the-walls-ebola-fears-infect-hospital.html], are multiplied in a dense urban environment, especially one where the health system has largely collapsed and residents appear increasingly distrustful of the government’s approach to the crisis, experts say.

At least 1,350 people are estimated to have died in the current outbreak[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_20_ebola/en/] of Ebola, the first of its kind[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/world/africa/tracing-ebolas-breakout-to-an-african-2-year-old.html] in West Africa. The deaths are rising most rapidly in Liberia, which now has the highest death toll, estimated to be at least 576.

“Being the first time to get this problem, they didn’t know what they were dealing with,” Dr. David Kaggwa, a Ugandan physician working for the World Health Organization here, said of the Liberian government. “They didn’t know how to respond to it. By the time they realized, it was way out of control.”

In a cholera ward at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center that he helped transform into an Ebola ward, Dr. Kaggwa said that his own nation’s long history with Ebola was limited to rural outbreaks.

“This is our first experience in a capital city, and all the indications are that it spreads faster in a city because people are living closer together,” he said.

Beyond the threat of Ebola itself, experts warn that there has been a broader collapse of the public health system here, resulting in a range of life-threatening illnesses and conditions that are being left untreated. Many hospitals closed after health workers died, and the facilities that remain open have become overwhelmed.

“The emergency within the emergency is the collapse of the health care system,” said Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, who recently surveyed Liberia and other affected nations. “People don’t have access to basic health care,” she said, including malaria treatment for children, medical care for pregnant women and other common but essential needs.

Dr. Liu said that her team had come across six instances of pregnant women who had been wandering around Monrovia for hours, looking for a facility that could help deliver their babies. “They couldn’t find one,” she said. By the time her team had attended to the women, she added, the babies had died.

“All the health care facilities are basically closed in Monrovia,” she added. “There may be some marginal activities, but basically there’s nothing really working right now.”

Sheldon Yett, the director in Liberia for Unicef, said the group has deployed volunteers to West Point and other poor areas to educate residents about Ebola. “The fact that it is really firmly entrenched now in the capital city makes it a real game changer for us,” he said.

Even before the government imposed a blanket quarantine on West Point — a strategy governments in the region are using in a desperate bid [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html]to contain the outbreak — the neighborhood was seething.

Last week, Health Ministry officials quietly turned a primary school in West Point into a holding center for Ebola patients without informing the residents. Over the weekend, hundreds of residents[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/world/africa/with-aid-doctors-gone-ebola-fight-grows-harder.html] invaded the center, enraged that outsiders were also being transferred there. Their community, they believed, was becoming a dumping ground for Ebola patients. Residents stormed through, running off with a generator and supplies like mattresses, some soaked with the blood of patients who were believed to have Ebola.

“I can tell you they were uncountable,” said Isaac Toe, 25, a hygienist who was working at the center at the time of the invasion. “The entire West Point community broke in — men, women, children, boys and girls.”

Christiana Williams, 52, who lives behind the center, said that locals were bewildered when they learned that the neighborhood school had been turned overnight into an Ebola holding center. Through the weekend, she said she heard cries from inside the center.

“ ‘We’re not eating,’  ” Ms. Williams recalled hearing. “ ‘They’re just spraying us.’ ‘We’re getting weak.’ ”About 17 patients who were thought to have Ebola left the center for a couple of days before they were brought to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center here, raising concerns that the disease would continue to spread.

“There’s enough blame to go around,” said Lewis Brown, the information minister, acknowledging that the residents were caught by surprise.

Health officials had no choice but to transfer patients from outside West Point to the holding center because it was the only one of its kind in the city, Mr. Brown said, adding that the government is planning to open similar centers elsewhere.

On Tuesday, hours before the quarantine was declared, community leaders said that despite improvements since the end of the war in 2003 — the creation of public toilets, the paving of the main road — West Point remained a crucible for Liberia’s postwar problems. Crime keeps rising, and so has the use of crack cocaine, called coco or Italian White.

Sprawling across a peninsula just north of the city center, much of West Point is made up of shanties separated by alleys wide enough for only one person. After the war, its population swelled as rural Liberians gravitated here looking for work. Anywhere from 60,000 to 120,000 people are believed to live in West Point.

A deep distrust of the government has fueled rumors that the authorities have made up the Ebola crisis to squeeze money out of international donors.

“We have a lot of Doubting Thomases,” Philip Bropleh, 45, an electrician and community leader, said of people, including politicians, who have said that the government has invented the crisis. “Because of all these things, it allowed Ebola to run into Monrovia.”

On Tuesday night, after most people had gone to sleep, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced the imposition of the quarantine in West Point as well as a nationwide curfew. Early Wednesday morning, crowds tried to break through the barricade near an electrical station.

During a lull, many residents complained that they could not leave West Point for work.

“There is nowhere to go for our daily bread,” said Davidette Wilson, 27, who sells goods at a large market just outside West Point.

Making matters worse, the quarantine immediately led to a surge in prices of goods sold inside West Point, residents said. A cup of rice, usually the equivalent of 30 cents, was now going for 90 cents, they said.

Peter Tarr, 22, one of the many former child soldiers in West Point, eked out a living by begging in the city’s wealthier areas. “Where can I go to beg now?” said Mr. Tarr, who lost his right arm in the war.

By midmorning, a crowd began gathering again in front of the entrance near the electrical station.

“You fight Ebola with arm?” David Anan, 34, shouted at the heavily armed soldiers.

Minutes later, hundreds of stone-hurling young men tried to storm through the barricade once again.

In all, residents tried to break through the barricade three times on Wednesday, Col. Prince Johnson, the army’s brigade commander, said Wednesday evening by phone. His soldiers had fired in the air, he said, but he would not comment on whether they had also fired into the crowd, including at the teenage boy. Heavy rains starting around noon helped quell West Point’s fury.

“Things have quieted down,” he said.

Experimental drug sparks hope in Ebola fight; Treatment kept monkeys alive after similar virus was detected, study finds

An experimental drug has completely protected monkeys from lethal doses of a virus related to Ebola, bolstering confidence that a similar medicine might be effective if deployed in the current outbreak in Africa, researchers reported on Wednesday.

The researchers said that the drug, which is being developed by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, kept all monkeys alive in a study, even if given as late as three days after exposure to the Marburg virus, when the virus could be detected in the animals’ blood.

Both Marburg and Ebola are filoviruses that cause deadly hemorrhagic fever characterized by multiple organ failure and uncontrolled bleeding. Tekmira, which is based in British Columbia, has a separate drug for Ebola that is already in early testing in healthy human volunteers. Both drugs use the same approach: turning off viral genes through an approach called RNA interference.

Some experimental drugs for Marburg and Ebola have been shown in animal studies to be effective when given shortly after infection. But in a real epidemic like the one in West Africa, most people do not know they have been infected until they get sick, which can be a week or more later. So there is a need for drugs that will treat a disease that is already underway.

Tekmira’s Marburg drug moves in that direction. The virus was detectable in the monkey’s blood three days after exposure, corresponding to the time an infection might first be diagnosed using a test.

The study demonstrates the ‘‘real-world utility of this technology,’’ said Dr. Thomas W. Geisbert, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and a senior author of the study, which is being published in Science Translational Medicine. He said additional studies were being planned to see if the drug could be used even further out.

Dr. Daniel G. Bausch, an associate professor of tropical medicine at Tulane University, who was not involved in the study, said effectiveness at three days after exposure was not that useful. In an outbreak, only people who are closely monitored — like those who have had contact with an infected person — might get a diagnosis based on a blood test, before symptoms appear.

‘‘The vast majority of people come in after they are sick for a couple of days,’’ said Dr. Bausch. In the study, even the monkeys that did not get the drug did not show symptoms until about six days after exposure.

In the study, paid for by the National Institutes of Health, 21 rhesus macaques were exposed to a high dose of the Angola strain of Marburg, the most lethal strain, with a human fatality rate of up to 90 percent.

The monkeys were given daily injections of the drug for seven days. For four of the monkeys, the injections did not start until 72 hours after exposure. The others began receiving injections at earlier time points.

All 16 of the treated animals survived, with reduced viral levels and disease symptoms. The five monkeys in the control group all died or became so sick that they were euthanized.

Some of the study’s authors work for Tekmira and Dr. Geisbert has patent rights to this type of treatment.

Gene G. Olinger, an Ebola and Marburg expert at MRIGlobal, a research institute, said other experimental drugs had provided protection at three days or later, but usually not 100 percent.

Tekmira’s Ebola drug protected two-thirds of monkeys when given at three days after exposure. A predecessor of ZMapp, a drug that appears to have helped two American aid workers stricken with Ebola in the recent outbreak in West Africa, kept three of seven monkeys alive when given four to five days after exposure to Ebola, when some of the animals had symptoms.

Tekmira executives have said the company was evaluating possible ways to use its Ebola drug in the current outbreak, but they have provided little detail. An executive said last week that it would take months to make more of the drug, which is being developed under a United States Defense Department contract.

Federal officials monitoring the situation said Tekmira had about 44 doses and decided to retain them for its own clinical trials after talks with one or more African governments broke down.

The testing of the Ebola drug in healthy volunteers was halted by the Food and Drug Administration last month after some patients suffered inflammatory reactions at high doses. Earlier this month, however, the F.D.A. said the drug could be tested on people actually infected with Ebola.

RNA interference, the technique used by Tekmira, is a way to turn off potentially any gene. It holds promise for treating many diseases, not just viral infections.

Such drugs typically consist of short stretches of synthesized double-stranded RNA that match part of the gene to be silenced. The challenge for drug companies has been delivering the RNA through the bloodstream and into the cells where it is needed. Tekmira encapsulates the RNA in microscopic lipid particles to help in this.

‘‘This technique of getting a lipid-encapsulated product that can actually enter the cell efficiently is something that is important,’’ said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Top General Becomes Thai Prime Minister, Sealing Military's Rule

The army general who led the overthrow of Thailand's elected government in May was named prime minister Thursday by a rubber-stamp legislature, sealing the military's acquisition of near-absolute power in a country once considered a regional beacon of political freedom.

Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha was chosen as prime minister by the National Legislative Assembly, whose members were handpicked by the junta last month. There were no dissenting votes, and General Prayuth, who was attending a military ceremony outside of Bangkok and was not present, was the only candidate.

Thailand has a long history of generals seizing power, but the military this time has been more aggressive in rooting out democratic institutions than after the last coup in 2006. All forms of popular elections have been suspended, including those for local councils that first appeared well over a century ago when Thailand was still an absolute monarchy.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is 86 years old and ailing, endorsed the junta soon after the coup and was expected to formally approve General Prayuth's selection as prime minister.

The ascendance this year of military power in Thailand goes against a recent trend of greater democratization in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, which for decades was ruled by a military strongman, a populist governor, Joko Widodo, defeated a former general in the July presidential election. Meanwhile, Thailand's western neighbor, Myanmar, is embracing multiparty democracy after five decades of harsh military dictatorship.

Thailand's military says it will eventually restore democracy. But the junta has not provided a firm timetable for elections, and an interim constitution introduced by the military says that democracy, when it is restored, will be ''suitable for a Thai context,'' a vague qualification that has yet to be defined.

Surachart Bamrungsuk, a professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok and one of the leading experts on the Thai military, describes the current system as a ''soft dictatorship'' and says that the top generals are trying to cement their place in the country's future.

''What they want is a kind of guided democracy where the military has a supervisory role,'' Professor Surachart said.

Although martial law is still in effect and more than 500 people with links to political activism have been detained since the coup -- most of them have since been released -- the junta's political repression is scarcely felt on the streets of Bangkok, which remain lively despite a 10 percent drop in the number of foreign tourists visiting the country this year and an economy that shrank in the first half of 2014.

Even those skeptical of the bloodless coup admit that the military has significant support, especially among the urban middle class.

The military seized power on May 22 after six months of political stalemate brought on by protests backed by the Bangkok establishment. The coup achieved the ultimate goal of the protesters, the removal from power of the governing party founded by the billionaire former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose movement has strong support in the provinces and has repeatedly won national elections but antagonized the Bangkok elites.

''A lot of people who supported the coup see it as a necessary pause for democracy -- they are buying into what the coup leaders are saying,'' said Sarinee Achavanuntakul, an investment banker turned blogger who has been critical of the coup.

Military rule is popular with Thais who are tired of street protests and polarized politics, Ms. Sarinee said. ''I think there's a false normalcy now,'' she said.

Political rancor has been pushed underground. The normally divisive and cacophonous process of passing an annual budget was dispensed with in a few hours this week when members of the National Legislative Assembly, most of whom are either current or retired soldiers, voted unanimously to pass it. Politicians -- defined as anyone who has held a position in a political party within the last three years -- are barred from membership in the assembly.

Thongchai Winichakul, a professor of Southeast Asian history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says the junta is harnessing disdain for politicians and a yearning, among some Thais, for virtuous authoritarianism.

''Buddhist political philosophy has always featured an enlightened despot,'' he said.

But Professor Thongchai predicts that ultimately the generals will be unable to manage the country, the second largest economy in Southeast Asia, and will meet resistance to their rule.

''Paternalistic dictatorship won't work anymore,'' he said. ''The society is too complex.'' Previous military strongmen in Thailand operated during a time when the country was poor and agrarian, he said; Thailand today has a population that is much more politically aware and demanding.

General Prayuth has decreed an expansion of spending on railways and roads, and regularly makes pronouncements on matters well beyond the normal duties of a career soldier. In a recent speech he addressed the Ebola outbreak in Africa, trash management, begging syndicates, education, tourism, household debt and surrogacy.

The military says its mission is to bring ''happiness back to the people'' and has announced a number of populist policies since coming to power, including a raise for civil servants, free movie tickets and putting World Cup soccer games on free television channels.

General Prayuth, who gives weekly addresses to the country, speaks in a folksy style and often brushes off serious issues with attempts at levity. Unlike previous Thai military strongmen, he had a relatively low profile before becoming the chief of the army in 2010.

Even a military officer who researched a book with him says he knows little about General Prayuth's career and personal life.

''Very few people know his background,'' said the officer, Col. Khajornsak Thaiprayoon, a lecturer at the Command and General Staff College in Bangkok who helped publish the book, ''The Royal Thai Armed Forces and Non-Traditional Threats.''

A military spokesman said there was no resume available for General Prayuth. The general does not appear to have ever served in battle, but he was instrumental in organizing the crackdown against protesters in Bangkok in 2010 that left more than 90 people dead.

General Prayuth, who is 60, faces legally mandated retirement from the military next month; his appointment as prime minister will allow him to continue to lead the junta.

Professor Surachart, the military expert, says the junta's acceptance by the public will depend in large part on whether the ruling generals keep their hands clean.

''The big question is will they revert to the corrupt practices of the past,'' he said.

Previous military strongmen in Thailand amassed staggering levels of wealth. The estate of Sarit Thanarat, who seized power in a coup in 1957 and ruled for six years, was valued at $140 million when he died, a sum equivalent to more than $1 billion in today's dollars. The general's fortune became public after 20 people who claimed to be his wives, mistresses and children sought legal action after his death.

Soldiers and police officers in riot gear blocked the roads. Even the waterfront was cordoned off, with the coast guard stopping residents from setting out in canoes. The entire neighborhood, a sprawling slum with tens of thousands of people, awoke in the morning to find that it was under strict quarantine in the government’s halting fight against Ebola.

The reaction was swift and violent. Angry young men hurled rocks and stormed barbed-wire barricades, trying to break out. Soldiers repelled the surging crowd with live rounds, driving back hundreds of young men. One teenager in the crowd, Shakie Kamara, 15, lay on the ground near the barricade, his right leg apparently wounded by a bullet from the melee. ‘‘Help me,’’ he pleaded, barefoot and wearing a green Philadelphia Eagles T-shirt.

‘‘This is messed up,’’ said Lt. Col. Abraham Kromah, the head of operations for the national police, looking at the teenager and complaining about the crowd. ‘‘They injured one of my police officers. That’s not cool. It’s a group of criminals that did this. Look at this child. God in heaven help us.’’

By Thursday morning, calm prevailed as driving rain dampened tensions. But the capital remained on edge as the clashes on Wednesday had opened a dangerous new chapter in West Africa’s five-month fight against the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record.

The virus continues to spread, yet the total number of cases reported in the affected nations — Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone — is already higher than in all other Ebola outbreaks combined since 1976, when the disease was first identified, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.

The outbreak has mostly been concentrated in rural areas, but the disease has also spread to major cities like the Guinean capital, Conakry, and especially here in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. Fighting Ebola in an urban area — particularly in a neighborhood like this one, known as West Point, an extremely poor and often violent place that still bears deep scars from Liberia’s 14 years of civil war — presents challenges that the government and international aid organizations have only started grappling with.

The risks that Ebola will spread quickly, and the difficulties in containing it, are multiplied in a dense urban environment, especially one where the health system has largely collapsed and residents appear increasingly distrustful of the government’s approach to the crisis, experts say.

At least 1,350 people are estimated to have died in the current outbreak of Ebola, the first of its kind in West Africa. The deaths are rising most rapidly in Liberia, which now has the highest death toll, estimated to be at least 576.

‘‘Being the first time to get this problem, they didn’t know what they were dealing with,’’ David Kaggwa, a Ugandan physician working for the World Health Organization here, said of the Liberian government. ‘‘They didn’t know how to respond to it.

Making matters worse, the quarantine immediately led to a surge in prices of goods sold inside West Point, residents said.

Two American aid workers who were infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia have recovered after being treated in a hospital in Atlanta, The Associated Press reported on Thursday.

Alison Geist, a spokeswoman for Samaritan’s Purse, the aid organization that Dr. Kent Brantly was working for, confirmed that he would be discharged on Thursday. The second aid worker, Nancy Writebol, was released on Tuesday.

Dr. Brantly, 33, was flown out of Liberia on Aug. 2 and had been in the hospital’s isolation unit for nearly three weeks. Ms. Writebol, 59, left Liberia on Aug. 5. They were infected while working at a missionary clinic.

Ebola Patient Revels in ‘Miraculous Day’ as He and Another Exit Hospital

ATLANTA — To evaluate the condition of Dr. Kent Brantly[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/us/kent-brantley-nancy-writebol-ebola-treatment-atlanta.html], the American aid worker who became the first person to be treated for Ebola in the United States, all anyone needed to do Thursday was notice what he was not wearing.

Gone was the bulky white suit he had been put in upon his arrival on Aug. 2, amid heavy security, at Emory University Hospital here.

Instead, appearing trim and vibrant and wearing a button-down shirt and slacks, Dr. Brantly stood before reporters as he prepared to leave Emory after his doctors declared him recovered from the virus he contracted while working in Liberia.

“Today is a miraculous day,” Dr. Brantly, his wife at his side, said in a steady voice that wavered when he thanked his health care team. “I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family.”

Emory said on Thursday that Dr. Brantly, who lived in Fort Worth before going to Liberia, and Nancy Writebol[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/us/nancy-writebol-kent-brantly-ebola-atlanta.html], a missionary from Charlotte, N.C., who also contracted Ebola while in Africa this summer, had been released from its specialized isolation unit this week. The hospital, in a statement, said it was “confident that the discharge of these patients poses no public health threat” and said the decision to release them was linked to the results of urine and blood tests.

Ms. Writebol, who did not appear before reporters, was released on Tuesday, but the hospital did not announce her discharge until Thursday morning. Her husband, David Writebol, said in a statement that “the lingering effects of her battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition” that required additional rest without an onslaught of public scrutiny.

But he added, “Her departure from the hospital, free of the disease, is powerful testimony to God’s sustaining grace in time of need.”

Emory officials, whose decision to admit Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol prompted questions about whether their arrivals could spread the virus in the United States, on Thursday defended their actions.

“We understand that there are a lot of questions and concerns regarding Ebola virus and the infection that it causes,” said Dr. Bruce S. Ribner, the Emory infectious diseases specialist who coordinated the treatment of Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol. “However, we cannot let our fears dictate our actions. We must all care.”

Dr. Ribner said it was “the right decision” to evacuate the patients to Emory from Liberia, both because they could receive superior care in the United States and because the lessons learned in treating them could eventually assist doctors treating patients on the front lines.

Emory doctors were able, Dr. Ribner said, to carefully monitor levels of electrolytes in the patients, as well as any abnormalities in their blood clotting.

It will be difficult, though, to apply such guidance in West Africa. Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, said in an interview on Tuesday that patients in their treatment centers received only a single blood test — a screening for the Ebola virus — between admission and death or recovery. There were no tests for electrolytes or clotting factors, she said, because it is simply too risky to handle the blood of Ebola patients, especially in conditions where doctors and nurses are stressed and overworked from an outbreak that has already killed more than 1,200 people.

Even if electrolytes cannot be easily measured in the emergency field hospitals that dot Africa, Dr. Ribner said, the Emory experience showed the importance of replacing lost electrolytes in patients suffering from Ebola.

At Emory, Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol were held in an isolation ward built 12 years ago after consultation with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has its headquarters near the hospital. Visitor contact was limited — glass separated Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol from family members — and hospital staff members donned specialized gear before interacting with the patients.

Faced with questions of whether Emory was gambling public health to assist the two patients, the hospital and its supporters, including the director of the disease centers, said there was no risk for the infection to spread.

Dr. Ribner said that there was no virus in their blood and that they no longer had any symptoms. “We are confident they pose no public health threat,” he said. Virus has been found in the semen of men who recovered from Ebola as long as three months after recovery. But the disease has never been proven to have been transmitted through sex. The C.D.C. suggests that men who have recovered use condoms temporarily, and Dr. Brantly was informed of the C.D.C.’s recommendation, Dr. Ribner said.

Although Dr. Ribner conceded on Thursday that doctors “didn’t know what to expect” about how Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol would fare in the United States, he said that Emory officials had “always suspected that we had a good chance of helping these patients survive.”

It remained unclear on Thursday whether an experimental drug the two received while still in Africa had aided in their recoveries.

“Frankly, we do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference or even, theoretically, if it delayed their recovery,” Dr. Ribner said.

But on Thursday, Dr. Brantly focused on thanking the five doctors specializing in infectious diseases, the 21 nurses and many other sub-specialists Emory said were involved in caring for him and Ms. Writebol.

And then, before he hugged teary-eyed members of his medical team who stood behind him during his statement, he said, “Above all, I am forever thankful to God for sparing my life and I’m glad for any attention my sickness has attracted to the plight of West Africa in the midst of this epidemic.”

Israel Kills 3 Top Hamas Leaders, Securing Upper Hand in Fighting

JERUSALEM — Hamas is the party that keeps extending this summer’s bloody battle in the Gaza Strip, repeatedly breaking temporary truces and vowing to endlessly fire rockets into Israel until its demands are met. But the latest round of fighting appears to have given Israel the upper hand in a conflict that has already outlasted all expectations and is increasingly becoming a war of attrition.

Barrages of rockets from Gaza sailed into Israel nearly nonstop on Thursday, but they did little damage, and a Hamas threat against Ben-Gurion International Airport failed to materialize. Israel, meanwhile, killed three top commanders of Hamas’s armed wing in predawn airstrikes, and by afternoon had called up 10,000 reservists, perhaps in preparation for a further escalation but in any case a show of strength.

Israel’s advantage has never looked more lopsided. In contrast to the earlier phase of the war, Israel this week deployed its extensive intelligence capabilities and overwhelming firepower in targeted bombings with limited civilian casualties less likely to raise the world’s ire.

Hamas, the Islamist Palestinian faction that dominates Gaza, buried some of its most beloved and effective leaders while launching largely futile homemade rockets from its depleted stock.

“There’s a longstanding conventional wisdom that Israel doesn’t do well in wars of attrition,” said Michael B. Oren, an Israeli historian and a former ambassador to the United States. “That overlooks a broader historical view that Israel’s entire existence has been a war of attrition, and we’ve won that war.”

The long-term impact of the strikes against the Hamas commanders, which followed an attempted assassination of the head of the armed wing on Tuesday night, may be limited. Hamas waged its fiercest fight ever this summer despite Israel’s 2012 hit on the director of day-to-day military operations.

But in killing Hamas militant leaders responsible for years of headline-grabbing attacks, including the 2006 abduction of Sgt. Gilad Shalit, Israel dealt a profound psychological blow to the enemy while giving the home front something clear to celebrate.

“These are senior people,” said Michael Herzog, a retired Israeli brigadier general and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “People in Gaza know exactly who they are, people in Israel know exactly who they are. In our bilateral context, it resonates strongly.”

Even more significant would be the death of Mohammed Deif, the shadowy figure who has survived several previous Israeli assassination attempts with severe injuries and was the target of Tuesday night’s attack. Mr. Deif’s fate remained unknown Thursday, though the body of his 3-year-old daughter, Sara, was recovered from the rubble of the Gaza City home where five one-ton bombs also killed Mr. Deif’s wife, baby son and at least three others.

Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli chief of military intelligence, called the killing of Mr. Deif’s three deputies “a very important operational achievement” and said that if Mr. Deif also turns up dead, “this will badly hurt Hamas’s military wing.”

“This is a complex campaign and there is no such thing as a knockout, or a silver bullet that will put Hamas out of commission,” cautioned Mr. Yadlin, director of the Institute for National Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. “We’re now going to a war of attrition that was a threat of Hamas. Israel basically turned it upside down and said, ‘You want attrition? You are welcome. You lost your strategic military tools against Israel. Our firepower and our intelligence and our capability to sustain more days is much bigger than yours.’ This is the strategy.”

The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 60 people since the collapse on Tuesday of cease-fire negotiations in Cairo and the resumption of violence after nearly nine days of quiet, bringing the Palestinian death toll in the operation that began July 8 close to 2,100.

Several of Thursday’s attacks targeted men on motorcycles or in cars who Israel said were militants, though Palestinian witnesses also reported that five people, three of them children, were killed while watering a Gaza City garden, and five others while digging a grave in the Sheikh Radwan cemetery.

Returning to a limited air campaign after weeks of a ground assault in which 64 of its soldiers were killed in surprisingly strong challenges by Hamas fighters, Israel was able to avoid the large-scale collateral damage that has provoked international outrage.

The Israeli military said that more than 300 rockets were fired from Gaza over 48 hours, one of the most intense barrages of the battle so far, sending rattled residents of southern cities once again scrambling for shelter. Though Israel’s education minister announced that school would start as scheduled Sept. 1, the mayor of Ashkelon, less than 10 miles from Gaza, said he would not allow schools in his city to open under fire.

With Israel and the Palestinians apparently still far apart on terms for a durable truce, analysts suggested settling in for days or even weeks more of cross-border air exchanges, after what is already the longest Israeli military operation in decades. Diplomatic pressure appeared to be easing, if only because the world’s attention seems focused on other crises including the rise of Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria, the Ebola outbreak in Africa and civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo.

As the conflict grinds on, Israelis see time as on their side. Experts estimate that Hamas began the summer with a stockpile of about 10,000 rockets. It has fired nearly 4,000, according to the Israeli military, which says it has taken out at least 3,000 more. So it cannot keep launching at this pace for long.

Israel has much vaster resources, though its politicians and people are increasingly fractured over the prosecution of the campaign. There are growing calls for a more aggressive ground invasion, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted, and intense opposition to the idea of making concessions in a cease-fire agreement that might seem to reward Hamas.

“His hope is that he can avoid those two things by essentially continuing an air campaign while Hamas fires rockets,” said Nathan Thrall, co-author of a recent International Crisis Group report on Gaza. “Israel can play that game for a long time, certainly longer than Hamas can. That’s true on a purely military level, but the fact is, as the war drags on, it’s going to be harder and harder for Netanyahu not to do one of those two things.”

In Gaza, time is a liability. The number of displaced residents seeking shelter in United Nations schools swelled to nearly 300,000 as the violence resumed; officials have already given up any hope of classes starting Sunday as planned.

Analysts said the recent halt in hostilities had made the leaders of Hamas’s Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades vulnerable, as they left the safety of underground bunkers.

In a statement, Hamas said that the three commanders were part of Qassam’s “founding generation” and had “fed pain to the enemy for more than 20 years.” Killed were Mohammed Abu Shamalah, who was the head of Qassam’s southern division and known as “the Fox”; Raed Attar, nicknamed “the Blonde” and in charge of the Rafah brigade; and Mohammed Barhoum — “the White-Haired,” or “the Old” — who had been on Israel’s most-wanted list for two decades.

When Sergeant Shalit was exchanged for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in October 2011 after Hamas held him in captivity for five years, it was Mr. Attar seen in a video ushering him from a pickup truck. Mr. Abu Shamalah, the Israeli military said, was also involved in a 2004 tunnel attack that killed six soldiers, and the 1994 murder of an Israeli officer in Rafah.

Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, called the killing of the Qassam commanders “a big Israeli crime that will not succeed in breaking our people’s will,” and promised, “Israel will pay the price.”

But a 39-year-old mourner who would identify himself only as Abu Nuqira acknowledged, “This is a painful loss — they are the symbols of resistance.”

In the Rafah refugee camp, a friend of Mr. Abu Shamalah’s said he had last seen him at the onset of the war, with Mr. Attar, and that he had said then he hoped to be a martyr.

“I told them, how do you stay together under these circumstances?” recalled the friend, who gave his name as Abu Mohammed and said he was 55. “He said that we lived together and we will die together.”

MONROVIA, Liberia — A teenage boy who was wounded on Wednesday during clashes at an Ebola-stricken neighborhood in Monrovia, Liberia, died of hypovolemic shock after being shot in his legs, said Dr. Mohammed Sankoh, the medical director of Redemption Hospital.

The teenager, Shakie Kamara, 15, was part of a large crowd of young men who tried to storm out of the neighborhood, West Point, which was placed under quarantine the night before. Soldiers fired live rounds to drive the protesters back into their neighborhood.

Two other residents also were shot during the disturbances. They were taken to Redemption Hospital and were released on Thursday, Dr. Sankoh said.

Two New Cases of Ebola Stem From Indirect Contact

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Two new cases of Ebola were reported in Nigeria on Friday, both in spouses of health workers who died after caring for the Liberian-American who brought the disease[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] there last month.

The health minister of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, said more cases beyond the 14 known ones could arise, but thus far all are linked to Patrick Sawyer, a Minnesota resident who was very ill when he arrived in Lagos on a flight from Liberia and died soon after, on July 25.

The cases were the first from secondhand contact with Mr. Sawyer. Until Friday, world health officials had hoped Nigeria’s outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/africa/ebola-in-nigeria.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] was fading.

“We are not surprised by this,” Dr. Onyebuchi Chukwu, the health minister, said in a telephone interview. “There may be a few more. All these cases are linked to the index case, so the risk is still there. Our fingers are crossed.”

He added that he would be more upset if the disease had appeared in someone not linked to Mr. Sawyer or if one of the secondhand cases had passed it on.

Twelve people who had contact with Mr. Sawyer, in the hospital or in the car that took him there, have fallen ill. Two doctors, two nurses and the driver have died.

The dead health workers’ spouses, a man and a woman, are now being treated, said Dan Nwomeh, a Health Ministry spokesman.

Five others have been treated and released.

Mr. Sawyer apparently caught the disease from his sister, Princess, who died July 7 in a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia.

As of Friday, the World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/en/] reported 2,615 confirmed or suspected cases of the virus in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, with 1,427 deaths.

Nigeria’s containment strategy should still be considered successful, Dr. Chukwu said, emphasizing that all of the known cases were in one city, Lagos, and that all of the known contacts of every case were under constant observation.

With help from the United States, he added, Nigeria was improving its airport screening. It has been using hand-held devices to check the temperatures of arriving passengers, but the United States is supplying thermal imaging cameras that will allow more people to be checked at once as they walk by.

“People should feel free to visit Nigeria,” he said.

The W.H.O. has not suggested any travel restrictions on Nigeria.

KENEMA, Sierra Leone — The best defense against despair was to keep working. Many times, that choice was far from obvious: Josephine Finda Sellu lost 15 of her nurses to Ebola in rapid succession and thought about quitting herself.

She did not. Ms. Sellu, the deputy nurse matron, is a rare survivor who never stopped toiling at the government hospital here, Sierra Leone’s biggest death trap[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/dont-touch-the-walls-ebola-fears-infect-hospital.html] for the virus during the dark months of June and July. Hers is a select club, consisting of perhaps three women on the original Ebola nursing staff who did not become infected, who watched their colleagues die, and who are still carrying on.

“There is a need for me to be around,” said Ms. Sellu, 42, who oversees the Ebola nurses. “I am a senior. All the junior nurses look up to me.” If she left, she said, “the whole thing would collapse.”

The other nurses call her Mummy, and she resembles a field marshal in light brown medical scrubs, charging forward, exhorting nurses to return to duty, inspecting food for patients, doing a dance for once-infected co-workers who live — “nurse survivors,” she called them enthusiastically — and barking orders from the head-to-toe suit that protects her from her patients.

In the campaign against the Ebola virus, which is sweeping across parts of West Africa in an epidemic worse than all previous outbreaks[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1409903?query=featured_home] of the disease combined, the front line is stitched together by people like Ms. Sellu: doctors and nurses who give their lives to treat patients who will probably die; janitors who clean up lethal pools of vomit and waste so that beleaguered health centers can stay open; drivers who venture into villages overcome by illness to retrieve patients; body handlers charged with the dangerous task of keeping highly infectious corpses from sickening others.

Their sacrifices are evident from the statistics alone. At least 129 health workers have died fighting the disease, according to the World Health Organization. But while many workers have fled[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/world/africa/with-aid-doctors-gone-ebola-fight-grows-harder.html], leaving already shaky health systems in shambles, many new recruits have signed up willingly — often for little or no pay, and sometimes giving up their homes, communities and even families in the process.

“If I don’t volunteer, who can do this work?” asked Kandeh Kamara, one of about 20 young men doing one of the dirtiest jobs in the campaign: finding and burying corpses across eastern Sierra Leone.

When the outbreak started months ago, Mr. Kamara, 21, went to the health center in Kailahun and offered to help. When officials there said they could not pay him, he accepted anyway.

“There are no other people to do it, so we decided to do it just to help save our country,” he said of himself and the other young men. They call themselves “the burial boys.”

Doctors Without Borders trained them to wear protective equipment and to safely clear out dead bodies potentially infected with Ebola. They travel across backbreaking dirt roads for up to nine hours a day.

In doing their jobs, the burial boys have become pariahs. Many have been cast out of their communities because of fear that they will bring the virus home with them. Some families refuse to let them return.

After Mr. Kamara started working, his family said, he was no longer welcome in his village. His uncle, the family patriarch, told him never to come back. At first, he stayed with a friend, but the man’s wife was afraid and kicked him out, too. With no pay for months, he sometimes begged on the street after work to get enough money for food. Recently, he talked the owner of a small shop into clearing out enough space in a back room for him to sleep there.

He is finally getting paid, about $6 a day, and he hopes to find a room to rent, probably at an inflated price. Some of the other burial boys have tried to rent apartments but have been refused.

“After the Ebola virus, if I live long enough, I will go back to my people,” Mr. Kamara said. “I will tell them, ‘I did this job for you.’ Maybe they will understand me.”

At the government hospital a few hours away in Kenema, photographs of the dead nurses are still plastered on the crumbling walls. Notes to young women suddenly cut down, like Elizabeth Lengie Koroma — “Lengie We All Love U But God Loves U” — offer visual reminders of the pain that remains.

“Today three, tomorrow four — it was just like that, rapid,” Ms. Sellu recalled, her cheery demeanor quickly dropping. “We said, ‘What is happening?’ ”

She added, “You are asking, ‘Who is next?’ ” In all, some 22 workers at the hospital died.

The nurses and doctors here had banked on their experience treating Lassa fever, another deadly disease that causes bleeding. But Ebola is of a different order, and they had never seen it before.

With the first cases, the nurses simply used their Lassa goggles. Ebola demands a far more protective face shield. They also used “light gloves,” Ms. Sellu said. Now, she puts on two layers of heavy-duty rubber gloves. The inadequate initial precautions had fatal consequences, even for the revered young doctor who headed the Lassa unit, Dr. Sheik Umar Khan.

“Such a careful man, always saying, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that,’ ” Ms. Sellu said. “That is the mystery.” Dr. Khan died on July 29, a huge blow[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/africa/ebola.html] to the nation.

Ms. Sellu also spoke about the nurses she had lost to Ebola. Usually so keen on projecting strength to her subordinates, she began to cry.

“It has been a nightmare for me,” she said, her features contorting. “Since the whole thing started, I have cried a lot.” She added: “It came to a time when I was thinking of quitting this job. It was too much for me.”

But the lesson she drew appeared inevitable to her. “You have no options. You have to go and save others,” Ms. Sellu said. “You are seeing your colleagues dying, and you still go and work.”

At the height of the deaths last month, her two teenage children and her family in the capital, Freetown, urged her to stop. The remaining nurses at the hospital staged a revolt. One morning, 40 of them appeared outside the door of her home in Kenema, yelling, “If one of us dies again, prepare yourself to die!”

Frightened, her children warned her. “ ‘They have come for you! Mummy, don’t go there again!’ ” she recalled. “And my relations in Freetown were saying, ‘Don’t go there again!’ ”

Ms. Sellu disobeyed all of them. “I was sneaking in at the end of the day,” she said.

With precision, she recalled the day the nightmare at the hospital began: May 25. In neighboring Guinea, where the epidemic started, the crisis had appeared, falsely, to be abating. In Kenema, a patient was bleeding profusely.

“The nurses were curious; they called me,” she said. “Dr. Khan said, ‘Do the test.’ ” It was positive for Ebola.

“The whole hospital went haywire,” Ms. Sellu said. “All the nurses were put into quarantine.”

But it was the second case, in the hospital’s private annex for V.I.P.s, “that put the calamity on us,” she said. The patient was a local chief suffering from severe diarrhea and vomiting. He infected three nurses and a porter. The porter and one nurse died. The dying nurse was pregnant and miscarried, infecting all four nurses who aided in the delivery. All four died.

“There are times when I say, ‘Oh my God, I should have chosen secretarial,’ ” Ms. Sellu said. But her job as a healer, she said, “is the calling of God.”

The Kenema hospital is a different place now. In the last several weeks, with international help, a more rigorous system for screening, filtering and holding Ebola patients has been instituted. Confidence among the nurses has been restored.

Outside the hospital, they continue to face stigma. Some of Ms. Sellu’s staff spoke of husbands abandoning them and neighbors shunning them. One nurse told of returning home to find her belongings in suitcases on the sidewalk, and her spouse warning her to stay away. Another nurse, seeking lodgings, lied to the landlord, telling him she was a student.

“If you meet with them, they will balance this way and that not to touch you,” said Veronica Tucker, a nurse who survived an Ebola infection, doing a little jig to demonstrate her experience on the streets of Kenema.

The epidemic goes on. International aid workers say the official figures — an estimated 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_22_ebola/en/] in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone — are almost certainly much lower than the real number of infections and deaths.

Ms. Sellu finds some reason for optimism, though. She has seen the flood of Ebola patients diminish. And she and her nurses are no longer alone in the fight.

“Some went, but we stayed,” said a nurse, Nancy Yoko. “We have kept coming. We never left.”

Ms. Sellu then shooed away her visitors, put on her suit and prepared for work.

“By the grace of God, it will end,” she said.

Order vs. Disorder, Part 3

THE United States is swamped by refugee children from collapsing Central American countries; efforts to contain the major Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa are straining governments there; jihadists have carved out a bloodthirsty caliphate inside Iraq and Syria; after having already eaten Crimea, Russia keeps taking more bites out of Ukraine; and the U.N.’s refugee agency just announced that “the number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people worldwide has, for the first time in the post-World War II era, exceeded 50 million people.” If it feels as though the world of disorder is expanding against the world of order, it’s not your imagination. There’s an unfortunate logic to it.

Three big trends are converging. The first is what one of my teachers Dov Seidman calls the growing number of  “un-free” people in the world — the millions who “have secured a certain kind of freedom but yet feel un-free because they’re now aware that they don’t have the kind of freedom that matters most.”

Seidman, author of the book “How” and C.E.O. of LRN, which advises global businesses on governance, points out that while there’s been a lot of warranted focus on the destabilizing effects of income inequality, there is another equally destabilizing inequality emerging at the same time: “It is the inequality of freedom, and it is even more disordering.”

That may sound odd. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the toppling of dictators in the Arab awakening, how could more people be feeling “un-free”?

Seidman looks at the world through the framework of “freedom from” and “freedom to.” In recent years, he argues, “more people than ever have secured their ‘freedom from’ different autocrats in different countries.” Ukrainians, Tunisians, Egyptians, Iraqis, Libyans, Yemenis to name a few. “But so few are getting the freedom we truly cherish,” he adds. “And that is not just ‘freedom from.’ It is ‘freedom to.’ ”

“Freedom to” is the freedom to live your life, speak your mind, start your own political party, build your own business, vote for any candidate, pursue happiness, and be yourself, whatever your sexual, religious or political orientation.

“Protecting and enabling all of those freedoms,” says Seidman, “requires the kind of laws, rules, norms, mutual trust and institutions that can only be built upon shared values and by people who believe they are on a journey of progress and prosperity together.”

Such values-based legal systems and institutions are just what so many societies have failed to build after overthrowing their autocrats. That’s why the world today can be divided into three kinds of spaces: countries with what Seidman calls “sustainable order,” or order based on shared values, stable institutions and consensual politics; countries with imposed order — or order based on an iron-fisted, top-down leadership, or propped-up by oil money, or combinations of both, but no real shared values or institutions; and, finally, whole regions of disorder, such as Iraq, Syria, Central America and growing swaths of Central and North Africa, where there is neither an iron fist from above nor shared values from below to hold states together anymore.  

Imposed order, says Seidman, “depends on having power over people and formal authority to coerce allegiance and compel obedience,” but both are much harder to sustain today in an age of increasingly empowered, informed and connected citizens and employees who can easily connect and collaborate to cast off authority they deem illegitimate.

“Exerting formal power over people,” he adds, “is getting more and more elusive and expensive” — either in the number of people you have to kill or jail or the amount of money you have to spend to anesthetize your people into submission or indifference — “and ultimately it is not sustainable.” The only power that will be sustainable in a world where more people have “freedom from,” argues Seidman, “is power based on leading in a two-way conversation with people, power that is built on moral authority that inspires constructive citizenship and creates the context for ‘freedom to.’ ”

But because generating such sustainable leadership and institutions is hard and takes time, we have a lot more disorderly vacuums in the world today — where people have won “freedom from” without building “freedom to.”

The biggest challenge for the world of order today is collaborating to contain these vacuums and fill them with order. That is what President Obama is trying to do in Iraq, by demanding Iraqis build a sustainable inclusive government in tandem with any U.S. military action against the jihadists there. Otherwise, there will never be self-sustaining order there, and they will never be truly free.

But containing and shrinking the world of disorder is a huge task, precisely because it involves so much nation-building — beyond the capacity of any one country. Which leads to the second disturbing trend today: how weak or disjointed the whole world of order is. The European Union is mired in an economic/unemployment slump. China behaves like it’s on another planet, content to be a free-rider on the international system. And Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is playing out some paranoid czarist fantasy in Ukraine, while the jihadist world of disorder encroaches from the south.

Now add a third trend, and you can really get worried: America is the tent pole holding up the whole world of order. But our inability to agree on policies that would ensure our long-term economic vitality — an immigration bill that would ease the way for energetic and talented immigrants; a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would replace income and corporate taxes; and government borrowing at these low rates to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs, while gradually phasing in long-term fiscal rebalancing — is the definition of shortsighted.  

“If we can’t do the hard work of building alliances at home,” says David Rothkopf, author of the upcoming book “National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear,” “we are never going to have the strength or ability to build them around the world.”

 The Cold War involved two competing visions of order. That is, both sides were in the world of order, and all we in the West needed to do was collaborate enough to contain the East/Communism. Today is different. It is a world of order versus a world of disorder — and that disorder can only be contained by the world of order collaborating with itself and with the people in disorder to build their “freedom to.” But “building” is so much harder than “containing.” It takes so much more energy and resources. We’ve got to stop messing around at home as if this moment is just the same-old, same-old — and our real and tacit allies had better wake up, too. Preserving and expanding the world of sustainable order is the leadership challenge of our time.

A radical but promising proposal to help treat victims of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa appears to be gaining support among knowledgeable experts.

There are currently no approved drugs to treat infection with the Ebola virus, and only a handful of potential drug therapies in the very earliest stages of testing in humans or animals, with little likelihood that they could be produced on a large scale any time soon. The new proposal would fill the gap by using drugs that have already been approved to treat other diseases and repurposing them to treat Ebola as well.

This approach is well worth pursuing, given the crisis. Two broad categories of drugs are being mentioned. Existing drugs that seek to disable the viruses responsible for other diseases, for example, might conceivably disable the Ebola virus. And drugs that temper the body’s response to other diseases by reducing severe inflammation might also dampen the often fatal inflammatory response in Ebola patients.

An advantage to using existing drugs is that they have been tested for safety and are often available in large quantities and produced as cheaper generics. If they could be offered to infected people in Africa, it might encourage patients to go get treatment instead of hiding from the authorities, and it might bolster the confidence of health care workers who are fleeing from hospitals in droves.

There are also disadvantages. Just because a drug is effective against one disease does not mean it would work against Ebola. It is possible that some drugs might actually harm Ebola patients by making their infection worse or by causing severe side effects. One expert warns that the Ebola infection progresses rapidly within the body and that a drug that helps on Day 2 might become harmful by Day 7. That is why even approved drugs should be administered in clinical trials to determine whether they work against Ebola. Though it would not be easy to conduct such trials, several experts have said they think it could and should be done.

The idea of using approved drugs was proposed in an Op-Ed article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/opinion/can-statins-help-treat-ebola.html] in The Times on Aug. 16. Thirty respected clinical investigators and epidemiologists around the world are on record as supporting the article. Other experts have expressed reservations and have called for drug tests in nonhuman primates first. Even those who have backed the use of existing drugs because “desperate situations justify desperate measures” have stressed that there needs to be some evidence a drug might work.

Beyond this, the primary need right now is supportive care — like keeping patients hydrated, which allows many to recover even without a drug treatment. This requires that hospitals and clinics have isolation units for the patients and protective gear for doctors and nurses to prevent the spread of the virus. Once such facilities exist, it should be possible to compare one group of patients given standard supportive care with another group given supportive care plus a drug that might help them.

The World Health Organization is scheduled to hold a meeting in Geneva next week with more than 100 experts, including 20 from West Africa, to discuss potential therapies and vaccines for the Ebola virus and explore ways to expedite clinical trials and ramp up production of the most promising treatments. The meeting should be sure to consider the use of drugs that are already approved for other diseases and are readily available.

CORRECTION APPENDEDA Liberian doctor with Ebola who was given ZMapp -- the same experimental drug given to two infected Americans -- has died, officials said Monday.

Dr. Abraham Borbor, deputy chief medical doctor at Liberia's largest hospital, received one of the few existing doses of the drug, made by a San Diego company, The Associated Press said, quoting Liberia's information minister.

The two Americans who received ZMapp, both working for the charity Samaritan's Purse, survived after treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. When the two were released last week, their doctors said they did not know whether the drug -- a cocktail of mouse antibodies grown in tobacco plants -- had helped them, had no effect or perhaps even slowed their recoveries.

A Spanish priest who received one of the first six doses also died, but that was attributed in part to his age, 75.

Also on Monday, it was confirmed that another Ebola outbreak is underway in a remote village in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A Congolese government laboratory said it was of a different strain and not related to the West African outbreak, which is almost 3,000 miles away.

A lab designated by the World Health Organization will test samples from the outbreak, which is in Equateur Province.

The Congo outbreak is known to have killed 13 people. The country -- formerly Zaire -- has had six outbreaks since the disease was discovered there in 1976 in a village near the Ebola River.

Also on Monday, Nigeria reduced its Ebola case count to 13, from 14. One recent case was a false positive, the health minister said.

A British nurse who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone was flown home Sunday night by the Royal Air Force and hospitalized in London.

More than 240 health care workers have fallen ill in this outbreak, the health organization said Monday, and half of them have died. In previous outbreaks, the organization said, deaths among medical workers have decreased rapidly once it is known that patients have Ebola and personal protection measures are taken.

As of last Friday's W.H.O. update, 2,615 people in four countries had been infected and 1,427 had died.

The nurse, William Pooley, 29, had been in Sierra Leone since March giving palliative care to patients dying of cancer and AIDS when Ebola began spreading there. He volunteered to work in Kenema Hospital, where 22 local health workers have died. The hospital has been described as a ''death trap,'' and Mr. Pooley worked long shifts among highly infectious patients in the isolation ward.

The health organization also said that an epidemiologist affiliated with one of its partner organizations had contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the organization, said the victim was Senegalese and working with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, through which the W.H.O. and other agencies respond to health crises.

Japan said Monday that it was ready to provide a new influenza drug to fight Ebola. The drug, called favipiravir or Avigan, is made by the Toyama Chemical Company. It has not been shown to work against Ebola in humans. A health official said 40,000 doses were available.

Canada has offered an experimental vaccine made by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals. It has also not been shown to work in humans.

Correction: August 28, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a Liberian doctor with Ebola who died after being given ZMapp, an experimental drug, misstated the efficacy against Ebola of the drug called favipiravir or Avigan. It has been shown to be effective against mice; it is not the case that it has not worked against Ebola at all.

AIDS Progress in South Africa Is in Peril

VERENA, South Africa — A fading roadside ad for Selala Funeral Service here captures what was, until recently, the essence of South Africa’s AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic: “Tombstones Are Available,” it reads. “Buy One, Get One Free.”

Not long ago, even places like Verena, a blip on the roadside northeast of Pretoria, supported several funeral parlors.

But in the last few years, “we’ve managed a miracle,” said Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, one of the country’s leading AIDS researchers. “Undertaking is not a business you want to go into anymore.”

As recently as 2008, the AIDS epidemic in South Africa was out of control, hampered by the indifference of President Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela’s successor. Death was everywhere.

Now the country has won high praise from world AIDS experts for its response, especially at a time when the Ebola virus has spread in West Africa.

South Africa has 2.4 million people on antiretroviral drugs, far more than any other country, and adds 100,000 each month. Five years ago, 490 clinics gave out those drugs; now 3,540 do. Only 250 nurses were trained to prescribe them then; now 23,000 are. (The figures, from the end of 2013, are the most recent available.)

Mother-to-child transmissions have dropped by 90 percent, new infections have dropped by a third, and life expectancy has increased by almost 10 years.

“South Africa takes this very seriously and has made major, major progress,” said Michel Sidibé,[http://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/unaidsexecutivedirectormichelsidibe/] the executive director of Unaids, the United Nations agency fighting the disease.

But experts say much of that progress is now in jeopardy.

Though few Americans or even South Africans realize it, the nation owes much of its success to a single United States program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief[http://www.pepfar.gov/], or Pepfar, started in 2003 under President George W. Bush. It has poured more than $3 billion into South Africa, largely for training doctors, building clinics and laboratories, and buying drugs.

Now that aid pipeline is drying up as the program shifts its limited budget to poorer countries, so the South African government must find hundreds of millions of dollars, even as its national caseload grows rapidly.

The country has six million infected and 370,000 new infections a year. That is seven times as many new infections as in the United States, which has six times the population. Condom[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/condoms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] use is dropping, according to a new survey[http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-01-sa-holds-highest-number-of-new-hiv-infections-worldwide-survey], and teenage girls are becoming infected at alarming rates.

Still, Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, the national health minister, says he is confident South Africa will find the money and the political will to fight on.

“It’s a logistical problem,” he said. “Any country in the world would be shaken by putting 2.4 million people on treatment quickly. But it’s not as if we have any choice. If we don’t, they fill up the hospital beds and I.C.U.’s. It’s becoming easier for Treasury to give me what I ask.”

Clandestine Philanthropy

Dr. Ian Sanne’s “Right to Care”[http://www.righttocare.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1] chain of clinics, which treats 203,000 patients in five provinces, is an example of the fruits of American largess.

In a country where public hospitals use hand-scribbled paper records and are infamous for long waits, Right to Care’s Johannesburg headquarters has an electronic medical records system so fast that a nurse can read a tuberculosis test result delivered by a $17,000 GeneXpert machine and click a box that types a prescription directly into the patient’s record. Within 17 seconds, a German-made robotic arm in the clinic’s pharmacy can pluck that drug from the shelf, print a label, and drop it down a chute to be handed to the patient.

“We opened in 2004, with 100 percent Pepfar money,” Dr. Sanne said.

Right to Care, like many other AIDS treatment programs here, owes its existence to a decision that year by Pepfar to help South Africa quietly, almost clandestinely, while the Mbeki administration was still in power.

In poor countries with broken health care systems, Pepfar paid American medical schools[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medical_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to run its programs. South Africa, by contrast, had excellent doctors and hospitals, but Mr. Mbeki’s health minister, who claimed garlic, beetroot and lemons could cure AIDS[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/world/africa/17manto.html], forbade public hospitals to give out AIDS drugs.

Mr. Mbeki was finally ousted in an internal African National Congress power struggle in 2008; by that time, Harvard researchers calculated[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html], his policies had cost 365,000 lives[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html?pagewanted=all&action=click&module=Search®ion=searchResults&].

In the interim, Pepfar had supported private practitioners like Dr. Sanne, Dr. Hugo Tempelman of the Ndlovu Care Group[http://www.ndlovucaregroup.co.za/index.html] and Dr. Helen Rees of the Wits Reproductive Health Institute[http://www.wrhi.ac.za/Pages/default.aspx] in Johannesburg.

“It was a gracious, unpretentious and right thing to do,” said Justice Edwin Cameron, a judge on the country’s highest court who began taking AIDS drugs back when they cost him a third of his salary. “You empowered us and let us get on with it.”

Because South Africans are sensitive about needing any foreign help, the aid is still given with little fanfare. Many clinics have only one sign of their roots: a modest brass plaque with Pepfar’s globe-and-red-ribbon logo.

“I’ve had visiting congressional delegations upset that America gets no recognition for saving lives while China gets visibility for building an airport in Mozambique,” Dr. Rees said.

The country received $350 million from Pepfar last year, according to Dr. Eric Goosby, who ran the program until last November. That figure will shrink to $250 million by 2016.

“We need to move on to places like Burundi and Cameroon,” Dr. Goosby said.

While very poor countries rely almost entirely on donors, South Africa now pays 83 percent of its own costs. But it struggles to do so. Patients overwhelm understaffed public clinics. And as evidence mounts that it is best to put patients on drugs as soon as they test positive rather than waiting until their immune systems falter, the national caseload will triple.

Dr. Sanne complained bitterly about cutbacks, Dr. Goosby said, and got “bridge money” to prevent layoffs from his well-trained staff.

“Our stay of execution,” Dr. Sanne said, laughing.

‘Corruption and Pilferage’

Closing private clinics can have dangerous consequences. When one Durban hospital abruptly went bankrupt after its Pepfar grant expired, its 4,000 H.I.V. patients were told to report to public clinics near their homes — places that many H.I.V. patients avoid for fear of being spotted and shunned by their neighbors.

A Harvard-sponsored survey[http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/early/2014/07/14/ofid.ofu058.short] found that nearly 20 percent of those 4,000 patients did not renew their prescriptions at their local clinics.

In theory, because Pepfar pays for the care of about a million South African patients, a similar dropout rate nationally would mean that 200,000 patients were not in care and were at risk of developing drug-resistant strains, said Matthew M. Kavanagh, the author of a study[http://healthgap.org/blog/2014/1/15/jaids-journal-the-politics-epidemiology-of-transition-pepfar-and-aids-in-south-africa] of South Africa for Health GAP[http://healthgap.org/], an American medical advocacy group.

Dr. Motsoaledi, South Africa’s health minister since 2009, has won high praise from AIDS experts and even from advocacy groups that are often at odds with him.

Asked if there was any chance that the United States, having received little credit for helping from 2004 on, would now be vilified for pulling out, he said: “No, I personally will never allow that. Because this would never have happened without America.”

How well the country can do on its own remains to be seen. It has world-class doctors; the first heart transplant[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/surgery/heart-transplant/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] was done in Cape Town in 1967. But public hospitals and the drug supply chain are overseen by local governments, where corruption and incompetence are common.

The country was recently scandalized by the death of “Baby Ikho,”[http://www.health-e.org.za/2013/09/11/one-baby-national-campaign/] a chubby 1-year-old who was hospitalized with simple pneumonia[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pneumonia/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but died slowly because the hospital administrator ordered oxygen only after it ran out.

The doctor who reported the death, blaming the administrator, was fired for doing so.

Last year, Section 27[http://www.section27.org.za/], a health advocacy group, surveyed the country’s pharmacies and found that 20 percent had sometimes run out of drugs for AIDS or tuberculosis.

Mark Heywood, Section 27’s executive director, said the problem was theft from government warehouses by local officials. Some of those officials stayed in office even while facing criminal charges because they supported President Jacob Zuma’s wing of the deeply factionalized A.N.C., he said.

Dr. Motsoaledi agreed that those warehouses were sites of “corruption and pilferage” and said that he was making hospitals order directly from manufacturers or from one national warehouse. Corrupt officials would not be protected by connections, even to the president, he said.

“My hands are not tied by any faction,” he said. “We will destroy them.”

His greater worry, he said, was that forces outside the country would push up the prices of newer AIDS drugs by preventing the import of generic versions. Some South Africans still receive older drugs no longer prescribed in wealthier countries.

In January, Doctors Without Bordersreleased documents[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/south-africa-stand-strong-against-aggressive-pharma-campaign] it obtained outlining a secret campaign[http://cdn.mg.co.za/content/documents/2014/01/16/skmbt36314011511040.pdf] planned by a Washington lobbying firm hired by the pharmaceutical industry. It proposed forming a fake grass-roots organization called “Forward South Africa” advocating stronger patent laws against generics.

Dr. Motsoaledi publicly denounced[http://mg.co.za/article/2014-01-16-motsoaledi-big-pharmas-satanic-plot-is-genocide] the plan as “satanic” and “genocidal,” and the pharmaceutical lobby dropped it[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-31/drug-patent-threat-opens-division-on-how-to-fight-back.html] after some of its members quit in protest.

Dr. Motsoaledi said he was confident that he would eventually be able to pry enough money out of government to treat everyone.

“If we don’t,” he said, “we make TB[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pulmonary-tuberculosis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] worse, cervical cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cervical-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] goes up, even leprosy[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/leprosy/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] returns. From whatever angle you look at, it’s cheaper to treat people early. The treasury minister understands that. It’s becoming easy for him to agree.”

As if you didn’t already think Doctors Without Borders had its hands full with the Ebola crisis[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/africa/ebola-is-disaster-of-scale-still-unknown-relief-official-says.html?ref=africa] unfolding in West Africa, the organization recently released a series of videos and photographs covering the group’s work in and around Syria. The series, “The Reach of War: A Day in the Life of the Syrian Conflict[http://reachofwar.msf.org/],” offers a glimpse into the activities that the organization conducts on a daily basis to aid refugees and the war-wounded in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan.

The managing editor of Doctors Without Borders, Phil Zabriskie, explains[http://lightbox.time.com/2014/08/13/syria-refugee-doctors-without-borders/#1] in an interview with Time that the idea is to “at least suggest the scope of the medical needs that exist because of this war.”

The series begins with footage of a clinic in Ramtha, Jordan, a small town just over the border from Daraa, Syria, that consists of little more than a hospital and a bank. Dr. Haydar Alwash, a refugee from the first gulf war in Iraq, presides over a chaotic clinic where the newly injured arrive in ambulances.

The video opens with the news that three children, all with severe bleeding, will be arriving shortly. After emergency surgeries, Dr. Alwash consults with Rukaya[http://img.qz.com/2014/08/msf-rukaya-wheelchair.jpg], a 14-year-old girl who has just lost her mother and her legs. She will need two more surgeries, he tells her, following the seven she has already undergone, to prepare her legs for prosthetics.

Rukaya speaks quietly to Dr. Alwash from behind a shy smile. As she is wheeled into surgery, we hear her through a voice-over: “I am accepting the situation. And I pray to God that I will be happy in my life.”

From Ramtha, the series travels to refugee camps in Iraq and Lebanon — where families live in clusters of cloth tents, vulnerable to snow, wind and mud and without blood pressure and diabetics medications — before finally settling in an established clinic in Amman, Jordan.

It has been open since 2006, when it was created to treat injuries for Iraqi refugees, and now plastic surgeons, physical therapists and psychotherapists treat patients for the long term. Dr. Ashraf Bustanji, a maxillofacial surgeon, explains that here they receive the “cold cases,” “the residual deformities.”

Many of the cases were treated in a home country but, because of unreliable access to medical equipment or emergency treatment that wasn’t successful, surgery needs to correct or reinforce what’s already been done. In one scene, Dr. Bustanji attends to a 19-year-old boy whose badly broken jaw[http://img.qz.com/2014/08/msf-ashraf-bustanji.jpg] was compounded by “shoddy care” that caused “residual deformities and other complications.”

In the afternoon, physiotherapy and rehabilitation are conducted. We see a boy, his arm in a cast, working with a doctor at a board affixed with household hardware: doorknobs, spigots, latches, a light switch. The boy practices turning a bolt loosely fitted to a screw. “Mumtaz,” the doctor murmurs. “Perfect.”

Misinformation about politics may often seem silly — the immigration bill will give out free cars! [http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jun/26/blog-posting/does-immigration-bill-include-free-obamacars-teens/] — but the consequences of false beliefs in public health can be deadly.

In the developed world, myths about the risks of vaccines have enabled the resurgence of communicable diseases like measles [http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-surge-u-s-fueled-unvaccinated-travelers-n88196] and pertussis [http://www.boston.com/health/2014/07/15/what-you-need-know-about-whooping-cough/PRYCT5w6EDB48tZFlTcDEM/story.html]. And in developing countries, false beliefs have hindered efforts to fight H.I.V./AIDS [http://healthland.time.com/2012/08/21/legitimate-rape-todd-akin-and-other-politicians-who-confuse-science/slide/questioning-the-origin-of-aids/] and eradicate polio in countries like Nigeria [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-08/p-aci072914.php] and Pakistan [http://www.unicef.org.proxy.bc.edu/immunization/pakistan_62246.html].

The latest example of the dangers of health misinformation comes from Western Africa, where the response to an Ebola outbreak [http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/index.html] in four countries [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] has been hampered [http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/20/world/africa/ebola-myths/] by conspiracy theories about its causes and phony rumors about how to treat it. False beliefs may not be the biggest obstacle to containing the Ebola outbreak, but they make an awful situation worse.

People in the affected regions have become especially distrustful of doctors [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html], with some suggesting the disease is a hoax. A resident of a heavily affected area in Liberia told [http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/a-tale-of-two-africas-1408749489] The Wall Street Journal last week: “I’ve never seen anybody die of Ebola. I’ve only heard of it. So it’s a rumor.” These beliefs are often based on conspiracy theories that the disease was invented by national governments in search of international aid [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html?_r=0] or political power [http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/health/archive/2014/08/the-danger-in-losing-sight-of-ebola-victims-humanity/378945/?single_page=true].

When a crowd, angered at a sudden quarantine [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html] and the transfer of patients, overran a clinic [http://news.yahoo.com/ebola-patients-flee-attack-liberia-isolation-ward-002954011.html]in Monrovia, Liberia, on Aug. 16, the idea that Ebola was a hoax played a role. The intruders, some of whom yelled, “There’s no Ebola,” not only came into contact with infected patients (many of whom fled) but also looted the facility of equipment. The gear may have included contaminated materials [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28827091] that further spread the contagion [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/ebola-fears-rise-liberia-clinic-looted-bloody-sheets-stolen-article-1.1906418#ixzz3AkDBGQbU].

The effects of Ebola myths apparently extend far beyond Monrovia. With so many people dying after leaving home to receive treatment, some residents have come to equate the effects of the disease with efforts to respond to it. Raphael Frankfurter, an aid worker in eastern Sierra Leone, described [http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/health/archive/2014/08/the-danger-in-losing-sight-of-ebola-victims-humanity/378945/?single_page=true] hearing one woman saying about the hospital in Kenema: “Ebola is a lie! They’re sending people to Kenema to die!”

This kind of misinformation, along with fear of contagion, has led to some health workers’ coming under attack, [http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/03/health/ebola-outbreak-west-africa/]being blocked [http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-sierra-leone-religious-leaders-critcize-government-handling-of-ebola/1962115.html] from entering affected areas or being spurned by their own communities [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/world/africa/sierra-leone-if-they-survive-in-ebola-ward-they-work-on.html]. Workers have also encountered conspiracy theories that Ebola was brought to the region [http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/18/health/ap-eu-med-ebola-caregivers.html?ref=aponline] by Westerners.

In addition, false claims are circulating about how to treat the disease. The World Health Organizationissued [http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/15-august-2014/en/] a statement warning people against unproven treatments or supposed preventive measures, such as drinking salt water [https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/166257-ebola-sparks-panic-across-nigeria-as-citizens-scramble-for-salt-water-bath-remedy.html#sthash.Ge0bomNI.2S9BRP4H.dpbs], which has reportedly killed [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2014/0819/In-Nigeria-Ebola-threat-tests-the-rhythms-of-daily-life-video] several people in Nigeria.

As we’ve seen in the case of vaccines [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/upshot/vaccine-opponents-can-be-immune-to-education.html], circulating correct information about the causes and treatment of Ebola — as the W.H.O. and national governments are trying to do — has not been enough to erase these myths, particularly given the pace and scope of the outbreak and the lack of health facilities and workers in the region. A better approach (though harder to do quickly enough) is to work with trusted community leaders, as Dr. Marc Forget of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) correctly emphasized [http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/20/world/africa/ebola-myths/].

“We need to go to the thousands of small villages and repeat the message,” he said in an interview with CNN. “It has to be one-by-one contact that needs to be done through the chiefs, the local authorities, the youth. It is time-consuming and very difficult.” Such an approach has been used, for instance, in the fight against polio in Nigeria, where Muslim imams have been enlisted [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-08/p-aci072914.php] as advocates to help overcome local opposition.

In seeking to understand and address misconceptions about Ebola, it’s especially important to avoid the victim-blaming impulse, which may be exacerbated by negative Western stereotypes about African culture, as Mr. Frankfurter notes. Anyone facing such a terrifying outbreak would be panicked, distrustful of outsiders bearing a potential death sentence, and eager for any shred of hope.

In particular, research suggests that conspiracy theories can be psychologically reassuring in situations like this — seeing conspiracies in randomness [http://www.rifters.com/real/articles/Science_LackingControlIncreasesIllusoryPatternPerception.pdf] or attributing negative events to enemies [http://people.ku.edu/%7Emjlandau/docs/Sullivan_enemyship_JPSP%202010.pdf] can restore feelings of control when people encounter unpredictable threats. Until we can help people feel as if the situation is coming under control, we shouldn’t be surprised if they try to regain psychological equilibrium however they can.

Liberian Leader Reported to Fire Officials for Defying Ebola Order

LONDON — President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia was reported on Tuesday to have dismissed government ministers and senior officials who refused to return home as West Africa confronts the worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus.

The impact of the order, reported by The Associated Press, was not immediately clear and a statement from the president’s office did not say how many people had defied her order to return home as part of emergency measures to combat the outbreak.

The World Health Organization says that more than 1,400 patients, of at least 2,600 known cases, have died since the outbreak was identified in March.

The response by governments in the main affected countries — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea — and by international organizations has been widely labeled as slow.

“We have never seen an Ebola epidemic on this scale,” Dr. Peter Piot, a Belgian who helped discover the disease almost 40 years ago, told the French newspaper Libération.

“In the last six months we have been witnessing what can be described as a perfect storm — everything is there for it to snowball,” he said.

A smaller Ebola outbreak has also been reported in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, and a laboratory in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country known as Zaire when the virus was discovered in 1976 in a village near the Ebola River, has reported an outbreak of what it calls a different strain of the virus.

There is no licensed cure for the disease, but the World Health Organization has endorsed the use of scarce experimental drugs to try to combat it in a handful of cases. Two Americans who received the drug ZMapp survived[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/two-us-ebola-patients-are-released-by-atlanta-hospital.html], but a Liberian doctor[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/world/africa/liberian-doctor-treated-with-an-experimental-drug-dies-from-ebola.html] and a Spanish priest died despite being given it.

Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the manufacturers of that drug,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/business/an-obscure-biotech-firm-hurries-ebola-treatment.html] says its stock is now exhausted.

In Britain, a special unit at a hospital in northwest London has been activated to treat William Pooley, a 29-year-old British nurse who contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone and who was flown home on Sunday by the Royal Air Force.

According to British news reports on Tuesday, Mr. Pooley has told friends he expects to recover without the experimental medication and to return to West Africa to continue caring for Ebola patients.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, said at a meeting in Liberia also attended by President Johnson Sirleaf on Monday that “lots of hard work is happening, lots of good things are happening,” The A.P. reported. “But the virus still has the upper hand.”

Sierra Leone: Ebola Teams Moved After Worker Is Infected

The World Health Organization announced Tuesday that it had removed its Ebola response teams from a region of Sierra Leone that has been hardest hit by the outbreak after a Senegalese epidemiologist there contracted the virus.

The pullback comes just a day after the organization announced a ''reinvigorated commitment'' and an increase in its work to combat Ebola in Sierra Leone, one of three West African nations at the center of the outbreak.

The organization was overseeing two teams in Kailahun, near the Guinean border, said Christy Feig, its director of communications. Those pulled back included three Public Health Agency of Canada workers running a mobile laboratory that tested for the virus, and three employees of the World Health Organization who coordinated the tracing of victims' contacts, among other tasks, Ms. Feig said. The aid group Doctors Without Borders operates an 80-bed treatment center in Kailahun, which will continue operating, according to Michael Goldfarb, a media relations manager for the group.

As of Monday, there had been 440 confirmed Ebola cases in Kailahun, nearly half of the total throughout Sierra Leone, where there have been 341 deaths, according to the country's Ministry of Health and Sanitation. On Monday, it documented 31 new cases, including 12 in Kailahun.

The health organization is investigating how the epidemiologist, who was deployed through its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, became infected. Ms. Feig said the organization was working on evacuating him from the country and had a new team in Freetown, the capital, ready to deploy to Kailahun after addressing whatever issues might have led to his infection.

''This was the responsible thing to do,'' Dr. Daniel Kertesz, the organization's representative in Sierra Leone, said in a news release. ''The field team has been through a traumatic time through this incident. They are exhausted from many weeks of heroic work, helping patients infected with Ebola. When you add a stressor like this, the risk of accidents increases.''

Ms. Feig said the work of the laboratory team would be taken over by a second laboratory, in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

Doctors Without Borders' Ebola health workers wear more restrictive equipment than the standard protective gear used by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors Without Borders says it has never documented an infection of a staff member through many years of responding to Ebola outbreaks.

In hot environments, though, some workers said they could not spend as long in the Doctors Without Borders gear. Ms. Feig said it was unlikely that the World Health Organization's protective equipment, worn properly, would have played a role in the worker's infection, given that large numbers of staff have worked safely in it. The Senegalese man infected was also not serving as a clinician and was, according to the health organization, its first affiliated worker to contract the virus. The organization has not released any other information about the man.

Last week, the United Nations announced an emergency appeal for more than $18 million to fight Ebola for the next six months in Sierra Leone, including the deployment of more health organization workers to support logistics, improve public awareness and coordinate the overall effort to control the outbreak.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Thursday:

• Rebels are advancing in Ukraine.

The Russian-backed forces have taken[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28963310] a key town in the southeast and are headed to a port city.

Russia has also sent its own armored troops across the border, expanding the conflict[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-novoazovsk-crimea.html]. A rebel leader admitted today[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28963310] that thousands of Russian citizens were fighting in his ranks.

• A fresh search for Flight 370.

Malaysia and Australia signed an agreement[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/27/world/asia/ap-as-malaysia-plane.html] today to share costs in the next phase of the investigation of the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner.

The focus will be on the southern part of the search area in the Indian Ocean.

• U.S. banks were hacked.

The F.B.I. is investigating[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/technology/hackers-target-banks-including-jpmorgan.html] whether Russian hackers launched an attack this month in possible retaliation against U.S. sanctions over Russia’s Ukrainian activities.

• Growing anxiety about Ebola.

Health ministers from across West Africa are meeting in Ghana’s capital today to discuss the crisis.

The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week[http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=343436300] from Liberia that there were many more cases that have been reported.

• A new, but familiar, president.

The prime minister of Turkey, who has been in office for more than a decade, switches roles today when he is inaugurated as president.

Some critics, though, fear Recep Tayyip Erdogan will begin an increasingly authoritarian rule[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/europe/premier-tries-to-keep-power-as-president.html].

• Buckets of cash.

The Ice Bucket Challenge, the viral fund-raising campaign for A.L.S., also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is likely to surpass[http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082714.html] $100 million today.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stock futures are slightly lower. European and Asian markets are also down.

NOTEWORTHY

• Hitting the road.

Almost 35 million people — the most since 2008 — will travel 50 miles or more this Labor Day weekend[http://newsroom.aaa.com/2014/08/nearly-35-million-traveling-labor-day-says-aaa-highest-since-recession-driven-decline/], which unofficially starts today, according to AAA, the auto club.

Almost 86 percent will go by car. They will be enjoying the lowest gas prices around the holiday since 2010, with the current national average near $3.44 a gallon.

• You be the judge.

For the third time, Amazon is releasing a batch of television pilots[http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/web-to-watch/entertainment/2014/08/26/web-to-watch-amazon-to-debut-5-new-pilots/14650869/], with the response from viewers helping to decide whether a show makes the cut.

The shows, available beginning today on Amazon Instant Video, include the half-hour comedies “The Cosmopolitans,” “Really” and “Red Oaks,” and the hourlong dramas “Hand of God” and “Hysteria.”

• Maybe it was the heat.

Milder temperatures will greet the fourth day of the U.S. Open[http://2014.usopen.org/index.html] in New York, where there were a few upsets[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/sports/tennis/us-open-agnieszka-radwanska-sloane-stephens-maria-sharapova.html] on a 90-degree Wednesday.

The biggest was the No. 4 seed Agnieszka Radwanska losing to an unseeded player in a second-round match.

• Look who’s on top.

The rapper Wiz Khalifa has his first No. 1 album[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/nobody-beats-wiz-khalifas-album-shake-it-off-soars/], and Taylor Swift’s new single, “Shake It Off[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/business/media/taylor-swift-maximizes-use-of-social-media-in-release-of-new-album.html],” shot to the top.

• Reunion.

Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are back together on Broadway today in previews for “It’s Only a Play.”

The pair starred in the box-office-record run of “The Producers,” starting in 2001, and then in a 2005 film version. They last appeared together on Broadway in 2005 in a seven-month run of “The Odd Couple.”

BACK STORY

For well over a decade, cable networks have taken advantage of the lull in summer broadcast programming, using it to premiere their original series.

“Breaking Bad,” for instance, started in the summer months in its popular final seasons.

Lately, the broadcast networks have followed suit[http://adage.com/article/media/summer-tv-hits-misses/294330/], with some of their most-hyped shows debuting in summer.

Last year, “Under the Dome,” the sci-fi drama based on a Stephen King novel, was CBS’s highest-rated summer premiere in a decade.

It paved the way for CBS to debut “Extant,” the heavily publicized series starring Halle Berry and including Steven Spielberg as an executive producer. It opened this summer to mediocre ratings.

And when Fox decided to revive its “24” franchise for a limited run, it didn’t pick a spot in the fall or just after the Super Bowl. “Live Another Day” ran from May to July.

Joseph Burgess and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.

Ebola Could Eventually Afflict Over 20,000, W.H.O. Says

GENEVA — As the tally of deaths from the worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus continued its seemingly inexorable rise, the World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic was still accelerating and could afflict more than 20,000 people — almost seven times the current number of reported cases — before it could be brought under control.

The dire forecast was made as the W.H.O. reported that the number of known cases and fatalities had risen once again. The organization also acknowledged that in areas of intense transmission “the actual number of cases may be two-to-four times higher than that currently reported.”

The outbreak “continues to accelerate,” the organization said.

According to the latest figures released by the W.H.O. on Thursday, the death toll has risen by more than 100, to 1,552 out of 3,069 cases in four West African countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, which had previously indicated that its outbreak was under control.

While the disease was first identified in March, “more than 40 percent of the total number of cases have occurred within the past 21 days,” the W.H.O. said. “However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities.”

The assessment came as the W.H.O. presented a road map for affected countries and for the international community that included strategies designed to deal with more than 20,000 cases, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the health organization, told reporters in Geneva. The plans are likely to cost nearly half a billion dollars over the next six months.

The road map aims to stop transmission of the virus in the next eight to nine months, Mr. Aylward said, but he added: “We have to be realistic that there is uncertainty” about such targets.

With many centers for treating the disease now too full to take new patients, classic treatment strategies could no longer cope, and it was necessary to find and expand other complementary approaches to contain the spread of the disease, the organization said.

The road map assumes that a number of countries that are not now affected by the epidemic could become so, but also asserts that the procedures it sets out could stop any new transmissions within eight weeks of the first case being identified. “That’s extremely aggressive,” Mr. Aylward said, acknowledging that such speedy containment had only ever been achieved in remote locations, not in the crowded urban centers now affected.

The road map came as Tom Frieden, director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that the epidemic could get worse before it gets better. Mr. Frieden called for quicker international help and cooperation to control its spread.

In a sign of the difficulties facing governments seeking to contain the disease, the health authorities in Nigeria reported for the first time on Thursday that the disease had spread beyond Lagos, its commercial capital, to claim another death.

Nigeria does not share a land border with the other three countries in the grip of the outbreak.

The first sign of the virus’s spread to Nigeria came when Patrick Sawyer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/africa/ebola-in-nigeria.html], a Liberian-American traveling from Liberia, flew to Lagos and died of the disease in the teeming city last month. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation but has recorded only 15 patients infected with Ebola, six of whom have now died.

The Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters on Thursday that a man who had come into contact with Mr. Sawyer had evaded surveillance and traveled to Port Harcourt, the hub of Nigeria’s lucrative oil industry in the south of the country, where he infected a doctor who later died.

The man, who was not identified by name, recovered from the disease. The wife of the dead doctor also has Ebola symptoms, Mr. Chukwu said, according to The Associated Press. Additionally, 70 people in Port Harcourt, including funeral directors who embalmed the dead doctor, are now under surveillance.

In its statement on Thursday, the W.H.O. said the countries hit hardest by the epidemic — Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone — were “struggling to control the escalating outbreak against a backdrop of severely compromised health systems, significant deficits in capacity, and rampant fear.”

Mr. Aylward, picking out details of the road map, said it would need at least 750 international and 12,000 local health workers, not in capital cities but “right out there in the districts running the operations.”

“That is very difficult in the current environment,” he added, alluding to fears arising from the high number of medical workers — 250 as of Monday — who had contracted the disease. Recruiting international staff may be harder than finding local personnel, he added, debunking the notion that locals were running away from the crisis.

Health workers were getting infected because they were exhausted from working extraordinary hours, Mr. Aylward said. “The best way to get this program safer is to get a lot more people into these countries,” he said.

The road map emphasized the need to halt transmission of the disease in major cities and ports, and underscored the importance of keeping air and shipping links operating to deliver medical supplies, personal protection equipment, food and other goods to fight the outbreak.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are facing severe economic downturns as they struggle to cope with the Ebola outbreak, the African Development Bank reported on Thursday, a problem that is likely to be exacerbated by the growing number of airlines cutting services to those countries. On Wednesday, British Airways said it was suspending flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone because of Ebola concerns. Air France followed suit on Thursday.

The W.H.O. was already arranging short-term air support with the World Food Program to offset flight cancellations by commercial airlines, Mr. Aylward said, but the cost of the response would rise sharply if this had to become a long-term arrangement.

“Bans on travel and trade will not stop this virus, absolutely not, in fact you are more likely to compromise the ability to respond,” Mr. Aylward said. “It’s a self-defeating strategy.”

Ebola Outbreak in Sierra Leone Is Tied to One Funeral

Sierra Leone’s explosion of Ebola cases in early summer all appears to stem from one traditional healer’s funeral at which 14 women were infected, according to scientists studying the blood of victims.

The funeral, which took place in mid-May, constitutes a “super-spreader” event comparable to a 2003 one in a Hong Kong hotel[http://www.medscape.com.proxy.bc.edu/viewarticle/807935_4] in which one doctor from China dying of SARS infected nine other guests who spread the virus throughout the city and to Vietnam and Canada.

The funeral was in Koindu, a diamond-mining town just across the border from Guéckédou in Guinea, where the outbreak is thought to have begun in December, and the healer was known for treating victims of a mysterious illness that turned out to be Ebola.

The funeral’s central role — which local doctors had anecdotally suspected — was confirmed by geneticists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard who sequenced the virus found in 78 patients treated at Kenema Government Hospital in northeastern Sierra Leone, near the borders with Liberia and Guinea, two countries that are also at the heart of the outbreak.

Their study[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1259657] was published online Thursday by the journal Science.

“It’s frightening that a single event could catalyze a whole outbreak, but that’s what it looks like happened,” said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a renowned virus hunter at Columbia University, who called the study “a really nice piece of work.”

The scientists not only found that all 78 had virus traceable to funeral guests, but showed that the West African Ebola strain was quite different from the strain circulating thousands of miles away in central Africa, and that the two probably diverged as far back as 2004.

“No one knows where it’s been during that time,” said Dr. Pardis C. Sabeti, a Harvard geneticist and study co-author.

It might, she added, have circulated in some combination of bats, apes or other forest animals, “or it could have been circulating in humans for ten years with little or no notice.”

That information is important, experts said, because all the diagnostic tests now in use, as well as experimental drugs and vaccines under consideration, are based on the central African strain and might not work well on this new outbreak. For example, a diagnostic test in use now might not give a clear positive if a victim had a low viral load early in an infection.

The study also found that the 78 victims had two variants of the West African strain. The healer may have been infected with two variants from two patients, said Stephen K. Gire, another co-author from Dr. Sabeti’s lab. Or someone else at the funeral could have been infectious.

The work had a sobering footnote: Before it could be published, five of its co-authors had died of Ebola. They included Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone’s leading hemorrhagic fever expert, and four other staff members at the Kenema hospital[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/dont-touch-the-walls-ebola-fears-infect-hospital.html]. By midsummer, so many hospital staff and patients had died that it was considered a death trap and partly vacated.

Since that note was written, Dr. Sabeti said, a sixth co-author, also at the hospital, died of a stroke.

“They’re such amazing heroes, dealing with an unfathomable situation,” she said. “When we heard Khan had Ebola, I was all ‘We’ve got to do this, we’ve got to do that.’ And then my face kind of melted, and I began bawling. And I turned to the room, and everyone began bawling.”

Dozens of people attended the healer’s funeral, said Robert F. Garry Jr., a Tulane University hemorrhagic fever expert whose teams searched for attendees and persuaded 40 of them to give samples.

Fourteen — all women — were infected, Dr. Sabeti said, although the DNA in two samples was too degraded to sequence.

It’s not known why only they became infected. Women normally wash the bodies, “but at a traditional burial, presumably everyone had some interaction with the body,” Dr. Garry said.

(Several scientists, including Dr. Sabeti, complained that many Westerners describe African funeral rites as bizarre, when it is actually routine around the world to wash and dress corpses — though in wealthy countries, undertakers are paid to do it. In many countries, including the United States, it is not uncommon for mourners to touch or kiss a loved one in an open coffin.)

Dr. Garry’s team began collecting blood after one woman who had attended came to the Kenema hospital with a high fever that had begun May 25; the exact date of the funeral was vague, but the typical incubation period is eight to 10 days.

The Kenema hospital was ready to ship samples because it collaborates with foreign laboratories to study Lassa fever. Lassa is unrelated to Ebola but can also cause fatal bleeding. If Ebola circulated for years, some deaths could have been misdiagnosed as Lassa or typhoid or malaria, which all have similar early symptoms. Many Ebola victims die without developing the external bleeding that created its fearsome reputation.

Because the hospital is still overwhelmed and now overseen by the World Health Organization, Dr. Sabeti said, she has received no samples since June.

To help researchers working on drugs or vaccines, she has been posting sequences as soon as she has them, rather than waiting until academic journals publish her papers.

“It doesn’t take a village to fight this,” she said. “It takes a planet.”

In Liberia’s Capital, an Ebola Outbreak Like No Other

MONROVIA, Liberia — Some people are swimming in and out of the Ebola quarantine zone in this seaside capital. One man slips out every day to reach his job at a Western embassy. Another has turned his living room into a tollbooth, charging others to escape through his apartment at the edge of the cordoned area. Countless others have used a different method: bribing their way out with fees that soldiers determine according to a person’s appearance, circumstances and even gender.

Christian Verre, a 26-year-old clothing salesman, sneaked out through an abandoned building with his girlfriend, Alice Washington, 21, and eight friends. “Go back! Go back!” soldiers and police officers yelled, he recalled, but the conversation quickly took on a different turn: “What do you got?”

Those carrying goods handed over more than $8, Mr. Verre said. Traveling light, he was charged $4.25 for his girlfriend and about $6 for himself, “because I’m a man.” The couple now share a shack a few blocks outside West Point, the vast, sprawling slum that was placed under an Ebola quarantine last week.

“I didn’t want to stay in West Point for 21 days,” he said, referring to Ebola’s maximum incubation period. “I wouldn’t die of Ebola but of hunger.”

The five-month outbreak here in West Africa, already worse than all other Ebola epidemics combined, is for the first time spreading uncontrollably in a major city — one in which a third of Liberia’s 4.5 million people is estimated to rub shoulders, often uneasily. Though Ebola reached Monrovia three months after its appearance in the rural north, the city has become, in a few short weeks, a major focal point of the epidemic.

The outbreak has overwhelmed the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who has won the Nobel Peace Prize[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2011/] and the admiration of leaders around the world. But her management of Liberia has long drawn criticism at home, and now her handling of the Ebola epidemic has presented her with a political crisis that is galvanizing her opposition.

“We suffering! No food, Ma, no eat. We beg you, Ma!” one man yelled at Ms. Johnson Sirleaf as she visited West Point this week, surrounded by concentric circles of heavily armed guards, some linking arms and wearing surgical gloves.

“We want to go out!” yet another pleaded. “We want to be free, Mama, please.”

International Ebola experts and her own health officials advised against imposing the quarantine in West Point, worried that it would antagonize a population whose cooperation the government desperately needs to stop the epidemic. But Ms. Johnson Sirleaf sided with the army, which was the strongest proponent of the quarantine and took the lead in enforcing it, especially in the first two days.

“Putting the police and the army in charge of the quarantine was the worst thing you could do,” said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a Congolese doctor who helped identify the Ebola virus in the 1970s, battled many outbreaks in Central Africa and has been visiting Monrovia to advise the government. “You must make the people inside the quarantine zone feel that they are being helped, not oppressed.”

Isolating communities has succeeded in some rural areas in past outbreaks in Central Africa. But the quarantine of an entire urban neighborhood, where an estimated 60,000 to 120,000 people are crammed into crumbling shacks, has proved to be more than just porous. It has also led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may even be helping spread the disease, experts say, forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid, like food relief.

Cordoned off from the city, young men in West Point squeeze together in dense lines for rice and water, pushing and shoving, sweat mixing, saliva flying, blood sometimes spilling. One morning, a man in a wheelchair trying to cut to the front was beaten, stripped and left sprawled in the middle of the road, urinating over himself.

“The quarantine is going to worsen the spread of Ebola,” said Dr. Muyembe, the director of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. “It’s difficult to understand the motivation behind it. It’s simply not a good strategy.”

Lewis Brown, the Liberian minister of information, said the president made the decision based on both health and security concerns. Though Ebola has been spreading throughout other parts of the city, he said, the government singled out West Point because of its dense population and its potential for political instability, as shown when residents recently stormed an Ebola holding center that they did not want in the neighborhood.

“We’re not saying that Ebola is any more present in West Point than other places in the country — that’s not the argument we’re making,” Mr. Brown said. “But the potential is in the size of the area and the interaction with the city itself.”

He added: “We’re not claiming to be experts on Ebola. We’ve never had to deal with this kind of thing, but we’ve always had to deal with our people. We understand our people more than we understand this disease.”

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf has made no public statement since the start of the quarantine and the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old West Point boy, Shakie Kamara, who was caught in a battle between soldiers and men[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html] trying to break out of the quarantine zone.

During her visit to West Point, she apologized to his family and looked at those calling for help with sympathy in her eyes, saying little. Walking several feet behind her, a man in a checkered shirt pulled out Liberian dollar bills from a backpack with his gloved hand and tossed the money to the loudest protesters. The money silenced their criticism but immediately set off fistfights.

A Toyota Land Cruiser took the president out of West Point. Her guards and entourage followed on foot, tossing their used gloves on the ground on their way out.

An Explosive Outbreak

No one knows yet why Ebola has succeeded in spreading at such an alarming rate here in the capital. Ebola has reached the capital cities of Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Conakry, Guinea — the two other West African nations most affected by the current outbreak — but the disease has been more effectively contained in those cities.

The first cases in Monrovia were reported only in June. Infections have multiplied quickly here in recent weeks, illustrating the speed with which Ebola can spread in a major urban area. The county containing Monrovia quickly registered the nation’s biggest death toll — now 274 deaths out of a national total of 754, according to the Ministry of Health.

“The Conakry outbreaks have been very small, and they haven’t exploded in Freetown,” said Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert for Doctors Without Borders here. “So something is different in Monrovia. It’s something in the disease transmission behaviors in Monrovia that has done this. That’s my guess. We’ve never seen this kind of explosion in an urban environment before.”

Others point to a political system long dominated by an elite out of touch with the population and more focused on jockeying for power. Politicians, including members of the president’s own party, publicly expressed doubts about the extent of the outbreak and even accused her administration of exaggerating it to collect money from international donors.

Among Liberians, still grappling with the consequences of a 14-year civil war that ended in 2003, distrust of the government runs deepest in Monrovia’s poorest neighborhoods. Despite billboards and posters throughout the city declaring that “Ebola is Real,” many Liberians believe it is not.

Dr. Moses Massaquoi, who has been heading Ebola case management for Liberia’s health ministry during the crisis, said that high-level political denials delayed the expansion of a treatment center just as cases mushroomed last month.

“Unfortunately, Ebola is not waiting for politics,” he said. “That was a missed window of opportunity.”

As the situation worsened in the capital in mid-August, the government established the city’s first Ebola holding center in West Point, Monrovia’s biggest slum and political opposition stronghold. Locals ransacked[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/world/africa/with-aid-doctors-gone-ebola-fight-grows-harder.html] and closed down the center within days.

On Aug. 20, under the president’s orders, the army and police placed West Point under quarantine — the first time, some experts say, that a quarantine was attempted on such a scale[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html]. West Point reacted with fury: hundreds of young men tried to storm through the barricades. As soldiers fired live rounds to drive them back, the 15-year-old boy, Shakie, was killed. Only heavy rain starting around noon put a stop to the riots.

In rural areas, quarantining communities can work if they are small enough and unified under political or traditional leadership, experts say.

“What is important is for the people to participate in the process; otherwise it becomes too difficult to implement effectively,” said Dr. Nestor Ndayimirije, the World Health Organization’s director for Liberia.

A week into the quarantine of West Point, life has been getting harder for those without the means or connections to get out. The price of goods that find their way into the quarantine zone — rice, water, coal, prepaid cellphone cards, soap — has doubled.

“People are fighting for food to eat,” said Victor Nwanodu, who owns one of West Point’s most popular public toilets and baths. Business has dropped, he said, as people can no longer afford to pay for a hot bath.

Serena Wallo, 31, was one of a few dozen people whose houses were washed away this week along West Point’s heavily eroded shoreline. Unable to leave the quarantine zone, her family now has to stay with friends in the area, in the kind of overcrowded conditions where Ebola thrives.

“I’m not happy with the government,” Ms. Wallo said. “They are treating us like we are slaves.”

A Political Backlash

Like her counterparts in Sierra Leone and Guinea, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was dealing with Ebola for the first time. She decided to do so with a firm hand by deploying the army — an institution that remains troubled despite being rebuilt after the civil war with American training and hundreds of millions of dollars in American assistance.

Mr. Brown, the information minister, said that it was necessary for the army to take the lead in the first couple of days of the quarantine. “If the military had not backed up the police the way they did, probably not only West Point would have been overrun, but the city center would have also been overrun,” he said.

But the president’s handling of the crisis is drawing new political challenges and leading to defections. Political parties and newspapers are calling for her resignation. This week, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf announced she had fired high-ranking government officials who refused to return to Liberia because of the Ebola outbreak. Though she inspired great hope among Liberians when she was first elected in 2005[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/international/africa/12liberia.html], becoming the first woman elected head of state in Africa, the crisis has fueled longstanding criticism that her reputation abroad was inflated by foreigners with little knowledge of the conditions in Liberia.

“This Ebola thing now has basically laid the thing out like this: the system is bad and the emperor has no clothes,” said Samuel P. Jackson, who served as an economic adviser to the president until the end of July but is now backing, Benoni Urey, a businessman believed to be Liberia’s richest man and a candidate in the next presidential election.

Mr. Urey, who for months has been criticizing the government’s handling of the outbreak, said Ms. Johnson Sirleaf “must take the ultimate blame for everything.” One of the greatest sources of public anger, he pointed out, has been the government’s inability to pick up the bodies of the Ebola dead, which have often been left in people’s houses or even dumped on public streets.

“Come on!” Mr. Urey said, calling it an example of the government’s incompetence.

Jerolinmek Piah, the president’s press secretary, said that Ms. Johnson Sirleaf was no longer giving interviews.

In a very brief exchange, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said of the quarantine in West Point, “We are trying to make it go well.”

Little the Hospital Could Do

Shakie Kamara, the 15-year-old boy who was killed in the clashes in West Point, was raised by his aunt. His mother died when he was a toddler, and his father a couple of years later.

On the morning of his own death, Shakie had gone to buy tea and bread for his aunt at a shop near the entrance to West Point, but apparently got caught between a crowd of rock-throwing men and soldiers firing live rounds.

“No pa, no ma,” he said, pleading for help as he lay on the ground with wounds to both legs.

The defense ministry said the wounds were caused by barbed wire. But Dr. Mohammed Sankoh, the medical director of Redemption Hospital, where Shakie died, and two other hospital staff members said that the boy died after suffering deep bullet wounds. There was little that the hospital, where a doctor and several nurses had died recently of Ebola, could do, hospital workers said.

“There was no material in the emergency room,” said Dr. Alphonso Gray. “The theater was not operating.”

While visiting West Point, the president promised Shakie’s family an investigation into his death.

Shakie’s older brother, Lusine Kamara, 27, said he told the president he wanted nothing — just Shakie’s body for a proper funeral. Shakie’s aunt, Eva Nah, left the door open.

“She told me that after everything, she will get back to me,” Ms. Nah said.

A couple of hours later, the military released Shakie’s body to his family, and he was buried at Monrovia’s Muslim cemetery.

An Ominous Ebola Forecast

The World Health Organization warned on Thursday that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, already the largest outbreak ever recorded, is going to get much worse over the next six months, the shortest window in which it might conceivably be brought under control. By then, the organization said[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html], the virus could infect more than 20,000 people, almost seven times the current number of reported cases.

It is a frightening prospect that requires an urgent infusion of aid from public and private donors around the world. The situation as described by the health agency is so dire and the resources needed so daunting that it is hard to see how they can be supplied anytime soon.

The agency issued a road map listing tasks that must be carried out by countries with Ebola cases, nearby countries, the international community and nongovernmental organizations if the epidemic is to be contained.

A top official said the road map would require at least 750 international and 12,000 local health workers on the front lines delivering care. How can impoverished countries whose health workers are falling ill and dying or fleeing in fear possibly supply that many caregivers? If they cannot muster those workers, it seems inevitable that wealthier nations will need to step in with more personnel, but they, too, may have difficulty recruiting people.

The World Health Organization is belatedly catching up to a warning issued in June by Doctors Without Borders, a group that has been delivering care in some of the hardest hit areas, that said the epidemic was out of control. On Thursday, the health agency said that the reported death toll had risen to 1,552, from 3,069 cases of infection in four West African countries — Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria — and that the actual toll could be up to four times higher because many cases go undetected or unreported. That suggests there could already be up to 12,000 cases.

A top American official on the scene in West Africa said the situation is far worse than anticipated and raised concerns that, with each passing day, the virus might spread to additional countries. More than 40 percent of the total number of reported cases have occurred in the past three weeks. Most of those cases are concentrated in a few localities, offering hope that the outbreaks can be contained if more resources are sent to those places.

The road map could cost almost half-a-billion dollars over the next six months, not including broader support to provide food, sanitation and other necessities or to strengthen systems in afflicted countries that are so overwhelmed with Ebola cases that they can’t provide basic health services. Some local workers have shown immense courage in tending to the sick, but they need more protective gear, disinfectants, tents and body bags to prevent infection, which the health agency intends to deliver.

In a detailed timeline, the organization says its goal is to reverse the trend in new Ebola cases within three months and stop all residual transmission in six to nine months. It also hopes to stop any new transmissions in a country within eight weeks of a first case being identified. That seems achievable with a vigorous effort to trace and isolate anyone who has come into contact with an infected person although some contacts in a large country or city will probably be missed.

The World Health Organization emphasized the importance of preventing the spread of the virus to other nations by screening travelers at international airports, seaports and major land crossings to bar travel by people with illnesses that could be Ebola. Some airlines have canceled flights to the afflicted countries. But that is an overreaction, if good screening programs are established. It will be critical to keep air and shipping links operating to deliver medical supplies and other essential goods.

GENEVA -- The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the Ebola epidemic was still accelerating and could afflict more than 20,000 people -- almost seven times the current number of reported cases -- before it could be brought under control.

The dire forecast was made as the health organization reported that the number of known cases and fatalities had risen once again. The organization also acknowledged that in areas of intense transmission ''the actual number of cases may be two to four times higher than that currently reported.''

The outbreak ''continues to accelerate,'' the organization said.

According to the latest figures released by the health organization on Thursday, the total cases had risen to 3,069, with 1,552 deaths, in four West African countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

Though the disease was identified in March, ''more than 40 percent of the total number of cases have occurred within the past 21 days,'' the organization said. ''However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities.''

The assessment came as the organization presented what it called a road map for stopping the transmission of Ebola within nine months. The plans are likely to cost nearly half a billion dollars over the next six months.

Though the road map aims to stop the epidemic in that time frame, ''We have to be realistic that there is uncertainty'' about such targets, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the health organization, told reporters in Geneva.

With many centers for treating the disease now too full to take new patients, it was necessary to find and expand other approaches to contain the spread of the disease, the organization said.

The road map assumes that a number of countries that are not now affected by the epidemic could become so, but also asserts that the procedures it sets out could stop any new transmissions within eight weeks of the first case being identified.

''That's extremely aggressive,'' Mr. Aylward said, acknowledging such speedy containment had been achieved only in remote locations, not in the crowded urban centers now affected.

The road map came as Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that the epidemic could get worse before it gets better. Dr. Frieden called for quicker international help and cooperation to control its spread.

Doctors Without Borders, which is battling the disease in the region, welcomed the road map but cautioned against taking a ''false sense of hope'' from it.

In a sign of the difficulties facing governments seeking to contain the disease, the health authorities in Nigeria reported on Thursday for the first time that the disease had spread beyond Lagos, its commercial capital, to claim another death.

In its statement on Thursday, the World Health Organization said the countries hit hardest by the epidemic -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- were ''struggling to control the escalating outbreak against a backdrop of severely compromised health systems, significant deficits in capacity, and rampant fear.''

Mr. Aylward, picking out details of the road map, said it would take at least 750 international and 12,000 local health workers.

''That is very difficult in the current environment,'' he added, alluding to fears arising from the high number of medical workers -- 250 as of Monday -- who had contracted the disease. Recruiting international staff may be harder than finding local personnel, he added, debunking the notion that locals were running away from the crisis.

Health workers were getting infected because they were exhausted from working extraordinary hours, Mr. Aylward said.

The road map emphasized the need to halt transmission of the disease in major cities and ports, and underscored the importance of keeping air and shipping links operating to deliver medical supplies, personal protection equipment, food and other goods to fight the outbreak.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are facing severe economic downturns as they struggle to cope with the Ebola outbreak, the African Development Bank reported on Thursday. On Wednesday, British Airways said it was suspending flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone because of Ebola concerns. Air France followed suit on Thursday.

Study Says ZMapp Works Against Ebola, but Making It Takes Time

A new study provides strong evidence that the experimental drug given to two American aid workers stricken with Ebola in Africa really works and could make a difference in the current outbreak — if more of it could be produced.

In the study, all 18 monkeys exposed to a lethal dose of Ebola virus survived when given the drug, known as ZMapp, even when the treatment was started five days after infection, when the animals were already sick.

Moreover, the monkeys’ symptoms, such as excessive bleeding, rashes and signs of liver toxicity, eventually disappeared. By contrast, all three monkeys in the control group died.

Experts said these were the best monkey results reported to date for any Ebola drug, raising hopes that the drug will work in people.

“I think it strongly supports that concept,” Gary P. Kobinger, the senior author of the study, said in a telephone news conference Friday, shortly before the paper was published by the journal Nature. Still, Dr. Kobinger, a researcher for the Public Health Agency of Canada, cautioned that effectiveness in monkeys was not “proof” that a drug would work in people.

Kartik Chandran, an expert on Ebola who was not involved in the study, said the results were impressive.

“To actually be able to reverse all those symptoms and signs and bring them back to baseline, I think that is pretty astounding,” said Dr. Chandran, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “If you are going to give somebody something during this outbreak, this would be it.”

The problem is that the supply of ZMapp is exhausted, according to Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the nine-person San Diego company that is developing the drug. And it is expected to take months to make more of the drug, which is produced in genetically engineered tobacco plants.

ZMapp came to the world’s attention early this month when it appeared to help two American aid workers stricken in Liberia and later flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, recovered and were discharged from the hospital last week.

Doctors say it is impossible to say what role ZMapp played in their recovery. Nonetheless, there has been a clamor for the drug and an ethical debate about who was entitled to the handful of treatment courses available.

The remaining supplies went to a Spanish priest, three doctors in Liberia and, just this week, a British nurse recovering in London. The priest, Miguel Pajares, and one of the Liberians, Dr. Abraham Borbor, died.

Father Pajares received one of the recommended three doses before he died, and the remainder has gone to the British nurse, William Pooley, according to a person involved in the discussions about drug allocation.

Some other experimental drugs have shown the ability to protect monkeys from Ebola if given shortly after infection, up to about two days. That might make such a drug useful for what is called postexposure prophylaxis — for example, after a person is stuck by an infected needle.

But in an outbreak like the one in Africa, most people do not know they are infected until symptoms develop. Most if not all of the people who have received ZMapp, for instance, were already sick. Hence it would be important that a drug could work even if treatment starts after symptoms appear, as was the case in this study.

Dr. Kobinger, who works at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said it was difficult to know how that aspect of the monkey results would translate in humans..

People can take up to 21 days to develop symptoms. In the study, the monkeys not given ZMapp died by eight days after infection. He said the next step would be to see if the drug can work even if started six or seven days after exposure, though at some point, the organs would be too damaged to allow for recovery.

ZMapp is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins that can isolate and neutralize an invading pathogen. The antibodies were initially harvested from mice exposed to a protein from Ebola, then genetically engineered to make them more like human antibodies.

The resulting antibodies are then manufactured in genetically engineered tobacco plants. The Kentucky manufacturing facility that has been used can make only about 20 to 40 doses a month, Dr. Kobinger said. Federal authorities are looking to increase production, perhaps by enlisting other companies that can do similar work.

Mapp, which was working with the Defense Department, and Dr. Kobinger’s laboratory initially developed their own three-antibody cocktails. When the two groups learned of each other, they joined forces.

They tested individual antibodies and various combinations in guinea pigs, and the two best combinations were then tested in monkeys. The winner of that face-off — consisting of two antibodies from Canada and one from the United States — became ZMapp.

The results reported Friday, particularly the protection when treatment was started five days after infection, were significantly better than those of the original Canadian and American cocktails.

“We of course expected an improvement — I mean, we were at least hoping for it,” Dr. Kobinger said. “But the level of improvement was at least beyond my own expectation.”

In the study, the monkeys were injected with a high dose of the virus. They then received three doses of ZMapp spaced three days apart, with the first dose coming three, four or five days after exposure.

The virus used in the experiment was from an outbreak in 1995. But some laboratory tests showed that ZMapp also inhibited the strain involved in the current outbreak.

MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s government announced Friday night that it would lift an Ebola quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A10%22}] on a large slum here in the capital, 10 days after attempts to cordon off the neighborhood from the rest of the city sparked deadly clashes and fueled doubts about President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s ability to handle the outbreak.

Residents of the neighborhood, West Point, will be free to move in and out starting Saturday at 6 a.m., said Lewis Brown, the minister of information. The army, which had pressed for the quarantine and took the lead in enforcing it in the first two days, will be removed from West Point, leaving only the police, Mr. Brown said.

A nationwide curfew, from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., will remain in place, he said.

“This was a tool intended to help the community to help themselves and get the help they desperately need,” Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview. “We’re pleased with the way that the community has owned up to this.”

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf ordered the quarantine on Aug. 20, rejecting the advice of international Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] experts and her own health officials who argued that such a large-scale quarantine, especially one led by the military, would be unmanageable and could exacerbate the spread of the disease. The quarantine immediately led to running battles between residents and the security forces; Shakie Kamara[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/world/africa/liberian-boy-dies-after-being-shot-during-clash-over-ebola-quarantine.html], a 15-year-old boy caught in the violence, died after suffering bullet wounds to both legs.

During the quarantine, many residents have sneaked out of West Point by paying bribes to soldiers and police officers. Prices of food and basic goods have doubled, causing living conditions in the slum to degrade further.

As state radio announced the news of the lifting of the quarantine Friday night, hundreds of residents in West Point gathered on its main road to celebrate, according to residents contacted by phone. Soldiers could no longer be seen at checkpoints, and only a light police presence remained, residents said.

“The road is jam-packed,” said Abubakar Bah, who manages a drug dispensary near the main entrance. “Everybody is very happy. Most people here still don’t believe there is Ebola in West Point. They’re saying that the government came and didn’t find Ebola, and so that’s why they’re leaving.”

Science
Leadership and Calm Are Urged in Outbreak

With the SARS outbreak in 2003, Taiwan’s news media was so alarmist that the government finally ordered every television channel to devote two minutes, three times a day, to a calm presentation of facts by Dr. Lee Ming-liang, a retired health minister in charge of the task force[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/16/world/sars-epidemic-outbreak-number-cases-taiwan-may-be-more-than-reported.html] dealing with the disease.

“Dr. Lee is nice, old, intellectual — very respected,” said Dr. Steve Kuo, who coordinated Taiwan’s SARS task force. “And he speaks an authentic Taiwanese dialect. Whatever channel you turned to, there he was. That was very useful.”

Unusual tactics and inventive thinking will be needed to beat West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, according to some of the world’s top experts in disease eradication. About 3,000 Africans have been infected and about half have died. The World Health Organization has warned that infections could rise to 20,000[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html], and Senegal on Friday announced its first case, a Guinean who entered a hospital in the capital, Dakar, seeking treatment.

Leadership must be imposed, the experts said, perhaps with a West African in charge. Donors must commit at least $500 million. And a new strategy is needed, with the first priority being to stop the panic caused by imprisoning residents of the affected countries behind barbed wire and roadblocks.

The outbreak will not end, they argued, until average citizens calm down and help their infected neighbors instead of fleeing from them.

“Liberians are not going to be saved by internationals coming in,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, one of the leaders of the drive to eliminate polio and an author of the health organization’s Ebola-fighting plan introduced this week. “They’re going to be saved by Liberians.”

The New York Times asked 10 leaders of the fights against smallpox, polio, SARS, rinderpest, Guinea worm and other diseases — some of them legends in their fields — for their views on how best to fight the outbreak.

All offered suggestions, but several asked not to be quoted by name for fear of appearing to undercut W.H.O. and United Nations leadership.

Most agreed on many basic principles. All, for example, were sure the outbreak could be stopped without experimental drugs or vaccines. None expected it to take less than six months.

All said that Western countries needed to help generously, especially those with long ties to affected nations: the United States to Liberia, Britain to Sierra Leone and France to Guinea. Their militaries may be useful, as long as they only deliver supplies, set up field hospitals, provide electricity and communications — and avoid anything that involves brandishing weapons, including enforcing quarantines.

The experts were universally appalled at the sight of rural areas hemmed by roadblocks[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html] and a slum in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, with barbed wire[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html] that made residents believe they were being locked in to die; they were even more appalled that soldiers used truncheons and bullets during what was supposed to be a public health effort. On Friday, the government said the quarantine of the slum, West Point, would be lifted on Saturday morning.

“People are going to break out — and a lot may get killed if they try,” said Dr. Peter L. Roeder, a British veterinarian who directed the final eradication campaign against rinderpest, a lethal cattle disease that led millions of Africans to starve to death in the 1890s and was declared eradicated in 2011. In that fight, he said, “if you went in heavy-handed and slapped on a quarantine, people just ran away with their cattle and dispersed the disease.”

To prevent panic, respected leaders must quell rumors, as Dr. Lee did. West Africa is not Taiwan; there are nearly 100 tribal languages, literacy is low and televisions rare. Radio is useful, experts said, but the key is to get trusted local leaders like chiefs, clerics, midwives and traditional healers to do the job. Ebola survivors “should be publicized,” one expert said, “so people understand that they don’t have to die if they come in for care.”

Pay is also an issue, experts said. Health workers taking huge risks must be compensated, and so must their families if they die.

Aziz Memon, a Pakistani textile executive who helps lead the fight against polio for the international Rotary Club, noted that when Taliban gunmen killed polio vaccinators in his country two years ago, vaccinators’ pay was doubled; for those in the riskiest areas, it quadrupled. To the families of those murdered, Rotary paid $10,000 in compensation.

Several doctors who helped eradicate smallpox — which had a 30 percent fatality rate — said they sometimes paid victims and their families in food and cash to stay indoors. Whole villages were paid to build quarantine huts where the sick were cared for by neighbors who had survived or had been vaccinated.

“Large amounts of money in small denominations can do a lot of good,” said Dr. Joel G. Breman, who has fought smallpox in West Africa and the first Ebola outbreak in 1976.

Doctors Without Borders, Unicef and other aid groups have said that they are struggling to find expatriate doctors, nurses and logistics personnel willing to go in. Most get modest stipends. Offering more might work, experts said, as might recruiting in countries with lower-paid health professionals like India or the Philippines.

Also, this outbreak is like SARS in that doctors and nurses are in the highest risk group. Training must be extra-thorough — especially in taking off protective gear that might be smeared with virus. Nigeria, for example, does not let anyone near victims without three days of training on wearing protective gear, said its health minister, Dr. Onyebuchi Chukwu.

Dr. Donald A. Henderson, a leader in the fight against smallpox who is now the dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, suggested a tactic that some of his peers found controversial. The outbreak has been so mismanaged, he said, that it may initially be wise to quarantine only obviously ill Ebola victims and temporarily abandon isolating their relatives and contacts. Eventually, all will have to be monitored, but seemingly healthy people have been forced into hospitals alongside the dying. That people go into hospitals in good shape only to die makes others flee from health teams.

Also, the experts agreed, rapid diagnostic testing is crucial, because the early symptoms — fever, headache and vomiting — mimic those of common diseases like malaria and typhoid. Quarantining people with easily curable ills alongside Ebola patients is a deadly error.

Clear, courageous leadership is also essential. In Liberia, some cabinet ministers and senior civil servants fled overseas, leading President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson to fire them[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html].

“This is not just a U.N. responsibility,” said Dr. David L. Heymann, who has fought Ebola, SARS and polio and is now the chairman of Britain’s Health Protection Agency. “Hopefully, there will be local African champions.”

Right now, Dr. Margaret Chan, the World Health Organization’s director-general, and Dr. David Nabarro, the new senior United Nations coordinator for Ebola, share leadership. But, the experts said, a command center must be established in West Africa with representatives of all affected countries.

To quell rumors that the disease is spread by foreign doctors, it might be prudent, some experts said, to put an African doctor in charge. Dr. Chukwu and his Ghanaian counterpart were mentioned as possibilities.

Experts estimated that the fight would cost $500 million or more — Dr. Aylward calculated that up to 1,500 field hospital beds will be needed — about five times as many as are now available; field hospitals need about four staff members per patient, and also generators, water purifiers, laboratories, kitchens, vast amounts of protective gear and supplies. The new W.H.O. road map calls for 12,000 local health workers and 750 expatriates.

To build trust and lower death rates, especially because local hospitals are not functioning any more, the plan will have to include treating less exotic but still potentially fatal illnesses like malaria and pneumonia.

Also, areas under quarantine will require food shipments for months. At the moment, an area in Sierra Leone and Liberia about the size of New Jersey with 1 million people in it has been cordoned off.

“There’s no part of this you can’t break down and make work,” Dr. Aylward said. “But it took us 20 years to build the polio response, and this has to be done in 20 days. You’re building the boat as you sail.”

U.S. Colleges See Little Risk From Ebola, but Depend on Students to Speak Up

With college students from countries hit by the Ebola outbreak entering the United States for a new school year, universities are downplaying the risk they might pose while admitting that they have limited ability to track students' travels or their health.

Schools know which students are from the affected countries -- the primary ones are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- and even the largest universities have no more than a few dozen. But most schools have no idea how many students, faculty and staff members may have visited the region over the summer. Some are trying to identify and question people who have been there recently, to take their temperatures and to ask them to watch for symptoms like fever and diarrhea for as long as three weeks.

''We basically ask people to advise us if they become ill,'' said Craig M. Roberts, an epidemiologist with the University of Wisconsin's student health service and chairman of the American College Health Association's task force on emerging health threats.

The association, an alliance of campus health officers, has given its members guidelines, Mr. Roberts said, ''but every college is free to come up with its own policy, and there's no centralized reporting, so we don't have any tally of which schools are doing what.''

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not given any specific guidance to colleges about arriving students, but plans to do so, possibly next week. The agency has advised against unnecessary travel to the affected countries, which include Nigeria, and this has prompted many colleges to suspend study abroad programs there.

''We're walking a line of trying to be vigilant and have a safe environment, without raising the kind of alarm that would unnecessarily escalate stigma and isolation of people,'' said Dr. Robert A. Winfield, chief health officer for the University of Michigan. ''Unless there's some evidence we should do more, or the C.D.C. recommends we do more, we're going to keep it a relatively low profile.''

Many schools, following the college health association's guidelines, are questioning students from the countries hit by the outbreak, and asking others who have visited to step forward voluntarily. A crucial question is when they left the region, because the incubation period of Ebola is up to 21 days. Also relevant is what contact they had with sick people, and any symptoms they might have.

Public health officials in Massachusetts have instructed colleges that people who might have been exposed in the last three weeks should take their temperature twice daily and report the results to the authorities.

Harvard University sent a letter this month to its students, faculty and staff members, telling them in boldface type, ''if you have been in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia or Nigeria in the past four weeks,'' to contact the university health service before returning to campus.

But other schools, like the University of Michigan, are screening only students from the affected countries, and not trying to identify others who have traveled there recently. The University of Illinois at Chicago said it was not requiring screening for students who are free of symptoms.

And still others, like Michigan State University and Penn State University, said they were not taking any specific steps to check for Ebola, beyond asking people who have traveled in outbreak areas to watch for symptoms.

Kansas State University, in addition to screening students, has worked with the state and a nearby hospital to develop a plan for handling anyone who is infected, said Jim Parker, director of the student health center.

Among communicable illnesses, Ebola, a hemorrhagic disease that kills most of those infected and has no known cure, inspires particular fear, and the current outbreak is the largest recorded. But university officials say the threat to their communities is exceedingly remote, and that fear of Ebola is more likely to cause problems than the disease itself.

Three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- have most of the Ebola cases, and combined, they have fewer than 400 citizens studying at American colleges and universities, according to the Institute of International Education. Nigeria, with a smaller number of cases, has more than 7,000 students in the United States.

But campus officials generally do not know which students or staff members have traveled to those nations, or when. An exception is Northeastern University, which asks its people to inform the university of their travel.

Mr. Roberts, of the University of Wisconsin, said that for university health officers, the level of fear may be unusual but the challenge of monitoring exotic diseases is not.

''We're always on top of emerging threats from around the world,'' he said. ''MERS, chikungunya, various strains of influenza -- there's always something.''

When a state sends more than a thousand troops with mobile artillery and heavy equipment into a neighboring state and takes control of territory, that’s an invasion, right?

Not according to NATO, which reported the Russian military movements in Ukraine[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/ukraine/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] this past week but depicted them only as increased Russian “interference.” And not according to President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per], who saw Russia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russiaandtheformersovietunion/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] being only “a little more overt” in its support of secessionists in southeastern Ukraine. And certainly not according to President Vladimir V. Putin[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/vladimir_v_putin/index.html?inline=nyt-per], whose lieutenants simply denied everything and labeled the evidence a Western “canard.”

Spin, of course, is an elemental political tool, and for the West to call the invasion an invasion would require a response that neither Washington nor other Western capitals nor NATO are prepared for. But an invasion it is, and the fundamental challenge to the liberal world order that it poses will be high on NATO’s agenda when its leaders gather in Wales this week.

As for Mr. Putin, the lie is an honored Soviet propaganda tool he has used since the start of the Russian campaign against Ukraine. The Russian leader is aware that acknowledging an invasion would not only sharply elevate the level of tension with the West, but would carry considerable domestic repercussions. Polls show that only 5 percent of Russians would support sending their troops into Ukraine.

When Russia acknowledged that Ukraine had captured some Russian soldiers — Moscow said they accidentally wandered across the border — mothers and girlfriends of the prisoners immediately and loudly began demanding an explanation.

The implausibly deniable invasion of Ukraine, to play on an old C.I.A. term, is not the only unconventional war facing the United States and NATO. There is also the question of what to do about ISIS[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/al_qaeda_in_mesopotamia/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the brutal jihadist outfit marauding through Iraq and Syria.

In brief comments on Ukraine and the Middle East on Thursday, President Obama said the United States had not yet formulated a strategy for dealing with ISIS inside Syria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], but he confirmed he had asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for options. But however reluctant he and the American public were to get militarily involved abroad, it was clear that neither the United States nor NATO could ignore the two threats.

As NATO grapples with armed conflicts, international health authorities will be fighting their own unconventional war against the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus, which spread to a fifth West African country, Senegal, and, according to the World Health Organization, could eventually infect 20,000 people.

In this struggle, too, finding a strategy was not always easy. Liberia’s misguided attempt to quarantine the squalid West Point neighborhood of the capital of Monrovia, the African city hit hardest by Ebola, created a reaction arguably as dangerous as the infection, with residents crowding together and battling surrounding soldiers and the police.

The Convenient Lie

The crisis in Ukraine has been underway now for half a year, and the Russian involvement, from the outright annexation of Crimea in March to the men, arms and convoys repeatedly reported spotted in the fighting in the southeastern industrial belt, has been obvious. But something seemed to change in the past week, when Mr. Putin amiably shook hands with President Petro O. Poroshenko on Tuesday, just two days before NATO reported that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers with artillery and other heavy weaponry were on the march inside Ukraine, and as rebels poised themselves for a new thrust along the Sea of Azov.

Until now, Europe, and to a lesser degree the United States, had publicly sustained the myth that Russia was intent only on destabilizing Ukraine to deter it from shifting westward politically, rather than to gain control over its eastern provinces, and that Mr. Putin could be brought to the negotiating table through sanctions and censure. But the Russia-backed rebel drive toward the port of Mariupol could also open a land route from Russia to Crimea, underpinning Russian control of a broad section of Ukrainian territory that Mr. Putin has provocatively called by its old czarist name, “Novorossiya,” or “New Russia.”

The West has been reluctant to acknowledge that Mr. Putin may be seeking actual control over the Donbass region, in part because breaking with Russia would endanger a major European energy source and lucrative trade deals, including the French sale of two Mistral-class assault ships to Moscow. More broadly, defining Russia as an enemy would mean an end to the post-Cold War world order based on the international rule of law — an order in which a democratizing Russia was to be a partner in integrating emerging economies, fighting terrorism and reining in rogue states.

Mr. Putin has craftily assisted Europe in its illusions by consistently denying any role in the Ukrainian fighting, regularly referring to the Europeans as “our partners,” pinning the blame for the crisis on American “unilateralism,” and posing as a mediator between Kiev and the pro-Russian militias. His actions, however, reflect a primitive and aggressive brand of geopolitics that was not supposed to have survived the Cold War.

In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed intent first of all on restraining expectations of what the United States might do about either Ukraine or ISIS. Russia’s actions, he said, were “not really a shift,” and he was vague about tightening sanctions.

Yet the pressure for intervening more directly in Ukraine by supplying the government in Kiev with weapons and intelligence is bound to grow, both within the Obama administration and among Eastern European states.

The Islamic State

That challenge extends to Iraq and Syria, where the latest iteration of fanatical Islam, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has established a virtual state straddling the two countries through military prowess and ruthless cruelty.

While Washington has agreed to airstrikes against ISIS inside Iraq[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] to protect threatened minorities and to give the Baghdad government time to marshal its badly battered and fractured forces, President Obama emphasized on Thursday that no decision had been made yet on dealing with ISIS inside Syria.

But there was a growing awareness that ISIS could not be curbed so long as it could flee to bases in Syria. Officials were said to be debating whether to use drones or fighter jets, and whether to target ISIS forces or specific leaders.

Mr. Obama did not address the actual choices before him. His message was not the action the United States or its allies might take, but rather the inadmissibility of any mission creep.

A report[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/world/africa/liberian-boy-dies-after-being-shot-during-clash-over-ebola-quarantine.html] in the World Briefing column on Aug. 22 about a teenage boy who died from injuries suffered in a clash in an Ebola-stricken neighborhood in Monrovia, Liberia, gave an incorrect cause of death from a doctor. The boy died of hypovolemic shock, or severe blood and fluid loss — not from hypothermic shock.

NEW YORK

An article[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/nyregion/with-bells-and-bananas-a-time-to-worship-ganesh.html] on Wednesday about a celebration in Queens honoring the Hindu deity Ganesha, using information from festival organizers, misidentified the oboelike instrument that was played at some of the proceedings. It is a nadaswaram, which is more popularly used in southern India; it is not a shehnai, which is more popular in the country’s north.

A Sports of The Times column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/sports/tennis/its-painfully-clear-banish-5-setters-.html] on Thursday questioning why men play best-of-five tennis matches at the United States Open while the women’s matches are best-of-three misstated, in some editions, the score of Kevin Anderson’s five-set victory over Pablo Cuevas in the first round. It was 6-3, 6-7 (3), 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (1) — not 6-3, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (1). (Cuevas, not Anderson, won the third set.)

SCIENCE TIMES

An answer in the Q&A column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/science/dont-judge-them-by-their-shells.html] on Tuesday about the color of an egg’s shell not having any bearing on its nutritional value misstated a nickname for the Ameraucana chicken, which lays eggs with blue shells. It is Easter egg chicken, not Eastern egg.

An obituary[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/arts/artsspecial/david-rosand-an-art-history-scholar-whose-heart-was-in-venice-dies-at-75.html] on Friday about David Rosand, an art historian and author who specialized in 16th-century Venetian painting, referred incorrectly to his son Eric. Though he went to law school, he is not a lawyer. The obituary also misspelled the name of a home in Italy bequeathed to Columbia University, in part through the efforts of Professor Rosand.

Opinion
Lessons Learned from the Ebola Epidemic
By KEN ISAACS

English
© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
On July 24, I wrote on this blog[http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/why-are-we-ignoring-a-new-ebola-outbreak/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body] that the Ebola epidemic was spinning out of control and pleaded with the international community to join my organization, Samaritan’s Purse, on the front lines of the fight against this deadly disease.

Two days later, we received word that one of our doctors, Kent Brantly, had tested positive for Ebola. News of Nancy Writebol’s infection came shortly afterward. In the ensuing days, our team worked to care for Kent and Nancy, evacuate them to the United States, and continue to help Ebola-stricken Liberians at our two case management centers. Tragically, the situation on the ground became so out of control that we were forced to evacuate our expatriate staff.

Kent and Nancy have now recovered and have been released from Emory University Hospital. Upon his release, Kent stated[http://spweb-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/08/sp-ebola-brantly-remarks-8.21.14.pdf], “I am forever thankful to God for sparing my life and am glad for any attention my sickness has attracted for the plight of West Africa in the midst of this epidemic.” He has definitely attracted global attention to the epidemic, but unfortunately that awareness is still not translating into effective action.

As Samaritan’s Purse and other organizations — most notably Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/] — continue to engage in the fight against Ebola, I would like to share some of the lessons I have learned over the past few months.

The international community was caught off guard by this epidemic, and the response remains inadequate to address realities on the ground.

Ebola in West Africa is moving faster than a racehorse. On August 7, I testified[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/us-and-global-efforts-to-contain-ebola-draw-criticism-at-congressional-hearing.html] before a congressional subcommittee. That night, the U.S. Embassy in Liberia ordered the evacuation[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/230398.htm] of non-essential personnel. The next day, the World Health Organizationdeclared an international health emergency[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html]. In the weeks since then, the disease has claimed over 300 lives in Liberia, and at least 100 more in Sierra Leone and Guinea. International experts agree that these numbers are greatly underreported[http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-africa-ebola-20140828-story.html].

The number of infections — and deaths — are increasing so dramatically that few epidemiologists are publicly willing to project how many more may get the disease. Some epidemiological reports I have read speculate that it will be mid-2015 before this Ebola outbreak peaks.

Doctors Without Borders is fighting a tough battle, especially in Liberia[http://www.msf.org/article/liberia-msf%E2%80%99s-new-ebola-management-centres-already-overwhelmed].

One 20-bed facility in the remote area of Foya recently had a patient load of 67. Recently, they opened a new 120-bed facility just outside of Monrovia, and reports say it is already overwhelmed.

Donor countries have released some funds as an incentive for non-governmental organizations to begin new programs to combat Ebola in West Africa, which is a good start. The United States Agency for International Development announced that they landed a plane with tons of supplies in Monrovia recently. The military can also play a key role in providing logistical support and airlifting essential items like soap, chlorine, protective equipment and medical supplies.

Last month, the Centers for Disease Controlpledged to dispatch 50 emergency responders to West Africa within 30 days[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/live/articles/2014/08/how-the-cdc-is-hacking-ebola/378695/]. I would not qualify sending 50 people over the course of 30 days as a true “emergency” response.

Liberia has tragically transitioned from an international public health crisis to a complete humanitarian emergency. Normal health care is disrupted and in many places halted. Insecurity and civil unrest is widespread. The World Food Program reports that up to one million people now need food rations[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/officials-visit-liberian-ebola-clinics-25064693]. Ebola was the catalyst for this catastrophe, but now these other emergency needs are overshadowing the continued disease threat.

W.H.O., which is widely known for its bureaucracy, infighting, academic perspective and lack of implementation capacity, is the United Nations coordinating body for the response to the Ebola crisis. If they fumble the ball many more lives will be lost.

Local health authorities in the United States lack the knowledge and coordination necessary to deal with Ebola effectively.

As our evacuated staff returned to the United States from Liberia, we found wide discrepancies in how they were treated by local public health departments. One physician was quarantined for 21 days and directed not to leave the interior of the house under threat of a two-year imprisonment. In another area, our personnel were “isolated” for 21 days but only told not to leave the county. They were free to interact outside of their homes. Public health concerns can mean that a doctor serving in Liberia for two weeks may well end up missing five weeks of work.

We need to rethink how we are providing patient care and fighting to contain the virus.

The slum of West Point, adjacent to Monrovia, was under a quarantine enforced by bullets and barbed wire. Not long ago, some members of this community ransacked a temporary isolation ward. Dozens of patients were chased out, and rioters looted mattresses and sheets — the very materials that would be loaded with Ebola virus. No doubt many were infected and are now at home sick, dying or dead.

West Africans are faced with a very hard decision if a loved one gets sick: take them to a center where more than 60 of 100 patients die or try to care for them at home. Many are choosing home care, which means sick people are staying with their families in their houses where they will most likely die and pass the virus to others.

We must explore the possibility of alternative treatment options to help these caregivers. Are there ways to educate them and provide essential materials to improve their chances of remaining uninfected — and perhaps increase the odds of survival for their sick loved one? Samaritan’s Purse is trying to answer this critical question and think outside the box in developing interventions to assist family caregivers.

I share these lessons because I am frustrated about the continued lack of respect for this disease among those who have the best resources to fight it. The problem only seems to garner serious attention when Ebola victims are citizens of a developed nation, like Kent and Nancy.

Those of us who are still witnessing Ebola’s destructive path through West Africa are committed to continuing the fight. We are taking the lessons we have already learned and applying them to new strategies in areas such as ground logistics, the deployment of skilled personnel, the provision of fuel oil, payment of salaries, and the education and engagement of local populations. I admit there are times when the battle feels overwhelming. I pray the international community will immediately and exponentially increase its efforts. There are still lives that can be saved.

Three months and 5,680 entries ago, we began our Summer Reading Contest.[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/our-fifth-annual-new-york-times-summer-reading-contest/]This week[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/summer-reading-contest-week-10-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week/], reluctantly, we announce our final winner — congratulations Ted Zhu! — along with the usual long list of runners-up and honorable mentions.

In a summer that featured agonizing headlines from around the globe — whether from Israel, Iraq, Ukraine, West Africa, Ferguson, Mo., or the United States border — we were heartened, and often humbled, to read the passionate, thoughtful responses of our teenage audience. Our favorite student posts, like the one we honor below, made both personal connections to the news and went beyond the personal to discuss broader questions an article raised.

Thank you, as always, to the many teachers who assigned this contest. We loved seeing those same school-identifiers (PRHSlions2014, bengal, MCHS2014, MADHS and so many more) over and over. We hope you’ll properly congratulate your school’s winners when classes resume, since making it to one of our top slots this summer was quite a feat.

Winner: A High School Journalist on the Execution of James Foley[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html]

By DB_TZ[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/summer-reading-contest-week-10-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week/comment-page-10/#comment-1872648]

As a high school journalist, my biggest fears to date have ranged from stuttering while conducting interviews to missing a deadline that could delay the publication of our newspaper. These may sound trivial, but trust me, it’s a pretty real nightmare that my fellow journalists understand.

Yet nothing to date could have remotely helped me identify with this: the horror of watching the beheading of a journalist covering a war zone.

At the start of journalism class every school year, we are taught the principles of journalism. It has always led me to envision journalists as the marauding crusaders for free speech that illuminate the truth for the general public. As journalists, we stand for the right to knowledge, and it is our duty, at all costs (within legal, ethical and moral bounds, of course), to obtain that knowledge and disseminate it.

I am touched by Mr. Foley’s bravery on his quest to bring to light the realities of war and give voice to the people of war-torn countries that suffer, yet often have no way to speak out. However, his gruesome execution is an all too real, brutal and barbaric reminder for journalists of the consequences of the pursuit of truth.

We are fortunate that there are people with the heart of James Foley, trekking into the murky waves of danger for the sake of the world at large. But while it’s brave and noble to do so, journalists shouldn’t have to face such massive and one-sided dangers. International law protecting them in war zones should be respected and followed, on account of how vital and essential their work is for the world at large.

I realize that may be too quixotic. For as long as journalists do their job correctly and impartially in such controversial areas of the world, it’s likely that sooner or later they will draw the ire of somebody out there. However, is sacrifice of life the ultimate price journalists must pay for the sake of truth? I hope, for the sake of Jim Foley and all journalists out there, the answer is no.

Video Shows Panic in Liberia as Man Wanders Out of Ebola Clinic

As Liberia struggles to contain[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html] the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record, health workers say that fear of the disease, and the stigma of being identified as a possible carrier, is creating a hostile environment for possible victims of the disease.

That terror was on display on Monday in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, where at least 270 people have already died of the illness, when a man suspected of having the disease wandered out of a treatment center and sowed panic in a nearby market.

The incident, which was captured on video[http://youtu.be/F-JZEaeOmfE] by witnesses, showed the man, wearing a medical bracelet, being confronted by angry and worried bystanders. He was then surrounded by health workers in yellow protective suits[http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/07/24/334948345/this-suit-keeps-ebola-out-so-how-can-a-health-worker-catch-it] from the international medical group Doctors Without Borders, who eventually bundled him into the back of a pickup truck and returned him to the clinic.

Sophie-Jane Madden, a press officer for the medical aid group, said in a telephone interview from Monrovia that the man had become disoriented while waiting for an evaluation at the group’s new clinic for patients suspected of having Ebola. After he was brought back from the market and given further medical treatment, he was eventually discharged.

Stefan Liljegren[https://twitter.com/aaxl/status/506438360303296512], who manages the Doctors Without Borders Ebola management center in Monrovia[http://youtu.be/dzWel8JQD3A], could be seen in the video coordinating the effort to take the man back to the clinic. He said in a statement[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/press-release/global-bio-disaster-response-urgently-needed-ebola-fight] released on Tuesday that the team operating the 160-bed center was overwhelmed and needed more resources. “Every day we have to turn sick people away because we are too full,” Dr. Liljegren said in the statement. “I have had to tell ambulance drivers to call me before they arrive with patients, no matter how unwell they are, since we are often unable to admit them.”

Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, warned on Tuesday that more needed to be done to stop the deadly outbreak. “Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history,” she said at a United Nations briefing[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/speechopen-letter/united-nations-special-briefing-ebola], “the world is losing the battle to contain it.”

More than 3,500 cases have been confirmed so far and more than 1,500 patients have died, making this the worst outbreak since the disease was first identified [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/world/africa/un-and-medical-group-make-appeals-for-ebola-aid.html]in 1976.

U.S. Health Agency Advises More Vigilance on Campuses

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has advised American colleges and universities, and any students or staff arriving from nations hit by the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus, to take precautions against spreading the disease that go beyond what most schools have done.

In interviews last week, some large universities said they had not adopted any anti-Ebola measures, noting that the C.D.C. had not yet offered them any guidance on the matter. Other colleges said they were asking anyone known to have recently been in the affected countries about possible exposure and potential symptoms, like fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], severe head or body aches, or unexplained bruising or bleeding.

In a new advisory issued over the weekend, the agency recommended that colleges conduct that kind of screening for anyone who had been in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Nigeria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/nigeria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] or Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] in the past 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus before symptoms appear.

In addition, it advised measures that few colleges and universities have adopted, like having people returning from those countries take their temperature twice daily until the 21-day period has passed, even if they have no symptoms and no risk of exposure under guidelines the C.D.C. has developed. It instructs colleges, “If a student, faculty or staff member has had a high- or low-risk exposure, state or local public health authorities should be notified, and school officials should consult with public health authorities for guidance about how that person should be monitored.”

The C.D.C. says that anyone who was recently in the outbreak region and develops a fever of 101.5 degrees or higher, or has other possible signs of the disease, should seek immediate medical care and warn a hospital or doctor’s office in advance of their arrival. It advises steps to minimize proximity to others, like not taking public transportation.

At this time of year, thousands of foreign students and workers, and Americans who have been traveling abroad, arrive on campuses to start a new school year, stirring fears of Ebola reaching the United States.

Campus health officials have played down the risk, noting that the numbers from the affected countries are small. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the outbreak is most severe, send fewer than 400 students each year to American colleges and universities. Nigeria sends more than 7,000, but it has had far fewer Ebola cases.

Administrators can easily identify students from those nations. Identifying others who have traveled to those countries is harder, and colleges say they have little choice but to rely on people stepping forward voluntarily.

U.N. and Medical Group Make Appeals for Ebola Aid

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations and the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders each issued urgent appeals on Tuesday for international aid to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

Senior United Nations officials urged diplomats to cable their capitals to send money, doctors and protective gear to the affected region. The doctors’ group called for countries to send civilian and military biohazard experts.

Jan Eliasson, the deputy secretary general of the United Nations, said at a meeting of the General Assembly on Tuesday that the outbreak was “a test to international solidarity.”

More than 3,500 cases have been confirmed so far, with more than 1,500 deaths, making the outbreak the largest and most complex since the disease was first identified in 1976. Three countries in West Africa — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — account for most of the cases, but there have also been confirmed cases in Nigeria and Senegal.

A separate strain of the virus has been detected farther east, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 53 cases confirmed there, United Nations officials said.

Public health officials said the rate at which new cases were being identified was rising. “We understand the outbreak is moving out of our grasp,” said Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy for the Ebola crisis.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the head of the World Health Organization, said Tuesday that “the outbreak will get worse before it gets better, and it requires a well-coordinated big surge of outbreak response urgently.” Her agency has described the outbreak as “a global threat,” one whose magnitude Dr. Chan said “we all underestimated.”

United Nations officials said it was impossible to predict how many more people would be infected, and warned that the virus could spread further.

The virus was apparently carried to Nigeria by an infected traveler who flew to Lagos, the country’s commercial capital, from Liberia. It has since been detected in Port Harcourt, a bustling oil city in the south. Senegal reported a confirmed case of Ebola after someone carrying the virus traveled by land from neighboring Guinea, slipping through the cracks of a system meant to monitor travelers.

A number of airlines have stopped flying in and out of West African capitals. But Dr. Chan said a better way to bring the outbreak under control would be to improve screening of passengers at airports, rather than restricting air travel.

The disruptions caused by the outbreak have already led to food shortages in the most severely affected countries, and may affect the rice and maize harvests, the Food and Agriculture Organization said[http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/242177/icode/#.VAXTwAzKEnA.twitter] on Tuesday.

Doctors Without Borders criticized the World Health Organization on Tuesday for not acting sooner to bring the outbreak under control. The doctors’ group’s international president, Dr. Joanne Liu, told diplomats[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/speechopen-letter/united-nations-special-briefing-ebola] at the United Nations that countries with expertise in handling biological threats should help the affected countries by setting up mobile laboratories and field hospitals to treat Ebola patients.

“It is your historic responsibility to act,” Dr. Liu said. “We cannot cut off the affected countries and hope this epidemic will simply burn out. To put out this fire, we must run into the burning building.”

Because the virus is transmitted very readily through contact with fluids, medical caregivers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/world/africa/sierra-leone-if-they-survive-in-ebola-ward-they-work-on.html] have been prominent among the victims of the outbreak so far. An American missionary doctor who had been treating obstetrics patients in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, was diagnosed with Ebola, a Christian missionary organization called SIM announced on Tuesday.

The W.H.O. is due to convene a meeting of scientists later this week to decide how to put to use experimental vaccines against Ebola. Canada has offered to donate 800 to 1,000 doses of one vaccine that is still undergoing trials.

Tech Shares Lead Nasdaq Lower in Quiet Day of Trading

A slide in Apple and other technology stocks steered the stock market to a small loss on Wednesday, as relief that greeted reports of a possible cease-fire in Ukraine faded on Wall Street.

News that Russia and Ukraine were close to reaching a cease-fire agreement rippled through markets early, lifting stocks in Europe and pushing up oil prices. In the United States, the stock market headed higher at the start of trading, but then sagged in the afternoon.

One reason was Apple, the market’s top heavyweight. The technology giant’s stock slumped $4.36, or 4.22 percent, to $98.94, after Samsung introduced two Galaxy smartphones with displays aimed at quick access to frequently used applications. Analysts expect Apple to unveil iPhones with bigger screens next week.

Shares in other big tech companies, including Amazon and Facebook, also fell 1 percent or more. Of the 10 sectors in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, technology companies lost the most.

The S.&P. 500 slipped 1.56 points, 0r 0.08 of a percent, to 2,000.72. The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by large tech companies, sank 25.62 points, or 0.56 percent, to 4,572.57.

The Dow Jones industrial average managed to eke out a slim gain, rising 10.72 points, 0r 0.06 of a percent, to 17,078.28.

The stock market has barely moved this week even with news that, in other times, might cause investors to cheer.

Any good news has to be unusually good to push the S.&P. 500 past 2,000 and further into record territory, said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, an investment fund.

“Above 2,000, discretion is the better part of valor,” Mr. Landesman said. “Most people are kind of reluctant to jump in right now.”

More encouraging reports on the economy came out on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve said the economy strengthened in all regions of the country in July and August. The Commerce Department said that orders for factory goods shot up 10.5 percent in July.

“Everything right now is pointing to greater market strength,” said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “What usually stops bull markets? It’s almost always a recession.” And, he said, there are no signs of a recession on the horizon.

In Europe, stock markets surged after reports that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his Ukrainian counterpart had agreed to the broad terms of a peace plan to stop the fighting in eastern Ukraine. The DAX index in Germany climbed 1.26 percent. The CAC-40 in France picked up 1 percent. Russia’s benchmark MICEX soared 3.5 percent.

Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari, said the reports of a cease-fire were “welcomed with open arms by the markets.”

The hope, he said, must be that economic sanctions on Russia would soon be lifted, which could help the European economy reclaim lost ground.

Among the stocks on the move, Delta Air Lines tumbled $2.11, or 5.16 percent, to $38.82, giving it the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The airline cut estimates for a measure of revenue, blaming “events in Russia, the Middle East and Africa,” an apparent reference to fighting in eastern Ukraine, war in Syria and an Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In the bond market, interest rates eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.40 percent, down from 2.42 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 7/32, to 99 26/32.

U.S.
3rd Missionary With Ebola Is Identified

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The third American sickened in West Africa with the Ebola virus was identified on Wednesday as a 51-year-old doctor from the Boston area who was delivering babies at a hospital in Liberia.

Bruce Johnson, the president of the missionary group SIM USA, which sponsors the work of the doctor, Rick Sacra, said at a news conference that it was not clear how he had contracted the virus. All of Dr. Sacra’s patients in the obstetrics ward at the ELWA Hospital of SIM in Monrovia had been screened for Ebola, Mr. Johnson said[http://www.simusa.org/content/latest-news/4574/press_conference_september_3_2014].

“A strong possibility is that the Ebola symptoms were masked and not presenting themselves with a patient who was admitted and cared for,” he said.

Dr. Sacra had worked in Liberia before for SIM, and he decided to go back after the two other missionary workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, fell ill with the virus. “He approached us after hearing of Dr. Brantly being unable to carry on his medical duties,” Mr. Johnson said. “Plus, our other two doctors had been pulling very long hours, under extremely fatiguing conditions, and they needed a break.”

Both Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol were taken to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and treated with an experimental drug, ZMapp. For now, Dr. Sacra is being treated in the Ebola ward at ELWA Hospital, and there are no plans to bring him back to the United States, Mr. Johnson said. The doctor has not received the experimental drug.

Ms. Writebol, 59, who was discharged from Emory late last month along with Dr. Brantly, made her first public appearance[http://www.simusa.org/content/latest-news/4575/nancy_writebol_shares_about_ebola] on Wednesday, recounting her experience being evacuated from Liberia and recovering from Ebola. She spoke at a news conference at SIM’s headquarters here.

Ms. Writebol, who has spent recent days in seclusion with her husband, said that she did not know whether to credit the drug or the care she received for her recovery, but that she believed God had played a role.

She said she had been helping to dress and then decontaminate doctors and nurses as they went in and out of the Ebola unit at the Monrovia hospital when she felt ill. Recognizing the symptoms of weakness and fever from an earlier bout with malaria, she had a test for the disease. It was positive, but the fever did not go away after treatment. As a precaution, she was tested for Ebola. The test came up positive, and she immediately began treatment in Liberia.

Ms. Writebol said that she had few memories of the illness, because she drifted in and out of consciousness, with debilitating pain in her feet and legs. She said she remembered feeling incredibly sick, but never afraid.

“I had no fear, because I felt God’s presence was with me whether I lived or died,” she said. On Wednesday, she walked with ease in black flats.

Ms. Writebol said she did not believe she would survive the flight back to the United States. But when describing her evacuation, she told reporters, “I have a funny story for you.”

While dressed in a white hazardous materials suit and being handled by medical personnel wearing the same, she said, she was placed flat on the luggage conveyor belt to be loaded onto a private air ambulance for the flight home.

“This is God’s story, not my story,” she said. “It was a privilege to be there.”

When Reporting Is Dangerous

My heart broke for Steven Sotloff, the second American journalist beheaded in Syria, not only because of the barbarity ISIS inflicted on him but also because he died trying to push back against the trend in news coverage.

Over the last couple of decades, we’ve all seen trivialization of news, a drift toward celebrity, scandal and salaciousness.

So far this year, nightly newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC have offered a combined total of 3 minutes of coverage of the civil war and impending famine in South Sudan, and 9 minutes about mass atrocities in Central African Republic, according to Andrew Tyndall of the Tyndall Report[http://tyndallreport.com/], which tracks such things. In contrast, the missing Malaysian airliner drew 304 minutes (almost five times as much as the Syrian civil war).

That’s why this is a moment to honor Sotloff — and James Foley[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html], the other American journalist executed, and so many others out on the front lines — not just for his physical courage, but also for his moral courage in trying to focus attention on neglected stories. He shone a spotlight in dark nooks of the world to help shape the global agenda.

It was a struggle for him.

“I’ve been here over a week and no one wants freelance because of the kidnappings,” Sotloff emailed another journalist while in Syria before his kidnapping, according to Reuters[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/03/us-syria-crisis-sotloff-idUSKBN0GY01720140903]. “It’s pretty bad here. I’ve been sleeping at a front, hiding from tanks the past few nights, drinking rainwater.”

One of the biggest changes that I’ve seen in my career is that journalists and aid workers have become targets. Virulent extremist groups now see journalists as enemies, and subject captives to abuse and torture. For instance, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syriareportedly waterboarded Foley[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/captives-held-by-islamic-state-were-waterboarded/2014/08/28/2b4e1962-2ec9-11e4-9b98-848790384093_story.html] before murdering him.

In addition, in conflict areas, any petty criminal with a gun can kidnap a journalist or aid worker and sell him or her to a group that will demand a ransom. European nations pay these ransoms, which both enrich the terror groups and create an incentive to kidnap other foreigners.

A Times investigation found[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html] that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates had raised at least $125 million from kidnappings since 2008. That’s a powerful business model for a terror group, and it’s one reason journalism and aid work is more dangerous today.

Last year, 70 journalists were killed for doing their jobs, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists[http://www.cpj.org/killed/2013/]. Over the last few years[http://www.cpj.org/2014/09/cpj-condemns-murder-of-us-journalist-steven-sotlof.php], some 70 journalists have been killed while covering the Syrian conflict, and about 20 are missing.

Most of those are Syrian, and let’s remember that the greatest danger is faced not by the Western journalists but by local ones — or by the local translators and drivers working for Western journalists.

In Darfur once, my interpreter and I were frantically interviewing villagers as a warlord was approaching to massacre them. Finally, my interpreter said: We’ve just got to go. If they catch us, they’ll hold you for ransom. But they’ll just shoot me.

We fled.

One way to honor Foley and Sotloff (and Daniel Pearl and many others killed over the years) would be for the United States to speak up more forcefully for journalists imprisoned by foreign governments — often by our friends, like Turkey or Ethiopia. Think of Eskinder Nega[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/opinion/letter-from-ethiopias-gulag.html], serving an 18-year sentence in Ethiopia, or Somyot Prueksakasemsuk[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-magazine-editor-jailed-for-11-years-for-insulting-king-8462651.html], a Thai serving 11 years for publishing articles deemed insulting to the king of Thailand.

Today there are Steven Sotloffs covering war in Ukraine, Ebola in Liberia, malnutrition in India — and also covering unemployment and crime in American cities.

They are indefatigable and relentless. Once while I was covering the Congo civil war with a group of Africa-based reporters, our plane crashed. It was terrifying for me, but another passenger (a reporter based in Nairobi) told me it was her third plane crash. Yet another colleague on that plane was later killed covering a conflict in West Africa.

A special shout-out to the photojournalists and video journalists, for they often take the greatest risks. A reporter like myself can keep a distance, while that’s useless for those with cameras. My first rule of covering conflicts is never to accept a ride from photographers, because when they hear gunfire they rush toward it. Just Wednesday, it was confirmed[http://en.ria.ru/world/20140903/192581043/Statement-by-Rossiya-Segodnya-Director-General-on-Death-of.html] that a Russian photojournalist, Andrei Stenin, had been killed in Ukraine.

So, to Steven Sotloff and James Foley and all brave journalists putting themselves in harm’s way, whatever nationality, this column is a tribute to you — and to your loved ones, who suffer as well.

We mourn you; we miss you; and, we admire you. And your commitment to the serious over the salacious elevates not only journalism but the entire global society.

Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, based in Geneva, flew to New York on Monday for several days of meetings in the United States focused on the international fight against the Ebola outbreak. Before walking to her first meeting and then tucking into her favorite East Side noodle dive[http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2014/09/04/world/04chan2.html], she sat down for an interview about Ebola.

Questions have been edited, and answers have been condensed.

Q. You managed the SARS emergency in your former position as the director of health of Hong Kong, so you’re obviously well acquainted with outbreaks. Can you lay out the chronology of the W.H.O.'s response to the current Ebola outbreak, once the W.H.O. was notified of it in March?

A. First and foremost, people need to understand W.H.O. W.H.O. is the U.N. specialized agency in health. And we are not the first responder. You know, the government has first priority to take care of their people and provide health care. W.H.O. is a technical agency.

Q. How do affected countries work with the W.H.O.?

A. They will invite W.H.O. to provide technical advice and also technical support. Now, what does that mean? For example, if they have a cholera outbreak, if they have you know an Ebola outbreak, they would ask us: “What are the good practices to control the outbreak?”

If the countries say, “Well, we may need an epidemiologist or we may need some laboratory support,” then W.H.O. will call on our partners, which would include countries or include scientific organizations, like the C.D.C., like the Institut Pasteur. Then people with the skills or the expertise, we will say [to them], “Would you be happy to go to this country and provide technical support?” And they go under the aegis of W.H.O.

So this is how we provide services. We are not like international N.G.O.'s, for example M.S.F. [Doctors Without Borders], Red Cross, Red Crescent or local N.G.O.'s who are working on the ground to provide, you know, direct services.

I met with the president of Guinea in April. He visited just before my World HealthAssembly. I had a very good discussion with him. I told him, “This is not a disease you should take it lightly. We will support you, and reinforce you.”

Q. How does funding play into the response of the W.H.O. to outbreaks?

A. My budget [is] highly earmarked, so it is driven by what I call donor interests.

When there’s an event, we have money. Then after that, the money stops coming in, then all the staff you recruited to do the response, you have to terminate their contracts. So I don’t like these kind of ups and downs and ups and downs. We need to even the fluctuations, so going forward, my view is that we need to have sufficient funding to have a core group of staff. When there is no war to fight, these staff would help countries to build preparedness, to build response systems. Just like a fire department. When there is no fire, you help countries to build capacity. When there is a fire, you fight the outbreak, but at same time you also build a network of GOARN [Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/]] partners, so that you can mobilize them and surge them to provide the very much needed support.

Q. What has made this outbreak different for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia compared with outbreaks that have occurred in recent years such as MERS-CoV in the Middle East or H7N9 in China and haven’t spread as far?

A. Those diseases happened in countries which had capacity, which had the leadership and which have the people. But [with Ebola] these three countries that we’re talking about are very, they have very challenging conditions.

In those three countries, there is an area where they share a common border. I was educated by the people — they belong to the same tribe, but they may live in different countries. So they visit their friends, their relatives. So they give each other the disease.

And of course, we must understand poverty in these countries. What does that mean? It means people don’t store food more than one day, and they have to go out to seek employment. They have to go out and seek food, and even if they have been exposed, they move around. So this can explain part of the reason why it was spreading so quickly.

Q. Some responders, including even some within the W.H.O., have told me they wished the W.H.O. had done more sooner on this outbreak. Do you agree with that?

A. The benefit of hindsight is always better. I have to say that all the agencies I talked to — including the governments — all of us underestimated this unprecedented, unusual outbreak. You know, part of the reason is we always look at history in some way.

For almost 40 years, all outbreaks of Ebola were smothered. But they were in the villages. And this time, because the population now, compared with 40 years ago in these countries, is many times [greater] and more mobile and so forth, so there are multiple reasons. I don’t want to say that, you know, we blame the country, or we blame any agency, because it’s just too big for any country, or for any organization to deal with this.

Q. In early August, you declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on the advice of a committee you convened. What does that designation mean, and how did you explain the decision when you met with the presidents of the three most affected countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia — prior to the declaration?

A. I met them the first of August. I said I have already prepared for an emergency meeting of the International Health Regulations. I said to them, I am the director general of the W.H.O. My duty is to the world’s population as well.

The announcement is important so that the whole world’s countries are informed: This is happening. You need to be prepared should there be a case arriving at your doorstep, whether or not you have the preparedness and response plan ready. So this is the established mechanism.

Q. Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said she wanted you, as the director general of the W.H.O., to call the outbreak “out of control.”

A. Well, we use different language to mean the same thing. I did say that the outbreak is running ahead of us.

I don’t know if this is culture or whatever. I said the language I use — you use “out of control” — you see all my speeches. I always say that the outbreak is running ahead of our response.

In all my life, when you deal with a major crisis, you do have ups and downs. I never allow ups and downs to demoralize. Because I need to see hope, and also motivate people. There is a window that we collectively can do something.

Q. What are some of the important things the W.H.O. is planning to do?

A. We need to look at the science of the virus, because it is spreading in such a way, you have never seen it before. We need to go back and look at the science. This week on Thursday and Friday, I’m going to have a meeting to look at what are the potential vaccines and medicines. How can W.H.O. coordinate all the scientists in the world? The U.S. has many people coming — N.I.H., C.D.C. and the F.D.A. And, of course, I have invited some 20 scientists from African countries and Canada. I want to have an open and transparent discussion, given such a very severe disease.

The scientists, I did say to them I would like them to look at the potential of medications or vaccines and conduct clinical trials to get safety data. I don’t want to do any harm. You do no harm before you do good. So the scientists must agree under such a serious condition and on compassionate grounds. The ethicists already agreed it’s O.K. to use experimental treatments, as long as the person involved is fully informed, and has [given] informed consent, knowing the pros and cons.

I want to move it one step further: What are the minimum safety data? The scientists would agree, O.K. let’s do a quick, clinical trial. It is good that based on our initial discussion we are bringing groups of people together, a consortium. You heard [GlaxoSmithKline[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/business/as-ebolas-toll-rises-drug-makers-race-to-test-medicines.html]] make an announcement, and N.I.H. And the Canadian government has invested in R and D in making a vaccine available to us. And so we want to test the safety and do some clinical trials and if they can be used to protect the groups of people who are providing service, then we’d be happy to do so.

Q. There were some early tensions between agencies involved in the Ebola response. Can you address that?

A. I’ve been through all these crises. In a way, I just feel myself as a bridge builder, bringing people together, making them feel comfortable. I have a famous song, do you know that? Getting to know you. Getting to know you. I always sing this song to the people who don’t know each other. I said you need to get to know each other, what each agency can do, and cannot do, before you understand why they are not doing the kind of things you want.

Q. What’s next in the fight against Ebola?

A. We have a road map. W.H.O. produced a road map on an Ebola response plan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html], on the public health response. [Dr.] David Nabarro will work with the U.N. family and come up with what are the food responses, what are the water and sanitation [responses], what are the air bridge and logistics [needed] to support the public health response. Countries of the world like a plan, costed so that they know how they can help. I’m optimistic in the sense that we use these plans to rally support from the countries, and I expect to see more and more countries come forward and say we want to help [with] this, because this is a global issue, is a global threat and we must have a global solution.

I have managed so many outbreaks in my life. And new diseases. This is the most difficult. You know why? The fear factor. There’s no medicine for fear. Because people overreact, airlines… These people are at the lowest risk, and yet their fear is there.

Cuts at W.H.O. Hurt Response to Ebola Crisis

With treatment centers overflowing, and alarmingly little being done to stop Ebola from sweeping through West African villages and towns, Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, knew that the epidemic had spun out of control.

The only person she could think of with the authority to intensify the global effort was Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, which has a long history of fighting outbreaks. If the W.H.O., the main United Nations health agency, could not quickly muster an army of experts and health workers to combat an outbreak overtaking some of the world’s poorest countries, then what entity in the world would do it?

“I wish I could do that,” Dr. Chan said when the two met at the W.H.O.'s headquarters in Geneva this summer, months after the outbreak burgeoned in a Guinean rain forest and spilled into packed capital cities. The W.H.O. simply did not have the staffing or ability to flood the Ebola zone with help, said Dr. Chan, who recounted the conversation. It was a fantasy, she argued, to think of the W.H.O. as a first responder ready to lead the fight against deadly outbreaks around the world.

The Ebola epidemic has exposed gaping holes in the ability to tackle outbreaks in an increasingly interconnected world, where diseases can quickly spread from remote villages to cities housing millions of people.

The W.H.O., the United Nations agency assigned in its constitution to direct international health efforts, tackle epidemics and help in emergencies, has been badly weakened by budget cuts in recent years, hobbling its ability to respond in parts of the world that need it most. Its outbreak and emergency response units have been slashed, veterans who led previous fights against Ebola and other diseases have left, and scores of positions have been eliminated — precisely the kind of people and efforts that might have helped blunt the outbreak in West Africa before it ballooned into the worst Ebola epidemic ever recorded.

Unlike the SARS crisis of 2003[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/world/as-sars-outbreak-took-shape-health-agency-took-fast-action.html], which struck countries in Asia and elsewhere that had strong governments and ample money to spring to action, the Ebola outbreak has waylaid nations that often lack basic health care, much less the ability to mount big campaigns to stamp out epidemics.

The disease spread for months before being detected because much of the work of spotting outbreaks was left to desperately poor countries ill prepared for the task. Once the W.H.O. learned of the outbreak, its efforts to help track and contain it were poorly led and limited, according to some doctors who participated, contributing to a sense that the problem was not as bad as it actually was. Then, as the extent of the epidemic became obvious, critics say the agency was slow to declare its severity and come up with plans, and has still not marshaled the people and supplies needed to help defeat the disease and treat its victims.

“There’s no doubt we’ve not been as quick and as powerful as we might have been,” said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a W.H.O. assistant director general.

Another W.H.O. leader agreed. “Of course in retrospect I really wish that we had jumped much higher much earlier,” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the assistant director general in charge of outbreak response. “Of course I wish we’d poured in more and more earlier.” But, he added, “if this outbreak had been a typical outbreak, nobody would be saying we did too little, too late.”

The outbreak began close to the borders[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/world/africa/tracing-ebolas-breakout-to-an-african-2-year-old.html] of three neighboring countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia — and spread surprisingly fast. Since then, the W.H.O. has engaged more than 400 people to work on the outbreak, including employees of other agencies in its network, and in August the agency declared the epidemic an international emergency[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html?_r=0], hoping to stop it from crossing more borders. Dr. Chan has met with presidents in the region, and last week the W.H.O. announced what it called a road map[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/resources/publications/ebola/response-roadmap/en/] for a “massively scaled” international response.

The current outbreak has killed more than 1,900 people and spread to the point that the W.H.O. warns that more than 20,000 people[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html] could become infected. Sick people are dying on the street. Some feel the entire model the world uses to fight outbreaks needs to be rethought, so that an agency like the W.H.O. has the structure and mandate to take command.

But Dr. Chan said that governments have the primary responsibility “to take care of their people,” calling the W.H.O. a technical agency that provides advice and support. Still, she noted that her organization, like many governments and agencies, was not prepared.

“Hindsight is always better,” Dr. Chan said. “All the agencies I talked to — including the governments — all of us underestimated this unprecedented, unusual outbreak.”

A Shift in Emphasis

The W.H.O., founded in 1948, is responsible for taking on a wide range of global health issues, from obesity to primary health care. But since the world’s health needs far outstrip the financial contributions of the W.H.O.'s 194 member nations, those priorities compete.

The threat of emergent infectious diseases jumped high onto that list 20 years ago, when an outbreak of plague in India[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/24/world/thousands-flee-indian-city-in-deadly-plague-outbreak.html] created a panic, sending about 200,000 people fleeing. The next year in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/10/world/mysterious-disease-kills-at-least-56-in-one-month-in-zaire.html], Ebola killed about 245 people. With fears of cross-border infections high, a new urgency arose: improving the world’s ability to stop outbreaks.

The W.H.O. took the lead, at the request of its member nations. A crew of passionate outbreak veterans assembled a unique department, using an early form of electronic crowdsourcing to detect outbreaks and dispatching experts to the field. Three years after the effort solidified, the W.H.O. played a big role in responding to a cluster of deadly pneumonia cases in Asia. The new virus became known as SARS, and it was contained within the year, with most cases occurring in China.

To aid the fight, wealthy individuals offered the W.H.O. “literally hundreds of millions because their businesses were affected,” said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank and a former director at the W.H.O. “But as SARS burned out, those guys disappeared, and we forgot very quickly.”

Soon, the global financial crisis struck. The W.H.O. had to cut nearly $1 billion from its proposed two-year budget, which today stands at $3.98 billion. (By contrast, the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 2013 alone was about $6 billion.) The cuts forced difficult choices. More emphasis was placed on efforts like fighting chronic global ailments, including heart disease and diabetes. The whims of donor countries, foundations and individuals also greatly influenced the W.H.O.'s agenda, with gifts, often to advance specific causes, far surpassing dues from member nations, which account for only 20 percent of its budget.

At the agency’s Geneva headquarters, outbreak and emergency response, which was never especially well funded, suffered particularly deep losses, leaving offices that look, one consultant said, like a ghost town. The W.H.O.'s epidemic and pandemic response department — including a network of anthropologists to help overcome cultural differences during outbreaks — was dissolved, its duties split among other departments. Some of the main outbreak pioneers moved on.

“That shaping of the budget did affect the area of responding to big outbreaks and pandemics,” said Dr. Fukuda, who estimated that he now had 35 percent fewer employees than during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic — more than double the cuts for the organization as a whole.

“You have to wonder are we making the right strategic choices?” he said. “Are we ready for what’s coming down the pike?”

The entire W.H.O. unit devoted to the science of pandemic and epidemic diseases — responsible for more than a dozen killers, including flu, cholera, yellow fever and bubonic plague — has only 52 regular employees, including secretaries, according to its director, Dr. Sylvie Briand, who said that could be increased during outbreaks. Before the Ebola epidemic, her department had just one technical expert on Ebola and other hemorrhagic diseases.

Across Africa, the ranks of the agency’s regional emergency outbreak experts, veterans in fighting Ebola, were cut from more than a dozen to three. “How can you immediately respond to an outbreak?” said Dr. Francis C. Kasolo, a W.H.O. director. “It did affect us.”

And a separate section of the W.H.O. responsible for emergency response was whittled “to the bone” during the budget cuts — to 34 staff members from about 94 — according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, its assistant director general.

“You can’t make a cut that big, that deep, and it’s not going to have an effect on your operational capacity,” he said.

His group, charged with responding to wars, disasters and resurgent polio, was asked in August to assist with Ebola, too. “At no time that I can think of in the recent past have we been dealing with such a scale of human misery over such a broad geography due to such a range of hazards,” he said, including enormous population displacements in Syria, Iraq, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. But, officials warn, multiple, overlapping challenges may well be a feature of the future.

The W.H.O. hoped to balance its budget cuts by strengthening the ability of countries to respond to public health threats on their own. It put out new regulations for nations to follow to help contain outbreaks. But by 2012, the deadline it set, only 20 percent of nations had enacted them all. In Africa, fewer than a third of countries had programs to detect and stop infectious diseases at their borders. The W.H.O.'s strategy was often more theory than reality.

“There never were the resources to put those things in place in many parts of the world,” said Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a specialist formerly with the C.D.C.

A Disease Finds Its Opening

The Ebola virus took full advantage of these poorly prepared nations and the holes at the W.H.O.

Given the weakness in surveillance, the outbreak was not identified until March, in Guinea, roughly three months after a villager was believed to have contracted the virus from an animal, possibly a fruit bat. The delay allowed dozens of cases to spread through villages and even to Conakry, a capital of more than one and a half million people. Right away, Doctors Without Borders declared the outbreak unprecedented in its reach, the only group to do so.

Hastening the spread, hospitals lacked basic infection-control essentials like running water, protective gowns and gloves. Many doctors and nurses caught the virus from their patients, passed it to others, and died. The vulnerability and collapse of medical facilities revealed how far there is to go in achieving the W.H.O.'s top priority — ensuring basic global health care.

“This kind of outbreak would not have developed in an area with stronger health systems,” Dr. Fukuda said.

In the crucial weeks after the discovery, daily meetings brought together national authorities and foreign responders at the W.H.O. office in Conakry. But an absence of strong leadership and professionalism was notable from the beginning, participants said.

“It’s purely improvisation,” said Marc Poncin, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Conakry. “There is no one to take responsibility, absolutely no one, since the beginning of the crisis.”

Stopping previous Ebola outbreaks had required meticulous tracking: monitoring people who had close contact with infected individuals and isolating them if they developed symptoms. Previously, “if we missed a case,” said Dr. Simon Mardel, a British emergency doctor deployed by the W.H.O. to help with the effort, “it was like a failure.”

This time, the number of contacts being followed was disastrously low from the beginning, only 8 percent in the epicenter of Guéckédou, Guinea, in early April, according to another doctor sent by the W.H.O. That meant the disease was silently spreading. Dr. Mardel said he thought the more experienced W.H.O. leaders who had left the agency “would have been very vocal, and they would have sought to put it right quickly, as a matter of urgency.” A single person who traveled and became sick could touch off a conflagration.

It was not that responders were not trying. Victims’ contacts were spread across a wide area, hours away on bad roads. The payment of local workers had somehow been overlooked, so they stopped doing vital, risky jobs. Essential protective equipment was not delivered to many who needed it. Bottles of bleach were given out without buckets. The W.H.O. lacked relationships with some longstanding organizations with large networks of health workers in the region.

Traditions that contributed to Ebola’s spread, including funerals where mourners came into contact with corpses, were not fully recognized or confronted, said Dr. Pierre Rollin, an outbreak specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who worked within the W.H.O. umbrella.

Some villagers blocked roads with tree trunks and drove Ebola workers away with stones, accusing them of bringing in the disease. Adding to the tension, only bare-bones clinical care was provided to try to treat patients, reducing the chances of yielding survivors who could act as ambassadors for the cause. Some doctors deployed by the W.H.O. said it should have given them more tools to care for patients.

Institutional and personal tensions flared. “Everyone’s working at a fevered pace,” Dr. Dowell said. “There’s confusion and chaos. It argues for a system that’s organized as much as possible ahead of time so people know their roles.”

One consultant thought it strange that the W.H.O. would not send Twitter messages with links to the C.D.C.'s Ebola prevention information, part of a policy not to promote material from other agencies. Various offices within the W.H.O.'s balkanized hierarchy also jockeyed for position.

The difficulties in tracking cases and gaining access to villages led many to think the outbreak was burning out. “I came home sort of thinking, with a little luck, that’s wrapped up,” said Dr. Daniel Bausch, an Ebola outbreak veteran from Tulane University, who returned in May from a W.H.O. mission in Guinea.

The outbreak was not gone, just hidden. An herbalist in Sierra Leone contracted the virus treating Guinean patients. More than a dozen mourners at her funeral fell ill[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/health/ebola-outbreak-in-sierra-leone-is-tied-to-one-funeral.html] and seeded Sierra Leone. Some of them traveled back to Guinea and rekindled the outbreak there. After a lull of several weeks, cases re-emerged in Liberia, too, and reached the capital, Monrovia.

Dr. Bausch flew to Sierra Leone in July. “I was like, ‘where is everybody?’ ” referring to the shortage of health workers fighting the disease. “We all recognized we were really understaffed. We needed more people in the field.”

In some treatment centers, two or three doctors, wearing stifling gowns and masks in the heat, were caring for up to 90 patients. With the only W.H.O. logistician in the country working elsewhere, Dr. Bausch did not have anyone to accompany him and manage supplies of protective equipment, he said.

Dr. Bausch worked in Kenema, Sierra Leone, where he had helped set up a research program for another hemorrhagic fever, Lassa, which was common in the region. He knew some of the nearly two dozen health workers there who died after Ebola hit[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/29/science/100000003078361.embedded.html].

“It would be a logical question to ask, since Lassa was there, why was it so hard to switch gears” to Ebola?, Dr. Bausch said. But research institutes provided money for science, he said, not for disease surveillance and treatment. Those tasks had been left to the government of Sierra Leone, “one of the poorest countries on earth,” he said. “I always felt bad about this.”

In late July in Liberia, two Americans working at a missionary hospital fell sick and were soon evacuated home[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/us/nancy-writebol-kent-brantly-ebola-atlanta.html]. A Liberian-American brought the virus by plane to Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. Suddenly, the world seemed to understand the threat.

The question now, experts wonder, is whether the leaner, retooled W.H.O. — heavy on technical know-how, light on logistical muscle — can surge in a way that will help lead the world in bringing one of the most challenging health crises in recent history to a close. W.H.O.'s road map calls for $490 million from donors, and thousands of foreign and local health workers to contain the outbreak. Yet few foreign medical teams have answered the call so far.

“It is incumbent on the international community to really respond now,” said Dr. Kasolo, a W.H.O. director in Africa. “Otherwise history will judge us badly.”

W.H.O. Concerned About Another Ebola Cluster in Nigeria

An — The World Health Organization expressed worry on Wednesday about a second cluster of Ebola virus patients in Nigeria — in the center of its oil industry — because one of the three confirmed victims was a doctor who had treated patients and socialized after he became contagious.

The doctor, in the southern city of Port Harcourt, died on Aug. 22, and his infection was confirmed five days later. On its website[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/3-september-2014/en/], the W.H.O. said that more than 200 people might be at risk.

The W.H.O. said this second cluster had indirectly resulted from a quarantine lapse in the first cluster of Ebola cases that hit Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, in July, and was potentially far more serious. Tracing the spread of the disease in Port Harcourt, the statement said, revealed “multiple high-risk opportunities for transmission of the virus to others.”

Ebola has primarily afflicted three countries in West Africa — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — where hundreds of people have died in recent weeks in what W.H.O. officials have called the worst outbreak of the disease ever recorded. While the toll in Nigeria has been far more limited, officials are particularly worried about it because it is Africa’s most populous country.

The W.H.O. has been criticized by some other medical advocates for what they call its initial failure to mobilize adequately against Ebola when the outbreak surfaced in West Africa months ago.

The Lagos cases were traced to a traveler from Liberia, and Nigerian officials thought they had basically contained the spread. But the health organization’s statement said one person in Lagos escaped a quarantine in early August and sought treatment from a doctor in Port Harcourt, nearly 400 miles away. That doctor became infected and developed symptoms after a few days, was hospitalized on Aug. 16 and died of Ebola less than a week later.

Even as he developed symptoms, the statement said, the doctor “continued to treat patients at his private clinic, and operated on at least two.” Moreover, the statement said, before he was hospitalized the doctor “had numerous contacts with the community, as relatives and friends visited his home to celebrate the birth of a baby.”

It said visitors to his hospital room had included members of his church who performed a healing ritual that could have exposed them as well.

The other two confirmed cases in Port Harcourt are the dead doctor’s wife, who is also a doctor, and another patient at the same hospital. The W.H.O. statement said that epidemiologists were monitoring “more than 200 contacts” and that 60 were considered especially vulnerable.

It said the Ebola outbreak in Port Harcourt had “the potential to grow larger and spread faster than the one in Lagos.”

Discovered in 1976, Ebola is an aggressive virus that causes high fevers, extreme weakness and internal bleeding, with a fatality rate as high as 90 percent.

In Washington, the head of the W.H.O., Dr. Margaret Chan, said Wednesday at a news conference[https://unfoundation.app.box.com/s/8yqirr2uqxekdbue0th4] that there had been at least 3,500 Ebola cases, with more than 1,900 deaths. She called the outbreak “the largest and most severe and most complex we’ve ever seen in the nearly 40-year history of this disease.”

Last week, the organization, based in Geneva, said[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A10%22}] Ebola could afflict more than 20,000 people before it was brought under control.

Correction: September 6, 2014, Saturday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about concerns by the World Health Organization over a second Ebola cluster in Nigeria referred incorrectly to Lagos. It is Nigeria’s largest city, not its capital.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• It’s jobs day.

Economists expect the monthly labor report[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-05/jobs-day-guide-u-s-payrolls-participation-wages-and-hours.html] to show this morning that 223,000 nonfarm jobs were added in August, up from 209,000 in July.

The unemployment rate is forecast to edge down to 6.1 percent, after Thursday’s report that the number of Americans receiving jobless benefits fell to a seven-year low.

• Peace talks for Ukraine.

Ukraine, Russia and pro-Russian rebels are expected to begin discussions today in Belarus, despite reports of shelling[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/05/world/europe/05reuters-ukraine-crisis.html] near a port city in Ukraine.

President Obama and other leaders, at the final day of a NATO summit meeting in Wales, have prepared[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/world/as-nato-meets-ukraine-conflict-holds-center-stage.html] another round of sanctions against Russia if there is no deal.

• Pressing the Supreme Court.

Indiana and Wisconsin officials will go to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court ruling Thursday that unanimously rejected[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/us/us-appellate-court-overturns-same-sex-marriage-bans-in-wisconsin-and-indiana.html] a ban on same-sex marriage there.

Thirty-two states that either allow the practice or have banned it asked[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/05/us/ap-us-gay-marriage-.html] the Supreme Court to settle the issue.

• Pipeline at a crossroads.

The proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL oil pipeline, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, heads to the Nebraska Supreme Court[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-05/keystone-xl-route-runs-through-nebraska-top-court.html] today.

Though a decision is not expected for months, the court will hear arguments over the constitutionality of state law giving the governor the authority to approve the pipeline’s path.

• Ebola victim en route to U.S.

An American doctor who became infected while working in Liberia is expected to arrive today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/05/us/ap-us-ebola-americans.html] at a Nebraska hospital for treatment.

He is the third American aid worker sickened with the virus. The two others were treated and released over the summer.

• Adding to the Benghazi debate.

In a book to be released next week[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/world/africa/new-book-says-cia-official-in-benghazi-held-up-rescue.html], five commandos say the C.I.A. station chief in Benghazi, Libya, stopped them from intervening during the attack on the diplomatic mission there in 2012.

• Air traffic troubles.

About 250,000 travelers will be affected by a six-hour strike[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/lufthansa-pilots-to-stage-6-hour-strike-friday/2014/09/04/33d1255e-3449-11e4-9f4d-24103cb8b742_story.html] today by Lufthansa pilots.

The pilots, in a dispute over pay and early retirement, plan to disrupt short- and medium-range flights from Frankfurt, which is Germany’s busiest airport.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stock futures are down ahead of the August jobs report. European shares are mixed, and Asia ended mostly lower.

• Income inequality is growing, the Federal Reserve says. Its consumer finances report[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/business/economy/least-affluent-families-incomes-are-declining-fed-survey-shows.html] showed the most affluent Americans are richer while most other families are poorer since the Great Recession.

• Apple users will start to get alerts on their devices if a hack is detected, the company said[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/apple-says-it-will-add-new-security-measures-after-celebrity-hack/] after hackers broke into the accounts of a number of celebrities.

Separately, hackers breached security[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/us/hackers-breach-security-of-healthcaregov.html] at the website of the government’s health insurance marketplace, HealthCare.gov[https://www.healthcare.gov/], but did not steal any personal information.

NOTEWORTHY

• Staving off elimination.

Roger Federer fended off two match points and came back from two sets down to defeat Gaël Monfils in a five-set quarterfinal match[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/sports/tennis/us-open-2014-roger-federer-rallies-to-defeat-gal-monfils.html] Thursday night at the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

He’ll play Marin Cilic in the semifinals on Saturday, which also has the top-seeded Novak Djokovic facing Kei Nishikori.

Today’s women’s semifinals[http://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/schedule/index.html]: Shuai Peng vs. Caroline Wozniacki and the No. 1-seeded Serena Williams vs. Ekaterina Makarova.

• Forrest runs again.

A remastered cut of “Forrest Gump” will be released today in IMAX theaters across the country, celebrating the movie’s 20th anniversary.

The 1994 film, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, won six Academy Awards — best picture, best actor and best director among them.

• Bill Murray Day.

The Toronto International Film Festival will have screenings and tributes[http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/special-events/bill-murray-day-14] to characters played by Mr. Murray in three films — “Ghostbusters,” “Groundhog Day” and “Stripes.”

It all leads to the premiere today of his latest film, “St. Vincent.” (Winners of a Bill Murray costume contest[http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/special-events/bill-murray-day-14/bill-murray-day-contest] get a spot at the premiere.)

BACK STORY

While passengers in coach class have been fighting, literally, for leg space on domestic flights, the mile-high life keeps getting better for those riding in higher classes on Persian Gulf airlines.

Later this year, Etihad Airways, the flag carrier airline of the United Arab Emirates, will debut “The Residence,” a three-room suite in first-class sections of its Airbus A380 jets.

The 125-square-foot suite will have a living room with two couches, a 32-inch TV and a refrigerator, a bathroom with a shower, a bedroom with a double bed, and, yes, a private butler.

A one-way fare will cost about $20,000 from its base in Abu Dhabi to London.

Etihad’s nearby rival, the Dubai-based Emirates Airline, started the competition for excess in 2008 when it introduced first-class compartments with sliding doors, a lie-flat seat with mattress, a vanity, a personal minibar and a flat-screen TV.

Travelers in those seats now have access to private bathrooms with a shower on its A380 double-decker planes, where they can also spend the entire flight mingling at the bar and lounge. The fare from Dubai to Los Angeles is about $30,000.

Flights of fancy, indeed.

The Other Ebola Toll: African Economies

DAKAR, Senegal — Airlines have canceled their flights to the most Ebola-affected countries. Prices of staple goods are going up, and food supplies are dwindling. Border posts are being closed, expatriate workers are going home and national growth rates are projected to plummet.

Ebola — the reality and the hysteria over it — is having a serious economic impact on Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, three nations already at the bottom of global economic and social indicators. Aggravating both the financial and social consequences, these countries and their frightened African neighbors are enacting concentric circles of quarantines, cutting off neighborhoods, regions and even whole nations.

International medical authorities have warned against such practices, arguing that they will worsen suffering and deprivation, and do little to stop the spread of the disease.

But many African nations have gone ahead anyway, sealing borders, barring entry to residents of the affected countries, stopping their national carriers from flying to them, and even, in the case of Senegal, refusing to allow humanitarian flights with urgently needed supplies and medical personnel. That decision has infuriated aid agencies here in their West African hub. South Africa and Kenya, two of the continent’s economic heavyweights, have restricted entry to people coming from the Ebola zone.

For the worst-hit countries, “isolating and stigmatizing them and making it difficult to transport supplies, personnel and other resources” can only make things worse, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa, Luis Gomes Sambo, said at a meeting in Ghana last week.

For three nations that have only recently emerged from decades of war and political upheaval, Ebola has dealt a hard blow.

“After a decade of conflict we were set to restore the economy to its prewar status,” Amara Konneh, Liberia’s finance minister, said in an interview. “This outbreak is dealing a serious blow to all of our efforts. This is the biggest crisis we have faced since the end of our civil war.”

With sections of Liberia and Sierra Leone under quarantine and the borders Senegal and Guinea sealed, the movement of goods has slowed. National budgets are under strain, health care expenditures are rising, government revenues are dropping and agricultural production, especially in Sierra Leone, is taking a hit. South Africa is barring entry to non-South Africans who have been in the affected countries, and Kenya and Senegal are practicing similar measures.

“With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements of goods severely restricted, food insecurity is poised to intensify in the weeks and months to come,” the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s regional representative for Africa, Bukar Tijani, said in a statement Tuesday.

This week the United Nations warned that the price of cassava, a staple starch, increased 150 percent in Monrovia in the first week of August. In Sierra Leone rice, fish, palm oil and other basics have all risen in price, according to the country’s finance ministry.

Fear of Ebola has added uncertainty, recalling the worst period of the 1990s civil wars in West Africa. “People are thinking, ‘This is going to be as bad as the war,"’ said Rupert Day, who runs a British cocoa and coffee trading company in eastern Sierra Leone, at the heart of the Ebola zone.

“My staff said, `At least during the war, you knew when the rebels were coming,’ ” Mr. Day said. He has had to shut down much of his operation and lay off many in his staff of around 90.

Five months into the epidemic, World Bank officials said they are still working out the epidemic’s economic impact in light of a new World Health Organization estimate of 20,000 potential Ebola cases.

But the bank has already projected a drop in Guinea’s G.D.P. growth rate of at least one percent. In Liberia health care expenditures will now account for 25 percent of the government’s annual budget because of Ebola, instead of 8 percent, said the country’s finance minister. ArcelorMittal, which runs a major iron ore mining operation in Liberia, has delayed an expansion because contractors have evacuated 645 employees. In Sierra Leone, where the country’s main agricultural region has been hardest hit, the finance ministry wrote this week of the “devastating impact of the disease” on the country’s economy, predicting a 4 percent drop in growth.

The evidence is so far mostly anecdotal. But analysts, economists and officials agree: the shock is noticeable. “Very, very damaging,” said the president of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, in a statement last week, while the ratings agency Moody’s spoke of “significant economic and fiscal ramifications” from the epidemic across the region.

In Sierra Leone, where the finance ministry this week produced a detailed summary of Ebola’s economic implications, there will be fewer farmers to harvest cassava, cocoa and coffee in the country’s breadbasket. Villagers spoke of harvests being canceled this year because so many farmers had died, and the finance ministry predicted “the loss of a whole planting season.” It projected a one-third drop in agricultural output.

Roads normally well-traveled by produce-bearing vehicles are empty. At numerous checkpoints along the main road, crowds of small traders are backed up, refused passage by soldiers and the police guarding them.

In the capital, Freetown, patrons are sparse at hotels and restaurants catering to the expatriates who are vital for the economy. Hotel occupancy rates have dropped 40 percent.

There is already “scaling down” at the country’s three biggest manufacturers: a brewery, a bottling company and a cement plant, the finance ministry said. Construction on major road projects has been suspended following the evacuation of foreign staff members overseeing the projects. Mining, of iron and diamonds, most significantly, presents a mixed picture, with some companies expected to meet production targets, but diamond miners probably not, with a production drop in the latter sector of 10.4 percent.

In the eastern city of Kenema, population 600,000, the major city in Sierra Leone’s Ebola zone, the market stalls are still full of goods and produce, but it is unclear how much of the produce, on which the rest of the country depends, is flowing out. There is a “shortage of basic food items in the markets, especially in the urban areas,” the finance ministry said.

“You have a general sense that the economy is completely shut up,” said a leading official in the region, David Keili-Coomber, the paramount chief. Timber harvesting, a mainstay, is frozen because trucks can’t move the trees out due to roadblocks.

“People have a lot of timber stored up,” the chief said. “They can’t sell it.”

Farmers need bank loans to hire labor to clear the land around the cacao trees, but “because of Ebola they won’t give us loans,” Mr. Keili-Coomber said. “There is a general atmosphere of fear.”

Mr. Day, the manager of Tropical Farms, said the epidemic had stymied his operation. Buying cocoa and coffee beans has become nearly impossible. “We’re closed at the moment,” he said in an interview in Kenema. “We can’t take the risk of sending staff into the bush,” to buy beans from small-scale growers.

Many of them have died, in any case. “The guys from this village, or that village, have died,” Mr. Day continued. “That makes it really upsetting. I know these guys.”

World; Africa
Ebola Vaccine Could Be Ready by November, W.H.O. Says

Two vaccines against the deadly Ebola virus that is ravaging West Africa could be available as soon as November, the World Health Organization announced on Friday. It said the vaccines would be given first to health care workers at the greatest risk of exposure to the disease.

The organization also said that blood from Ebola patients who have recovered and serums derived from that blood should be exploited to treat the sick, and it called for investment in other experimental therapies to combat the virus, which has escalated into a major health crisis.

The announcements were made at the end of an extraordinary two-day meeting of nearly 200 experts at the organization’s Geneva headquarters. The meeting was called to expedite treatments for Ebola, which has killed nearly 2,100 people over the past six months. Nearly all of the deaths have been in three West African countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — but clusters of cases have also appeared recently in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.

Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, an assistant director general at the W.H.O., said in a telephone news conference after the Geneva meeting that the two vaccines still needed to undergo some preliminary safety checks, but that they should be available by November and would be administered to health care workers in the field first.

Dr. Kieny also said that drug therapies derived from the blood of Ebola survivors who are convalescent and doing well offered promise for combating the disease, a hemorrhagic fever whose fatality rate can run as high as 90 percent.

“What is available will be used in the field to treat real patients as soon as possible,” she said.

Dr. Kieny said the decision to bypass normal protocols for developing treatments in the interest of speed was “unprecedented, there is no doubt.”

A statement issued by the organization said that in view of the urgency of the Ebola outbreak, vaccines that have not yet been tested in humans but have shown promising results in animal tests should be expedited. “The international community is mobilizing to find ways to accelerate the evaluation and use of these compounds,” the statement said.

It also said the meeting’s participants had unanimously decided that “the use of whole-blood therapies and convalescent blood serums needs to be considered as a matter of priority.”

The W.H.O. meeting was part of a broader mobilization within the United Nations to combat the spread of Ebola. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, speaking to reporters in New York, called the mobilization “an international rescue call.”

“The number of cases is rising exponentially,” Mr. Ban said. “The disease is spreading far faster than the response. People are increasingly frustrated that it is not being controlled.”

Officials have said that $600 million in supplies will be required to fight the Ebola outbreak, the worst since the disease was first identified in 1976, and that as many as 20,000 people could be infected before it is brought under control.

Health
Many in West Africa Are Thought to Be Immune to Ebola, but Finding Them Won’t Be Easy

Although few medical experts realize it, part of the population in West Africa is immune to the Ebola virus, according to virologists who specialize in the disease.

Assuming they are correct, and if those people can be identified, they could be a great help in fighting the outbreak. Immune persons could safely tend the sick and bury the dead just as smallpox survivors did in the centuries before smallpox vaccine.

Also, antibodies could be harvested from their blood to treat new Ebola victims.

But many factors remain unclear, including which Africans have antibodies and how much antibody is needed to be protective. The biggest mystery is how the immunity arose, and there is a mix of explanations, like silent infections and fruit contaminated with bat saliva.

“It’s fair to say that some people are immune,” said Robert F. Garry Jr., a Tulane University expert in hemorrhagic fevers who works in Sierra Leone. “But we don’t know if it’s 1 percent or 2 percent or 20 percent.”

Right now, there are about 1,800 survivors of the current West African outbreak, all of whom are now immune, of course. But there may be many thousands more.

Small studies of household contacts of Ebola victims show that some people are infected without ever falling ill — perhaps because of some unknown genetic advantage.

But many Africans who have never seen a victim also have antibodies.

It is possible that some get low doses of virus by eating infected monkeys or bats that are undercooked.

“If someone got just two or three or four virus particles, if it enters through the mucus membranes in the mouth, yes, it’s plausible,” said Thomas W. Geisbert, a hemorrhagic fever expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “It would take a while for the virus to get going, and it’s a race with the clock. The immune system gets a chance to fight it off.”

Antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that attach to a virus and block it from invading cells, are the immune system’s first line of defense; the second line is white blood cells primed to recognize and digest the virus.

One of France’s leading Ebola experts says he believes many rural villagers are “vaccinated” by eating fruit gnawed by bats and contaminated with their saliva.

“We imagine that this is the main route,” said Dr. Eric M. Leroy, a veterinarian and virologist at the International Center for Medical Research in Franceville, Gabon. “But it is a hypothesis. We do not have the evidence.”

Determining the overall level of immunity in West Africa would require testing thousands of blood samples, an impossible task in the current chaos, especially when any slip of a needle or broken vial could fatally infect a health worker.

But in 2010, Dr. Leroy led such a study[http://www.plosone.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009126] in Gabon, a central African country that had four Ebola outbreaks from 1994 to 2002.

His teams took 4,349 blood samples in 220 randomly selected villages. They found that 15 percent of Gabon’s population had antibodies. But it varied widely: near the coast, only 3 percent did; in some jungle villages near the Congo border, up to 34 percent did.

Also, their antibody levels varied widely, and what level is protective is roughly known for lab monkeys, but not for humans.

“I don’t think we have a good idea of what constitutes a person who’s going to survive versus a person who’s going to succumb,” said Randal J. Schoepp, head of diagnostics at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Md., who led a study[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/7/13-1265_article] of blood from patients in a Sierra Leone hospital who were originally thought to have Lassa fever but did not. Nearly 9 percent had Ebola antibodies — and the samples dated from as far back as 2006, proving that the virus circulated long before this year’s outbreak.

Also, there is anecdotal evidence that some West Africans are resistant. Victims have relatives who never get sick. At the funeral of a traditional healer where 14 women got infected, at least 26 other mourners did not, Dr. Garry said, even though most probably touched the body.

There is firm evidence for silent infections.

In 2000, Dr. Leroy’s team studied[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2800%2902405-3/abstract] 24 Gabonese who had tended victims without ever falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation in their blood — meaning they had clearly been infected but had defeated the virus on their own.

A similar 1999 study[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/179/Supplement_1/S28.short] by American scientists in the Democratic Republic of Congo found similar results in five of 152 household contacts.

Those who are immune can donate blood containing antibodies[http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/04/ebola-experts-antibodies-survivors-blood-potential-cure] to be given to acutely ill patients, as was done for Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the first two Americans to get Ebola. He survived, although his Emory University doctors later said it was unclear whether the transfusion or an experimental drug, ZMapp, containing cloned antibodies, helped him at all.

Having those who are immune be caregivers and body-carriers makes sense, said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Protection.

“But we can’t count on their immunity,” he added. “They would still need full personal protective gear.”

Relying on such measures may be inevitable, Dr. Garry said, adding: “There’s no more ZMapp out there. It’s time for creative solutions.”

People avoid shaking hands here these days. The government is urging us not to. This is a serious matter in a country where a casual ‘‘hello’’ is downright rude and everyday greetings involve elaborate rituals based upon age, rank and even the state of the weather and the day of the week. Until about a month ago, it was by no means unusual for two friends, male as well as female, to remain hand-in-hand long after the protocol of the greeting was complete. Now not so. The Ebola scare has introduced a new awkwardness in social relations.

I first heard about the government’s call to avoid shaking hands from a priest at Mass three Sundays ago. It was not long after the Ebola virus had landed at the Lagos airport on July 20 in the person of Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian national and naturalized American citizen who had fled the Liberian capital Monrovia in hope of better treatment in Nigeria. He died five days later, by which time others had been infected, whereupon the Lagos state government, in collaboration with federal authorities, was quick to promulgate the message: Avoid physical contact, wash your hands frequently, and leave it to professionals to handle the dead.

While the country’s myriad radio stations broadcast the warnings, the authorities also asked churches and mosques to spread the word. (Most Nigerians are profoundly religious, and even many nonbelievers attend services, compelled as often as not by neighborly tradition rather than pietistic pressure.)

Working from the airline passenger list and hospital patient information, the authorities were quickly able to develop a comprehensive list of those who came into contact with Mr. Sawyer, and sent medical workers to locate those who might have been exposed to the virus. Some 200 people were put under observation until the 21-day incubation period had passed.

The authorities wanted to avoid the panic and mayhem that occurred in Liberia, and I have to say (though I usually find very little to praise in any government in Nigeria) that the speed and efficiency with which the Lagos State authorities reacted was exemplary. It seems as if the virus has been contained in this city of 20 million people. Agence France-Presse reported this week that 320 people suspected of exposure to the virus have been certified clear and released, and that another 41 remained under surveillance.

But the situation here and elsewhere is still uncertain. Despite all the precautions, one of the nurses who had treated Mr. Sawyer managed to escape a poorly guarded isolation ward and travel to the southern city of Enugu. Her name was never released, and it is not known why a professional nurse would suddenly take flight. In any case, the Enugu state government was quick to act. All of the 20 or so people she is known to have come into close contact with during her daylong trip from Lagos were located and placed under surveillance. Though the nurse, who apparently did not know she was infected, has since been reported to have died, there have been no reports — so far — that any of the people she came in contact with have been infected.

People in Port Harcourt, the oil capital in the south, have not been so lucky. Another suspected carrier also escaped from a Lagos isolation ward. Unlike the nurse, he allegedly knew he was infected. The doctor he consulted died of Ebola on Aug. 22, according to the World Health Organization. The doctor’s wife, who was flown to Lagos for treatment with her three-month-old baby, is also said to have died, according to local media reports. The infant’s fate is unknown. The authorities say the man who infected them may be tried on manslaughter charges. W.H.O. officials said this week that there were three confirmed cases of Ebola infection in the city, and that some 200 people remain under surveillance there.

The tendency to panic in the face of a deadly virus with no known cure is of course understandable, especially given the stories that have been coming out of Monrovia and elsewhere in West Africa. Foreigners from suspect countries are regarded warily. Just recently, the Lagos police, acting on a tip from fearful neighbors, raided a hotel and arrested 39 people, 35 of them from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The others were from Senegal, or Sierra Leone, depending upon what newspapers you read.

There have also been the inevitable quack cures, as well as traditional herbal remedies from folk doctors. In one bizarre case, claims that drinking and bathing in salt water would prevent infection flooded the Internet. A surprising number of people apparently believed it. Two are reported to have died from drinking salt water, and another 20 have been hospitalized.

Yet it is remarkable how calm most people have remained. Not that they aren’t taking precautions. The other day, for instance, a bank security guard offered me some of the hand disinfectant that most people seem to carry about these days, as did the owner of a local cafe I frequent.

There is little doubt that quick action by the authorities has generated a broad sense of civic responsibility that is rare in Nigeria. Even the federal government, otherwise so mired in corruption that it is helpless in the face of our home-grown Islamist insurgency, appears to have taken an atypically responsible approach. Despite the perennial distrust that most Nigerians have toward any government statement, the fact that the virus has so far been relatively contained has given this nation of skeptics hope that our leaders can govern, once they put their minds to it.

Nevertheless, fear remains that Ebola may yet spiral out of control. Another death was reported here this week, this one at the Lagos University teaching hospital. It is said, though not confirmed, that the health workers who attended to the victim were not wearing the recommended protective equipment.

This does not inspire confidence. Though United Nations officials have praised the way Nigeria has handled the threat so far, the nation’s health minister warns that ‘‘a few’’ more cases are likely. In the meantime, most of us are crossing our fingers, rubbing our hands with disinfectant, and carrying on as best we can. Meanwhile, newspaper cartoonists are having a field day dreaming up alternatives to the handshake.

In late May, a woman was admitted to the Kenema Government Hospital’s maternity ward in Sierra Leone after a bloody miscarriage. Augustine Goba, director of the hospital’s diagnostic laboratory and my longtime collaborator, ran a series of sensitive molecular tests and detected the first case of Ebola infection in the hospital, and one of the first confirmed cases in the country. Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone’s leading virologist, and other medical staff members isolated the patient and wore gloves, gowns and masks while treating her. She survived and made a full recovery, and no one else was infected.

Had this patient been one of the first cases of Ebola in West Africa, the hospital’s rapid diagnosis and expert handling might have helped control the outbreak quickly. But by May, the epidemic had already been spreading for six months, with hundreds of cases in neighboring Guinea and Liberia. When the hospital’s outreach team traveled to the patient’s village, they found that 14 people had already been infected, with what turned out to be two distinct versions of the virus. With each passing week, the number of confirmed cases in Sierra Leone grew, to 31, then 92, then 147, until the virus emerged in nearly every district of the country.

Kenema was well positioned to detect and treat Ebola because of its experience combating another deadly virus, Lassa, a project I started working on in 2008. As the hospital’s reputation for treating Lassa fever spread, more patients with unexplained fevers began to travel there. Rapid diagnosis of more people not only helped treat individual patients, but it could also uncover other unexpected pathogens hiding in the population, thus warning of outbreaks before they became global threats.

Just weeks before Ebola entered Sierra Leone, Dr. Khan and I joined colleagues from around the world in Nigeria to inaugurate the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Disease, a new venture that would enable monitoring of dangerous microbes across West Africa. The Ebola outbreak put our plans on hold. Soon after Dr. Khan returned to Kenema, the hospital became overwhelmed. He and the nurses were treating up to 80 patients at a time, working 16-hour days.

In the United States, my colleagues and I struggled to get aid and novel treatments to them, while we worked on sequencing the virus’s genome. Help did not come in time. While drafting a paper on the viral samples from Kenema, we began receiving devastating messages. Seven members of our team had themselves become infected with Ebola.

The constant flow of severely ill patients made it impossible for hospital staff members to protect themselves. Over the next few months, around 40 contracted the disease, including Mbalu Fonnie, a head nurse, who had worked there for 25 years, and Dr. Khan. By the middle of the summer, they were both dead.

It did not have to be that way. If diagnostic facilities like those at Kenema had been more widely available, the virus could have been caught as it emerged. A team of trained individuals, perhaps 50 people, could have been sent to the site of the outbreak before it spread, and stayed for 50 days after the last infection. Working with the local community, they could have isolated and treated the sick, buried the dead, traced each person’s contacts over the incubation period, performed outreach and education, and ensured food supplies, all while keeping themselves safe from infection. With the virus confined to one village, this 50-50 approach would have been a modest investment for the world.

Instead, the virus was allowed to escape the first village, and then to spread into four more countries. That missed opportunity has cost the lives of many people, including my good friends.

Failure to contain the virus now will be cataclysmic. Based on World Health Organization numbers, more people became infected with the Ebola virus in August than in all the earlier months of this epidemic combined. The W.H.O. predicts that Ebola may afflict 20,000 people before the outbreak ends, but that is only if the world mounts a prompt and enormous response. If we fail, that number will become 40,000, then 80,000, with no end in sight. Meanwhile, the virus is evolving as it spreads from human to human, raising the risk of it becoming even more contagious.

As the virus reaches new villages and now large cities, the challenge of full-scale containment increases by orders of magnitude. We need governments and international organizations to immediately send out response teams along the lines of the 50-50 model to all sites with active cases, and to train many more people on the ground.

At the same time, we need to find creative solutions. The National Institutes of Health and companies like Mapp Biopharmaceutical (the creator of the ZMapp medication) are now accelerating drug candidates and vaccines to clinical trials. Our own scientific team publicly released genome sequencing data so groups around the world could use them for better diagnostics, vaccines and therapies. And Nigerian celebrities, through the Nollywood Workshops’ Lens on Ebola campaign, are helping to spread health information on Facebook; we need more large-scale public service campaigns like this.

We must end this outbreak, both to honor the memory of those who have died, and to aid those still in the path of the virus. Then we can begin to work to ensure that such an outbreak never happens again. Had Ebola not intervened, Mr. Goba and Dr. Khan would have spent this past summer with me at Harvard and the Broad Institute, training in advanced molecular diagnostics for genomic surveillance.

Instead, Dr. Khan is gone. Mr. Goba remains on the front line in Kenema, where he has just given his good friend and colleague, the talented young scientist Mambu Momoh, a diagnosis of Ebola.

IF there is a traditional path to becoming an impact investor, it is the one taken by David Keller, who made a lot of money at a young age and retired from Cisco Systems in his 40s in 2002.

Mr. Keller got the idea of starting a family foundation and wondered if he could do more good by putting some of the foundation's money in investments that would have a positive social impact.

''With a modest family foundation, I knew I wasn't going to change the world,'' Mr. Keller, now 60, said. ''The whole idea of combining my values with investment returns made a lot of sense in the context of just small grant-making. I wanted all of it to work together.''

Twelve years later, 10 percent of his wealth is in so-called impact investments -- those made in companies, organizations and funds with the intention of generating a measurable, beneficial social and environmental impact.

While these investors are also seeking a financial return, the kinds of private investments Mr. Keller has made -- as in Generation Investment Management co-founded by Al Gore and David Blood -- tend to be risky in the same way other private equity investments are and less liquid than investments in public companies.

But interest in impact investing, which has been around for more than a decade, is growing and changing. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, some $3.74 trillion, or 11 percent, of total United States assets under management were placed in sustainable investments in 2012. This was a fivefold increase from 1995.

Financial firms have followed the money and are expanding what they offer to impact investors. Last year, Morgan Stanley started the Institute for Sustainable Investing with a goal of having $10 billion in client assets invested for social and environmental impact within five years.

Last month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch sold $12 million worth of ''green bonds'' from the World Bank, with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The proceeds are being used to fund projects like alternative energy programs.

And HIP Investor, which rates companies and municipal bonds on their societal impact, has started rating company 401(k) plans based on the sustainability ratings of their underlying investments. Of course, financial firms aren't doing this for purely altruistic reasons.

''We fundamentally believe that considering the sustainability and impact of your investments is a business opportunity for us and our clients,'' said Audrey Choi, chief executive of Morgan Stanley's Institute for Sustainable Investing. ''We also think it's a fundamentally strong value proposition to integrate thinking about large global issues into your investing decisions.''

Or as Andy Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, put it: ''We think impact investing is an idea whose time has come in mainstream wealth management.''

But as impact investing grows and the minimum amount needed to invest decreases, the path is becoming more like the one Jennifer Anderson took. A former investment adviser at SEI Investments, Ms. Anderson has worked since 2008 as a consultant to companies that want to do business in a more sustainable way. Yet it was only in the last year and a half that she felt comfortable enough with the investment products to begin putting her own money into them.

''There are now more options, transparency and information available,'' said Ms. Anderson, 41, a co-founder of Sustrana, a sustainability consultancy outside of Philadelphia.

She has taken all of the money locked up in retirement accounts from previous jobs -- less than $1 million -- and invested it in companies that are addressing the risks climate change poses to doing business in the future. ''I want to do something that will have an impact and that I'll feel good about,'' she said.

Such enthusiasm about an investment approach that has no accepted benchmark and, for the most part, still requires large minimums and long holding periods might seem frothy. And few people talk of impact investments' ability to outperform investments made with an eye solely on a company's profitability. (That's because they generally don't.)

But the problems the impact investments are trying to address, like clean drinking water or health concerns, are real to anyone following the Ebola outbreak in western Africa.

How should someone proceed who wants a solid return and is generally interested in doing good with her investments but not zealous about a cause?

The first rule of thumb is to go slowly. Mr. Keller said he felt that he probably missed some investments by being overly cautious, but at the same time he had no regrets and his portfolios continued to perform well.

''I viewed this as trying to move the industry by my own small demand. That made it more comfortable to take a patient approach and not panic if I had investments that weren't aligned with my mission.''

The second rule is to find a guide, often in the form of an adviser similarly interested in impact investing.

''I didn't always have people who were necessarily onboard with what my intentions were,'' said Patricia Rouen, 65, who has been focused on impact investing for 15 years. ''They were more or less humoring me. I realized I needed to find the investment professional who totally supported what I was doing.''

For Ms. Rouen, who lives in Hawaii, it helped to define how her investment and life views were going to mesh. Like many, she started by screening out traditional energy and oil companies and replaced them with clean energy alternatives. But over time she realized she needed to broaden her view to companies that might not seem green but were operating in a way that was better than their peers.

Coca-Cola is an example of this kind of strategy. To some investors, the company sells calorie-laden sugary drinks around the world; to others it is a company that understands the need for clean water and is working to protect water sources.

And that leads to the need to be expansive in the way people, particularly those with less wealth, assess impact investments. R. Paul Herman, chief executive of HIP Investor Ratings and president of HIP Investor, said his firm recently began assessing 401(k) plans for their sustainability ratings. He said having rated 4,500 companies and 4,000 municipal bond issues, the firm was able to assess the underlying assets owned by the plans.

These ratings are ''a way to have the broadest definition of impact that is meaningful to you,'' he said. ''Every investment has a sustainability or impact profile.''

While the companies and municipal bond issues are rated for obvious metrics, like carbon usage and water efficiency, they are also screened for criteria like employee turnover, chief executive pay, board diversity and legal issues. By these measures, Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company, ranks high, while Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's investment vehicle, ranks low as much for some of its holdings as its hands-off approach to managing the companies it owns stakes in.

Of course overlaying all of these impact investments is the returns. They vary depending on how an investor defines the impact investments, from screening out certain companies all the way up to making direct investments in cutting-edge companies.

But there is generally a trade-off. Steven Tiell, 36, a technology executive at Accenture, said four years ago he and his wife decided to invest their savings with an impact focus.

''We can't say this portion of our portfolio can just do good,'' he said. ''We're still building wealth. We needed it to grow over time.''

He said they had achieved growth through traditional investments in stocks and bonds but also through tailored exchange-traded funds, like one focused on investing in water.

''If you compared it against the Vanguard Target Retirement Fund over the past three years, my portfolio hasn't done as well,'' he said. ''But it still has positive returns that I'm happy with.''

Of course, the bet that these investors are making is that the industry they have chosen is developing and there will be more options for all investors.

Two Vaccines to Protect Against Ebola Could Be Available Within Weeks

Two potential vaccines against the deadly Ebola virus ravaging West Africa could be available as soon as November and would first be given to health care workers most at risk of exposure to the disease there, the World Health Organization announced on Friday.

The organization also announced that blood from recovered Ebola patients and serums derived from that blood should be used to treat the sick, and it said treatment centers should quickly begin testing other experimental therapies to combat the viral disease, which has escalated into a devastating health crisis.

''We have to change the sense there is no hope in this situation to a realistic hope,'' Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, an assistant director general, told a telephone news conference at the conclusion of a two-day meeting at the organization's Geneva headquarters aimed at expediting the prevention and cure of Ebola. The disease has now killed nearly 2,100 people over the past six months. Nearly all the deaths have been in three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- but clusters of Ebola patients have recently been found in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.

Dr. Kieny said nearly 200 scientists, ethicists and clinicians from around the world had reached a consensus in identifying the most promising vaccines and potential treatments and developing strategies for testing them. The two vaccines, which have not yet been studied in humans, are set to undergo initial tests of their safety and immune system effects beginning this month in a small number of volunteers in Britain, the United States and Mali, which borders Guinea, where the outbreak emerged.

If the initial safety tests were encouraging, the vaccines, still under evaluation, should immediately be offered in stages to health workers and other ''front line staff'' in West Africa, according to a prioritization plan set by a panel of ethicists convened earlier this summer by the W.H.O., Dr. Kieny said.

The pace of testing, and the bypassing of normal protocols to develop the vaccines, is ''absolutely unprecedented,'' Dr. Kieny said. She said that the vaccine testing protocol was approved in Mali within days and that there had been a ''change of all the processes that we know, for this particular Ebola outbreak.''

While it was likely that patents had been filed and intellectual property rights applied to some of the vaccines and treatments, she said, ''so far we've seen absolutely no problem and no barrier to the use of these.''

Dr. Kieny stressed the importance of carefully monitoring results to ensure that vaccines were not harmful and did not paradoxically make people more susceptible to the disease. ''We must also be conscious about that -- rollout must happen as quickly as possible but step by step.''

Upward of 10,000 doses of one vaccine, based on a modified chimpanzee cold virus, may be available by the end of the year, according to materials produced by the W.H.O. The vaccine is being tested by its developers, GlaxoSmithKline and the United States National Institutes of Health, and a British consortium. An initial 800 doses of the second vaccine were donated by the Canadian government to the W.H.O., Dr. Kieny said.

''I would love to be the first African'' to receive one of the vaccines, Dr. Samba Sow, director general at the Center for Vaccine Development in Mali, told the news conference.

Participants at the conference also concluded that countries should be assisted in offering patients transfusions of whole blood, plasma, or so-called convalescent serum produced from the blood of people who have survived Ebola. ''A blood-derived product can be used now, and this can be very effective in terms of treating patients,'' Dr. Kieny said.

However, carrying out such efforts will require strong international support, given that Ebola treatment centers are short of staff and overwhelmed with far more patients than they can handle, leaving care at the most basic level.

Such blood transfusions were used with apparent success in several patients during the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Oyewale Tomori, a professor of virology at Redeemer's University in Nigeria, said at the news conference that blood was being collected for this purpose from five Ebola survivors in Nigeria. It was reported that Dr. Kent Brantly, a missionary doctor who contracted Ebola in Liberia and recovered, received a blood transfusion from a patient that he had treated before being evacuated to the United States.

A handful of other potential Ebola treatments selected for their promise, including the antibody mixture known as ZMapp, should be evaluated in treatment centers in West Africa as protocols are developed and doses become available, the W.H.O. said. Each patient would be informed of the risks and benefits, and the effects would be evaluated.

The meeting in Geneva was part of a broader mobilization within the United Nations system to counter the spread of Ebola. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, speaking to reporters in New York, called the mobilization ''an international rescue call.''

''The number of cases is rising exponentially,'' he said. ''The disease is spreading far faster than the response. People are increasingly frustrated that it is not being controlled.''

W.H.O. officials recently estimated it would cost $600 million to fight the Ebola scourge, the worst in the nearly 40-year history of the disease, and that 20,000 people could be infected before it is brought under control. ''One of the things driving fear and panic in the communities and the world is the belief there is no treatment,'' Dr. Kieny said.

Sierra Leone to Impose 3-Day Ebola Quarantine

DAKAR, Senegal — With West African governments increasingly desperate to contain an ever-quickening Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic, Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] has decreed a stringent new measure confining residents to their homes later this month.

For three days, from Sept. 19 to Sept. 21, “everybody is expected to stay indoors” as 7,000 teams of health and community workers go door-to-door to root out hidden Ebola patients, a government spokesman, Abdulai Bayraytay, said Saturday from the capital, Freetown. The military and police will enforce the measure, Mr. Bayraytay added.

“It’s clear that we have pockets of resistance, in terms of denial,” he said. “People are still harboring loved ones at home.”

“Sometimes neighbors are calling us” with information about Ebola patients, he added. “That gave us the clear indication that people are still harboring patients.”

International health organizations have generally been opposed to such coercive measures in fighting the epidemic, arguing that they add a punitive element, increase hardships to communities hit by the virus and diminish needed trust and cooperation.

On Saturday, a representative of one agency voiced similar reservations about Sierra Leone’s new policy, expressing doubts that it would be effective. He suggested that the government’s initial plan — to educate communities that may be harboring patients about the risks of such behavior — had mutated into something harsher. He asked not to be quoted by name because of the delicacy of the matter.

The group Doctors Without Borders, which has been working in the region, warned that the lockdown could make matters worse. “It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers,” it said Saturday, according to news agency reports.

The World Health Organization said Friday that the Ebola death toll in West Africa had topped 2,000 — the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected deaths is now 2,097 — with no sign that is abating. Of the three countries most affected, Sierra Leone has the third highest number of deaths, at 491.

“In the last two weeks, the incidence in Sierra Leone has remained very high, with more than 150 cases reported each week,” the health organization said on Friday. Cases continue to increase even in Freetown, where Ebola had so far been less virulent than elsewhere.

As aid agencies plead for more hands-on help in the field, Mr. Bayraytay said Saturday that incentive payments of $150 per week would be given to burial workers and nurses fighting the epidemic, thanks to donations from the World Bank, the United Nations and others.
