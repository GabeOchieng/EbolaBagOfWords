AN American doctor who was flown back to the US for treatment with an experimental drug after he contracted Ebola has recovered.

EMORY University Hospital planned to hold a news conference on Thursday morning to discuss both patients' discharge.

Alison Geist, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse, said she did not know the exact time Dr Kent Brantly would be released but confirmed it would happen on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse, said in a statement that Brantly has recovered.

"Today I join all of our Samaritan's Purse team around the world in giving thanks to God as we celebrate Dr Kent Brantly's recovery from Ebola and release from the hospital," Graham's statement said.

Brantly and Nancy Writebol were flown out of the west African nation of Liberia earlier this month and have been getting treatment for the deadly disease in an isolation unit at the hospital. The two were infected while working at a missionary clinic outside Liberia's capital.

The Ebola outbreak has killed 1350 people and counting across West Africa.

Ebola is only spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick people experiencing symptoms.

DAVID Nabarro, a British physician appointed by the UN, is headed to west Africa to work on "revitalising the health sectors" in the Ebola-hit countries.

DAVID Nabarro, a British physician appointed last week by UN Secretary Ban Ki-moon, said he would focus on "revitalising the health sectors" in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

"One of the major issues is that health sectors and health services in countries affected by Ebola have really suffered," Nabarro told reporters in New York ahead of his trip.

Nabarro will travel to Monrovia, Freetown, Conakry and Abuja as part of his overall mission to co-ordinate the global response to the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola.

His visit comes at a time when some of the affected countries are struggling to contain the spread of the killer disease.

Violence erupted in an Ebola quarantine zone in Liberia's capital on Wednesday when soldiers opened fire and used tear gas on protesting crowds as they evacuated a state official and her family.

Four residents were injured in the clashes that flared in Monrovia's West Point slum which has been sealed off as part of tough new security measures aimed at containing the deadly virus.

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has ordered a nighttime curfew and the quarantine of West Point and Dolo Town, to the east of the capital.

Residents of West Point, where club-wielding youths stormed an Ebola medical facility on Saturday, reacted with fury to the crackdown, hurling stones and shouting at the security forces.

"It is inhumane," resident Patrick Wesseh said. "They can't suddenly lock us up without any warning, how are our children going to eat?"

Liberia, with 576 deaths from 972 diagnosed cases, has seen the biggest toll among the four west African countries hit by Ebola.

Deaths from the epidemic that has swept through west Africa since March now stand at 1350 after a surge of 106 victims in just two days, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Fears that the virus could spread to other continents have seen flights to the region cancelled, and authorities around the world have adopted measures to screen travellers arriving from affected nations.

Vietnam said Wednesday it had released two Nigerian air travellers from isolation after their fevers subsided. In Myanmar a local man is still undergoing tests after arriving from Guinea with a fever.

Countries throughout Africa and beyond remain on high alert, with the Equatorial Guinea airline, Ceiba Intercontinental, the latest to suspend flights to the whole region.

From its initial outbreak in Guinea - where 396 people have died so far - the virus spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, overwhelming inadequate public health services already battling common deadly diseases such as malaria.

Straining the situation even further, several top officials leading the fight have lost their lives to the disease.

A doctor who treated Nigeria's first Ebola patient was named among the dead on Tuesday, taking the death toll in Africa's most populous country to five.

Efforts to contain the epidemic have also run up against local distrust of outside doctors, and stories of aid workers carrying the infection.

WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib noted "encouraging signs" in Nigeria and Guinea, where prevention measures and work to trace lines of infection were starting to take effect.

The Nigerian outbreak has been traced to a sole foreigner, a Liberian-American who died in late July in Lagos. All subsequent Nigerian victims had direct contact with him.

In Sierra Leone, where 374 people have died, the outbreak has also been traced back to one person: a herbalist in the remote eastern border village of Sokoma.

No cure or vaccine is currently available for Ebola, which is spread by close contact with body fluids, meaning patients must be isolated.

Given the extent of the crisis, the WHO has authorised largely untested treatments - including ZMapp and the Canadian-made VSV-EBOV vaccine, whose possible side effects on humans are not known.

Three doctors in Liberia who had been given the experimental US-made ZMapp are reportedly responding to the treatment.

Researchers also said Wednesday an experimental drug treatment can help monkeys survive an otherwise deadly infection with a tropical virus called Marburg, which is similar to Ebola.

LIBERIAN riot police have sealed the offices of the National Chronicle newspaper.

POLICE spokesman Sam Collins said the paper's criticisms could "plunge the country into confusion" when the government is struggling to contain an Ebola outbreak.

Philibert Brown's National Chronicle has often accused President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's government of corruption and on Wednesday it called for the government to step down.

Brown has been ordered to report for questioning on Friday.

Sirleaf's government has come under stiff criticism for its record on press freedoms.

Sirleaf has signed the Declaration of Table Mountain, which calls for the Africa-wide repeal of defamation and "insult" laws, but multiple libel convictions have been handed down since she came to power in 2006.

A SECOND Sierra Leonean doctor has died after contracting the deadly Ebola virus, health officials say.

EBOLA has killed more than 1000 people in a West African outbreak that has also hit Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria. Many of the dead are health workers, who are often working with inadequate supplies and protection.

Sidie Yayah Tunis, director of communications for the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, announced that Modupeh Cole died on Wednesday.

The US-trained Cole was one of the lead doctors working in the Ebola isolation ward in Connaught Hospital in Freetown, the capital.

Cole's death comes on the heels of that of another physician who was leading Sierra Leone's fight against Ebola, Sheik Humarr Khan.

States of emergency are in effect across overwhelmed western African nations as the death toll from the ebola epidemic nears 1000 and the World Health Organisation considers global travel restrictions to halt its spread.

Soldiers in Liberia’s Grand Cape Mount province — one of the worst-affected areas — set up road blocks to limit travel to the capital Monrovia, where lawmakers gathered to ratify a 90-day state of emergency as bodies reportedly lay unburied in the city’s streets.

Two towns in east Sierra Leone, Kailahun and Kenema, were put under quarantine on Thursday, a government spokesman said, as nightclubs and entertainment venues across the country were ordered shut.

Public sector doctors in Nigeria suspended a month-long strike with fears rising that the virus is taking hold in Africa’s most populous country. The deadly tropical disease has already killed two and infected five others in Lagos.

Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives and infected more than 1700 people since breaking out earlier this year. WHO is debating whether to declare the latest outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” at a crisis closed-door session in Geneva overnight and is expected to announce new measures, including possible global travel restrictions.

As African nations struggled with the scale of the epidemic, the scientists who discovered the virus in 1976 have called for an experimental drug being used on two infected Americans to also be made available to African victims.

One of the three, Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said “African countries should have the same opportunity” to use ZMapp, which is made by US company Mapp Pharmaceuticals.

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

Spain flew home a 75-year-old Catholic priest, Miguel Pajares, the first European victim of the epidemic, on Thursday as Britain gave a further £3 million to shore up Sierra Leone’s beleaguered health system.

In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Liberians should expect certain rights to be suspended as the country imposes “extraordinary measures” necessary for “the very survival of our state”. People from infected zones must not be allowed to carry the virus into non-infected zones, Information Minister Lewis Brown said.

The Liberian government complained that its citizens were being harassed and stereotyped in Nigeria following the death in a Lagos hospital of one of its citizens infected with ebola.

In Sierra Leone, which has the most confirmed infections, 800 troops were sent to guard hospitals treating ebola patients, an army spokesman said.

Meanwhile, the two infected Americans, who worked for aid agencies in Liberia, have shown signs of improvement since being flown to a specialist hospital in Georgia.

There is no proven treatment or cure for ebola and the use of the experimental drug has sparked an ethical debate.

US President Barack Obama said it was too soon to send the experimental drugs to western Africa.

Nigeria’s Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu has asked about getting the drug, but Spain is cautious about the serum.

“We do not know of the scientific evidence, the scientific basis, the results that this serum can provide,” Antonio Alemany, director general of primary health care for the Madrid region, said.

“Obviously, if the serum is effective then the Spanish government will make contact to obtain it.” US regulators meanwhile loosened restrictions on another experimental drug, which may allow it to be tried on infected patients in west Africa, the company said.

The Canada-based company Tekmira said the US Food and Drug Administration changed the classification of its drug TKM-Ebola from full clinical hold to partial hold.US health authorities also warned ebola’s spread to the US was “inevitable” due to the nature of airline travel, but that any outbreak was not likely to be large. The worsening outbreak prompted the US to order home the families of embassy staff in Liberia.

CANBERRA DOCTOR KAMALINI LOKUGE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH MSF IN AFRICA’S EBOLA WAR, WRITES ANDREW CARSWELL

A battered old red pick-up rolls into the dirt carpark, its suspension creaking under the weight of a few passengers too many.

Its occupants unwittingly, and perhaps unjustly given the mercy dash they have just undertaken, are likely doomed. Amid them lays a desperate woman. She is vomiting. Her diarrhoea is unrelenting. She is drenched in sweat from an intense fever that is thrusting her frail body into constant delirium. She’s on the very cusp of life.

She has ebola.

Canberra doctor Kamalini Lokuge watches grimly as a throng of healthcare workers in protective medical gowns and masks swarm the pick-up and hastily carry the stricken 40-something woman away, their urgency giving a false sense of hope that this is a situation that can somehow be fixed.

It is futile, but nonetheless they push on, heads bowed, committed to doing anything they can to save her. “It was scary for the whole family. I remember the look on her face. She didn’t want to come in when she initially fell ill and she had been hiding for days,’’ Dr Lokuge said. “She was very sick. She looked so scared.” She will be dead in three days. Three days of hellish torment in a make-shift white isolation tent in a converted carpark of a dilapidated Conakry hospital in Guinea, the 13th poorest country on the planet.

With the woman safely transported into the village of tents under the shade of a gigantic flowering tree, Dr Lokuge’s attention turns back to the red pick-up. Pairs of horrified eyes stare back at the Medecins Sans Frontieres volunteer staff.

Their chances of infection are considerable, not just for the close proximity they have just endured with the planet’s most notorious disease in the back of a beat-up vehicle, but for the fact they have cared for and sheltered this ill family member for days. Weeks.

This is the fight Dr Lokuge, an Australian National University professor, is well used to. Having donated her valuable time and put her life at immense risk to aid stricken communities on whose doors the demon of ebola came knocking, the Sri Lankan-born epidemiologist knows the obstacles are not the disease itself. That, perhaps incomprehensively given the level of panic the mere mention of the name evokes, is the least of their problems.

It’s the locals. Primarily, their distrust of medical help, of Western intervention, of people in yellow coats and NGO trucks. Dr Lokuge spent three weeks with MSF crisscrossing the trustless, dicey suburbs of Conakry in April convincing family after family to give up harbouring their ill and trust the medical community — lest the disease run rampant. To do so she had to put her own life at risk.

She arrived in the Guinean capital when the ebola outbreak was beginning its deadly march from its genesis near the country’s wild interior on the border with Liberia, to its major cities. It has now claimed 930 lives with more than 1700 cases spread across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Health organisations fear the plague could soon leapfrog from its traditional heartland of Africa into neighbouring continents.

“To control these outbreaks people need to trust the healthcare workers,’’ she told Inside Edition this week. “One of the first families I went out to, we had had a patient admitted who had died the day he was admitted and we weren’t sure how he got infected. So I went out with one of the Ministry of Health staff to speak to the family about what had happened.

“They were really angry and suspicious when we arrived. And they wanted us to leave. We sat with them and spent a lot of time speaking with them about what had happened and telling them who we were and why we were there, what happens in the treatment centre, how the disease it transmitted, why it was good to bring sick people to the treatment centre.” That afternoon, the head of the household brought two young men who were ill into the treatment centre. The next day he brought in two more.

Even with the progression of the outbreak and preached education, that fear of medical help remains prevalent in many western African communities, with families throwing their dead and gravely ill on to the streets on the Liberian capital Monrovia this week, in preference of calling for help and subjecting themselves to the unknowns of an isolation ward.

This is why Dr Lokuge does the unthinkable when in the field. There is no team of yellow suits that escorts her into afflicted villages and suburbs tormented by ebola. No NGO-badged convoy of speeding SUVs. In plain clothes and driving a rusty blue pick-up, the ANU doctor hunts down families that may have had contact with suffers, knocking on the doors of compounds that unbeknown to her could be a cesspit of contagion; lifting back the woven flaps of huts and dilapidated brick slums to peer into a room that could be hiding a near-death, blood-oozing killer.

“I met plenty of people who know they probably had the disease, going from house to house talking to people, and once you start talking people come forward and admit ‘yes, I am sick’ and you explain to them what needs to happen, you can see they are terrified,” she says. “We don’t go dressed in full protective equipment as ebola is not particularly transmissible, you have to have close contact with someone who is sick, and so when we go out, we go dressed normally. If we find someone who is sick, then we call the teams. To get people to trust they need to have knowledge, they need to have an understanding of the disease and it takes time, it takes work.” From her ANU office in Canberra, Dr Lokuge initially deflects when asked about the outrageous risks, but then admits it often played on her mind. Then she deflects again, pointing instead to the heroics of local healthcare nurses and doctors who often take the brunt of such outbreaks.

“While (the risk of disease) is always in the back of your mind, I don’t see it much differently to the emergency service workers who respond to bushfires. It’s just like helping your neighbours out when they need help. You go to these outbreaks and there are always local health staff, even before the arrival of groups with proper medical equipment, who continue to try and do their job under very dangerous circumstances, and that is incredible.”Getting on a plane, giving up the comfort of home and your annual leave, thrusting yourself into the dark heart of western Africa’s ebola crisis, walking into homes of stricken sufferers, extending an arm of love to the world’s most maligned, forgotten people, and risking your life for them … that — Dr Lokuge — is just as incredible.

US on red alert for ebola

ATLANTA THE US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has placed its emergency operations centre in Atlanta on the highest response level because of the worsening ebola outbreak in West Africa.

The move comes as more cases of the deadly virus have migrated from rural villages and towns in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to urban areas in Nigeria, where it could spread more quickly.

It was the first time the CDC had issued a Level 1 alert since 2009. That alert five years ago was in response to the outbreak of H1N1 flu. The number of ebola deaths in the region has reached 932, according to the World Health Organisation, while the number of confirmed or suspected cases has now reached 1711.

The World Health Organisation convened a special summit of international experts in Geneva yesterday to determine if the outbreak constitutes a “public health emergency of international concern’’.

If so, WHO will recommend temporary measures to reduce the international spread of the disease.

Next week WHO will convene a panel of medical ethicists to explore using experimental treatments for ebola patients in West Africa.

Ebola only spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids. It cannot be transmitted through airborne particles.

While no vaccine is available, several are being developed. They include ZMapp, an experimental immune system booster made by Mapp Bio­pharmaceutical of San Diego.

Americans Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol, who had been working with patients in West Africa and were stricken with ebola, have been hospitalised at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and reportedly have been treated with ZMapp, even though the drug has never been tested in humans.

“We don’t even know if it works,” said Dr Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, which helped fund ­research that led to the drug’s development.

The drug is a cocktail of three antibodies engineered to recognise ebola and bind to infected cells so that the immune system can kill them.

People’s immune systems make antibodies to fight off various diseases, and attempts to cull those antibodies — from the blood of people who survive an illness, or from animals — date back to the 19th century and early experimental diphtheria treatments.

Using modern techniques to fight ebola, scientists culled antibodies from laboratory mice, Dr Fauci said, and ZMapp’s maker now grows the antibodies in tobacco plants and then purifies them. That process is “painfully slow”, he added, saying the manufacturer had told the government it would take two to three months to produce even “a modest amount’’.

US President Barack Obama said yesterday the US would not send supplies of ZMapp to the epicentre of the outbreak in West Africa because it was unclear if the drug was actually helpful.It was also “premature”, Mr Obama said, to discuss fast-tracking the approval process for ebola drugs until more information about their effectiveness was known.

MACHINES that can detect raised temperatures in passengers arriving in Australia are not being used by our international airports, despite the global ebola scare.

Thermal imaging scanners were bought for eight international airports in Australia in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic. But the ebola outbreak has raised concerns Australian airports are not doing enough to screen arrivals, particularly those from West Africa.

One of the first symptoms of the virus is fever. Concerns about lax airport screening was highlighted by Australian businessman Christopher Cooper this week.

He was not asked a single question about his health on his return to Sydney from Lagos in Nigeria, where an airline passenger was confirmed as having ebola two days before.

A spokeswoman for the Federal Health Department said there was no requirement for Australian airports to undertake special screening.WORLD P23

AN Australian businessman has questioned the strength of Australia’s quarantine procedures after breezing through customs on his return from ebola-plagued west Africa.

Christopher Cooper flew in to Sydney from Lagos, Nigeria, via Johannesburg last Friday.

Despite going through Lagos Airport two days after a man who was confirmed as having the deadly ebola virus disease, Mr Cooper said he was asked no questions about his health.

“Lagos is the filthiest ­airport,” Mr Cooper, from Queensland, said. “There’s dust and dirt everywhere and the toilets are a ­disgrace. They haven’t lifted their game whatsoever.

“You can’t help compare it with the SARS outbreak in Asia (in 2003), when every handrail and handle was constantly being sanitised by airport staff.” He made a point of not using the toilets at Lagos but was still surprised not to be asked any questions about his wellbeing when he passed through ­customs in Sydney.

“There didn’t even seem to be any infra-red cameras ­taking your temperature like they do at Asian airports,” Mr Cooper said.

“Because I answered yes to having been in Africa in the past six days I was pulled aside but the customs agent only ­inquired about my yellow fever vaccination card.” Australian border protection authorities have given ­assurances every effort is being made to ensure ebola does not reach our shores.

A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman said the World Health Organisation did not currently advise special screening of passengers at entry points, or any travel or trade restrictions.The highly infectious ebola virus has killed 826 people in west Africa since February.

THE return to the US of two aid workers infected with Ebola will be the first time the disease has entered the country.

IT will be the first time anyone infected with the disease has been brought into the country.

One was to arrive on Saturday in a private jet outfitted with a portable tent designed for transporting patients with highly infectious diseases, doctors said at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, where they will be treated. The second is to arrive a few days later.

US officials are confident the patients can be treated without putting the public in danger.

Ebola, which has no cure, is spread through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids from an infected person, not through the air. The outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the largest ever recorded, has sickened more than 1300 people and killed more than 700 this year.

The two Americans - Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol - worked for US missionary groups in Liberia at a hospital that treated Ebola patients. The State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are assisting the groups in their transfer.

The government is working to ensure any Ebola-related evacuations "are carried out safely, thereby protecting the patient and the American public", State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement released on Friday.

A defence department spokesman said Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, would be used for the transfer.

Brantly and Writebol were in serious condition and were still in Liberia on Friday, according to the US-based charity Samaritan's Purse, which is paying for their transfer and medical care.

The two-bed Emory isolation unit opened 12 years ago. It was designed to handle workers from the CDC if they became infected while working on a dangerous, infectious germ.

It was one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people who might have been exposed to dangerous viruses, said Dr Eileen Farnon, a Temple University doctor who worked at the Atlanta-based CDC and led teams investigating past Ebola outbreaks in Africa.

He said the possibility of people contracting the deadly virus in West Africa and falling sick in the UK was being contemplated by health officials.

But he said it was ‘most unlikely’ that ebola could spread within the UK because of ‘frankly different’ standards of infection control in this country.

An epidemic of the disease, which has no vaccine and there is no cure, has swept West Africa, killing more than 670 people.

Missionary Nancy Writebol, 60, remains in quarantine after contracting Ebola in Liberia, where she and her husband David have been working with aid group Serving in Mission. She is one of two Americans battling the deadly virus.

“She’s stable,” Mrs Writebol’s son Jeremy said.

“As dad put it, she’s fighting through it, and continuing to express a few symptoms, but she’s able to move around on her own, and they’re getting lots of fluids into her.” Meanwhile, volunteers are not being discouraged from working in Africa despite the deadly ebola virus with many believing they should go where “God needs them”.

Husband David has not been diagnosed with ebola, and has only been allowed to see his wife through a window.American doctor Kent Brantly, 33, is being treated at a hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, after also contracting ebola.

A TOP ebola specialist has died and an American missionary is fighting for his life as the worst ever outbreak of the disease continues unabated.

The UK also had a scare with the disease when a man who had flown from Nigeria to Birmingham via Paris was rushed to hospital with ebola -type symptons. He was given the all-clear last night.

In western Africa, Sierra Leone’s chief ebola expert Dr Sheik Humarr Khan was confirmed dead by health ministry officials.

Dr Khan had treated more than 100 patients with the disease and had been praised as a national hero in Sierra Leone.

Another medic, Texas-trained missionary Kent Brantly, is fighting for his life in an isolation unit on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia, after contracting the disease.

Dr David Mcray, a director at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, where Brantly completed a four-year residency, said Dr Brantly’s prognosis was grave.

Meanwhile, Pan-African airline ASKY announced it would suspend flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The move follows the death of one of its passengers from the virus after he had travelled from Liberia to Nigeria.

The 40-year-old man died in Lagos on Friday in Nigeria’s first confirmed ebola death.

ASKY also announced it would screen all passengers travelling from Guinea. Nigerian carrier Arik also said it was halting direct flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone.The virus, hitchhiking across borders for the first time aboard airliners, could spell new flight restrictions aimed at containing outbreaks, the International Civil Aviation Organisation Secretary General Raymond Benjamin said.

RED ALERT FOR KILLER

IT’S deadly, it’s on the loose, and Australian health authorities are concerned the frightening disease ebola could be headed our way.

Customs and border sec-urity around the nation have been placed on red alert following the rapid spread of ebola, a highly infectious disease that has killed almost 700 people across several west African countries.

The federal government’s chief health experts met with border protection agencies on Tuesday to formulate a plan to ramp up the monitoring of incoming passengers at airports, as the world’s leading health authorities expressed concern that the disease could leap-frog out of Africa for the first time.

That bolstering of security was followed by a meeting of the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia yesterday, headed by Australia’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Baggoley, key infectious diseases doctors, and all state and territory health authorities. Professor Baggoley told The Daily Telegraph delegates had discussed the possibility of the disease reaching Australia and how to respond.

“Everyone is on alert, and we have the best border protection for infectious disease system in the world,’’ he said.

More than 200 Australians have registered with the government’s Smartraveller website as currently travelling or working in the African nations affected by the outbreak, with the majority based in Nigeria.

A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said the government had been in contact with each of those travellers and expats to update them with the latest information on ebola.

Meanwhile, health authorities in the UK met with British Prime Minister David Cameron and detailed their grim assessment of the threat to the country, with Dr Brian McCloskey, the director of global health at Public Health England, describing the outbreak as the most “acute health emergency” currently facing Britain.

Professor Cameron Simmons, a molecular biologist and infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, maintains the threat of an epidemic beyond the disease’s traditional shores of Africa hinges on whether one ebola case was contained in the city of Lagos.

Liberian finance ministry employee Patrick Sawyer died in the Nigerian port city last week after contracting the disease from his sister.

Despite showing early symptoms, Mr Sawyer flew on a commercial flight from Liberia to Nigeria, via Togo, dying five days later in Africa’s most populous city.

“If ebola got into one of those high-density, low-­socio-economic urban hubs like Lagos, it would be pretty difficult to stop,’’ Professor Simmons said. “Lagos is a transit hub to western Eur-ope, into the Middle East and up and down Africa, and that is a large concern.

“Whether it comes to Australia, you never say zero, but a sensible risk assessment of the likelihood of ebola presenting to health care practitioners is remote.

“But nonetheless the medical community and health agencies need to be aware and heightened when it comes to seeing a patient with fever in someone from west Africa or with a recent travel history.’’ The outbreak of ebola, a virus that causes victims to eventually bleed profusely from the eyes, mouth and ears, is by far the worst on ­record. And while up to 90 per cent of sufferers die from the various strains of the disease, it can only be transmitted via bodily fluids.

Queensland University’s Alexander Khromykh, a professor of molecular virology, urged Australian authorities to provide adequate screening at airports to prevent the spread of the disease, despite maintaining the risk to Australia was “low”.

“(Increased detection at airports) wouldn’t hurt, much like the measures that were taken when SARS started,” he said.

“Temperature scans would be necessary. In these kind of cases, more precautions are better than less, but it is ­unlikely to spread like SARS unless you are physically touching them.”Editorial Page 28

AUSTRALIANS travelling to countries affected by the Ebola virus face the risk of becoming stranded if the outbreak worsens.

Nearly 700 people have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March from the deadly virus, which has a 90 per cent fatality rate and no known cure or vaccine.

The number of cases in those three nations is climbing, with a death this week hundreds of kilometres away in Nigeria sparking fears the virus is spreading further.

The outbreak has prompted Australian embassy staff to defer travel plans to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

“We recommend Australian travellers do the same,” the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says in its latest updated advice. There’s a real risk that Australians travelling in the region could become stranded if the outbreak worsens.

Liberia has already closed the majority of its borders to try to combat the disease, and entry points that remain open are being used as Ebola prevention and screening centres.

DFAT warns that borders in the region could close and travel restrictions be imposed with “little or no warning”.

Australians who ignore the government’s advice are being urged to check their travel insurance as medical evacuations for any Ebola patient would be “extremely difficult to conduct”.

“The Australian government may have limited options in providing consular assistance in these circumstances,” DFAT says.

Those in the region should closely monitor local health advice and know the symptoms of the virus, which are severe and include high fever and weakness followed by external and internal bleeding. Any traveller to the region showing these signs before or after visiting should seek medical attention.

Victims of the virus, or those suffering symptoms, should be avoided at all costs as the disease is highly contagious.

The outbreak began in March in forested areas of south-eastern Guinea, and has since become the worst recorded.

Family of former Blackburn journalist killed in Malaysia Airlines crash ‘hoping and praying’ body can be laid to rest

FRIENDS and family of one-time Blackburn journalist Glenn Thomas who was killed in the Malaysia Airlines crash in the Ukraine are ‘hoping and praying’ for the early return of his remains, an ex-colleague said.

The 49-year-old was working for the World Health Organisation when he was a passenger on flight MH17 downed in controversial circumstances on July 17.

His body is believed to be in the Netherlands, where most of the 298 victims came from, awaiting formal identification.

Carol Tapp was head of Granada’s East Lancashire bureau in Daisyfield, Blackburn, and Glenn’s boss for a couple of years in the 1990s. She said: “I along with his family, partner Claudio and friends are hoping and praying his body can be found, identified and returned to the UK for a decent funeral.

“I have heard nothing and the fear is that it won’t be recovered.”

WHO news and communications co-ordinator Gregory Härtl said: “We believe Glenn’s remains are still in the Netherlands.

“We don’t know when yet exactly he will be repatriated. It now depends on identification and autopsy.”

Glenn’s WHO communications colleague Tarik Jasarevic, currently in Africa working on the Ebola crisis, said: “I don’t know exactly what the position is. He was a really good friend. I was very close to him.”

Mr Thomas, originally from Blackpool, was working as a media officer for the WHO in Geneva, and was on his way to an Australia Aids conference .

He is one of at least ten British nationals known to be among those on board the Boeing 777-200, which is thought to have been shot down over war-torn Ukraine. Mr Thomas worked on the Blackpool Citizen newspaper, a sister publication of the Lancashire Telegraph, in the late 80s and early 90s, before his move to Blackburn.

On Tuesday Mr Thomas’s twin sister Tracey Withers joined other British relatives who met Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for the urgent and dignified return of the victims’ remains.

IT starts as the common cold and ends with bleeding in your eyes, organs and from your skin. There is no treatment. No vaccine. No antibiotics.

Pot luck rather than modern medicine decides your fate.

“Once you get it there are no treatments,’’ said Alexander Khromykh, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Queensland.

“It is initially flu-like symptoms and a runny nose then it develops into a haemorrhagic disease which includes bleeding in the eyes, internal organs and skin haemorrhages.’’ Ebola virus is formed in fruit bats, often transferred to monkeys by contaminated fruit they eat before humans become the “accidental carriers” of the virus. A human can contract it by eating monkey meat or bats in African nations or if bitten by the animals.

Experts describe the virus as “highly contagious” once contracted by a human. Ebola is transferred between humans via bodily fluids. It could be as simple as wiping a tear off a person’s face or as intimate as the transfer of saliva or semen.

Frighteningly, the virus can still be transferred once a person has died.The standard mortality rate is 90 per cent, although the current strain’s mortality rate is predicted to be 60 per cent.

A QUEENSLAND researcher has developed a molecular computer which could more quickly detect and contain the spread of deadly viruses such as Ebola.

UNIVERSITY of the Sunshine Coast senior lecturer Joanne Macdonald says she has created a computer which can diagnose and tell the difference between viruses using molecular circuitry.

Dr Macdonald's research team developed synthetic DNA that mimicked the Ebola and Marburg viruses and demonstrated that the computer could distinguish between them.

The computer screen displayed a pink "E" for Ebola or a green "M" for Marburg.

Dr Macdonald said the computer system will be developed further so that it can identify other viruses, potentially helping to contain dangerous outbreaks.

"Previously you would have to do lots of different tests to tell the difference between the different viruses," she told AAP.

"We think we have the ability to embed all those tests into a single device.

"The sooner that you know what virus you have, (the sooner) you can start making decisions to follow where it goes in outbreaks and make decisions about preventing movement.

"If it was an animal virus you could do things like euthanase an animal to help prevent the spread."

The computer system is still in the proof-of-concept stage but Dr Macdonald hopes it could be used to test real virus samples within the next two years.

An outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has killed more than 670 people this year. There is no known cure for the disease, which spreads through direct contact with blood and other bodily fluids.

The Queensland government is funding Dr Macdonald's research in the hopes of enabling earlier detection of the destructive Henra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus.

ALMOST 700 people in West Africa have died from the Ebola virus, and Australian travellers are being warned to avoid affected areas.

NEARLY 700 people have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March in what has been described as the most serious recorded outbreak yet of the virus.

There are fears it could spread further across the region; Nigeria has set up disease isolation centres at its international airports after recording its first death from the virus.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is urging Australians to avoid areas affected by the virus and be aware they could run into trouble if they venture into the region.

"Australians are also advised that borders in the region may be closed at short notice to contain the outbreak," the department said in its travel bulletin.

Those in the region should closely monitor local health advice and maintain strict standards of hygiene.

Victims of the virus, or those suffering symptoms, should be avoided at all costs.

Ebola has a 90 per cent fatality rate and can quickly kill once contracted.

There is no known vaccine or cure.

Symptoms include high fever and weakness followed by external and internal bleeding.

Any traveller to the region showing these signs before or after visiting should seek medical attention.

The outbreak began in March in forested areas of southeastern Guinea.

HE has been unloved by several bourses around the world due to his past drug convictions and run-ins with the law.

But the Romanian-born mining entrepreneur Frank Timis seems to have finally found the respect he has long craved following his recent tour of Sierra Leone.

Judging by some gushing media coverage, Timis appears to have won plenty of extra fans from his moral-boosting visit to the African country currently gripped by an ebola virus outbreak.

“Timis has shown he is a true friend of Sierra Leone and will stand by the government and people at this difficult time when others with business interests in the country (won’t),” said NewsTime Africa about Timis, who is the executive chairman and largest shareholder in the iron ore miner African Minerals. African Minerals is Sierra Leone’s largest employer with 6850 workers at its Tonkolili iron ore operation.Timis’s reception in Sierra Leone is in contrast to his frustrations listing his businesses in London, Toronto and Sydney due to his past convictions. He quit his directorship of African Petroleom last year ahead of its listing on the Norway’s Oslo Bors stock exchange. The 39 per cent Timis-owned company said his resignation from the board was “due to historical events related to other listed companies”.

LIBERIA has linked another seven deaths to Ebola, bringing the total number of people believed to have died from the virus in the country to 16.

DEPUTY Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said on Tuesday that brings to 16 the number of people believed to have died from the virus in the West African country since the outbreak began.

The deaths are worrying because no new cases had been confirmed in Liberia in more than two months.

The outbreak appears to have begun in neighbouring Guinea and has also spread to Sierra Leone. In all, the World Health Organisation says nearly 250 people have died of the virus, which causes severe bleeding and high fever.

AN international medical aid team has been pulled out of Guinea after a centre treating patients suffering from Ebola virus was attacked.

The violence took place in the southern town of Macenta, where at least 14 people have died since the outbreak emerged last month.

The mob of people who descended upon the clinic accused Doctors Without Borders health workers of bringing Ebola to Guinea, where there had never previously been any cases.

Guinea's government swiftly condemned the attack, saying that Doctors Without Borders and other international aid groups were key to stopping the spread of Ebola.

"The international community has rapidly mobilised to help us in these difficult moments with considerable medical support and specialists on the ground at the disease's epicentre," the statement said.

"That's why the government is calling on people to stay calm and allow our partners to help us eradicate this epidemic."

There is no cure for Ebola, which causes fever and severe bleeding, and up to 90 per cent of patients die from the strain that has been detected in Guinea.

A total of 86 people have died so far from Ebola in Guinea and two other confirmed deaths have been reported in neighbouring Liberia.

Authorities in Mali are also investigating three suspected cases of Ebola, and have sent samples overseas for testing.

AT least 59 people have recently been reported killed by the Ebola virus in Guinea, health officials say.

Guinea's Ministry of Health has registered almost 100 infections since the virus was first reported last month, according to a Radio France Internationale report on Sunday.

The southern districts Macenta and Gueckedou, which border Sierra Leone, had been particularly affected by the outbreak, said Dr Sakoba Keita, the chief of the health ministry's prevention unit.

Three of 12 virus samples sent to France had been confirmed as Ebola, according to Keita.

Ebola is one of the most contagious viral diseases known, often resulting in death. It cannot be prevented with a vaccine and is untreatable with medication.

Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has launched an emergency medical intervention in the poverty-stricken West African nation's southern region.

It says more than 30 tonnes of medical supplies are en route to Guinea.

The organisation has a 24-member medical team on the ground and more staffers are scheduled to arrive in coming days.

"We have set up an isolation ward in Gueckedou," Dr Esther Sterk of MSF told American broadcaster Voice of America, saying an additional isolation ward will be set up in Macenta.

World Health Organization officials were due to arrive Sunday to conduct additional tests on site, Guinea's health ministry said.

CONAKRY A MYSTERIOUS illness has killed at least 23 people in southern Guinea in six weeks, but the disease has yet to be positively identified, the health ministry announced Thursday.

“A feverish sickness whose first symptoms were observed on February 9 has claimed at least 23 lives, including that of the director of the Macenta district hospital and three staff, out of a total of 36 cases,” said Sakoba Keita, the doctor in charge of the ministry’s preventive wing.

“The administrative district of Gueckedou is the worst affected, with 13 deaths for 19 cases,” Dr Keita added, noting that “the illness is characterised by fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, and bleeding in the cases of some patients”.

Medical experts have been sent to the district to try to identify the highly contagious disease, the symptoms of which are similar to those caused by Lassa fever, yellow fever and Ebola.

About 30 test samples have been sent to France for analysis, with results expected “within 48 hours”, the doctor said, adding that further samples are due to be examined at the Pasteur Institute in the Senegalese capital Dakar.

Protective measures have been taken on the spot, including quarantine for each of the patients, as well as individual and collective steps affecting the local population.Three thousand health kits intended for medical personnel and residents of high-risk areas are expected from Burkina Faso, while the Swiss branch of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has already sent 100 tonnes of medical equipment.
