WORLD Bank president Jim Yong Kim says progress has been made on a proposal for a global fund to fight future epidemics like the Ebola crisis.

THE president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has revealed progress has been made in discussions on a proposal for countries to sign up to a contingency fund to prevent future outbreaks, that could instantly disperse billions of dollars for personnel, equipment and logistical support.

Speaking on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brisbane, Dr Kim said the fund would provide a "virtual buffer" for the world economy should another epidemic break out, with details of how it would work possibly finalised as early as the next six months.

"I just want to stress that pandemics, epidemics in fact are a very real downside risk to the global economy. They are also human tragedies, they are public health emergencies," Dr Kim said.

"It would require putting together something like a global public health corp. People from all over the world could be ready to respond at a moment's notice."

The comments came amid calls from aid groups and world leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama, for the Ebola crisis to be elevated as a key issue at the G20 meeting, and for nations to do more to combat the deadly virus.

Dr Kim said the fund could disperse millions and "many billions of dollars if necessary".

"If we had a flu pandemic it would move very quickly and potentially kill millions. We would need many billions of dollars dispersed right away," Dr Kim warned.

The world's worst ever breakout of Ebola has killed more than 5000 people, mostly in five West African countries, since the beginning of the year.

Abbott serves Russian broadside ahead of G20

PM tells global media Russia's economy is declining as assertiveness increases.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has set the scene for a tense G20 summit after accusing Vladimir Putin of focusing on military aggression and letting Russia's economy decline.

Mr Abbott jetted in to Brisbane on Friday to meet G20 leaders and business chiefs before chairing the global gathering which officially starts on Saturday.

The prime minister wants the focus of the summit to remain firmly on boosting global economic growth and jobs.

But other issues, such as Russia's support for Ukrainian separatists, the fight against the spread of Ebola in west Africa and calls for greater efforts to tackle climate change will also be key discussion topics.

Mr Abbott, who had previously promised to "shirtfront" Mr Putin over the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine, said Russia would find more friends if it promoted peace and freedom instead of trying to recreate its past.

"Interestingly, Russia's economy is declining even as Russia's assertiveness is increasing," he said, during a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron in Canberra.

"Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace and freedom and prosperity ... instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union."

Mr Putin is already aware of the prime minister's thoughts, which were voiced during a brief meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Beijing earlier this week.

Mr Abbott will hold a trilateral meeting with US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the G20 summit to discuss greater defence cooperation.

They will also discuss Russia's military flights into Japanese airspace and its decision to send a navy fleet of four warships to the South Pacific.

Mr Abbott describes Russia's naval posturing in international waters northeast of Australia as part of a regrettable pattern of bullying and aggression.

Mr Cameron raised the prospect of increased sanctions against Russia if matters in Ukraine worsened.

Kiev is readying for fresh combat operations in its war-torn east and NATO has backed claims Moscow is pouring military hardware across the border.

Ukraine will also be on Mr Obama's agenda at the summit, alongside climate change and economic reform.

Australia has set its G20 co-members the task of coming up with individual plans to deliver a collective two per cent rise in global economic growth beyond current levels to 2018.

Mr Cameron praised Australia for showing "great leadership in pushing these growth boosting measures".

Mr Cameron's also keen on greater G20 cooperation on big companies who don't "pay the tax bills they should".

But he's less enthusiastic about climate change, saying every country has its own views.

A spokesman for Chinese President Xi Jinping, who this week struck an historic emissions reduction deal with Mr Obama, said the delegation expected positive results to come out of the summit.

Mr Putin was due to arrive in Brisbane on Friday night.

NEW Zealand has been thanked for its support after the terror attack on Ottawa in October by visiting Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

HARPER, who is in New Zealand for a short visit on the way to the G20 summit in Australia, said New Zealanders had shown great solidarity with Canada after October's terror attack, where a man shot a security guard dead in Ottawa before shots erupted in the halls of Parliament.

"I want ... thank the people of New Zealand for your kind words of support," he said.

"Our two countries may not be close neighbours but we are like family. Indeed, this country has always been an important partner and ally of Canada."

Harper said he couldn't comment specifically on New Zealand, but much of the world was potentially at risk from Islamic extremists.

"As you know, New Zealand and Canada are tight security partners and I think we all have the view that the Islamic State and the people it represents are genuinely a threat all around the world," he said.

"The type of attacks we had recently in Canada, ... while they're on a small scale because they're single individuals executing them, they're also very hard to protect and prevent.

"I think the problem's going to be with us for some time to come."

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said there was a very deep and longstanding relationship with Canada.

He thanked Canada for its unflinching support for New Zealand's successful campaign to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council.

Key said their discussion points in Auckland today included ISIL, the G20 summit, the Ebola virus, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement currently being negotiated.

Key said he also took a moment to admire the Canadian flag, created after an impassioned flag debate in the 1960s, and discussed his campaign to change the New Zealand flag.

TURKISH prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu has promised his country will focus on much more than economic growth when it hosts the G20 next year.

TURKISH prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu has pledged to use his nation's presidency of the G20 next year to work closely with poorer nations outside the Group of Twenty on a broader agenda.

"Every year we are facing new challenges and we need to address this future of ours," he said on Friday.

"If the G20 agenda is only limited to financial issues, G20 cannot function, cannot have global legitimacy."

Turkey will assume the G20 presidency from Australia next month.

It will become responsible for ensuring the economic growth plans pledged by G20 nations at the leaders' summit in Brisbane this weekend are actually implemented.

But in a broad ranging speech Mr Davutoglu also promised Turkey's G20 agenda would tackle broader issues.

Ebola wasn't just a challenge for west Africa, because a global outbreak could threaten growth across the G20.

"It is not only the World Health Organization's agenda," he said.

"We have to think from today what will be the consequences of the Ebola crisis."

Turkey will also urge world leaders to help solve the refugee crisis in the Middle East, flowing from the wars in Iraq and Syria.

Australia has faced some criticism for its narrow G20 agenda focused on boosting the global economy by at least two per cent in the years to 2018.

The Abbott government has also come under pressure in recent days to put climate change on the meeting agenda after the US and China announced a broad deal to curb carbon emissions.

Mr Davutoglu said global warming would unequivocally be a top agenda item for his country at the 2015 summit.

"The biggest challenge to all humanity today is climate change," he told an audience in Brisbane.

Tony Abbott may have found another world leader apart from Vladimir Putin who he’d like to shirt-front this weekend in Brisbane at the G20. Barack Obama.

In announcing his secret carbon deal in Beijing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the US President delivered the PM’s critics the headlines they were after — embarrassment on the world stage over climate change.

It is true Abbott didn’t see it coming, despite several DFAT officials apparently being aware of it — but forgetting to tell anyone.

Diplomatically, it wasn’t a great look for Abbott. But the level of shame heaped on Australia courtesy of this announcement, as usual, has been completely overstated.

The political embarrassment will become evident over time but it’s likely to be one worn by Labor and the Greens rather than Abbott, and not simply because they blowtorched the issue four years ago in act of political cowardice and moral perversity.

As rhetoric, the deal reads as good news for the planet that China and the US — which combined are responsible for almost half the world’s atmospheric pollution — agreed to try and reduce it a bit, or at least reduce the amount by which they are still increasing it.

But the new US target that Labor and the Greens are popping champagne corks over will only be reached, according to Obama through (a) vehicle emission standards — a direct action policy — and (b) curbing power station output.

The main driver of emissions reductions in the US will come, however, through the migration from coal-fired power to coal seam gas.

The Greens are bitterly opposed to coal seam gas. Labor doesn’t quite know where it is on this issue yet.

And there is no carbon tax or emissions trading scheme, as Labor is still wedded to.

As for China, its pledge of doing something about reducing the annual increase in the 10 billion tonnes a year it emits by 2030 will be achieved through a mandated output of zero emission power and clean coal technology.

Yep, coal. The very fuel and major export commodity that shadow environment minister Mark Butler recently said he wanted to phase out and which the Greens would like to have us think is Earth’s equivalent of kryptonite.

It’s not surprising that Labor leader Bill Shorten has already thrown his lot in with a lame-duck President in Obama and a squawking minority in the Greens. Labor has consistently swum against the tide on this issue, and increasingly on others (such as ebola, which Labor appeared to want to bring to Australia despite most Australians wanting to keep it out).

Labor strategists may not have yet picked up on the fact the US Democrats’ recent pummeling in the mid-terms saw Republicans pick up two of the seven seats they won to gain control of the senate by taking them from Democrats in the working-class coal seats of Montana and West Virginia.

The new Republican senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had this to say about Obama’s deal: “I was particularly distressed by the deal that he has apparently reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which as I read the agreement requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emissions regulations are ­creating havoc in my state and other states around the country. I would welcome the President moving toward the middle.” Shorten would not be oblivious to the political reality of what happens to social democratic leaders who veer from the centrist path — the middle. So there must be something else at play.

Senior members of his own Right faction admit his decision this week to pull out of the negotiations with the government on the renewable energy target (RET) was a stunt — but one with deeper political strategy behind it There is an unquestionable need for certainty around the RET to prevent an exodus of investment. But certainty for investors is as much about the numbers as it is the guarantee the numbers won’t keep changing with future governments.

The 20 per cent RET target is essentially a consumer subsidy paid to the renewable energy industry through higher electricity prices for households and business.

A review of the MRET conducted under Labor warned that increasing the target would impose “significant economic costs through higher electricity prices”.

Shorten knows Labor’s only trump card in yet another political argument about climate change is to make the case that abolishing the carbon tax didn’t bring down power prices. Failure to reform the RET will ensure they don’t.

The less cynical interpretation of course is that Shorten has been circumscribed by the Labor Left out of a debt owed for agreeing to roll over on his demands of bipartisan support on national security and the military campaign in Iraq.Neither explanation is a particularly good one.

EXCLUSIVE A GREENS senator who requested consular assistance so he could go on a madcap one-man mission to West Africa and sort out the ebola epidemic has had the plan scuttled by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

In an expedition almost channelling that of 19th century African explorer Dr David Livingstone, Dr Richard Di Natale wanted Ms Bishop to order the Australian High Commission in Ghana to chauffeur him around Africa and organise meetings with the World Health Organisation. Instead he was advised it was too dangerous to go and told to get health insurance if he chose to go against government advice.

In a letter obtained by The Daily Telegraph, Ms Bishop said she would not spread the High Commission staff thin for a one-man “fact finding” mission to ebola-stricken Africa, writing that: “Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia and staff from the Australian High Commission in Ghana have deferred all non-essential travel to these countries.

“If staff were directed to travel to these countries, it would divert scarce resources from the High Commission in Ghana, which is on the frontline of Australia’s ebola response.’’ Australia’s official government travel advisory for Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia — the countries hit in an outbreak which has killed more than 5000 — is to “reconsider their need to travel” which is the second-highest travel warning.

The Victorian-based Dr Di Natale has previously worked as a GP and public health specialist. He has also assisted with the treatment of HIV in Asia.

Dr Di Natale had planned to ­privately fund the trip but wanted government officials to organise most of the official aspects of his visit.

“Meetings with representatives from the World Health Organisation, the United Nations co-ordinating team and NGOs would simply not be possible without consular assistance,” Dr Di Natale said last week.

Australia has committed $42 million to fight ebola, including running a 100-bed hospital in Sierra Leone, where the WHO on Wednesday new infections were surging.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been cautious about sending Australians to Africa because their safety cannot be guaranteed. Ms Bishop said Australia was monitoring the ebola situation closely.Without consular assistance, Dr Di Natale is unlikely to proceed. “You should ensure your travel insurance will cover healthcare and/or evacuation for ebola,’’ Ms Bishop advised.

MSF to host three Ebola clinical trials

THE charity MSF says it will soon carry out trials for three possible treatments for Ebola, which will be run in Liberia and Guinea.

THE international humanitarian group says it will host clinical trials starting next month in three Ebola treatment centres using experimental drugs that haven't been through the usual lengthy process of study with animals and healthy people.

Separate trials will be led by three different research partners and involve the UN World Health Organisation and health officials in affected countries.

"If we're going to find a treatment, we have to do it now - which is why we have to accelerate these trials," said Peter Horby, the chief investigator for the trial led by Oxford University.

Oxford's trial will test the antiviral drug brincidofovir in Liberia.

France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research will conduct a trial using the antiviral drug favipiravir in Gueckedou, Guinea, and the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine will test convalescent whole blood and plasma therapy in Guinea.

Results from some of the trials are expected by February or March.

The largest-ever outbreak of Ebola has raged for than eight months, killing more than 5000 people and infecting more than 14,000 in West Africa.

The UN has appointed an Ebola chief and various governments have set up clinics. But medical teams are stretched thin and the UN health agency WHO says there are not enough foreign medical workers.

There are no established drugs for Ebola. Human testing of a handful of experimental drugs for Ebola has begun on several continents. The current outbreak kills between 50 and 80 per cent of those infected in West Africa, according to Doctors Without Borders.

Prime Minister to seek 'concrete plans' for dealing with the health crisis.

British Prime Minister David Cameron will press other world leaders including Tony Abbott to do more to combat Ebola, having declared the issue will be at the top the agenda at the G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane.

Aid and health organisations on Thursday repeated calls for nations to lift their response to the Ebola crisis, amid warnings the window of opportunity to halt the spread of the deadly disease, which has so far killed more than 5000 people in West Africa, is closing fast.

Mr Cameron, who will address the Australian parliament on Friday before flying to Brisbane, is expected to push for world leaders and partners at the G20, such as Australia, to come up with "concrete plans" for dealing with the crisis.

The development came as Treasurer Joe Hockey on Thursday said Ebola presented a major risk to the global economy, and as health workers on the frontline of the battle against the disease in Liberia made a personal plea to Mr Abbott to offer more help.

The British prime minister, who has been outspoken about what has been viewed as an inadequate response to Ebola, said before he left for Australia that "problems with the global economy and Ebola will be top of the agenda" at the G20 leaders' meeting.

On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond confirmed Mr Cameron would raise the issue with international leaders in Brisbane.

"The prime minister will be pressing G20 members and other partners in Brisbane to take forward concrete actions to address the immediate crisis as well as support for longer-term economic resilience, and strengthen our resolve to prevent future threats to global health security," Mr Hammond said.

Mr Hockey, during a tour of the G20 HQ in Brisbane, said Ebola was a significant issue.

"It is a risk of course to the African economy as it is to the world economy and leaders and finance ministers will appropriately discuss all the risks, all the risks to the global economy," he said.

Aid organisation Oxfam said it welcomed the recognition from Mr Hockey that Ebola was a risk to economies beyond Africa.

"It is encouraging to hear the government recognising that Ebola is not just a health crisis, but a serious economic crisis as well," Oxfam Australia chief executive Dr Helen Szoke said.

But she also warned that the "window of opportunity to bring the spread of Ebola under control is closing fast".

Jobs and growth the G20 focus: Hockey

Treasurer's comments follow lobbying on Ebola, climate; Abbott says 'other forums' for climate change.

Jobs and growth will remain the focus of the G20 leaders' summit, despite strenuous lobbing to shift the spotlight to climate change and Ebola.

Australia, which holds the G20 presidency, on Thursday re-emphasised the summit's mission when Treasurer Joe Hockey stressed the heavy burden on group members "to get real outcomes".

"We have a plan before the leaders of the world to grow the world economy, to create the jobs that are necessary, to lift people out of poverty, and we are determined to deliver that," he said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott will join other world leaders and business chiefs in Brisbane on Friday afternoon ahead of the formal summit talks starting on Saturday.

On the table is Australia's call for the G20 to collectively add at least two per cent to world growth to 2018.

If successful, this could generate millions of jobs, massive infrastructure activity and cut red tape.

Global finance ministers will also meet on Friday to iron out last-minute issues on tackling multi-national tax avoidance and "too big to fail" banking reforms, before presenting a report to the leaders' summit.

Mr Abbott said while climate change -- which has been spotlighted by an historic emissions reduction deal between China and the US -- was a significant issue, there were other forums.

"If other countries want to raise other subjects they're entirely welcome to do so but my focus, and I believe the principal focus of the conference, will be on growth and jobs," he said.

His comments also followed a desperate and personal plea from health workers in Liberia for the summit not forget west Africa's Ebola crisis as they gathered in Brisbane.

G20 countries have produced 1000 plans to support the growth target.

These have been assessed by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, which will report back on how much they could deliver to growth.

Already expectations are high the target is within reach and may be exceeded.

G20 members that can't deliver on their promises, to be revealed on Sunday, must find alternatives.

"Everyone is determined to deliver on their plans and if you can't deliver on these plans you have to find additional plans," Mr Hockey said.

"The only way we are going to get economic growth is through structural reform."

IMF chief Christine Lagarde believes the two per cent additional growth target is an improvement.

But it may not be enough to deliver all of the jobs the world needs.

In a report ahead of the summit, the IMF said the world economy faced headwinds from sluggish growth in Europe and Japan and a slowdown in emerging economies.

It's trimmed the growth forecast for 2014 to 3.3 per cent, from 3.4 per cent.

The Labor 20 (L20) group of workers' organisations has new research showing if wages and public investment in infrastructure are boosted by one per cent of gross domestic product the growth target could be exceeded.

The Civil 20 (C20) wants a plan to lift the incomes of the billion people living in poverty in G20 nations.

ALL international travellers to Australia will be required to provide a 21-day travel history declaration and high-risk travellers will have their temperatures taken as part of ­revamped ebola measures at airports across the nation.

The federal Government will ­announce the new measures today in a bid to “ebola proof” Australia from the deadly disease.

Travellers on international flights will have to fill out the Travel History Card. It is believed more than two million have been printed.

Anyone flying from ebola-stricken Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will be referred to a Human Biosecurity officer to have their temperature taken. They will be interviewed and provided with a 24-hour number should they show any symptoms.

Airport smartgates, which is the electronic passport processing ­system, will be reprogrammed to cater for the changes. Flights to ­Australia will include in-flight ­announcements that will provide ebola advice to travellers.

The new measures are part of a plan to ensure potential ebola carriers do not slip through the cracks.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Health Minister Peter Dutton are expected to make a joint announcement about the changes today.

The new ebola airport screening measures come after the government last week committed more than $20 million to run a 100-bed ebola hospital in West Africa.

Australian medical provider Aspen Medical will be contracted to run the hospital, which will be staffed by a mix of paid Australian volunteers and local medical teams from Sierra Leone.

It is understood Australian authorities have tested more than a dozen people for ebola but no one has tested positive to the disease.Numerous hospitals across the country have set up ebola wards in case there is a positive test in Australia. The traveller cards will include the ebola hotline: 1800 186 815

MARITIME security and freedom of navigation at sea will be highlighted by Prime Minister Tony Abbott at an ASEAN summit in Myanmar.

AUSTRALIA'S 40 years of partnership with ASEAN was commemorated in Myanmar on Wednesday night, where Mr Abbott flagged a new Australia-ASEAN council to deepen engagement in the region.

Trade with ASEAN nations is now 80 times greater than it was 40 years ago, he said.

One million people visit Australia every year from ASEAN countries and more than 100,000 students choose to study in Australia every year.

Mr Abbott noted the rising influence and prosperity of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, an "emerging democratic superpower of Asia".

"I'd like to think that Australia has played its part in the advancement of the region," he said.

The new council would promote Australia's interests with activities to strengthen people-to-people links, Mr Abbott said, praising the progress of ASEAN.

"But we can't have prosperity without security," he said.

Myanmar hosts the ASEAN-related East Asia Summit (EAS) on Thursday, as China and its neighbours row over competing claims in the South China Sea.

Mr Abbott will underline Australia's interest in the region's maritime security and freedom of navigation at sea.

The threat of terror strikes and the response to the Ebola crisis are also on the agenda.

The EAS, now in its ninth year, brings together 10 ASEAN countries with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the US and Russia.

The summits come amid growing concerns Myanmar's transition to democracy is stalling.

Mr Abbott on Wednesday met popular opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains constitutionally barred from running for president in next year's elections.

He also met Myanmar's President Thien Sein and the leaders of Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines in the capital Naypwidaw.

Mr Abbott leaves on Thursday afternoon to host world leaders arriving in Australia for this weekend's G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane.

Bob’s Band Aid solution to heal Africa’s suffering

THE SONG THAT HELPED FIGHT FAMINE IS BEING RE-RELEASED TO TACKLE EBOLA

Sir Bob Geldof has announced he is gathering talent to record a new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas. Thirty years after the original song raised money for the Ethiopian famine, now it will be brought into the fight against the ebola epidemic in Africa.

Geldof has said the new ­recording was inspired by his distress at the plight of Africans who can’t even hold and comfort loved ones who have contracted the disease for fear of being infected. Thirty years ago he was moved by images of mothers holding their malnourished children in Africa.

Ethiopia in the ’80s was ravaged by civil war, disrupting the agricultural industry. This was exacerbated by land ­reforms introduced in the ’70s that left farmers on tiny plots with little incentive to produce surplus food. In 1983 and 1984 drought and poor harvest strained an already tenuous food supply and the government responded by trying to cover up the famine.

By 1984 the famine had ­become too severe to ignore, but Ethiopia’s government, led by General Secretary Mengistu Haile Mariam, had committed too much of the country’s resources to fighting insurgents to be able to cope with the disaster.

Aid agencies and news crews descended on the war-torn country, spreading news of the famine around the world and asking for help. Global condemnation for Mengistu’s government was matched by a desire to do something to stop the suffering. Geldof was one of many stirred into action.

Born Robert Frederick Zenon Geldof in a seaside town near Dublin in 1951, he formed a band, the Nightlife Thugs, with some mates in 1975. They later changed their name to Boomtown Rats, derived from a childhood gang in activist and singer Woody Guthrie’s semi-autobiographical novel Bound For Glory.

The band moved to ­England, and released their debut single in 1977. Their biggest hit was the 1979 song I Don’t Like Mondays, based on the true story of a 16-year-old girl who shot two people dead at a US school in January 1979.

The Boomtown Rats were on a downward trajectory in the ’80s but Geldof still had a profile as an actor. After seeing disturbing images of the extent of the famine in Ethiopia he was outraged. He called his friend Midge Ure, from the band Ultravox and said: “We’ve got to do something about this.” Geldof and Ure wrote Do They Know It’s Christmas and called on friends in the industry, performers, technicians and producers, to help them record the song, release it as a single and give the proceeds to starving Ethiopians. Under the collective name of Band Aid the performers included Paul McCartney, Paul Young, Phil Collins, Boy George and members of Bananarama, Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran, The Police and several other big names in British pop music.

The single would reach No.1 on the charts in more than a dozen countries (although only 13 in the US), but Geldof had to shame Margaret Thatcher’s government into not extracting the VAT (or value added tax, their GST).

Millions of pounds were raised by the record, and it ­inspired the Americans to ­release their own supergroup single We Are The World to raise money for the famine. Geldof followed the single up in July 1985 with global concerts, under the banner Live Aid (although the Australian component would be named Oz For Africa) raising millions more. He famously exhorted people not to go to the pub but to “stay in and just give us the money, there are people dying now”. It is often misreported as “give me the f...ing money.” Despite allegations that some of the money had ended up being spent on weapons, Geldof kept a close watch on where it went and insists that 97 pence out of every pound went to alleviating the famine.

Geldof’s efforts were recognised with a knighthood in 1986. Globally famous, often dubbed “Saint Bob,” Geldof failed to resurrect his band’s fortunes but he would make a fortune as a TV producer.

He has remained an activist for humanitarian causes in ­Africa. He re-released the song in 1989, with Kylie Minogue as one of the stars raising money for another Ethiopian famine, and again in 2004 for the ­Sudanese famine.troy.lennon@news.com.au

Ebola poses a threat for airport earnings

THE largest Australian airports face the greatest earnings threat from any Ebola outbreak, due to their exposure to international travellers.

CREDIT ratings agency Standard and Poor's has looked at what would happen if an Ebola epidemic spread beyond west Africa, and diluted demand for international air travel.

Australia's three busiest airports were rated as a medium-level risk when it came to a potential earnings downturn, along with Hong Kong, Paris and Tokyo, its report says.

"Simply because the percentage of revenue coming from international passengers is bigger," report co-author Thomas Jacquot told AAP.

"It's affecting earnings potentially more. Sydney has a slightly higher earnings impact."

Adelaide and Perth were regarded as low risk, along with Wellington, Dublin and London's Heathrow airport, which relies more on travel from other parts of the European Union.

When it came to a possible effect on credit ratings, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide were regarded as low risk, alongside Paris, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong.

Brisbane and Perth were seen as medium risk because they are undergoing major capital works, which meant they had less room financially to cope with a drop in international passenger numbers.

"Any impact on earnings, even if moderate, could therefore affect our view on their credit quality," the report said.

S&P concluded that a temporary drop in international passenger numbers in 2015 would have a limited effect on airports in the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Its report used the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003 as a guide to the consequences for international air travel.

Passenger numbers actually increased in 2004, after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome had spread from China, with passenger traffic at Australian airports rising by 12 per cent, compared with 16 per cent in Tokyo and 26 per cent in Hong Kong.

PM meets with TPP leaders in Beijing as China pushes ahead with FTAAP scheme.

Russia calls it an American plot that's doomed to fail and China is so angry about being excluded it has thrown its weight behind a rival trade plan.

But Prime Minister Tony Abbott is standing by the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious US-led plan to remove trade barriers among 12 Asia-Pacific nations.

Mr Abbott met his fellow TPP leaders, including US President Barack Obama, for closed-door negotiations on Monday, before the official opening of the annual APEC summit in Beijing.

The prime minister rejected suggestions it was provocative to hold a TPP meeting in the Chinese capital given Beijing's frustration that it cannot join in.

"I think that everyone wants to see freer trade in the Asia-Pacific region," Mr Abbott told reporters.

He pointed out that once the TPP nations had reached a deal, other countries would be invited to join.

In the meantime, China is vowing to push on with plans for a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).

Many analysts see the competing plans as part of the US-China rivalry for power and influence in the region.

But Mr Abbott says the FTAAP is a "parallel process" and dismisses suggestions the plans are part of US-China power dynamics.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ridiculed the TPP last week, calling it just another US attempt to build an institution America would benefit from.

And the absence of Russia and China ensures it will not be effective, Mr Putin says.

Mr Abbott also had meetings on Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang before heading into the TPP talks.

Mr Abbott's talks with Mr Obama were to focus on coalition efforts against jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq, as well as the G20 agenda, Ebola and the MH17 disaster.

The prime minister is set to confront Mr Putin over the Ukrainian separatist attack on Malaysia Airlines flight 17 when the pair meet on Tuesday.

Mr Abbott made international headlines when he threatened to "shirt-front" the Russian leader over the attack that killed 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

But Mr Abbott is now playing down the prospect of fireworks, saying his talks with Mr Putin were "by no means the biggest part" of his APEC agenda.

"It wasn't a tragedy. It was an atrocity, it was a crime, and Russia has said that it will do everything to bring the perpetrators to justice," he said.

"Good on Russia for saying that and I will just be looking for an assurance from the president that what they said then, they meant, and what they said then is still what they say now."

Mr Abbott will head to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, on Wednesday for the ASEAN East Asia Summit. He will return to Australia on Friday.

Facebook mogul’s a real softie at heart

FACEBOOK’S Mark Zuckerberg has revealed his softer side.

The 30-year-old tech billionaire, holding his first town hall-style Q & A, said his feelings were hurt by The Social Network — the award-winning movie about his life starting Facebook.

The boy wonder mogul told both a live studio audience and, presumably, thousands tuning in to the live stream.

“They just kind of made up a bunch of stuff that I found really hurtful. They made up this whole plot line about how I somehow decided to create Facebook to attract girls,” he said. “The real story is a lot of hard work. If they were really making a movie it would be of me sitting there coding for two hours straight.” Zuckerberg said he had never even heard of an appletini, or apple-flavoured martini, before he saw the movie.

Zuckerberg admits, though, that the sweet drink became a favourite around the office after the film was released.

Accepting questions submitted over several days, Zuckerberg also tackled subjects as diverse as ebola, Facebook’s new messenger app.

One woman asked Zuckerberg why he wears “the same T-shirt everyday,” drawing laughter.“I really want to clear my life to make as few decisions as possible” in order to focus on Facebook, he said. “I’m not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on anything that is silly or frivolous.”

TONY Abbott says he'll seek Vladimir Putin's personal assurance at APEC talks that the MH17 issue won't be swept under the carpet or forgotten.

MR Abbott has been seeking a face-to-face meeting with the Russian president since Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot down over east Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

In announcing the request had been granted, Mr Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov added the Tuesday meeting "will be short".

Mr Abbott, who departs for the summit on Sunday morning, did not repeat his previous threat to "shirtfront" the Russian president when asked about their impending talk.

But he said they'd have "a robust conversation" to ensure Mr Putin guarantees he's doing everything possible to assist investigations into the MH17 disaster.

"I will speak for our dead, I will speak for our nation, I will speak for decency and for humanity," Mr Abbott told reporters in Melbourne.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop hosed down concerns Mr Abbott's previous choice of language would derail discussions.

"Since the phrase shirtfront was used, I understand it has now entered the diplomatic lexicon of many countries," she said.

Mr Abbott is also expected to meet with US President Barack Obama during the leaders forum on Monday, where regional heads aim to clinch a pan-Pacific trade deal.

Australia is also confident about concluding a Free Trade Agreement with China, the negotiations of which have dragged on for about 10 years.

Ms Bishop said she would be "delighted" to have the agreement finalised ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane on November 15.

"But we're not pursuing an agreement for the sake of an agreement, it has to be in our national interest," she said.

Ms Bishop met with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Beijing on Saturday to discuss both countries' commitment in the fight against Islamic State, as well as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

She also had her first meeting with new Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi - who was appointed to replace Marty Natalegawa by new president Joko Widodo.

Ms Bishop said Ms Marsudi did not raise any concerns about Australia's immigration policies, but they did discuss the Bali Process more generally.

"We noted that the people smuggling trade had been significantly dismantled, and that both Australia and Indonesia had been beneficiaries of that," she said.

The APEC summit marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20.

RICHARD NOONE, DAD OF FOUR There is a little known study being conducted at Westmead Children’s Hospital looking into the nasty stuff growing at the back of kid’s throats.

I know this because I had to sign a consent form allowing one of my kids to be part of the “control’’ group.

By “control’’ the doctor conducting the study explained she didn’t expect to find anything untowards growing in my daughter’s pharynx, but they needed to see what bacteria was present in healthy kids and compare it with children who were known to have a particular bug.

The bug they’re looking for is a largely under-recognised bacteria called Kingella kingae, which like most people I’d never heard of before.

Apparently it was first identified in 1960 but it wasn’t until culturing techniques improved by the mid-1990s that K. kingae was linked with causing bone and joint infections in children.

While there is a fair bit of research going on in the US and Europe, the Westmead study hopes to establish a baseline in Australia.

I’m told it’s common enough but most kids never go on to develop any secondary infections and by the time they hit their teens their immune system kills it off, which is why it’s rarely found in the throats of adults.

The study piqued my interest and quizzing the doctor she told me there’s a whole gamut of bacteria and diseases often lying dormant in kids which, like the age-old medical mystery of “growing pains’’, we simply get over as we get older.

Naturally our conversation turned to daycare — those disease factories where little walking, talking Petri dishes cough, splutter, ingest and oscillate bacteria between themselves at alarming rates.

Like a lot of parents, I’ve never been sicker, more often, in my adult life than during the first couple of years of my kids attending daycare.

The doctor told me of a couple of overseas daycare studies which found while various bugs spread like wildfire through the kids and their families, those who worked there, the educators, proved largely immune because they’re exposed to it daily.It left me thinking … forget health authorities, let’s ask daycare workers to tackle ebola — their immune systems could be the hope of the world.

Deal crowns Timis as Sierra Leone’s main tycoon

FORMER Perth-based mining entrepreneur Frank Timis has well and truly cemented himself as the best-known tycoon in Sierra Leone.

Timis this week through his private company Timis Corporation snapped up the Marampa iron ore mine in the country from the receivers of London Mining which collapsed last month.

With Sierra Leone in the grip of a major ebola crisis, it looks like the Romanian-born Timis scored himself a bargain by gaining control of the mine in return for taking on London Mining’s $US210 million of debt.

“Timis Corp is delighted we have completed the purchase of the Marampa mine from the receivers, which secures the future of the mine and its employees, and preserves a major source of revenue for the government of Sierra Leone,’’ said Timis, whose ­African Resources is already the ­biggest employer in the country.

The purchase got over the line thanks to a $US20 million injection from the ASX-listed Lambert Resources, whose executive chairman Tony Sage is a close friend of Timis.

Lambert also includes Sage and the Timis-controlled African Minerals as key shareholders. Its funding package includes the $US12 million purchase of the Marampa mine’s royalties.

The company said it could earn up to $US500 million from these royalties over the 20-year life of the mine.

Eyebrows have been raised in the London press as to why Timis did not purchase the mine through the public-listed African Minerals. The company after all will now share its rail infrastructure with the Marampa mine.

However, Sage told Biz Con ­African Minerals was unable to secure bank funding to buy the Marampa mine given it already holds $US500 million of debt.“Because of ebola in West Africa not many other people had the balls to do it,’’ said the owner of the Perth Glory A-League team.

The star of INXS: Never Tear Us Apart has just returned from a week-long trip to South Sudan as an ambassador for Save The Children, where he visited sick kids and their parents in the town of Nimule, north of the Ugandan border.

“Obviously I was putting myself at slightly more risk of contracting something than I am here in Australia,” he said. “But there’s no cases of ebola in South Sudan.

“At the hospital we were at, there was lots of malaria, TB, sleeping sickness, malnutrition and a cholera outbreak.” It was Arnold’s second international tour with the organisation after an earlier trip this year to Jordan in the Middle East to help raise awareness of the humanitarian crisis resulting from the conflict in Syria.

Money raised by Save The Children goes to feeding programs for children suffering malnutrition in South Sudan.“People told me their stories very passionately because they don’t want to be forgotten and they are not getting enough,” Arnold said.

THE Federal Government will fund the operation of a 100-bed ebola hospital in Sierra Leone to combat the deadly outbreak.

Prime Minister Tony Abb-ott yesterday confirmed the government had contracted Australian medical provider Aspen Medical to run the hospital as part of the $20 million project.

Aspen will staff the hospital with largely local medical teams in Sierra Leone, but paid Australian volunteers could also go to the region.

There are 130 Australians who have registered interest.

The announcement came after the government struck a deal with the British Government to treat any Australian ebola victims in west Africa as British citizens.

The government had been concerned about the prospect of no evacuation plan for Australians who contracted the virus. Mr Abbott expects Aspen will have the hospital operational by the end of the month. “We anticipate about 240 staff required to do the job,” he said.

Mr Abbott said it was a “health emergency” not a military one. “Which is why we have contracted a private health provider to do this, which is in keeping with our response to other overseas health emergencies such as cholera in our region,’’ he said.

Mr Abbott also announced there would be tighter monitoring of overseas arrivals at Australian airports, including temperature testing.

“The last thing anyone would want to do is to have personnel going to Africa, coming back to Australia and acting as carriers for this horrible disease,” he said.“I think the Australian ­people expect our priorities to be prevention at home, preparedness in the region, and work in the wider world, and that’s what we are doing.”

PRIME Minister Tony Abbott doesn't believe next week's G20 summit in Brisbane is the appropriate forum to discuss the Ebola outbreak.

WHILE Mr Abbott acknowledged the outbreak had been a terrible disaster for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, none were major economies.

"I don't want to minimise the seriousness of the outbreak, but I also want to keep it in perspective," he told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday..

"This is a public health emergency. It's not a security emergency and it's certainly not an economic emergency.

"I don't think at this stage we want to overestimate the impact of Ebola on the global economy."

However, Mr Abbott said Ebola would be discussed if raised by leaders at the summit in Brisbane.

"But my very, very strong concern is to try to keep the G20 as an economic forum, not as a security forum, not as a public health forum," he said.

"There are other forums to talk about environmental issues. There are other forums to talk about security issues and there are other forums to talk about health issues."

Abbott hires contractor to fight Ebola

THE federal government will spend $20 million on a health contractor to run a hospital in West Africa, using Australian volunteers, to fight Ebola.

PRIME Minister Tony Abbott announced on Wednesday the government would hire Aspen Medical at a cost of $20 million to run a 100-bed centre in Sierra Leone until mid-2015.

Most of the estimated 240 staff will be African, but Mr Abbott said some would be international "and it's quite possibly even likely that some will be Australian".

Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said it was possible no Australians would be involved in providing vital care.

"It is a little difficult to understand exactly where these locally engaged staff will be coming from," she said, pointing out there were just 100 doctors serving the six million people of Sierra Leone before the Ebola crisis struck.

Mr Abbott said contracting out the health service was in line with other Australian aid efforts such as the fight against cholera.

He said British authorities had agreed to treat any Australians working in Ebola-affected parts of west Africa as though they were UK citizens.

Aspen will pull out workers who contract the virus and a mandatory quarantine will apply to any Australians before they return home.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the plan was welcome but overdue, and the government had not gone far enough to use Australian skills to defeat the disease at its source.

"There are many Australians who wish to volunteer to use their skills - committed and capable doctors and nurses who wish to help in the fight against Ebola," he told reporters.

A further $4 million will be spent on logistical support for Ebola teams and training for health staff in countries such East Timor and Papua New Guinea to deal with potential outbreaks.

Mr Abbott said he expected Aspen would have staff in Sierra Leone within days, and the treatment centre would operate by the end of November.

"I think the Australian people expect our priorities to be prevention at home, preparedness in the region, and work in the wider world and that's what we are doing," he said.

The overall fatality rate for Ebola, which has claimed the lives of about 5000 people, has dropped from 49 per cent to 36 per cent.

However, more than half of the 523 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus have died.

Airports are stepping up checks of passengers coming in from West Africa and other affected regions.

Health Minister Peter Dutton said the risk to Australia remained very low.

Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler said the government announcement was welcome, but more details were needed on training, safety and resources, and how many Australians would be involved.

Ebola deal breakthrough

VOLUNTEER medical crews could soon be dispatched by the federal government to ebola-stricken west Africa to fight the deadly virus.

An announcement is expec-ted as early as today, with the UK predicted to provide a much-needed guarantee to treat any Australian who contracts the disease.

Prime Minister Tony Abb-ott will not order any Australian into the danger zone. He has been cautious about sending a team to the region because there has been no guarantee that Western allies would be in a position to treat Australians.

Prior to a deal being struck, Australian ebola victims would have had to endure a 30-hour flight with several stops before they made it back home.

It is believed the National Security Committee has agreed to allow UK doctors to treat Australian victims.

All volunteers would have to undergo a 21-day isolation ­period before being allowed back in the community.

Last night, a spokesman for Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph the government was looking at a number of measures.

“In recent weeks the government has discussed the evolving situation, including measures to treat health workers, with our partners, in particular the United Kingdom and the United States,” the spokesman said.

“The government is considering these discussions and how it might best contribute further to the response.” Australia has contributed $18 million to the fight against the lethal ebola virus, which has already killed more than 5000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.

But the dangers couldn’t be more apparent after a doctor in Sierra Leone became yet another victim of ebola last night, the fifth doctor to die of the disease there, local authorities said.

UNICEF has announced it will double its staff in the three West African nations hard hit by the virus.

At the United Nations in New York, ebola co-ordinator Peter Salama of UNICEF said the children’s agency would double its staff from 300 to 600 in Guinea, Liberia and in Sierra Leone, where children make up 20 per cent of all ebola cases.

About 4000 children had been orphaned by the ebola outbreak, Dr Salama said. The death of Godfrey ­George of Kambia Government Hospital in northern ­Sierra Leone, was a blow to ­efforts to keep desperately needed health workers safe in a country ravaged by the world’s worst ebola outbreak.

In response to the biggest and deadliest ebola outbreak in history, the WHO has announced that it is electing a new regional director for its Africa office this week. Critics say it’s about time.

Coalition strikes a deal to fight virus

THE Federal Government is on the brink of facilitating volunteer Australian crews to fly to ebola-stricken west Africa to fight the deadly virus.

An announcement is expec-ted as early as today with Britain predicted to provide a much-needed guarantee to treat any Australian who contracts the disease.

Prime Minister Tony Abb-ott will not order any Australian into the danger zone. Mr Abbott has been cautious in sending a team to the region because there was no guarantee allies would be in a position to treat Australians.

Prior to a deal being struck Australians would have had to endure a 30-hour flight with several stops before they made it back home.

It is believed the National Security Committee has agreed to the plan. Volunteers would have to undergo a 21-day isolation ­period before they are allowed back in the community.

A spokesman for Mr Abbott last night told The Daily Telegraph the government was looking at a number of measures.

“In recent weeks, the government has discussed the evolving situation, including measures to treat health workers, with our partners, in particular the United Kingdom and the United States,” the spokesman said.

“The government is considering these discussions and how it might best contribute further to the response.” Australia has contributed $18 million to the fight.

By last month, Sierra Leone had nearly 3000 reported cases of the disease, with 930 deaths. Worldwide, the virus has killed nearly 3900 people.

The US Centres for Disease Control last month projected that “without addit-ional interventions or changes in community behaviour, CDC estimates that by January 20, 2015, there will be a total of approximately 550,000 ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone or 1.4 million if corrections for underreporting are made.”However, according to work by a leading Australian economic modeller, Warwick McKibbin, the ultimate damage might be considerably greater.

Let’s scratch chicken pox from our children

It started with a cough. Then a runny nose. Then the dreaded note from kindy that two kids in my daughter’s class had the chicken pox. The next day, my own little chicken woke up with pox.

My fully immunised chicken, that is.

She caught it off her fully immunised friends. But don’t worry, the doctor says, it will be mild because of the vaccinations.

Wrong. It was not mild. It was bloody horrendous. She was covered with itchy, angry red spots from head to toe. They were in her ears, around her eyes, ­between her toes. My poor little darling was a mess.

And, after a week of sleepless quarantine in our own little torture chamber, so were we.

In the interest of unity, I kept my youngest daughter home in the hope she would get it and we could be done with the virus all at once, but she only got one spot.

So how does one sister get 300 spots, and the other get one? Well, our GP says the chicken pox vaccine is only 98 per cent effective, so one in 50 children, like lucky us, will be unlucky and get the full hog.

And after experiencing one case so mild it was like she never had it, compared to one so vile it was like we could never leave the house again, I just don’t know how any parent could make the decision not to vaccinate their children.

Not only is it irresponsible and harmful to other parents and their unknowing offspring, but it puts your own children at risk. The ones you were made to protect. And that’s not right.

At the risk of being forever hounded by passionate anti-vaxxers, the myths and misconceptions about ­immunisation have to stop.

They do not cause autism. Or asthma. Or AIDS.

Side effects are rare. Vaccines are safe. They are tested properly, and are essential to protect children. And I know chicken pox is no ebola but, after experiencing such a bad dose on such a little girl, I just don’t know how you could choose to do that to them.

I don’t know about you, but I don’t want whooping cough or measles or anything else in my household — one week housebound was enough, trust me.

So it worries me that almost 80,000 Australian children are not vaccinated. Australian Childhood Immunisation Register statistics show in some states nearly 10 per cent of infants are not properly vaccinated against dangerous childhood diseases, and that number is growing.

I am happy that new laws in NSW mean a child can’t be enrolled at childcare unless they are fully vaccinated — and I am proud that happened after the Daily and Sunday Telegraph’s No Jab No Play campaign, which highlighted how communities in NSW had vaccination rates below 50 per cent, lower than some third world countries.

I don’t know if that’s an ‘‘I don’t believe in it’’ thing, an ‘‘I’m too busy’’ thing, or an ‘‘oh no I forgot’’ thing, but it has to be a priority.

I’m not ashamed to admit I am a medicine advocate. If I have a headache, I have Panadol, which I take with the water I know my body needs. If my eldest daughter has a fever, she likes the pink Nurofen. Not the white liquid strawberry flavour, mind you — it must be pink. If my baby is teething, we’ll rub on the Bonjela. Nose spray, eye drops, antibiotics — whatever the body needs to heal, the body shall get. I don’t understand the theory of waiting it out.

Why remain in pain when you don’t have to? Why let your children suffer when they don’t have to?

I am now wise to the chicken pox booster shot, which makes the vaccine 99 per cent effective, and if I ever have another child, yes I will be subjecting them to that. It beats a week of scratching, whingeing and feeling like a bad mother because I couldn’t prevent her from this preventable pain.So, on behalf of my ­spotty, scratchy and super uncomfortable little ­chicken, please do the right thing and vaccinate your children.

Australia near deal to help fight Ebola

THE federal government has reportedly reached an agreement that would allow it to help Australian health workers fight the deadly Ebola virus.

THE federal government has reportedly reached a deal with Britain that gives it confidence to help send Australian workers.

The prime minister's office did not confirm the report but said the government is considering discussions it has had with partners, in particular the United Kingdom and United States, about the evolving situation, including measures to treat health workers.

"The government is considering these discussions and how it might best contribute further to the response," a spokesman said on Tuesday.

Up until now it has been reluctant to send health workers to Ebola-affected areas, arguing there is no way to get them home safely if they catch the virus.

They have been negotiating to set up evacuation plans with various countries.

Fairfax Media has reported it has sealed a deal and the government will announce an agreement with a British field hospital in Sierra Leone, and that Britain has agreed to treat Australian volunteers as if they were their own.

Infected Australian workers would be evacuated to Britain or possibly access treatment in Germany, Fairfax says.

The ABC says it has been told cabinet's National Security Committee had decided to assist volunteers who want to travel to Ebola hotspots in Sierra Leone.

Labor has argued the best way to fight Ebola is at its source in west Africa.

"I would be delighted to see Australia increase its efforts," Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek told AAP on Tuesday.

"That includes our government supporting Australian health workers willing and able to go to help on the ground."

Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler said he would welcome the news, if it proved to be true.

He said there are many doctors and nurses keen to do this work and who understood the risks involved.

"It says a lot about the courage and commitment of doctors and nurses to their fellow man that they do put themselves in harm's way to go and do this incredibly important work," Professor Owler told AAP.

Ebola has killed almost 5000 people so far and the World Health Organisation has recorded more than 13,000 cases but says the real number of infections and deaths could be much higher.

Australia has enhanced border screening of people arriving from west African countries.

The government says it's ready to deal with any confirmed Ebola cases here or in the region.

UNICEF says at least 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to Ebola.

AT least 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to the disease, according to UNICEF.

Many have nowhere to go as extended families are refusing to care for them, the Disasters Emergency Committee said.

Save The Children is working in the remote Kailahun district in Sierra Leone, one of the worst affected areas in the country.

One of the young boys they are supporting lost his father and six members of his family to Ebola.

Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said children are suffering the most.

"One of the main tragedies of Ebola is that many children, who have already witnessed one or both parents dying in terrible circumstances, are now being abandoned because people are so terrified of contracting the disease.

"The traditional safety net of community support is under threat."

Armageddon outta my mind

I was mulling over my Armageddon Action Plan this week and wondering if I needed to make some tweaks. Come the zombie apocalypse, obviously one needs to be prepared.

What’s that, you say? I’ve totally lost it? Well, hold on, Mr and Mrs Sceptical of Sans Souci, I’m not quite as crazy as I seem.

After all, there was a whole episode about the topic last week on Dr Who, so it must be true. The Doctor had to tackle the imminent demise of the planet from a super solar flare causing an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP as we Doomsday Preppers like to say.

In truth, solar storms are expected about once a century. The last big one, known as the Carrington event in 1859, blew the telegraph wire system. Luckily, back then, they didn’t depend on communication to run society, so it only singed a few telegrams. But now? Imagine if our power sources and internet went down for even one day. There’d be chaos.

As for zombies, well, how do you think the general public would behave if they couldn’t get their Weetbix and milk from Woolies for a week? Most folk have got enough food in their home to last about 10 days. After that, unless you live off the grid, you’re stuffed. (This is where eco warriors in Mullumbimby start punching the air and saying, “See, I told you” whilst hiding their quinoa.) Anyone who is a fan of the zombie apocalypse genre, as I am, knows that come the end of the world, you need to do the following: 1. Slip into your post-apocalyptic outfit of khaki pants, boots and a large hat. Under no circumstances get caught out in your jim jams, as you’ll be stuck in these for the rest of your days.

2. Embark on a long, arduous journey across country to save a loved one and/or the world, while everyone else herds in a large building and dies.

3. Head to a country location where you can become self-sufficient. 4. Form a community of like-minded people in above country locale but expect one bad seed with whom you have to do battle.

5. Ward off attackers/zombies ad infinitum.

In order to achieve the above, you need to be ready to Bug Out (prepper speak for get out of the city). You need a BOB (Bug Out Bag – survival kit), a BOL (a Bug Out Location — see point three) and a BOV (Bug Out Vehicle, in other words your car), to get out WTSHTF (When the shit, oh, you get it now).

My plan involves heading to my mate Graham’s house in the bush in (*location suppressed for security). It occurred to me that I hadn’t ever mentioned this to Graham, so I gave him a ring. “That’s fine,” he said. Had he stockpiled supplies, or should I bring some? “Just pop in to Dural Liquorland on the way.” There are many doomsday scenarios, of course, from natural disasters to economic meltdown, fuel crises to ebola.

In the TV series Doomsday Preppers (pictured), on 7mate, American preppers show off their plans for TEOTWAWKI (The end of the world as we know it). They mainly fear World War III, the collapse of the American economy and an EMP. Most of their plans involve stockpiling food and guns. Lots of them.

Texan family man Robert, for example, proudly showed off his arsenal, which was about the same as that of a small emerging nation and included everything from pistols to machine guns and a bazooka. He’s also building an invisible tree house for his family to hide in, which is very cunning, apart from the fact that millions of people around the world now know exactly where it is.

“Protecting my home” is a recurrent theme with US preppers, who tend to favour firearms, tanks and booby trap systems for invaders. Note to self: if the zombie apocalypse happens whilst holidaying in America, for God’s sake don’t pop next door unannounced for some milk.

Australian preppers are a little more moderate. They congregate on the forum Ozprepper.com and most agree they’d give anyone who knocked on their door a drink and a snack (nice, I thought), with only one bloke saying that he would be setting up man traps under his windows. He has a lot of tomatoes, evidently, so proposed to blow off people’s feet.

But, being Australia, there’s little or no mention of guns. The most popular item in the shopping section is, rather surprisingly, embroidered name tags (well, those Bug Out Bags do look awfully similar), followed by a Bear Grylls compass.

Meanwhile, according to the Australian Emergency Management Institute’s site em.gov.au, everyone truly should have a survival kit and plan ready. And it turns out silly old me isn’t quite so daft after all, as they recommend all families arrange two meeting points — one near their home, and the other a place in the country where you should head to and meet in an emergency.

Just not Graham’s house, as I booked in first.And I’d avoid that man with the tomatoes, too, if I were you.

Ebola Crisis getting worse: charity

AN atmosphere of "fear and anxiety" exists in Sierra Leone as the Ebola crisis gets worse, says Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth.

AN atmosphere of "fear and anxiety" pervades the region, Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said on a trip to Freetown in Sierra Leone.

"I think it's still getting worse. It's going to get even worse before we get on top of it. We are still behind the curve," he said.

"We are in this race against time. There is enormous fear and anxiety."

Forsyth said he did not leave the country feeling "despair" and reported that there are signs that aid is making a difference, and there is "more action on the ground".

He praised the "inspirational" efforts of staff risking their lives to help bring the crisis under control.

"Save the Children staff who have lost relatives and loved ones have come into work and carried on the fight against Ebola.

"The whole country is mobilising. The international staff who are coming - families back home are very worried. It is an amazingly brave and courageous thing to do. People are putting their lives on the line."

On Saturday the Disasters Emergency Committee said it has been "overwhelmed" by the "extraordinary generosity" of the British public after STG4 million ($A7.30 million) was donated in just two days to a campaign to help people affected by the Ebola crisis in west Africa.

The UK Government has pledged to match the first STG5 million given by the public and its STG4 million contribution brings the fund total to STG8 million since the campaign was launched on Thursday.

So far, almost 5,000 people have been killed by the virus and more than 13,000 have been infected, although experts say the real figures could be much higher.

VATICAN’S MORAL COMPASS HAS BEEN REPLACED BY GPS

Inside the Vatican, not much has changed. There are books with gentle brown stains of age, stunning art collected and ­acquired, soft talk and ­repeated catechisms.

And it’s still being run by a group of old men who have never had sex. Over the past couple of weeks they have been trying to play catch-up. While the world has been holding back ebola and Islamic State terrorists, avoiding car accidents, growing food and sorting tasks, the church has been holding an Extraordinary Synod on the family, where the key topics covered included how to deal with gays, unmarried couples and whether or not communion should be given to ­divorced Catholics.

The agenda is like strolling through a museum and looking at an ancient spear on display — then wondering how anyone managed to throw it, let alone catch some food.

Their ideas and questions are wonders from another time. But the church is still ­trying to answer.

There is a new Pope. And he’s a rockstar.

Pope Francis is kind, progressive and manages to stir the crowd to love and good deeds. But this Synod reminds us he’s still the captain of an ageing cricket team — full of chunky pacemen, flat spinners and a batting order that can never find the middle.

The thought of the cardinals and bishops tilting their heads forward, nodding and having soft ponderings about homosexuality and divorce is a little childish.

Perhaps it’s the Pope’s way of giving the old boys a shake. But it seems to be more a panoply of irrelevance.

How many gays were asked to speak? How many divorced women from loveless conjugal experiments? How many ­unmarried couples who still hold hands after 20 years? How many of their children? How many folk who just enjoy a good cuddle in the grass?

Not many? None. Yet they debate, discuss and decide if they should be accepted or how they should be dealt with.

The Roman Catholic Church — like all other human temples built on the promise of divine connections — has had its place in the world.

It was a moral compass when there was none. And even though it watched a few evils unfold, it still managed to stop others.

But when that compass started pointing away from ­humanity, we all went out and bought ourselves a GPS. The blessing of the church started to mean less and less. And their definition of family is no longer required.

They are the pioneers who stopped to fix a wheel on the wagon while the rest of us went on to build the world.

THE Australian dollar has pushed back above US88c, boosted by improving investor confidence on the back of solid US economic growth figures.

Investors were buoyed overnight Thursday after it was revealed US GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the September quarter, beating market growth forecasts of 3 per cent.

FXCM market analyst David de Ferranti said the news helped the Aussie to ­regain the ground lost after the US Federal Reserve wrapped up its multi-billion-dollar asset-purchasing program.

“Positive investor sentiment aided a rebound for the high-yielding currencies ­including the Aussie and Kiwi in overnight trade (on Thursday),” Mr de Ferranti said.

“The concerns over ebola and slowing growth in Europe are being overshadowed by healthy US economic data.”Despite a busy week looming for economic data — ­including jobs, retail spending, trade figures and the Reserve Bank’s board meeting — the Aussie is not expected to break through US89c.

TRAVEL group Flight Centre says achieving its profit growth targets will not be a "formality" amid volatility in Australia and strength overseas

MANAGING director Graham Turner said achieving a previously forecast five-to-eight per cent rise in underlying pre-tax profit would "not be a formality".

"While we are experiencing some volatility in Australia, our international businesses are generally performing well," Mr Turner told the company's annual general meeting.

In August the company forecast an underlying pre-tax profit of $395 million and $405 million.

Mr Turner said first half profit growth for 2014/15 was likely to be subdued, with the result expected to be broadly in line with the corresponding period last year.

Australian first quarter sales increased three to four per cent compared to the previous first quarter but this was at a slower rate than the company's overall growth rate of around seven per cent.

"This slower-than-normal sales growth and an increased cost base means that Australian profits are currently down slightly on the prior year," he said.

Mr Turner said a change in consultant wage structures had contributed to extra costs.

He added that the company did not believe a recent devaluation in the Australian dollar was responsible for slower growth in Australian outbound departures.

Still, Flight Centre said first quarter results indicate it is tracking in line with the same period in the 2014 financial year after the UK, South Africa and Singapore started 2014/15 solidly.

In contrast to the SARS outbreak more than a decade ago, the Ebola epidemic was not having a meaningful impact on travel as the affected parts of West Africa were not mainstream tourist destinations, he said.

Shares in Flight Centre fell $1.17, or 2.7 per cent, to $42.30 at 1305 AEDT.

100 Doors analyst Peter Esho said the stock was being re-rating based on a more appropriate earnings multiple.

"Flight Centre is probably a victim of their own success because as they've outperformed consistently and the expectations are there for the market," Mr Esho said.

AN 18-year-old woman has been discharged from a Brisbane hospital after twice testing negative for the deadly Ebola virus.

"THE patient has undergone a second round of testing and results show that she does not have Ebola Virus Disease," a statement from Queensland Health said on Wednesday.

The woman has been discharged from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.

A Queensland Health spokeswoman told AAP the 18-year-old woman has been discharged from hospital to complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home.

She's expected to return to normal life mid-next week.

The woman was one of 19 people from four African families who agreed to go into home isolation earlier this month, after travelling to Queensland from parts of west Africa ravaged by the deadly virus.

She was taken to hospital after coming down with a fever. The others in isolation appear to be well.

The 18-year-old is the third person in Queensland to have been tested for Ebola.

Earlier on Wednesday, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said all people arriving in Australia from Ebola-affected countries should be tested for the disease regardless of their symptoms.

Mr Newman wrote to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison requesting new measures be taken to protect the country from Ebola.

The premier called for quarantine workers to test all passengers coming from Ebola-affected areas for the disease within 24 hours of their arrival.

He said travellers coming from Ebola zones should have to give their contact details and their temperature recordings to quarantine officers.

Mr Newman said within 24 hours of their arrival they should undergo comprehensive Ebola assessments.

Australia is yet to confirm a single Ebola case, but the Queensland government has been talking about the looming threat and its actions to protect against it nearly daily.

GLOBAL vaccine group Gavi could help tackle Ebola says Julie Bishop, after announcing another $50 in funding.

FOREIGN Minister Julie Bishop announced the extra funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which funds immunisation programs in developing countries.

The money takes Australia's commitment over the past five years to $250 million, and makes it the alliance's seventh largest donor.

Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has immunised 440 million children, and says it has saved six million from diseases such as hepatitis B, measles, meningitis and yellow fever.

Ms Bishop said the alliance - which includes the World Health Organisation and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - is investigating whether to help distribute an Ebola vaccine.

Two vaccines are undergoing human trials, while others are in development, she says.

Ms Bishop believes Gavi is well placed to scale up access as soon as one of the vaccines is proven safe and effective.

It could get a new vaccine to many people quickly and at an affordable price, she told a function in Canberra on Wednesday.

A SYDNEY doctor has slammed NSW Health for providing GPs with nothing but a fact sheet on identifying patients with ebola — saying he would refuse to treat patients who had visited Africa.

The Belrose doctor, who declined to be named, has written to the NSW opposition, saying his surgery has no protective gear and staff there “would be telling any patient who identified themselves as coming from West Africa not to come to our practice at all”.

The NSW Health flyer sent to NSW GP offices advises doctors to call their local public health unit and isolate any patient with a fever who has been to West Africa in the past 21 days. Opposition health spokesman Walt Secord said GPs were on the frontline of Australia’s ebola response and should be better supported by NSW Health, calling on minister Jillian Skinner to provide GPs with ebola suits.“The state government should provide them with appropriate information and protective clothing so they can make informed clinical decisions,” Mr Secord said.

There are a lot of distressing issues in the world right now. Ebola, Islamic State, Syrian refugees, sexual brutality of women in India, missing and downed planes, The Bachelor. (Just kidding about The Bachelor. Let’s never speak of it again.) Yes, there are a lot of serious issues — so much so that many of my friends now refrain from reading the news at all. They, like much of the population, are suffering from ‘‘bad news fatigue’’. They want happy news about hero cats and adorable toddlers who say “apparently” a lot.

They believe they are better off not knowing what’s going on in the world, or at least not knowing about it in any sort of depth. Murder, rape, death and destruction — let world leaders and the UN deal with it. If it’s ignored, maybe it won’t exist.

I understand how difficult it can be to see the cruelty we are capable of inflicting on one another. I know it would be easier to turn a blind eye to upsetting events. But I also know that it would be worse to not know. These issues require thought, discussion, opinion and debate. Knowledge forms the way the world is shaped.

As Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke said: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” There may not be much we can do to contribute from a physical perspective but we can gain knowledge, and share this knowledge with others. We can make informed decisions.People say they care about what’s happening in the world, but don’t want to read about it because caring hurts. They’re right, caring does hurt. But we can’t say we care if we aren’t willing to at least suffer the mental anguish of knowing. This is the cost of caring. We must all pay the price.

UBS has reported a third-quarter net profit of 762 million Swiss francs.

BUT Switzerland's largest bank warns of intensifying challenges and geopolitical issues, including new concerns such as Ebola virus, and a mixed outlook for global growth.

UBS said in a statement on Tuesday its results include a high capital cushion "well ahead of" what is required and net tax benefit of 1.3 billion francs that reflects annual revaluation of deferred tax assets and net charges of 1.8 billion francs for litigation, regulatory and other matters.

The Zurich-based bank's CEO Sergio Ermotti said "the business is far stronger, its earnings power is much greater."

THE federal government has temporarily blocked West ­African refugees from coming to Australia until the ebola ­crisis is resolved.

There are 120 visa holders in ebola-infected countries currently seeking entry to ­Australia. Seventy-three are on temporary visas and have had those visas cancelled while 47 are permanent visa holders having their cases managed through various protocols.

Immigration minister Scott Morrison said all humanitarian entrance programs from the ­region, which includes the worst-hit countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, had been suspended until Australia’s safety could be guaranteed.

“The government has strong controls for the entry of persons to Australia under our immigration program from West Africa,’’ he said. “These measures include temporarily suspending of our immigration program, including our ­humanitarian program from ebola-infected countries, and this means we’re not processing any application from the affected countries.” The suspension follows Queensland’s latest ebola scare, in which an 18-year-old African migrant tested negative for ebola yesterday after being placed into isolation in a Brisbane hospital on Sunday with a fever. The teen arrived in Australia after leaving ­Guinea’s capital of Conakry 13 days ago.

Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young said the teenager’s family arrived in Brisbane for humanitarian ­reasons. The patient, who is still in the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, will have a second ebola test tomorrow.

Dr Young has also met the state’s chief magistrate to ­discuss whether the health authorities could get a court order to force people ­suspected of carrying the ­deadly virus into isolation until tests ruled out an infection.

Mr Morrison said screening had been stepped up in August.

“The customs and border protection services introduced a new ­profile to assist screening of ­arrivals and that has ­resulted in more than 830 matches ­referred on for further assessment by other officers.” Mr Morrison said permanent visa holders returning from West Africa had been ‘‘thrice checked’’ and those still away would be quarantined for 21 days before ­returning.

Meanwhile a fight is brewing in the US between health authorities and the ­governors of New York and New Jersey over their 21-day quarantines for volunteer health workers returning from West Africa.WORLD PAGE 17

THE fear in the US over the ebola outbreak has made for bizarre but perfect timing for Halloween, with sexy hazmat costumes selling fast and haunted houses styled as ebola containment centres.

Texan James Faulk tapped into the Lone Star State’s fears over the killer virus after decorating his house like an ebola hazmat scene.

The country’s only death from ebola was in Dallas on October 8, with two further infections at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where Liberian man Thomas Eric Duncan,was treated.

“It was scary, and that’s why this thing came to mind so quickly. Ebola is scary and it scared me. It scared everybody,” Mr Faulk said.

While some neighbours said the set-up was a reflection of Mr Faulk’s humour, he has come under fire on Twitter and even had his landlord threaten to remove the decoration.“You know I’m a happy-go-lucky guy, and that’s what it’s all about,” Faulk said.

AUSTRALIAN authorities are arranging for people who travel from west Africa to go into voluntary isolation on arrival, in what seems to be a new policy.

NINETEEN people from four African families agreed to go into isolation earlier this month after travelling to Queensland from areas ravaged by the deadly virus.

One of them, an 18-year-old woman, gave authorities a scare when she came down with a fever.

She tested negative to Ebola on Monday and will be retested on Wednesday.

All the others in isolation appear to be well, Queensland's chief health officer Jeannette Young said.

Dr Young told reporters on Monday the federal government had advised them the four families would be arriving in Queensland from west Africa under a humanitarian program, but wouldn't identify their countries.

Officials had liaised with their relatives in Australia to work out details of the isolation.

Dr Young said all of them agreed, before coming into the country, to go into home quarantine.

She said two Queensland health workers in west Africa would undergo a similar quarantine when they returned.

She said she had not been advised of any other potentially risky impending arrivals.

"I don't have any specific details of any further families coming but we'll be told if there are any families coming under one of the humanitarian programs," she said.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday the new processes were working.

"There are good processes, clear processes. They've been applied and they are working," he told ABC radio.

Authorities have reiterated the risk of an Ebola outbreak in Australia remained very low.

Efforts to develop a treatment for the deadly disease, which has claimed nearly 4500 lives in west Africa, are underway.

CSL hopes to use the blood of people who've survived Ebola to cure infected people.

The blood plasma products and vaccine maker is working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organisation on investigating the use of "hyper immune" blood plasma products.

"You collect plasma from Ebola patients that have recovered ... and then manufacture specialised hyper immune products that can be delivered back into patients," CSL chief Paul Perreault told reporters on Monday.

"But it is very early days."

CSL uses so-called hyper immune products to treat tetanus and rabies.

LIBERAL MP Dr Peter Phelps thinks ebola is a bit of a joke.

So say his tweets.

Risking the almost certain ire of Twitter haters, the grandstanding government whip launched a serious of bizarre, insensitive tweets that mocked Queensland for being “beautiful one day; pandemic the next’’.

The tweets were lobbed just hours after Queensland Health confirmed an 18-year-old African migrant was being tested for the deadly virus, while her family members remains isolated in home quarantine. Other tweets included the rather nonsensical “NSW might have the State of Origin shield, but Queensland has #Ebola’’, and the truly deep and profound rambling of ``EBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLAEBOLA!!!!” Then he really got his game on; turning to the classic game of geographic portmanteau to wow his followers.

“Queensbola”. “Brisbola”. “Townsbola”.

Indeed, true wit at work.

Contacted by The Daily Telegraph last night, Dr Phelps didn’t know what all the fuss was about.“I am just parodying the general hysteria about ebola that is going on.”

LATEST NEWS 18-YEAR-OLD AFRICAN PATIENT IN ISOLATION AT BRISBANE HOSPITAL WILL RECEIVE TESTS FOR EBOLA TODAY ARRIVED FROM WEST AFRICA 12 DAYS AGO AUSTRALIAN MAN ALSO ON EBOLA WATCH IN THAILAND HAD RECENTLY TRAVELLED TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO

AN African migrant is being tested for ebola in a Brisbane hospital in Australia’s latest scare on the killer virus, while eight of her family members remain quarantined in their home.

Queensland health authorities have also confirmed three other families who recently arrived from West Africa have been placed in home isolation for 21 days.

The revelation came as an Australian man living in Thailand was also forced into quarantine after arriving in Bangkok from the Congolese jungle with a fever.

The 18-year-old African woman arrived in Brisbane with her family 12 days ago and was immediately placed in home isolation after informing health authorities she had recently travelled in areas of West Africa where severe ebola outbreaks had occurred, including her departure port of Conakry, the disease-ravaged capital of Guinea.

On Saturday night the woman developed a fever and she was rushed to the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital yesterday.

“She didn’t have known contact with anyone that was sick with the ebola virus disease, but she did come from an area that had a reasonably large number of cases, so that’s why we thought it appropriate that she go into home quarantine when she arrived here,’’ Queensland’s chief health officer Jeanette Young said. “Today on the routine daily call that we have in place to check if everyone is okay, she told the person that she had a fever last night so we sent an ambulance to pick her up from her home. The ambulance (officers) wore full protective equipment.’’ The woman’s test results will be known today, while a further blood test will be conducted on Wednesday. The remaining members of the family, including six children, have not exhibited any symptoms.

Ms Young said there was no risk for any travellers seated next to the woman on the plane inbound to the Australia, given her fever developed while in isolation: “There was no risk to the community at all because she hasn’t left the house or had any visitors in the time she has been in Brisbane.

“She doesn’t remember coming into contract with anyone with the ebola virus disease, so it is unlikely.

“But there is always that potential. The fact that she’s had a fever which is one of the first signs of ebola symptoms, is a concern.’’ Meanwhile, the unnamed Australian man ordered into quarantine in his Thai home had flown into the country from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 49 people have died from ebola.

He had returned to Thailand on October 17, with border security officials at Bangkok’s airport reporting him to health officials after he recorded an elevated temperature.The Brisbane case is Queensland’s second ebola scare, following the testing of Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack who developed a fever after returning from Sierra Leone. She returned a negative test.

EBOLA CRISIS Exclusive: Australia may send volunteers to West Africa

AUSTRALIAN health workers could soon be ­flying to West Africa under a government-­sanctioned program to help fight the ebola virus.

The revelations follow a Brisbane hospital’s ­decision yesterday to isolate a female patient who came down with a fever after returning from West Africa.

The Daily Telegraph has learned that the ­federal government is considering a plan to help send volunteer medical teams to the West African region – but only on condition that the workers are ­quarantined overseas for 21 days before returning to Australia.

The plan is one of several options canvassed in recent meetings of ­the cabinet’s National Security Committee. A senior government source confirmed it was also the most likely option if human assets were to be ­deployed to the region.

The news came as the World Health Organisation yesterday revealed the number of people infected by the ebola epidemic in West Africa had reached 10,000, of whom nearly 5000 have died.

The US government has introduced policy requiring all travellers ­coming to the country from ebola-­affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days, starting today. New York and New ­Jersey have gone further and ordered mandatory quarantine.

The Australian federal government source told The Daily Telegraph that the only way the Abbott government would back sending a volunteer team – most likely drawn from Ausmat – was if the Western coalition agreed to build a field hospital in the hot zone to act as a quarantine station for Western workers who had contact with ebola victims.

It would also be used to treat any medical worker infected.

The medical teams would have to agree to undergo a 21-day quarantine process before being allowed to return to Australia.

The plan would involve volunteers only and would not be a military ­operation. The non-negotiable condition of overseas quarantine was imposed on advice that if ebola was ever to reach Australia it would most likely be via a health worker or expat mining worker returning home, and not West African nationals, who are already screened when they arrive.

The majority of ebola cases to have appeared in counties outside the zone have been in medical and health workers returning home from West Africa.

Labor frontbencher Richard Marles said the Abbott government had to ­accept that Australia had a role to play in the crisis.“When you have a country like Cuba, with a GDP of less than 5 per cent of ours, which has 250 medical personnel in West Africa, the fact that we have essentially said ‘it’s West Africa’s problem and we will deal with it if and when it comes to Australia’ is a disgrace. If we are going to deal with this issue, much better to deal with it in West Africa than when it reaches our border,” he said.

Toll rising as health workers begin to panic

FREETOWN NEW figures reveal more than 10,000 people have been infected with ebola as the US ambassador to the United Nations has headed to visit all three of the West African countries hardest hit.

Samantha Power’s visit to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone — where more than 4900 have died from the disease — followed reports of panic among New York hospital staff over the first case of the deadly disease to hit the city.

The World Health Organisation figures on the reported cases of the current outbreak showed nearly half of those infected — 4,922 people — have died.

The ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest outbreak of the disease with a rapidly rising death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where Ms Power will visit national ebola co-ordination centres and meet US and UN staff on the ground.

Neighbouring Mali has been on high alert since it was reported a two-year-old who died of the disease in the country had been bleeding uncontrollably on a packed bus during a 1000km trip from Guinea. There have also been cases in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the US.

The latest case in the US is in New York where Dr Craig Spencer was diagnosed with ebola after returning from a stint treating the epidemic in Guinea.

Dr Spencer, 33, is being treated in an isolation unit at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, where staff at the hospital have called in sick rather than treat him, the New York Post reported.

The paper said those who showed up were terrified to enter his isolation chamber.

“The nurses on the floor are miserable with a ‘why me?’ attitude, scared to death and overworked because all their co-workers called out sick,” one source said.

“One nurse even went as far as to pretend she was having a stroke to get out of working there, but once they cleared her in the ER they sent her back up.” Dr Spencer’s fiancee has reportedly told friends the pair are doing well. Morgan Dixon, who shares an apartment with the victim, is to be released from hospital quarantine along with two friends who went bowling with Dr Spencer before he fell ill.

Nina Pham, the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse, was released from hospital virus-free on the weekend after testing positive for the virus this month after treating Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan.

But Ms Pham, who was thanked by US President Barack Obama for her efforts,, was told she will have to wait before her dog Bentley is declared virus-free.

The king charles spaniel is set to be released from a quarantine period on November 1.WHO said that the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases has risen to 10,141. Its figures show about 200 new cases since the last report, four days ago.

But neither the AMA nor the Chief Medical Officer know who the people are, what sort of training they’ve had and whether they’re prepared. “It’s not the AUSMAT (Australian Medical Assistance) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work,” he said.

When the government announces tough measures to deal with the menace this week, they must ignore animal rights activists who care more about bats than people.

Abbott fiddles while ebola bushfire burns

IN West Africa right now ebola is raging like a bushfire. The blaze continues to burn out of control and is spreading when infected people travel – as we have seen in Senegal, ­Nigeria and the US.

As the fire gets bigger and bigger the likelihood of these spot fires of ebola, and their number, will increase.

Thousands have died and thousands more face an agonising death if the outbreak is not extinguished.

Ebola is a bushfire that, in our interconnected world, threatens us all. It must be fought by all those with the trained personnel and resources to help.

Right now that isn’t happening. Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) is still the largest ­responder to the outbreak providing nearly 700 of the only 1000 beds available to ebola patients. We see everyday how woefully inadequate this is to tackle the crisis.

The UN estimates this week that in order to beat ebola at least 4500 beds are needed, as well as 19,000 doctors and nurses of which only a fraction are already there.

There should be 500 trained and equipped burial teams working within six weeks — currently there are only 50. Of the 1000 vehicles required only 69 have arrived.

Australia has so far made a financial donation to the fight but not yet committed any trained personnel to the frontline. Hundreds of the affected countries’ own health care workers have died.

Only the support of foreign personnel can fill the critical gap in outbreak management and control.

As Australians know, when a bushfire hits the entire community is mobilised to send fire-fighters even from far off places. And there is a very short timeframe to make it happen. Médecins Sans Frontières has already deployed more than 300 international volunteers to West Africa, including 25 Aussies and Kiwis.

They are working alongside 3000 national staff in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Like all countries with the trained personnel and equipment to support, Australia should commit to sending medical and logistics teams immediately, as it has been formally asked to do by the US, UK, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Even relatively modest contributions can have significant impact.

It would be too easy to pretend a small response adds nothing. Not in the eyes of the patients Médecins Sans Frontières has had to turn away due to the lack of treatment cap-acity. The government has said it must wait until it has guarantees that Australians who may be infected in West Africa could be medically evacuated or get top quality treatment ­before making such a commitment. It is hard to believe that Australians working, for example, with the US or UK ebola response teams would not be able to access the same level of treatment as their American or British colleagues. Médecins Sans Frontières has successfully arranged medical evacuations for its two international staff who have been infected (both of whom have survived) and in fact every request for medical evacuation from international agencies on the ground has to date been met. This issue should not be a reason to hold back. It’s been three weeks since internat-ional governments asked Australia to send medical and logistics teams to West Africa. Every day lost waiting, the challenge becomes ­greater.

Australia shouldn’t be naive, this crisis is continuing to grow and there is no other alternative but to join the fight.

Médecins Sans Frontières has been calling for help since it started its emergency res-ponse in Guinea more than seven months ago.

Despite the fear-mongering, the probability that ebola will become a problem within Australia is very small.

However, the virus is now, and will continue to be, a problem for Australia as it threatens the global system of travel and trade, increases costs and dangers associated with protecting the country and the ­region. By acting now, Australia not only makes it more ­likely that these risks are eliminated but also increases its own preparedness and expertise to handle similar infectious threats in the future.

It is shameful that despite seeing the smoke from a distance, and receiving passionate calls from its allies and the ­affected communities for its help, Australia has chosen to simply hose down its own house and hope that others will keep the flames at bay.

The ebola bushfire is a global responsibility. Australia must be in it, boots and all.Paul McPhun is Executive ­Director of Médecins Sans Frontières Australia

THE number of people believed sickened by Ebola has passed 10,000, according to figures released by the World Health Organisation.

THE Geneva-based WHO said 10,141 people have been diagnosed with the deadly virus, an increase from its previous estimate of about 9000 cases.

It added that 4922 people have died from the virus, which has hit Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the hardest.

The UN organisation said that no new cases or deaths linked to the virus had been recorded in Liberia in the last three days.

In Sierra Leone, almost 200 new cases were reported, bringing the total number of infections to 3896.

Twenty-two people died of the disease in the last three days, WHO said.

Although the worst Ebola outbreak has been largely limited to west Africa, there have also been confirmed cases in the United States, Spain and Mali.

EXCLUSIVE Deep inside a biological bunker in regional Victoria five deadly strands of ebola are locked in a secret room.

The Saturday Telegraph today takes you inside — within metres of the deadly virus which has slain nearly 5000 in the current outbreak crippling West Africa — with the brave Australian scientists trying to find a cure.

With the virus threatening millions and the first case diagnosed in New York yesterday, strands of ebola have been flown in from West Africa and are being tested at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.

Fewer than a dozen people in the country know the precise location of the stored ebola in the facility.

Scientists researching the virus must shower in chemicals and put on completely airtight suits before entering the labs.

The vials of ebola are stored somewhere on the third level locked behind an unlabelled door where only the “tiny few who need to know” have access.

And there the lethal pathogens are suspended in an unremarkable looking pink solution in minuscule plastic canisters.

The high security government facility — specially picked for its geographical isolation — where ebola is stored received the deadly cargo in the past 12 months from a country in West Africa.

Ministerial approval from both countries was required to perform the transaction.

“Right now, we are the only place to hold ebola in Australia,” Dr Greg Smith, head of microbiological security at AAHL, a division of the CSIRO, said.

“If you can find the differences between a pathogenic strain and a non-pathogenic strain you can develop therapeutics.” Only 32 people have the relevant security clearance to work in the “PC4” containment labs where the virus is studied.

An even smaller number work with ebola.

Researchers undergo yearly medical and psychological evaluations and submit to stringent security checks including probes into any political motivations.

“Quite a particular person can work in these suits,” Dr Smith said. Beneath the lab level — encased between an extremely thick ceiling and floor — infectious pathogens trickle through waste pipes 30cm from your nose.

The waste is never pumped under pressure in case a pipe bursts. The highly hazardous substances flowing through are potentially more lethal than atomic bombs.

In fact, the HEPA filters — high efficiency particle air filters — which service the compound were developed during the Manhattan Project to remove radioactive dust from the atmosphere.

The unofficial motto of AAHL is “we don’t care about what gets in, we care about what gets out.” With that in mind, AAHL was designed to withstand floods and 6.5 magnitude earthquakes.

It sits in the middle of 4.5ha of grassland and is separated from the outside world by high fences and patrolled security gates.

Senior staff will not comment on whether armed guards are present throughout the grounds.

“We’re visited regularly by ASIO for security updates,” said Dr Smith. To enter the “secure area” where research is conducted, visitors and scientists must strip naked and change into prison-like CSIRO jumpsuits.

Everyone who leaves must shower for a minimum of three minutes. The CSIRO even allowed us to don the facility’s specialised PC4 lab suits to experience scientists’ working conditions.

“The concrete block,” as it is known to staff, is divided into rings by heavy metal airlock doors.

The air pressure increases from the innermost lab outwards so any potential spill is pushed in on itself.

Ebola is studied in a room at -300 pascals by scientists wearing the balloon suits.

And this is the vital question they want to know: “Why is the African strain fatal in humans but the Asian strain isn’t?” To find out, ebola is being put under the microscope to study its impact on small cell cultures and in experiments involving ferrets.

Dr Smith said researchers were extracting nucleic acid from the virus RNA in the hope of finding an elusive smoking gun that helps in the global fight against the virus.

But he was realistic about the tough path ahead: “Research is about failure”. The CSIRO facility housing the ebola virus in Australia is the most sophisticated in the world.

Originally set up to protect the nation’s agricultural industry, it is increasingly turning its work towards human infections.

In the last 10 to 15 years all human infectious diseases “of major concern” were borne of animals.Ebola, which is thought to be naturally hosted within bats, is just the latest of those — but one that has scientists and politicians worldwide in a state of mild panic.

THREE NURSES DESCRIBE DAILY LIFE IN WEST AFRICA, FROM DEATH AND SORROW TO THE JOY OF SURVIVAL

SUE ELLEN KOVACK (56) Australian Red Cross nurse, Kenema, Sierra Leone AT the start of the day, I check my hands for any cuts or scrapes that will bar me from donning PPE (personal protection equipment). Entering the centre, I must wash my hands in a chlorine solution. I balance on one foot as someone sprays the bottoms of my shoes with the solution before being allowed entry to the low-risk area.

I search for a pair of cold wet boots in my size, which have been soaking in chlorine for the night, and I change into my scrubs. I go straight to the whiteboard to see who has passed away during the night; today, it’s one of three nurses who was infected at work. One is on his way to good health, the other is still hanging on.

We need to synchronise putting the PPE on with other team members, because if one is slower than the rest we end up waiting and baking in the sun. We have a dresser to make sure we are completely covered, or we work in pairs and check each other. First on are gloves and a jumpsuit. Then a second pair of gloves, a thick duckbill mask, a hood, and an apron that is tied by the dresser so we can untie it with one pull.

Then on go the goggles with a generous drizzle of antifogging spray, a final check in the mirror and a final check with each other. The checking does not stop there as we must ensure during our time in the high-risk area that we are still covered, that a mask has not slipped or that a piece of skin has not been exposed. If that happens we leave the area ­immediately.

We check the time — 45 minutes to one hour is the maximum allowed in the PPE. We have the luxury of four nurses today. Patients who are feeling well enough are sitting on plastic chairs waiting for a meal. We might offer some pain relief or a smile from beneath our PPE (yes, you can smile with your eyes).

Hannah (not her real name) is sitting outside, greeting us with a big smile. She has lost all her children to ebola, as well as her husband. And here she is asking me how my evening was. The staff tell me she has had some bad moments, but all they can do is reassure her that she is young and can bear more children.

Others have not fared so well — too weak to sit up or get to the toilet or the shower block. We do our best to offer fluids, a wash and some ­paracetamol.

The local nursing staff have amazing courage to work in our centre. Their families ­ostracise them but they still come to try to bring an end to this brutal, invisible “war”.

In Africa it is usually the family that feeds, washes and comforts the patients. But no family members are allowed inside our treatment centre.

My three key words are warm, dry and comfortable. Patients who are too weak to move away from their own vomit, faeces and urine need the most help. We clean and care for as many as we can, but if we need to leave the area ­because of heat exhaustion or feeling unwell, the priority is to get out.

You are a danger to your colleagues if you go down in your PPE. After our nursing team goes in, the hygiene team suits up for their rounds. They clean up the vomit, diarrhoea and urine spills, the garbage and the ­nappies. Their task is ­monumental and they can be at most risk.

A minimum of five ­minutes is needed to undress. We have two tents where the undressers and sprayers need to be on the ball. The urge to just pull the suit off is strong, but we wait.

First, the chlorine spray to the hands. Then, feet apart, arms in the air, we are sprayed from head to toe, first the front, then the back. We wash our hands in chlorine. Off come the first set of gloves.

We wash our hands again. Off comes the apron; we pull it over our heads. Into the chlorine soak it goes. We wash our hands. Next go the ­goggles. We bend over, close our eyes and gently remove them, dunk them three times in the strong chlorine-filled bucket and then place them in water. We wash our hands.

The hood comes off next. Once again, we bend over, closing our eyes to avoid ­contamination and dispose of the hood in the garbage. We wash our hands.

Next, the removal of our heavy PPE. Moving slowly — we do everything slowly here — we carefully expose the zipper, hidden under a taped-down flap. We wash our hands. Blindly, we have to find the zipper as our undressers and sprayers guide us. We wash our hands.

As we shimmy out of our PPE we are soaked to the bone in sweat, but it feels great. This is the hardest part: to ease off the jumpsuit while kicking your legs back, at the same time standing on it so it doesn’t fly away from you. It’s a balancing act.

The sprayer sprays the ­entire jumpsuit with a stronger chlorine solution and we put it in the garbage. We wash our hands.

Our heavy-duty filtration mask is next. I close my eyes and hope it doesn’t catch in my ponytail. We wash our hands.

The last pair of gloves comes off. Our boots are sprayed from all angles and we have to balance on one foot to cross the line from high risk to low risk. We wash our hands and we are done, stripped down to our scrubs, soaked with sweat.

I need a rehydration ­solution or water. No food is allowed in the low-risk area. It is too risky to put anything near your mouth from your hands. But I still see people biting their nails, touching their face, rubbing their eyes — risky but automatic responses. Your hands have been washed a trillion times in chlorine, but still, you don’t know how safe your colleagues have been.

You are literally entrusting your life to your work mates. Before I left Australia I took to wearing a rubber band and each time I caught myself touching my face I snapped it painfully so I would remember not to do it.

I hear an ambulance and the siren is going fast — it may pass us and head to the next treatment centre, hours away. But it abruptly turns into our driveway and we run out to greet it. I suit up and prepare for the admissions with a package consisting of a ­blanket, soap, towel, cup, toothbrush and toothpaste, all in a covered bucket that will be used for vomit, faeces or urine if the person is unable to get to the latrines.

The ambulance door is opened and I can see a man on the stretcher, two legs in the air, stiff as a board. They ­slowly drop and I realise this patient is dying. He walked into the ­ambulance in Freetown but ­deterioration comes rapidly. I pronounce him dead, and move to the other patient.

The woman is lying on the floor between the seat and the stretcher, strapped in by seatbelts. She is trapped, a terrified look in her eyes.

She is flailing wildly, a dangerous situation in itself. I try to calm her while ­maintaining my distance. We move her as best we can but then I realise that she is just trying to cover her exposed area below her waist.

In her last moments this is her concern.

We manage to get her into a tent. We ask her name, if she is married. She responds, “I am married”, looks away and dies.

All that struggle and ­desperation in the ambulance and she only wanted to ­preserve her dignity.

That was a tough moment.

BRIDGET MULROONEY (36) American nurse working for the International Medical Corps in Bong County, Liberia.

I was working as a travel nurse at a children’s hospital in ­California when I got an email from International Medical Corps asking if I was interested in deploying to Liberia to help fight ebola. I wanted to go immediately but I was locked into a contract at the time.

The more I heard, the more excited I got.

Within three days of finishing my contract I was in Alabama being trained in how to treat ebola patients safely. Within a week I was in Liberia.

I have now been at the ebola treatment unit (ETU) for two weeks — and what an ­incredible experience it has been.

This week, I am on the night shift so my working day starts at 7pm. Tonight we have 12 patients in the unit. One is a nine-year-old girl who came with her mother when they were both sick.

Her mum tested negative for ebola but unfortunately the girl tested positive. Her mother opted to go home, leaving her daughter behind. She is very weak and really scared, so I am going to spend some extra time with her tonight, feeding her to try to get her strength back up.

Our PPE suits get really hot. We spend up to two hours at a time in the ETU with the patients, which is about the longest you can comfortably remain inside the suits without a break.

Four new patients arrived at midnight in ambulances.

Tonight we saw a father and two sons: the dad is very sick, throwing up every few ­minutes. We gave him and the other patients plenty of fluids and medicine to help with the vomiting and then we took the blood test that would confirm whether or not they had ebola.

After triaging the patients we made our way to the ­confirmed ward to carry the body of a patient who had died earlier to the morgue.

Ebola is mean. It’s harsh and it tears families apart one by one, or takes them all out together. We recently had a teenage girl bleed to death over two days from an oozing intravenous site. Sounds easy to fix, right? Pressure dressing, elevation, blah blah.

Sorry, that’s not how things work in an ebola unit. You do all the normal interventions but a 20-gauge needle hole in a hand can slowly drain the life out of someone.

Walking into a room that is covered in blood, finding a semi-conscious girl face down on a bed pooling with barely congealed blood is hard. It’s harder the second day when you know all your efforts didn’t help. I cleaned her up and put her in a pair of still-tagged jeans. She half-smiled and took some medicines. I won’t forget her smile, nor her soft moans as she faded away.

This morning I carried a baby to the tent morgue. The baby’s father had died days earlier in the ambulance ride to our ETU. The baby tested positive for malaria. We are still waiting for ebola tests to come back on the mother and baby. The floppy, listless baby seemed to be turning a corner last night at 10. He smiled and took medicine willingly.

His mother, lying near him, was vomiting and too weak to care for him any more. We went back inside a second time at 4am and stayed a while.

Baby drank and we tried to get him to learn how to drink from a bottle so he could fend for himself. I came out joyed at baby’s bounceback. About 5.30am the mother came out crying. Baby had died. It was a shock and a testament to how rapidly situations can change. On the trip in to get the baby, two more patients had expired.

Ebola is not slowing down yet. I am trying my hardest to encourage everyone to drink through the nausea and ­vomiting, to eat and to try to have hope of recovery. Nursing wise we are doing high-level care, but the focus is on getting OK care to more ­people than good care to a few.

I have obviously had a hard few days and I am sorry for being so graphic. But this is what it really is like being in Liberia during ebola.

ANINE KONGELF (27) Norwegian Red Cross nurse, ­Kenema, Sierra Leone Finally, a happy day: 11-year-old Kadiatu and 35-year-old Osman are being discharged as our first two survivors. Their blood tests have come back negative — they are no longer infectious and can ­safely return to their families and communities.

For the whole week we have been separated by 1.5m-high orange fencing. I have been throwing “plumpinut” (a nutritious peanut paste) and biscuits across the fence to Kadiatu and we have been talking, singing and even dancing for the past two days — from our separate sides.

Today there is no more fence between us.

My first week as a community health delegate at the centre, run by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red ­Crescent Societies, has been a surreal ­rollercoaster between life and death, hope, grief, pain and joy.

My first task was to oversee four burials. As a team in full PPE carried the corpses in double body bags out of the morgue, we were there to pay our last ­respects and to make sure the burial site was mapped and the graves marked.

The sad fact is that there will be many more graves as the centre will admit more ­patients and some of them will lose the battle against the virus. One of the bodies that day was an eight-year-old boy.

When we returned from the burial site the boy’s family had arrived to ask for news about him. His father had ­already died from ebola but his uncle and brother came all the way from Freetown, a five-hour drive away.

The two men had been in contact with people with ebola and therefore might be ­carrying the virus, so we could not bring them into the low-risk area. Nor could they see their nephew and brother.

We brought them instead to the unused triage area, where we could speak in ­private, with the safe orange fencing between us.

They don’t say much at the news of the boy’s death. There is a nod of understanding, but their faces express shock and disbelief. At the end of the day I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to do this for a whole month.

Kadiatu was one of the first patients at the treatment ­centre and because she had been inside the high-risk area she had to go through the “happy shower” before she could be discharged: a chlorine bath followed by a normal soapy shower to remove all potential remains of the virus.

Her contaminated clothes were destroyed and she was given a new dress and sandals.

When she came out she was clean, uncontaminated and safe. She turned around to wave to Haja — another patient who has been taking care of Kadiatu inside — and walked out past the orange fencing.

As we wait for her ride home to Freetown we can ­finally sit together. Kadiatu is brought breakfast and vitamins, but the nurses no longer need to wear the personal protective equipment and the psychosocial counsellor can talk to her in private and uninterrupted.

Kadiatu makes us dance for her as she sings, and we can take photos together without being worried about coming too close.Magically, our first survivor is this beautiful, strong 11-year-old with the widest, whitest smile I have ever seen, and as the car drives off I know she will be fine. Her mother and siblings are waiting for her at home. And for us, the staff at the treatment centre, we know that people can survive ebola and that there will be many more happy days like this one in the midst of all the fear and despair.

A DOCTORS Without Borders volunteer rode on the New York subway to go bowling with friends and used a taxi to get home the night before he was diagnosed with ebola, the disease he had been treating in Guinea.

Dr Craig Spencer, 33, was rushed from his home in Harlem to an isolation unit at Bellevue Hospital after he reported a 39.4C fever the morning after his night out with friends.

He returned to the US from treating ebola patients in Guinea — one of the three West African countries suffering the worst effects of the virus — 11 days ago and has become the first New Yorker to test positive for the disease.

Authorities dispatched a team of “disease detectives” to track down anyone he may have had contact with. His fiancee Morgan Dixon is one of four people to have been placed in quarantine.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio moved quickly to reassure residents. “Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract,” he said.

The disease is transmitted via contact with an infected person’s body fluids. Dr Spencer is the fourth person to be diagnosed with the disease in the US. The World Health Organisation said 443 health workers have contracted the virus, of whom 244 have died.

The Australian government is expected to announce it will send a medical team to West Africa in the coming days. WORLD, PAGE 31

There is no cure for ebola, so how have survivors beaten the killer [?]

There is no cure for ebola, so how have survivors beaten the killer, asks SUE DUNLEVY

When Teresa Romero became the first person infected with ebola outside Africa, the fear about ebola notched up a level. This week doctors revealed she’d beaten the killer virus.

She’s one of a growing handful of Western health workers who’ve thwarted the deadly disease for which there is no cure.

Medecins Sans Frontieres this week celebrated Liberian Kollie James, the 1000th survivor among the patients they had treated.

Nigeria, which had 20 cases of the virus, was declared ebola-free. Texas nurse Amber Vinson, who contracted the virus after treating Liberian Thomas Duncan, was also declared ebola-free this week and her co-worker Amber Pham’s condition was upgraded from “fair” to “good”. With experts predicting 1.4 million people will have ebola by the beginning of next year, there is great interest in how these people have lived through a disease that kills 70 per cent of its victims.

The clues that are emerging involve early diagnosis and care, aggressive rehydration, treatment with antibodies from the blood of a survivor of the disease, some breakthrough new drugs and genes. Most of the patients who survived the disease have had access to some or all of these elements. Teresa Romeroreceived antibodies from a survivor of ebola in west Africa and she also reportedly took the antiviral drug Favipiravir.

US aid workers Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, British nurse William Pooley, 75-year-old Fr Miguel Pajares and Liberian doctor Abraham Borbor were treated with experimental antibody drug ZMapp.

Research shows 100 per cent of monkeys given the drug survived . However, it was unable to save the lives of Borbor and Pajares.

US aid worker Nancy Writeboltold NBC news she didn’t remember any reaction from ZMapp but did remember when she knew she would survive.

“There was a time when I sensed — I had not been able to get up and walk and there was great pain in my feet… “I said ‘I am just getting up. I am going to the bathroom and take a shower today’.” Dr Bruce Ribner, infectious diseases expert from Emory Hospital in Atlanta, US, who treated Brantly and Writebol, the first patients to receive ZMapp, said “frankly, we do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference or even, theoretically, if it delayed their recovery.” There were just seven doses of ZMapp available and the San Diego company Mapp Bio announced on its website in August “the available supply of ZMapp is exhausted”. It is understood to be manufacturing more.

Ebola survivor US aid worker Dr Rick Sacra received another experimental drug called TKM-Ebola that works by preventing the virus from replicating.

Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceutical has announced it had begun limited manufacturing of the drug, to be available by December.

Another experimental treatment being used on ebola patients involves injecting them with antibodies from the blood of survivors. Spanish nurse Romero received these antibodies from a west African survivor and Dr Sacra, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo and Texas nurse Nina Pham all received plasma donations from Brantly. All four survived.

While the focus has been on high-technology cures for ebola, none of these have been available to the thousands who survived ebola in west Africa.

British haemorrhagic fever expert Dr Simon Mardelsays the “low-tech” approach of rehydration is really the key to beating the disease.

The number of deaths could be cut in half if infected people were taught to properly hydrate themselves, he says.

Doctors who survived ebola in Nigeria credited heavy doses of fluids laced with sugar and salt with saving their lives.

Survivor Dr Adaora Igonohsaid the treatment entailed drinking at least five litres of the solution every day for five or six days when you have mouth sores and a sore throat and feel depressed.

“You don’t want to drink anything. You’re too weak, and with the sore throat it’s difficult to swallow, but you know when you have just vomited, you need it.” Research has also found your genes could be important. Some people may be resistant to ebola if they have a mutation in a gene called NPC1.

Dr Ribner says he hopes his success gives hope the disease can be beaten.“I’m hoping that since we were successful in helping them resolve their infections it helps dispel the idea that this is a disease that by nature has to be fatal.”

WITH New York confirming its first Ebola case, the EU has boosted its aid to affected African countries to 1 billion euros.

THE EU announcement of one billion euros for the worst-hit countries comes as fears of a spread of the virus grew, with the first confirmed case in Mali, where a two-year-old girl has tested positive.

The World Health Organisation (WHO), which has warned the Ebola crisis in west Africa "remains of great concern", held talks on Thursday on efforts to ensure access to and funding for potential vaccines.

The New York case is a doctor who recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea, the epicentre of the world's worst outbreak of the disease.

Craig Spencer was placed in isolation at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital Center, officials said.

With health workers in Spain and Texas already having caught Ebola from patients originally infected in west Africa, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio insisted the city was fully prepared to stop the disease in its tracks.

"We want to state at the outset, (this) is no reason for New Yorkers to be alarmed. Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract," said de Blasio.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said city officials had already identified four people believed to have been in contact with the doctor, who worked for the charity Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF.

He said he did not expect a repeat of the situation in Dallas, where hospital staff appeared to have been caught offguard by the arrival of the disease that has killed almost 4,900 people mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"Dallas was caught before they could really prepare. We had the advantage of learning from their experience," Cuomo said.

The announcement of the New York doctor's positive test came just hours after Mali reported its first confirmed case of the disease, the latest country affected.

Malian health ministry spokesman Markatche Daou said the two-year-old girl had travelled to neighbouring Guinea - with her grandmother.

Health authorities have put 43 people who had contact with the toddler and her grandmother under observation, the WHO said.

And in Ivory Coast, up until now Ebola-free, a hunt was going on for a health worker from Guinea who may have fled across the border after taking fright when a patient he treated died.

EU leaders agreed Friday to boost aid to combat Ebola in west Africa by 400 million euros to one billion euros.

"We're in a race against time on Ebola and we must address both the emergency situation and at the same time have a long term response," Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso said Thursday.

African countries have also pledged to send more than 1,000 health workers to the most severely-hit countries.

With almost 10,000 people now infected, African Union chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said the regional bloc was responding to an urgent need for medical reinforcements.

East African members of the bloc have also pledged to send another 600 health workers, she added.

A lack of skilled medical staff has been one of the major obstacles in the battle against Ebola.

Health workers have paid a heavy price in the fight against the epidemic, with 244 deaths out of 443 cases.

Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen - who has already dipped into his vast personal fortune to help WHO deal with the crisis - said Thursday he was upping his donation to $100 million.

THE EU has upped its aid to west Africa to fight Ebola to 1.0 billion euros as Mali and New York reported their first cases.

"EU will increase financial help to 1.0 billion euros ($A1.50 billion) to fight Ebola in West Africa," Van Rompuy tweeted on Friday on the second day of an EU leaders' summit in Brussels.

The 28 member states and the European Commission have already pledged nearly 600 million euros to pay for medical staff and facilities in the worst affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where about 4900 people have died of the disease.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has led calls to raise 1.0 billion euros, urging his EU peers to match London's efforts to tame a disease for which there is no vaccine nor cure, only therapeutic treatments.

So far, there have been some 10,000 cases but experts have warned that infections could soar to 10,000 per week by early December - a terrifying prospect for a disease with a death rate running at 70 per cent.

There have been some isolated cases in the United States and Europe but authorities are trying to put as many resources as possible into west Africa in the hope of containing it at its main source.

On Thursday, officials said a doctor who recently returned to New York from treating Ebola patients in Guinea tested positive, the first confirmed case in the country's largest city.

The Ebola crisis is a major concern at the EU summit, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for the bloc to agree how many personnel it should send to west Africa to fight Ebola on the ground.

Leaders agreed on Thursday to name Christos Stylianides, incoming Cyprus Commissioner for humanitarian aid, as coordinator for the Ebola response.

Meanwhile Mali has reported its first case of Ebola, marking a major setback for West African efforts to contain the deadly virus that now has affected six countries in the region.

Health Minister Ousmane Kone made the announcement on Malian television late on Thursday, saying that the patient was a two-year-old girl who had come from neighbouring Guinea, where the Ebola epidemic began last December.

The child was tested for the virus on Wednesday at a hospital in the Malian town of Kayes, about 600km from the capital of Bamako.

"The sick child and the people who were in contact with her in Kayes were immediately identified and taken care of," Kone said.

The Ivory Coast, currently free of the Ebola epidemic ravaging its neighbours, has launched a hunt for a Guinean health worker who may have fled his home country after possibly catching the disease.

The man apparently took fright after finding out that someone who came to his clinic for treatment had died, possibly of Ebola, a senior official at Ivory Coast's National Public Health Institute said.

"For the moment (this person) is not contagious," Daouda Coulibaly said, adding that the health authorities were not alarmed and "there is no panic".

"But it would be good if he got into contact with the health services," he said.

The unnamed health worker comes from an area in Guinea gripped by Ebola, which first broke out in the impoverished west African nation earlier this year.

Ivory Coast has just reopened its airports to flights from the three affected countries, with a first flight from Conakry landing in Abidjan on Monday, but land borders remain closed.

AUSTRALIA is set to upgrade its response to the global ebola crisis after Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was “carefully considering” a request from US President Barack Obama to send health workers to west Africa.

Government officials said US and European allies had now indicated they would treat our health workers if they became infected.

Until now, the time it would take to fly infected staff home to Australia for treatment was the main stumbling block.

Mr Abbott stressed no one would go until “risk mitigation procedures” were in place.î WORLD PAGE 37

The science of funding great minds

HAVING an idea that could change the world but no money to develop it was ­unthinkable to Sydney ­scientist Ben McNeil.

So he launched thinkable.org — a crowd funding website for people to contribute to groundbreaking research that otherwise wouldn’t get off the ground.

The UNSW oceanographer said that, for the decade after completing a PHD, it could be very hard for young scientists to attract the ­government funding given to their more experienced counterparts. The result was often brilliant minds leaving their industries.

“Science is broken and we want to fix it — and the great thing is anyone can be part of it,” Mr McNeil said of his initiative, which has already gained the attention of 600 scientists around the world. “When you think of a ­researcher you think of a university paying their salaries to work on their projects but that funding isn’t going to younger researchers in their 20s and 30s. A whole pool of innovative research ideas are getting left behind.” He said every Australian Nobel Prize winner still around today made their discovery before the age of 32.

“That is not just Australia, that is a global phenomenon — they come up with their big, creative, massive ideas when they are young,” he said. “From ebola to climate, there are so many challenges and we need researchers ­pursuing novel ideas, we need to help them do that.” One researcher listed on the site is Martin Rees, who has raised $13,000 from 28 sponsors to continue vital ­research on heart disease.

Mr Rees engages with his supporters through video snapshots in his lab, allowing the public to experience his cutting edge research.

“Really it is connecting science with society in a way that hasn’t been done ­before,” Mr McNeil said.

“It would be a huge waste of talent and knowledge if he had to leave research and get a job — this lets him stay in the lab.” On average, four out of five applicants for competitive government research grants are unsuccessful.UNSW Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark Hoffman said the university was proud to be thinkable.org’s launch partner, with five UNSW Gold Star recipients — whose projects were highly ranked by either the Australian Research Council or National Health and Medical Research Council but just missed out on major funding — involved in the site.

Plibersek urges charities to speak up

TANYA Plibersek has accused the Abbott government of vandalising Australia's aid program, and urged charities to speak up.

OPPOSITION foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek is disturbed by the lack of response from aid groups following the government's slashing of $7.6 billion from the overseas assistance program in this year's budget.

One in every five dollars saved in the May budget came from aid - the largest single source of savings identified.

In a speech to the heads of Australia's major aid organisations, Ms Plibersek warned the government was getting away with vandalising the agenda for global development.

"The Abbott government bet that even though the cuts to aid were the largest in the budget by far... the political consequences would be minimal," she told the Australian Council for International Development conference in Canberra.

"Although some organisations and individuals have spoken up, the lack of a co-ordinated response by the sector has proven them right."

Ms Plibersek said that $7.6 billion could have connected more than half a million people to basic sanitation or trained more than 30,000 health professionals in the developing world.

She said more - not less - would be needed from the international community to combat poverty in the future, especially in the face of new challenges like climate change and crises like the Ebola outbreak.

But worse was the government "crowing" about its cuts to people who don't approve of foreign aid, while charity groups welcomed its commitment.

She said ground had been lost and there were two factors to be overcome.

"Leadership from government and a strong, coordinated campaign from the sector which can mobilise public sentiment," she said.

"We need both and at the moment we risk having neither."

Confusion breaking out over ebola fight

THE top doctor in charge of Australia’s ebola response was unaware there was a team of 20 medicos ready to deploy throughout the region if an outbreak occurred.

Confusion over whether Australia was ready to deal with an ebola outbreak emerged yesterday, with the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Baggoley, telling a Senate estimates committee Australia was not ready for an outbreak in our region.

This came after the ­government had assured our regional neighbours Australia would be ready to help ­contain any ebola outbreaks.

And it came as US President Barack Obama spoke to Prime Minister Tony Abbott as part of an effort to get ­developed nations to do more to tackle the ebola crisis at its source.

The Abbott government is resisting sending health ­professionals and defence ­personnel to West Africa ­because it has no way to get them back to Australia safely if they contract the disease.

However Mr Obama is sending up to 4000 defence personnel to West Africa and has embarked on an international recruitment campaign, phoning world leaders to ­encourage them to send people and spend more money.

Two days ago, Mr Obama spoke to the leaders of Canada and Sweden, then observed that “more and more are stepping up’’, adding, “it has, I think, taken a little longer than it should”.

Prof Baggoley told a Senate estimates committee yesterday he had not been asked to train an Australian Medical Assistance Team (AUSMAT) to fight the killer virus in our region.

“You’re saying, I just want to be clear about this, we have not deployed any of our AUSMAT professionals to be skilled to be able to combat an epidemic if it was to occur in the near future,” Greens health spokesman Senator Richard Di Natale asked.

Prof Baggoley replied: “That’s correct, Senator”, adding that it would take two weeks to train a team. Several hours later Health Department secretary Martin Bowles said Australia was prepared and had 20 workers trained and ready to go.

“There are a number of case workers, around the 20 mark, who are fully trained to care for ebola patients and we would use them in the first instance for any immediate response,” he said in a clarifying statement to the committee.

Health Minister Peter Dutton provided further clarification last night and said a federally funded National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre in Darwin had trained 20 clinical staff in ebola-specific personal protective equipment.

“On standby are infectious diseases and emergency specialist doctors and nurses who could be deployed from Darwin,” he said.

“They are vaccinated and heat acclimatised for a four-week deployment. “A team of 20 health workers can be dispatched from Australia as a first immediate response to our regional neighbours should there be an ebola outbreak and should Australia be asked for help.” The confusion has raised serious questions about the co-ordination of Australia’s ebola response, with the ­nation’s top doctor unaware of our level of preparedness.Mr Bowles moved to ­reassure Australians that, from a domestic perspective, “the country is prepared to deal with ebola”.

Medical staff to live test vaccines

AN ebola vaccine will be tested on more than 20,000 health workers in West ­Africa as soon as January.

The World Health ­Organisation announced yesterday that it would begin testing two experimental versions of the vaccine on frontline medical staff treating those affected by the ebola crisis.

So far, more than 200 health workers have been killed by the disease. WHO assistant director general Marie Paule Kieny said clinical trials in Europe, Africa and the US were expected to produce preliminary safety data on two vaccines by December.

The vaccines would be rolled out to tens of thousands — but not millions — of people in 2015.

One of the vaccines is being developed by Glaxo-SmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health, and is made from mixing a chimpanzee cold virus with an ebola protein.

The other, being developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be tested shortly on healthy volunteers in the US, Switzerland, Germany, Gabon and Kenya.

The Canadian government said it would start shipping its experimental ebola vaccine to the WHO for possible use in the West African countries hardest hit by the outbreak.

Meanwhile, the makers of the ebola treatment ZMapp, which saved the life of American doctor Kent Brantley, announced their supply was now exhausted. The ZMapp serum is made from antibodies in modified tobacco leaves and takes months to grow.Sierra Leone said on Tuesday that the number of infected people in its west was soaring, with more than 20 deaths a day. That region is on the opposite side of the country from where the first cases emerged.

Lambie’s ebola-riddled suicide bombers in spoof magazine

LOUDMOUTH Senator Jacqui Lambie has suggested suicide bombers could infect themselves with ebola before being blown up to allow infec-ted bodily fluids to spray throughout the community.

The Senator used the critical Senate estimates hearings to grill defence chiefs on their preparedness for ebola ­ter-rorists. “Do you have any information to suggest that Aust-ralia’s enemies could attack our country or military using the virus, for ­example with suicide agents who are affected with the disease, or have access to bodily fluids containing the disease, and what is your contingency plan to fight this,” Senator Lambie asked.

Acting Defence Force chief Vice-Admiral Ray Griggs said there was no evidence to support the claim.

“One of the things, Senator, that we have playing to our ­advantage is our geographic isolation and (with) the length of time that it takes simply to get to Australia, and the life cycle of the virus, it becomes very obvious relatively quickly how sick someone is,” he said.

“So I think the ability to ­inject someone into the country, who is not showing symptoms, would be quite difficult.’’ He said defence personnel were as protected as anyone against a potential attack.After Senator Lambie made the bizarre claims, it emerged the idea had been raised in a US spoof magazine The Nat-ional Report, which features humorous articles. A recent headline read: DHS Uncover ISIS Terror Plot To Spread Ebola Virus Using Infected Suicide Bombers.

RWANDA is restricting travel to keep the Ebola virus from spreading within its borders as the US' new Ebola "czar" takes up his post.

KIGALI - Rwanda has boosted travel restrictions to stem the spread of the Ebola virus, ordering travellers who have been in the US and Spain to send daily updates. "Every day... they should call us or send an internet message," stating their health condition, Minister of Health Agnes Binagwaho said. The requirement applies to all travellers who have been in the US or Spain within the past three weeks. Messages should be sent for the first 21-days they are in Rwanda, she said.

It also applies to Rwandan citizens who had been in the US or Spain. Visitors who have been to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone within the last 21 days are barred from entry to Rwanda, which is screening all arriving travellers for Ebola. Rwandan citizens who have travelled to the three west African countries are placed under quarantine on arrival.

WASHINGTON - The US is ready to co-operate with Cuba in the international fight against Ebola in West Africa, a spokesperson for the US State Department confirmed to Efe. "We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Cuba to face this Ebola outbreak," said the US official, who stressed the significant contribution made by Cuba in sending hundreds of doctors and health workers to Africa to battle the virus.

WASHINGTON - It's Ron Klain's first day as the new White House "Ebola czar". A former White House adviser, he starts on Wednesday as President Barack Obama's Ebola response co-ordinator. The White House says Klain will meet with Obama and top aides in the Oval Office. Klain also has meetings scheduled with various White House teams leading the government's response to Ebola at home and in West Africa.

BUDUBURAM CAMP, Ghana - Hundreds of Liberians are stranded in Ghana, separated from their families because of poverty, fear and logistics.

AN Australian Red Cross worker who tested negative for the deadly Ebola virus is set to end her three week stint in isolation.

AUSTRALIAN Red Cross aid worker Sue Ellen Kovack was admitted to a Cairns hospital earlier this month after coming down with a low-grade fever soon after returning from treating victims in Sierra Leone.

The 57-year-old twice tested negative for the virus before she was released from hospital on October 13 to complete the 21-day incubation period for Ebola at home.

A spokesman from the Red Cross confirmed to AAP that the isolation period lapsed on Wednesday, although he wouldn't provide any other details.

He said the nurse has requested not to speak to media.

Ms Kovack has pleaded for greater action to fight the disease, which has killed thousands in west Africa since the start of the year.

"The international community needs to do so much more right now to stop Ebola in its tracks, before it really gets right out of control," she said in a statement last week.

Her pleas were made on the same day Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced no Australian health workers would be sent to Ebola-ravaged west Africa.

Two Queensland doctors have been stood down for speaking to the media about the handling of Ms Kovack's case, actions they later admitted were unwise.

Their concerns are being investigated by an independent panel appointed by Queensland Health.

NSW doctors and nurses will be required to wear respirators and sealed suits if forced to deal with ebola patients in Australia, in a radical upgrade of infection-control procedures in NSW hospitals.

The Daily Telegraph has learned the NSW health department is the first in Australia to lift its infection-control guidelines for heavier protection suits in line with the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta in the US.

NSW Health chief health officer Kerry Chant confirmed the guidelines for health workers had been lifted on Friday after meetings with the Commonwealth chief medical officer.

The new guidelines would also require health workers using personal protection equipment to be supervised by an observer to ensure the proper fitting of suits.

It is believed the failure to wear and fit suits properly led to the infection of health workers in the US.

The fully enclosed suits with respirators would replace the current impermeable masks and gowns.

“Protection of our healthcare workers from the risk of ebola is a top priority for NSW Health,” Dr Chant said.

“Our existing infection control guidelines are continually reviewed by experts based on the latest available science.

“NSW guidelines were revised last week to further strengthen the protection of health workers. This includes revised personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations and stressing the importance of a designated observer during the application and removal of PPE.” Westmead and the Sydney Children’s Hospital are also carrying out exercises to deal with an ebola event should a case appear in NSW.

Yesterday, the Labor opposition continued its attack on the government, claiming it was dragging the chain on stopping the spread of the virus from west Africa by not sending in Australian medical workers to the region.

But health minister Peter Dutton again was forced to explain that Labor’s position risked putting lives in danger as people could not be repatriated back to Australia in time for care if infected, and would probably die en route.

The Daily Telegraph revealed on Saturday that the federal government had instead mobilised a contingency plan for the region if the virus crossed over into South-East Asia.“While the risk is very low to our country, we would be a good neighbour if there was an outbreak, particularly in a country that may not have the level of healthcare standards that we do in Australia,” Mr Dutton said.

East Lancashire hospital staff briefed on what to do in the event of Ebola outbreak

HOSPITAL bosses said they have briefed staff about what they should do in the event of an outbreak of Ebola in East Lancashire.

The NHS has said dozens of hospitals may have to isolate and treat patients in the unlikely event of a serious outbreak in Britain, although cases would initially be dealt with at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Ian Stanley, medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “We have a contingency plan in place if there is an Ebola outbreak in the area.

“Our plan will follow the national guidelines that have come from the government and their world health organisation partners.

“Trust staff are being briefed on what they should do and are prepared to respond if necessary.”

He said the national guidance has had to be interpreted and applied at a local level for each department, and a steering group has been established to report to the trust board and executive.

The Lancashire Telegraph requested more details about the contingency plan on Tuesday, but the trust had still not provided any information by our deadline yesterday.

Russ McLean, chairman of the Pennine Lancashire Patient Voices Group, said: “I would have thought that if they had a plan then they would share it, so this begs the question why they haven’t done.

“People are really worried about Ebola so it seems right we should be getting some reassurance.”

The Royal Free Hospital has the UK’s only high-level isolation unit used to treat people with highly infectious diseases. It is where British nurse Will Pooley – who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone – recovered from the disease in August and September after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp.

After that, the infectious diseases units at the Royal Liverpool hospitals, Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield and Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne would receive cases.

NHS officials have stressed that they are not expecting a serious outbreak of the virus.

AGRICULTURE Minister Barnaby Joyce has defended Mathias Cormann bringing some colourful language into the budget debate.

SO Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce for one was pleased to see his government colleague Mathias Cormann bring some colourful language to the debate.

The finance minister last week described Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as an "economic girly man" for opposing the budget, a term Labor said was an insult to young women.

Opposition employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor went further, saying Senator Cormann doesn't have to sound like a "dickhead" if he wants to make a point.

But Mr Joyce, renowned for his own colourful barbs, believes you can over-analyse such things.

"You're either boring as bat-poo ... but as soon as someone is themselves, they say `shock, horror, you can't have that - go back to being boring'," he told reporters in Canberra on Monday.

Senator Cormann was dealing with the more serious business of the coalition's long time commitment of selling health insurer Medibank Private on Monday.

The sale is now estimated to raise $5.5 billion, which will be used to fund its asset recycling initiative.

That provides states and territories an incentive to sell off assets and use those monies to re-invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure, like roads.

Australian retail investors will be able to apply for shares from October 28 at an indicative price range of $1.55 to $2.00 per share.

"A price cap for retail investors means that Australian residents who choose to apply for shares will not pay any more than $2.00 per share, even if the final price is set above the indicative range," Senator Cormann said in a statement.

This budget initiative aside, at least $18 billion in government savings otherwise remain unlegislated.

The independent Parliamentary Budget Officer Phil Bowen has also warned there was a "reasonably uncertain international outlook" which would affect revenues.

"That is not helped by international conflicts and of course concerns about the Ebola epidemic," Mr Bowen told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra.

He said there is a risk that commodity prices could fall faster that predicted and have a negative impact in the short-term on the budget.

"I'm not crying wolf or trying to inject a flavour of panic - I am simply talking about the need for sensible budget management which does include building a sensible buffer against such shocks," he said.

Revenue, spending risks to budget: PBO

THE Parliamentary Budget Office says there are "significant risks" to the budget as the global economy falters and spending cuts are delayed.

THE government's projections show the budget moving from a deficit of 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product to a surplus of 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2024/25.

However, Parliamentary Budget Officer Phil Bowen said there was a "reasonably uncertain international outlook" that would affect revenues.

"That is not helped by international conflicts and of course concerns about the Ebola epidemic," Mr Bowen told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Monday.

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank had downgraded their forecasts of world economic growth including Australia's key trading partner, China.

Mr Bowen said the budget papers had allowed for a further decline in the terms of trade.

"But there's always the risk that commodity prices could fall faster and this would have a negative impact in the short term on the budget."

There were also revenue measures not yet passed by the parliament, the most important of which was the reintroduction of regular fuel excise rises.

On the spending side, Mr Bowen said there was a community expectation the government would increase levels of services over time.

"At the end of the period there is a surplus projected but it is based purely on the current policy settings without net additional spending," he said.

At least $18 billion in budget savings measures have yet to be legislated.

Mr Bowen said the surplus would inevitable shrink if the measures were not passed, by as much as one per cent of GDP.

"We are not saying the position is unsustainable, but we are raising the prospects of risks to sustainability," he said.

"I'm not crying wolf or trying to inject a flavour of panic - I am simply talking about the need for sensible budget management which does include building a sensible buffer against such shocks."

PRIME Minister Tony Abbott has raised concerns about the potential spread of ebola to our region with the Papua New Guinea government, insisting that countries in the region be prepared for the killer virus.

The PM stopped in PNG on his way to Jakarta yesterday for the inauguration of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

According to senior government sources, Mr Abbott met PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill to discuss “the global response to ebola and the importance of preparedness in the region”.

It is understood the PM outlined the Australian government’s contingency plans to help its neighbours should an outbreak cross over from west Africa to the region.

The Daily Telegraph revealed on Saturday that the Health and Defence departments had activated a regional contingency plan.

The rapid-response team, made up of senior members of AUSMAT, has been placed on standby by the Coalition if an outbreak of ebola was to occur in the Asia-Pacific region.

Questioned on whether Australia should be responding directly to the ongoing crisis in west Africa, Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton said it was not yet safe to send medical personnel there.

He said that no country, including the US, had given him an undertaking that it would accept an Australian ebola sufferer for treatment.A “30-hour plane trip home’’ would be the only alternative, putting their life at risk. But he said if an outbreak occurred closer to home, Australia would respond generously.

A grandstanding Labor wants the PM to put Australians in harm’s way

Ebola is ghastly enough. But must we also suffer the moral posturing of politicians such as Tanya Plibersek? Plibersek, Labor’s deputy leader, has fallen to the disease of the modern Left, wanting to seem good by demanding fine-sounding things that won’t actually work. Or in this case could kill.

Plibersek is berating the government for not doing more to help fight the latest ebola outbreak and contain it to the three African countries — Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone — where most of the 4500 deaths have occurred.

“Australia must significantly increase its efforts, immediately,” she insisted. If Plibersek just meant increasing the $18 million offered so far by the Government she’d probably be right. But she wants doctors, nurses and paramedics sent, too.

“We’ve got skilled Australians, who’ve trained for many years to provide exactly the kind of assistance West Africa is crying out for and our government is saying that they won’t assist them to go there.” In fact, 20 to 30 Australian volunteers are already in Africa fighting ebola and non-government organisations would welcome more. But there’s a risk. Doctors Without Borders, for instance, says nine of its staff are dead of ebola. More than 230 health workers in all have died.

Three American missionaries also got sick but were saved after flights of between 12 and 18 hours to the US for treatment, using a private jet with a special portable isolation tent for just a single patient.

So the government can’t morally order in workers unless proper treatment is available should they get sick. And there’s the problem.

Plibersek knows full well, since she’s been briefed by government experts, that there is no guaranteed high-quality hospital care for any Australians we send.

Australia is too far away to bring home the sick, who’d probably die on the flight home — a minimum of 30 hours, even if we instantly found a plane with isolation units.

The government has asked the US, Britain and European countries — much closer to western Africa — to guarantee they’ll treat any sick Australians but has not got one yes.

Some countries baulk at importing foreigners with ebola. The US couldn’t treat one patient in a Texas hospital without two nurses contracting the disease.

Then there’s this risk: are we ready to deal with the sick, should any come home contaminated?

A health professional who took part in a test at a major hospital said few involved were sure they were prepared to deal with ebola — passed on via bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting. Same story when Health Minister Peter Dutton toured the infectious disease unit of the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, where staff showed off protective gear with their necks exposed.

This explains why former AMA president Professor Kerryn Phelps, no natural friend of Liberals, backs the government’s caution, tweeting: “This is a time for pragmatism not blind altruism.” Plibersek, too, knows all this, yet postures as if the government was callously turning its back on dying Africans.

Others in the Left are worse. The Greens even sneer the government is racist, dragging its feet “because there are no votes in poor, black Africans dying,” as Senator Richard Di Natale foully put it.

Such moral grandstanding. proposing wildly impractical plans and vilifying sceptics just to seem noble, is the seeming-not-doing morality that typifies today’s Left.

Think of global warmists, proposing job-killing carbon taxes. Think of Greens demanding we scrap cheap coal-fired power, which would make electricity too expensive for the poor.

Plibersek is right to say “if the international community pulls together, the ebola outbreak may be possible to contain”.

But our doctors and nurses wouldn’t actually do that much to stop the disease spreading in Africa. They would just — important though it is — help save some of the sick.No, prevention means isolating those sick, teaching locals how to protect themselves and stopping people moving from ebola areas. Most of this is work only African authorities can do, and which Nigeria, for instance, has done well. Our best contribution could be to work on a vaccine, an option being explored.

Slamming the door on a deadly disease

The No.1 responsibility of government is to protect the people. If they fail on this, the rest is window dressing.

This is above being Liberal or Labor. It is the job of ALL in the Australian parliament.

So, what’s it going to take for someone to find the courage to do what’s obvious — to protect this country from the deadly ebola virus?

The best method of disease control is isolation and Australia is blessed with distance between us and the problem.

While still not enough is known about this killer disease, why are we continuing to run any risk?

No doubt, the health system is prepared as much as possible for the eventuality the disease will get here but shouldn’t every effort be going ­towards keeping it out of Australia?

And if that means travel bans and quarantining people arriving from countries in infection hot zones – then do it.

The world is learning as it goes along about how ebola is being transferred. Even the World Health Organisation admits bungling efforts to stop the spread across borders by acting too slowly.

In a leaked memo obtained by America’s Associated Press, it claimed “nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see fairly plain writing on the wall … a perfect storm was brewing, ready to burst open in full force”.

Now they tell us within two months there could be 10,000 new cases of ebola every week unless stronger measures are put into place.

Already 4500 people have died from the disease, which has a mortality rate of 50 per cent.

Meanwhile, nearly every African government has restricted travel from the three west African nations where the ebola outbreak originated.

Does that make them racist, or smart?

So there are travel bans around Africa but here in Australia, we’re filling out forms and running harm minimisation. At Australian airports, people returning from Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are taken aside, asked questions and allowed through.

And that’s it.

The nation’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Baggoley outlined the process on Friday.

“Biosecurity staff ask whether travellers have been in contact with ebola patients, whether they attended funerals or whether they have had a fever in the last 24 hours.” Most airports have thermal imaging scanners that can be used to check body temperature of arrivals but they remain switched off or in storage even though having a high fever is a known symptom of ebola.

This is a disease that could soon be an epidemic in Africa and this is all Australia is doing to keep it out.

Instead our politicians are mindlessly debating whether or not to send medical staff into the outbreak zones.

If we have the experts and they want to go, no one should get in their way — but returning home shouldn’t be a case of ticking a few boxes, clearing customs, then jumping in a taxi.

The federal government and Opposition are having the wrong argument. Australia is known internationally for having tough quarantine rules. We even try to limit movement of disease between the states with the threat of huge fines.

We insist on foreign racehorses coming to run in the Melbourne Cup spending weeks in isolation before being allowed in.

The brilliant Border Security staff at the airports seize tonnes of who knows what out of people’s luggage each week at airports, but with a killer disease we continue to take risks.

We protect our flora and fauna, but what about people?

Strange double standard.

Historically, we have relied on quarantine to keep communicable ­disease away from the general public.

But since August, more than 700 people known to have been in the danger zones have been allowed into Australia with nothing more than a few questions asked.

Some of the courageous doctors and nurses who’ve returned from west Africa have chosen to “self quarantine” for 21 days — but what for the rest?

So far, 11 Australians have been tested for the ebola virus, and thankfully none have returned a positive test.

But that should not be a reason not to act.

Ebola has a three-week incubation period and it takes just one infected person on our soil to change the stakes. No doubt, fear is spreading ­faster than the disease itself.

But can you blame people when we are dealing with an outbreak with no known cure?

The fact remains, the best way to contain the spread of ebola is to avoid contact with people who have been ­exposed or contaminated.Protecting all Australians should be the government’s highest priority even if it means upsetting a few. Getting this wrong would be unforgivable.

A US woman who fell sick at a Dallas train station sparked a new ebola scare after confessing that she had stayed in the same building as the first man to die from the virus on American soil.

The Dallas Area Rapid Transit station was closed and disinfected yesterday by first responders.

However, health authorities later confirmed the woman had no direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus on October 8, despite having stayed briefly in the same apartment complex where Duncan had been after he flew in from Liberia.

She was taken to hospital but was not being monitored for ebola symptoms. “The train used by the customer will be removed from service and cleaned consistent with our established protocols for cleaning hazardous materials,” DART spokeswoman Morgan Lyons said.The scare came as 14 people who had direct contact with Duncan were cleared. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said 159 people who may have had contact with Duncan or the two nurses who contracted ebola while caring for him, had been monitored or were under surveillance.

THE World Health Organisation bungled efforts to halt the spread of ebola in west ­Africa, an internal report has ­revealed, as the political brawl over whether Australia sends personnel to Africa escalated.

With the disease having ­killed more than 4500 people in Africa, a WHO draft report pointed to serious errors in coordinating the initial response.

The document found that WHO, an arm of the UN, missed chances to prevent ebola from spreading after it was first diagnosed in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea last spring, blaming factors including incompetent staff and a lack of information.

“Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall. A perfect storm was brewing, ready to burst open in full force,” a WHO spokespersonsaid.

The report was released as Labor leader Bill Shorten was accused of showing “reckless disregard” for the safety of health workers by calling for Australians to fight ebola in Africa without a credible evacuation policy in place.

Hitting back at Mr Shorten’s warning that the Abbott government was sleep-walking through the crisis, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Health Minister Peter Dutton have written to Labor calling for a return to bipartisanship.

Confirming the National Security Committee of Cabinet has formally considered Australia’s domestic and international response to the ebola crisis five times, the letter warns there is no current ­capacity to evacuate Australians in the region to safety if they contract the virus.

“It shows a reckless disregard for the safety of health workers to ignore this advice and call for Australians to be placed in harm’s way without credible evacuation arrangements in place,” it states.

Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Tanya Plibersek seized on ­reports that the Coalition’s $10 million pledge has yet to reach the UN. However, the government said the money had been provided but that the UN had simply failed to update its website.

Medicins San Frontieres Australia advocacy manager Jon Edwards said he recognised the government’s safety concerns but urged it to make a commitment.

“Every day the outbreak is becoming more dangerous and more difficult to control,” Mr Edwards said.

WHY does Australia spend $5 billion every year on foreign aid? Ebola. The spread of this virus is a story of poverty. Ebola is the perfect encapsulation of why development ­matters — why Australia’s own prosperity depends on our willingness to help others develop functional health systems, hospitals and border controls.

The Abbott Government should keep that in mind as it refocuses aid spending away from Africa and to our neighbours in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The government wants our aid to support private development and entrepreneurship, not handouts. Those goals are worthy, but right now there are corpses in the streets of nations only a plane-flight away.It’s time Australia sent not only money, but trained experts to help deal with this crisis. We have stood back for too long, because the government has failed to finalise an emergency repatriation plan for Australians who become infected. Helping the world’s most desperate people is an investment in Australia’s ­future. We can’t stay out of this one.

Woman on US ship takes Ebola blood test

A CRUISE ship carrying a Dallas health care worker who is being monitored for signs of Ebola has returned to port in Texas.

COMPANY and federal officials have said the woman being monitored for Ebola poses no risk because she has shown no symptoms and has voluntarily self-quarantined.

Petty Officer Andy Kendrick told The Associated Press that a Coast Guard crew flew in a helicopter to meet the Carnival Magic and retrieved a blood sample from the woman. He said the blood sample was taken to a state lab in Austin for processing.

Kendrick had no further details about how the sample was taken. He said the decision to take the sample was made in coordination with the federal, state and local health authorities.

Obama administration officials said the passenger handled a lab specimen from a Liberian man who died from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital earlier this month. Officials said the woman poses no risk because she has shown no signs of illness for 19 days and has voluntarily self-quarantined on the cruise ship.

US officials had been seeking ways to return the woman and her husband to the US before the ship completed its cruise.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that when the woman left the US on the cruise ship from Texas on October 12, health officials were requiring only self-monitoring.

Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement that the woman, a lab supervisor, remained in isolation "and is not deemed to be a risk to any guests or crew."

The ship was refused clearance to dock in Cozumel, Mexico on Friday, a day after Belize refused to let the passenger leave the vessel.

There have been no restrictions placed on other passengers aboard the ship, officials said.

PRIME Minister Tony Abbott has arrived in Indonesia for the presidential inauguration after a visit to PNG.

AHEAD of his inauguration on Monday, Mr Joko has already signalled he will take a tougher approach on sovereignty, following the inadvertent breaches of Australia's navy while turning back asylum seeker boats.

Mr Abbott's attendance at the inauguration will be his fourth trip to Australia's "hugely important neighbour" since becoming prime minister last year.

In a message before he left, Mr Abbott repeated his desire for Australia's foreign policy to have more of a Jakarta focus rather than a Geneva one.

While he'd stated that as an aim with the previous administration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, it became difficult to achieve because of the spying row, which was only solved in August.

Mr Joko has meanwhile flagged that he would like to be closer to Australia, building security cooperation and business an people to people programs.

But he's also warned he will be tough on Indonesian sovereignty.

Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek says Mr Joko's comments about Australia pushing boats back to Indonesia are telling.

"It is not a good start," she told the ABC on Sunday.

"As we have said all along, it is a very big deal for Indonesia that the (Australian) government is making announcements about what's happening on Indonesian waters and soil without talking to (that) government."

Before arriving in Jakarta, the prime minister visited Papua New Guinea to meet with Prime Minister Peter O'Neill.

The leaders discussed the global response to Ebola and the importance of preparedness in the region, among other bilateral issues.

Aussie markets tipped for strong start

AFTER solid performances in the US and Europe markets, the Australian bourse is tipped to open strongly in a busy week of data releases.

US consumer confidence rose to its highest level since 2007 and housing starts jumped strongly in September, while European car sales were up, renewing investors' faith in markets.

The Australian dollar finished higher on Friday at 87.44 US cents while the ASX200 futures contract was up 68 points, or 1.3 per cent, AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said.

That pointed to gains of 65 to 70 points at Monday's local open, he said.

Markets also had been encouraged by better than expected profits from Morgan Stanley and General Electric and the announcement that Europe will soon begin its quantitative easing program.

"All of those things saw investors come back with a bit of a vengeance on Friday so consequently our market will have a good start," Dr Oliver told AAP.

On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose or 1.6 per cent to 16,380.41 points on Friday and the S&P 500 index climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,886.76.

Investors will also have plenty of data to study this week, Dr Oliver said, with the focus in Australia on Wednesday's release of inflation figures, which he expects to show a decline.

"We have seen falls in petrol prices, fruit and vegetable prices have come off and we also saw the end of the carbon tax," Dr Oliver told AAP.

Benign inflation figures will probably encourage the RBA to leave interest rates at low levels, he added.

Clues on the RBA's position on rates will be revealed in speeches by Governor Glenn Stevens on Thursday and the RBA's deputy governor Phillip Lowe on Tuesday, when the bank's last board meeting minutes will be released.

Both speeches will likely suggest rates will remain on hold for some time yet, Dr Oliver said.

Chinese economic data, to be unveiled on Tuesday, will reveal expectations of commodity prices, which could impact the dollar.

And some volatility in the markets will likely continue, Dr Oliver said.

"There's still a lot of uncertainty around about the global growth outlook and the Ebola scare continues in the US and in Europe," he said.

BINTU SANNOH , 13, DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF EBOLA ON HER SIERRA LEONE COMMUNITY

EBOLA is not a pleasing name to me. In fact, I hate even to hear the word — it has destroyed my family and education.

Life was hard but OK: I live with my aunt and many family members in a big compound; we have always been poor but there was happiness.

But now we are terrified. Too many people, friends and families, have died and are still dying. And the number of orphans increases on a daily basis.

When ebola first arrived in my country, we weren’t too worried. Then came “sensitisation” — all the community groups and NGOs running around talking about ebola.

But many refused to believe in the danger and even tried to make politics out of it. We had a riot in Kenema, under the banner of “ebola is not real”. Some said the government does not care about ebola because the government is from the north and the virus is in the east (home of the opposition party).

Others said it was because doctors wanted your blood. There were so many stories and no one took ebola too seriously. Then, in early August, the situation changed. The government banned all movements in and out of Kenema and Kailahun districts. This hurt everyone, not just those with ebola, as almost everything came to a standstill.

We were trapped — and still are.

My aunt, who used to go to the trade fair to buy local goods at low prices, could no longer travel. We had less money at home — like everyone apart from the rich people who Aunty said made money because of high prices.

Things got much worse still when ebola came into our community. There was a pharmacist who got ill but said he was suffering from a septic ulcer, so he never went to the hospital. We believed him because he was a medical man and maybe because we didn’t know any better.

Many people came in contact with him during his illness. When he died, his corpse was washed and prepared for burial by people in the community, as is our custom.

But when his death was reported to the hospital, it was found that he had died of ebola. After about two weeks, several people who had come in contact with him and those who washed his corpse fell ill. Out of fear, the chief called for the ambulance that came and took three people to the hospital. Then 16 more people, including dear Aunty, became ill and, when tested, were confirmed ebola positive. Out of that number, only Marie, a 14-year-old girl who lives with us, and my aunt mercifully survived — or else I too would be an ebola orphan. I guess I am the lucky one, but it is hard to see it like that.

Even now, with all this, there is a problem with educating people about ebola. I just met two of my friends who told me about the illness of their uncle and how they were taking care of him at home, which they should not be doing as their uncle might have the ebola virus.

Over 100 children have been orphaned in my community alone. Who is going to take care of them? How will they survive or even go back to school? Fear always grips me when friends who I know don’t regularly wash their hands with chlorinated water want to play with me.

Thinking a little towards the future, how do I go back to school? Where will my aunt get money to support our education again? It is hard to depend on others. We want to depend on our own like we were learning to. Because of my aunt’s weakness and the difficulty of trading we have eaten the money there was in the business. We are suffering. If ebola does not kill us, maybe hardship and hunger will get us down if no one helps us before Christmas.

Three of my friends who were to sit exams have been impregnated already and I am also under pressure to go after men in order to survive and to buy a dress for Christmas. This is what girls have to do in Sierra Leone when there is no money. It is not right, but it is normal. If this ebola does not end soon, many more girls will get pregnant before schools reopen and that will be too bad for the future of children in this country.

I should be in school now but all schools are closed indefinitely. I am worried because by the time schools reopen, there will be too many dropouts due to poverty and teenage pregnancy. Of course, those who get ebola and their families suffer the worst. They have no food to eat and even the properties that are burned down are not replaced. But everybody in Sierra Leone is suffering.

Australian ebola strike force on notice as US grapples with killer virus

AN Australian medical rapid response team has been put on notice to be ready for potential regional deployment in case the ebola outbreak becomes a global pandemic and reaches neighbouring countries.

The Saturday Telegraph has learned that contingency plans for a potential spread of the virus to countries north of Australia are already being drawn up by the defence and health departments. Senior members of Australia’s rapid response team known as AUSMAT — trained in field hospital treatment, disaster management and disease containment — are believed to have already been notified that they could be called on if any cases of the deadly virus ­appeared in our region.

A senior government source confirmed contingency plans were being put in place for a rapid response to neighbouring countries such as PNG — if called upon — to help secure their borders and contain an outbreak should the virus spread to our region.

“Those plans are currently being worked on by the defence and health departments,” the source said.

The taskforce comprising officials from the defence department and health department and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet have been tasked by the National Security Committee of Cabinet to prepare plans for a regional outbreak.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, who yesterday warned the greater risk to Australia was the spread of the virus to our region, said border control measures in Australia would also be lifted should the virus turn up in the region.

Health Minister Peter Dutton said the risk remained very low for Australia and that the country was well prepared to deal with any domestic cases or a potential spread to our region. Several Australian hospitals are known to have run mock emergency exercises based on a potential ebola case.

But national ebola guidelines have remained unchanged after a meeting of chief medical officers yesterday, even though Queensland and the US have upgraded their protocols governing protective clothing for health workers.

After a phone hook-up with state medical officers, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Baggoley, said he was confident state and territory health authorities had well-developed systems in place to fight ebola.

Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young yesterday upgraded her state’s response and said anyone travelling to ebola-affected West Africa would be required to notify the state’s health department.Meanwhile, Nina Pham, the first American healthcare worker infected with ebola on US soil, has appeared in a video taken at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital smiling and joking with colleagues. She has since been transferred to the National Institutes of Health just outside Washington.

THE World Health Organisation has declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in Senegal and commended the country for its diligence.

THE World Health Organisation says it commends the country for its diligence in putting a stop to the transmission of the virus.

In a statement on Friday the WHO said the sole introduced case was confirmed on August 29 in a young man who had travelled to Dakar, by road, from Guinea, where he had had direct contact with an Ebola patient.

The statement called Senegal's response "a good example of what to do when faced with an imported case of Ebola."

It said Senegal government's response included identifying and monitoring 74 close contacts of the patient, prompt testing of all suspected cases, stepped-up surveillance at many entry points and public awareness campaigns.

DEPUTY Labor leader Tanya Plibersek says Australia should be doing its part to battle Ebola in west Africa before it gets to our region.

AN Australian medical rapid response team has been put on notice to respond should any cases of Ebola be diagnosed in neighbouring countries, News Corp reports.

But Labor has renewed calls for Australia to step up its response to the outbreak in west Africa, saying the government should support volunteers who want to assist.

Deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek says Australia must act before the virus hits Australia or neighbouring countries.

"We can not afford to wait until Ebola reaches out to Australia before Australia becomes part of the global effort to control this virus," she told reporters in Sydney.

United States health experts estimate Ebola could infect 1.4 million people by next year if the virus is not controlled.

About 4500 people have died from Ebola, mainly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The Australian government has committed $18 million to help fight the west African outbreak but has been criticised for not doing enough.

The US military is building up to a force of 3200 troops in Liberia and Senegal.

About 20 to 30 Australian volunteers are in west Africa, working with non-government agencies.

The Australian government says it won't order defence personnel or health workers into the area until appropriate evacuation procedures are put in place.

The 30-hour flight to Australia is long enough for someone with Ebola symptoms to die and so far the government hasn't been able to secure extraction agreements with countries like the US.

Ebola danger just too great

According to Labor’s Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek, the Abbott government’s $18 million contribution towards fighting the ebola crisis is not good enough.

Australian medical personnel and support teams must be dispatched to West Africa, she insists, even though there is no strategy in place to ensure their safety.

With any flight home taking a minimum of 30 hours, sheer practicalities would support the federal government’s reluctance to send workers to the region given their survival, or even access to adequate medical treatment, cannot be guaranteed should they become infected.

“I think it would be a little irresponsible of an Australian government to order Australian personnel into this very dangerous situation if we didn’t have effective risk mitigation strategies in place and at the moment there is no way of doing that,” the Prime Minister has said.

Despite the best efforts of senior diplomats to broker an agreement with the US, Britain or a member of the EU, none have as yet agreed to treat any Australian health worker who happens to fall victim to the ebola virus.

This would leave a long and painful flight back to Australia as the only evacuation procedures available to a citizen who becomes infected, a highly unrealistic scenario given health minister Peter Dutton has pointed out patients would be unlikely to survive the arduous journey home.

He has also queried Ms Plibersek’s assertion she has taken advice that supports her claim that affected workers in West Africa could be safely repatriated.

“If the advice is not available to government, I don’t know how it is available to the opposition,” Mr Dutton observed.

As a generous nation, it is only natural Australians feel inclined to assist in the global fight against the escalating ebola crisis.But, for now, geographical realities mean that, as with Japan and Korea, the most effective and wisest contribution we can make is in sending our money and equipment — not people.

THE latest bout of market volatility has picked up sharply and analysts say this is a great opportunity for investors to ­revisit their portfolios.

So which companies should be traded in, which need a stint on the bench, and which ones should be shipped off?

“Every year you get a pullback in the markets, anything from 8 to 15 per cent in value. That’s a good time to get rid of the deadwood in your portfolio,” Wealth Within chief analyst Dale Gillham says.

However the old adage of time in the market, not timing the market, is of utmost ­importance, others say.

IG Markets analyst Evan Lucas said investors needed to view the latest market upheaval in the context of the time frame of their investment outlooks. “You can certainly look at investing if you’re a buy-and-hold and shove-it-in- the-sock-drawer type ... there’s stocks that are looking ­considerably cheap,” he says.

“But this trade period, if you like, is still well under way. We haven’t seen the endpoint yet.” Lonsec senior client adviser Michael Heffernan says the waves of volatility washing through global share markets need perspective.

“I see more positives than negatives on the horizon,” he says. “The US company reporting season is about to hit its stride, our own banking reports, due in a few weeks, could trigger a reversal in fortunes and more stimulus measures in Europe would provide a boost.“The negatives — such as ebola, oil prices and geopolitical concerns — can be quarantined to some extent.”

THE EBOLA CRISIS MEANS THE WORLD IS ON A DANGEROUS JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN, WRITES SUE DUNLEVY

It kills 70 per cent of its victims within 16 days, it has defeated the first-world health system in the US and unless its contained within 60 days ebola is forecast to slay millions globally.

The UN’s deputy ebola co-ordinator Anthony Banbury warned this week that, unless the virus was contained by December, the world will face an “unprecedented situation for which we don’t have a plan”.

As the first infections of the killer tropical virus occurred outside West Africa this week, even the carefully considered containment plans of modern health systems like the US and Australia were called into question.

Texas nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson took on one of the most terrifying jobs in healthcare when they nursed ebola patient Thomas Duncan. They should have been safe in a modern US hospital but they still caught the disease.

Their plight has raised serious questions about what we know about the spread of ebola and the advice healthcare workers are being given about how to protect themselves.

The World Heallth Organisation reports more than 9000 people have caught the disease and 4500 have been killed by it. Disturbingly, 427 health workers have contracted ebola and over 236 of them have died.

The US was severely embarrassed when the virus showed up lax adherence to infection control in a Texas hospital. It was later revealed an infected nurse had travelled on a plane with the permission of the US Centres for Disease Control and visited a bridal shop, possibly infecting 136 others.

Schools were closed and school buses disinfected in Texas and Ohio because students had travelled on the same plane as the infected nurses. The news that an astounding 77 poorly protected health workers had contact with Thomas Duncan has also caused alarm.

It’s these type of slip-ups in a globalised world with extensive air travel that could easily see this virus explode to become a human catastrophe.

A chastened US Centres for Disease Control was forced to overhaul its infection control guidelines after the nurses became infected and now says health workers must wear full fluid-proof suits, goggles, two sets of gloves and rubber aprons when treating ebola patients.

In Australia our state and federal medical officers were forced to revise the adequacy of our guidelines, which are based on CDC protocols.

And it left the Australian Medical Association and public health experts raising questions about how prepared we are to deal with the virus.

“Dallas, Texas is a first-world facility and you would not expect that two healthcare workers would become affected by ebola by treating a patient with ebola. So I think, in light of that, people need to review the way that they are conducting management,” AMA president Dr Brian Owler said.

“We do have concerns about the preparedness of Australia,” Professor Owler said. President Obama called in health experts as he tried to take control of the crisis and Australian doctors complained our own government had failed to meet health leaders to reassure them about how prepared we were.

It emerged that Australia’s defence force has never had access to an isolation pod that can be inserted into an aircraft to transport infected patients.

This raised questions not just about our preparedness for ebola but how ready we are for any type of bioterrorist attack or other infectious disease outbreak.

Three state governments — Queensland, NSW and Western Australia — hastily purchased five of the isolation pods in recent weeks, months after the ebola outbreak began.

Health officials in some states admitted some smaller country hospitals may not have the protective equipment to keep health workers treating ebola victims safe.

On average every person who has developed ebola infects two others and the World Health Organisation warned this week within two months there would be 10,000 new infections a month unless more effort was put into containing the disease in West Africa. By January there could be 1.4 million people infected.

Australia has been a step ahead of the US in its infection control advice. We had already set up designated ebola hospitals in each state; the US is just embarking on this process.

Australian guidelines call for healthcare workers who treat an ebola patient to take off their protective gear in the presence of another person who can check for any infection routes; the US is only just now recommending this.

We’ve been interviewing travellers from West Africa when they cross our border for months, while the US only began doing this last week.

Nurses in many of our designated hospitals have been going through ebola drills, practising putting on and taking off the cumbersome protective gear they need to wear when treating an ebola patient. However, experts were this week questioning whether Australia’s infection control guidelines are strong enough. University NSW Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Raina MacIntyresays public health officials aren’t considering all the evidence when they insist ebola can only be spread by contact with body fluids from an infected person.

A 1999 study of an ebola outbreak found five of the 19 people who contracted ebola after visiting the home of an ebola patient had no contact with the patient, pointing to transmission by another mode.

A 1995 study found control monkeys caged in the same room as infected monkeys caught the disease In 2012 a study found monkeys without direct contact with ebola infected pigs caught the disease.

Experts fear ebola could become an explosive health problem if it became airborne and was able to be transmitted through microbes suspended in the air in the same way as influenza, measles or chickenpox.

“I can’t imagine anything in my career — and this includes HIV — that would be more devastating to the world than a respiratory transmissible ebola virus.” Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.

Expert opinion says the ebola virus currently enters the body through breaks in the skin, through the eyes, nose or mouth and tricks cells in the immune system to make copies of itself and then attacks the blood vessels.

Patients with the virus suffer extreme vomiting, diarrhoea and rash, their kidney and liver functions are affected and they bleed both within the body and externally. Between 50 and 90 per cent of patients die within six to 16 days of symptoms appearing.

Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert William Schaffner told Scientific Americanthat to become airborne the ebola virus would have to change so it could attach receptors in the upper respiratory pathway — “something that neither it (nor any of its viral cousins) has been known to do in the wild”.

However, the further ebola spreads the greater the chance it has to mutate. And there is some evidence it is already changing, with researchers from the Broad Instituteand Harvard University finding 300 genetic changes in the virus in the latest outbreak.

Professor MacIntyre says we should consider the possibility that ebola patients could generate large droplets of liquid that evaporated into smaller droplets which stay in the air.

“The dogma it’s not airborne is too simplified, we need to be looking at some of these paradigms,” says Professor MacIntyre.

“One of the blatant facts, like the emperor’s new clothes, is that healthcare workers are getting infected wearing the right clothes and that should be our starting point,” she says.

“We need to be acknowledging other modes of transmission are possible.’’ MacIntyre says business schools teach that, when plans begin to fail, instead of learning from their mistakes leaders often escalate their commitment to a failing plan — and she fears this could be happening here.

But public health authorities don’t want their message clouded. Two doctors at Cairns Hospital were stood down for speaking to the media about their concerns about a potential ebola patient being managed in the emergency department.

“To punish doctors for speaking to the media is not the right approach. Nor is the right approach to blame the health worker victims for the infections,” says MacIntyre.

There are two possible explanations as to why health workers who are using the recommended protective clothing are becoming infected, she says.

They could be making mistakes putting on or taking off the gear or the guidelines could be wrong.

She’s calling for a rethink on the protective gear recommended for healthcare workers treating ebola patients. A study by MacIntyre and two other researchers published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies questions the recommendations health workers use only surgical masks when providing routine care of ebola patients.

The study says evidence suggests P2/N95 respirator masks would provide greater certainty of protection from the virus. The paper questions why infection control guidelines call for much tougher protection for lab workers exposed to ebloa, who ”must adhere to the highest level of biocontainment (BSL4) when working with the virus”.

Lab workers must use a positive pressure space with a segregated air supply and use showers and vacuums to contain any spread of the virus even though they are exposed to it in a much more stable environment than a nurse.

The largest US nurses association, the National Nurses United, this week demanded nurses be given hazmat suits to wear when treating ebola patients.

The US Center for Disease Control late this week changed its guidelines to require health workers to wear overalls that provided full body coverage when treating ebola victims.

However, the president of Australia’s College for Infection and Prevention Control Belinda Henderson, and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, have rejected the need for hazmat suits to treat ebola victims.

They claim the all-in-one suits could help the disease spread because they are difficult to remove.

“Hazmat suits are like a big plastic overall with a breathing unit built in, they are quite sweaty and bulky,” says president of the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control Belinda Henderson.

She says Australian guidelines are based on the evidence that ebola is an organism transmitted by blood or body fluids and we take contact and droplet precautions. These include gloves, a fluid resistant gown, a fluid repellent surgical mask and eye protection.

The ebola crisis has sparked a fierce political debate about whether Australia should send health workers to West Africa to contain the virus.

The President of Sierra Leone has written to Tony Abbott pleading for Australian health workers. Sixty professors of public health and the Labor opposition have written to Mr Abbott calling for our expert Australian Medical Assistance Teams to be sent.

“I don’t think it is the time to put our heads in the sand and suggest that Australia should shut its doors and just pretend the problem is a West African problem and let other nations handle the problem by themselves,” AMA president Professor Brian Owler says.“Unless we actually tackle the problem at its source, we are not going to see the problem go away,” he said.

ATLANTA A WHISTLEBLOWER nurse has slammed the Texas hospital where a man died and two staff contracted ebola, claiming her employer gave her protective clothing that exposed her neck.

Briana Aguirre claimed medical staff at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas “never talked about ebola” and weren’t given emergency training.

“I watched them (the hospital) violate basic principles of nursing,” the nurse told Today in the US.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has been heavily criticised for turning away “patient zero” Eric Duncan when he first sought treatment on September 25, and after two nurses who treated him — Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson — caught the disease.

Ms Aguirre said she treated her colleague Ms Pham, 26, and now fears for her own health. She said she was shocked by the insufficient protective gear she was provided, as a gap of several inches around her neck was left exposed.“I’ll be honest, I threw a fit. I just couldn’t believe it,” she said. “In the second week of an ebola crisis at my hospital, the only gear they were offering us at that time, and up until that time, is gear that is allowing our necks to be uncovered?”
