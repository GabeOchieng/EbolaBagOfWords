Guinea is trying to halt the spread of Ebola in its capital, with the health ministry identifying five suspected cases of a deadly virus outbreak estimated to have killed 70 people.

The cases were detected in Conakry as West Africa's first outbreak of the disease moved from rural regions to the city of more than two million people. In neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia, 11 more people have died from suspected Ebola, stirring concern that one of the most lethal infectious diseases known to man could be spreading in the impoverished region, which is ill-equipped to cope.

Health officials in the West African nation of Guinea said yesterday that they were treating four cases of Ebola in Conakry, the first time the deadly virus has reached the capital, which has a population of three million. At least 63 people have died in the country's south since an Ebola outbreak began last week.

The virus causes haemorrhagic fever in its victims, with a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent. A spokesman for the health ministry said the new cases involved patients who had been in contact with the body of one of the earlier victims.

Guinea has banned inhabitants from eating bats after an outbreak of the Ebola virus left at least 60 dead.

Scores have died of haemorrhagic fever in the country since the start of February, with the Ebola virus identified as the cause in 13 of 45 samples.

West Africa was on high alert after Sierra Leone warned that the virus had crossed its borders and five deaths in Liberia were being tested for the virus.

Bats, commonly eaten in West Africa, often act as a host of the virus.

Shops have been trying to bully us to part with our Christmas[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/] cash since at least October, but data from the high street suggest that consumers have left it later than ever this year to buy gifts. Though time may be running out, and stress levels rising, that does not mean you have to be one of the estimated 20 million consumers who succumbs to panic buying at Christmas.

So, in an attempt to help feckless shoppers, who find department stores in December as comforting as sunbathing on the Titanic, we have compiled a gift guide - of all the items you should avoid. This is our roundup of the worst gifts of 2013.

1. Xmas jumper with fire place, £16, George at Asda

Festive jumpers are back in fashion - in a lazy, ironic sort of way. They are to Christmas what the pink stetson is to hen weekends, proof of gruesome bonhomie.

This one, however, is rather special. It features a scene of a festive mantelpiece, but instead of a fire there is a aperture into which you slot your smartphone. Presuming you have downloaded the free app, your phone’s screen will display the fire’s flickering flames. Yes, a century after Alan Turing’s birth, computer technology has done something useful - made our Christmas jumpers come alive. Bravo.

2. Roadkill fluffy toy, £24.99, Firebox

Well, they are certainly original. But after that it’s hard to find anything positive to say about Twitch the racoon and Splodge the hedgehog, whose guts, spleens and lives spill out of their little fluffy stomachs. Even the most ghoulish, snot-obsessed, scab-picking little brat you give this to might be alarmed. If you really want gross-out fluffiness, opt for the £7.99 super-sized microbe teddies such as the Ebola virus and e.coli, which in their own twisted way are educational. Who knew that chlamydia was cute?

3. Cookie cutter Kama Sutra, £17.99, Firebox

If there is one thing that is more likely to kill any festive libido it is a “naughty but fun" gift. Because they are rarely naughty and never funny. Chocolates willies, edible underwear, ‘naked’ aprons - put them away, you’re embarrassing the children.

These expensive gingerbread men cutters also manage to produce shapes that look nothing like the erotic and supple positions revealed in the ancient Hindu text. The finished biscuits resemble dinosaur droppings. Or possibly a rabbit being murdered by a swan.

4. Downton Abbey Bathing Collection, £16, Marks & Spencer

Yes, I know that Aunt Mildred adores Downton Abbey, but even she would shudder to receive a gift that smells not of the subtle notes of freesia and mandarin but the unmistakable scent of your desperation. And however effective the bath cream, it could not wash away the grubbiness of the production company squeezing the very last commercial drops from the show as if they were Ethel working the mangle. If servant chic is really your thing, buy something from the surprisingly tasteful Blenheim Palace Below Stairs range.

5. One Direction singing toothbrush, £9.99, Asda

Your niece may worship the ground that Harry, Zayn, Niall, Louis and Liam walk on; she may already have the posters, dolls, duvet cover, onesie and silver-plated heart bracelet featuring their bequiffed faces. But there is one thing she can live without: a singing toothbrush. Once you press the button the wretched “What Makes you Beautiful" plays for two minutes (to encourage her to brush for the dentists’ recommended time) and you can’t turn it off. The song will - quite literally - be playing inside her head every day. Torture.

6. American Originals Popcorn Maker, £14.99, Argos

When, when, when will we ever learn? It was fondue sets in the 1970s, Sodastreams in the 1980s and juicers a few years back. Our generation’s Ozymandias of the kitchen, vast and trunkless, and as useless as a shower cap for Harry Hill, is the popcorn maker. It doesn’t even do a very good job, spitting out uncooked corn like an angry old woman, which will leave your kitchen covered in low-calorie shrapnel for days to come.

If you like homemade popcorn, buy a saucepan. It really is that simple.

7. Chad Valley Argos Alien Doll - Baby Blue, £9.99, Argos

It’s one thing to patronise a high street giant, it’s quite another to become their commercial patsy. This horrid blue alien, which would give most toddlers nightmares before Christmas, is the “star" of Argos’s seasonal adverts. Admittedly stuffed toys from television ads are nothing new; BT was pushing Buzby a full three decades before the meerkats invaded the toy box. Yet at least those these animals had some wit. These aliens are creepy, uncuddly and charmless.

8. Fifty Shades of Grey No Peeking Soft Twin Blindfold Set, £11.99, Superdrug

The sales figures do not lie: millions of women (and even a few men) devoured “Fifty Shades of Grey", EL James’s bonk-and-spank-fest. But, come on! I think the message behind the appalling prose was that you should let your fantasies run wild. Popping into Superdrug to buy a blindfold that you could pick up for free on a long-haul flight is as about as erotic as a wet weekend in Bognor. And the least said about the “Soothe me after spanking cream" the better...

9. Love Buggy wine holder, £28, House of Bath

Wine accessories. There is no other phrase that sends shudders down true drinkers’ spines than these two dread words. Claret aerators from Lakeland, novelty drip catchers, Heath Robinson bottle storage solutions. They are the garden gnomes of the kitchen - designed to prove “I have a sense of humour" and invariably owned by crashing middle-management bores called Melvyn.

This buggy is the grand cru of naff, over-priced wine accoutrements. Why does anyone need a “wine holder", let alone one that seems to encourage drink driving? Baffling. What to buy a wine lover this Christmas? How about a nice bottle of wine?

10. Tweet cloud poster, £14.99, Firebox

No other gift captures more perfectly the narcissism of our age, except, perhaps, a montage of all the selfies you took in 2013 (now there’s an idea...). This is a poster-sized distillation of all the tweets that you have sent over the last few weeks, with the most used words given more prominence. They are displayed over an enormous version of your Twitter avatar.

To be clear: it’s a jumble of inane, foolish, prattles accompanied by your huge mug. Ready to be framed and admired. When the historians of the future come to analyse how our civilisation ended, they need look no further than this Christmas gift.

Tim Yeo deselected. Rejoice! Just Rejoice!

This is such good news that I thought I'd nip in before Delingpole. Tim Yeohas been deselected by South Suffolk Tories[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10485742/Tim-Yeo-dropped-as-Tory-MP-by-local-party.html], where he's been MP for 30 years. As we report:

In June he was caught up in a newspaper sting and faced allegations that he offered to lobby ministers and "coached" a business associate who was due to give evidence to his committee. He stood down temporarily from his position as chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee while the allegations were investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.The committee cleared him of wrong-doing and he returned to his post last month.

So, cleared of wrong-doing, but my God the man was deeply entrenched in the profitable rich man's hobby known as the "renewable energy industry" (profitable for those involved in it, that is – not for the taxpayer). He never saw a wind turbine he didn't like. To quote James Delingpole writing in his Telegraph blog on June 9 this year[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100220897/trougher-yeo-we-mustnt-laugh/]:

In some of these blogposts it may gently have been hinted, with this column's characteristic delicacy and tact, that there may be a degree of conflict of interest between the 200,000 plus per annum Yeo snaffles from his green businesses (on top of his MP's salary) and his fierce advocacy in Parliament and behind the scenes of the kind of environmental regulatory measures without which this kind of business would be unlikely to survive commercially.

Indeed. And, mirabile dictu, Andrew Sinclair, the BBC's man in East Anglia, has given us a fair-minded account of why Yeo was deselected:

For the last year or so there's been a growing sense of frustration among Conservatives in South Suffolk.

Constituencies around them had chosen young and dynamic MPs like Therese Coffey, Dan Poulter and Ben Gummer who seemed to spend all their time in the commons championing local causes. Some suggested Mr Yeo, on the other hand, appeared more concerned with his various directorships.

The final straw came with the Sunday Times' undercover sting. Mr Yeo was cleared of any wrong doing this week but the shaky footage of him boasting about his connections did nothing to help.

His local association had hoped he would decide to retire at the next election so that he could make a dignified departure from politics. But he wanted to go on and so very reluctantly they've had to tell him that it's time for change.

My emphasis. The man's 68, for God's sake. It's nearly 20 years since he last held ministerial office, resigning from John Major's government after fathering a love child with a local Conservative councillor. There's only one bit in the BBC report that doesn't quite ring true. South Suffolk Tories told him "very reluctantly" that it was time to move on. Hmm.

Oh, and the icing on the cake. Will Straw wades in:

In what sort of fantasy world are South Suffolk Tories Tea Partiers? Presumably the same one in which Tim Yeo is an "environmentalist".

Delingpole: Just why is Tory MP Tim Yeo so passionate about green issues? [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100144779/]

Delingpole: Tim Yeo – like a cross between Ebola and Chris Huhne [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100172094/tim-yeo-like-a-cross-between-ebola-and-chris-huhne/]

The Collected Short Stories of TC Boyle, volume 2 review; In TC Boyle’s unadorned fictions, a bleak universe is redeemed by the beauty of nature

There are 61 short stories in this tome, 14 of them newly published; the rest collected over the past couple of decades. They showcase TC Boyle[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9617407/San-Miguel-by-T-C-Boyle-review.html] as a writer whose considered, unadorned prose returns again and again to the same themes: man’s isolation and fragility; the line between humanity and animals; the obsessive love of a man for a woman, rarely consummated and usually ending in voyeurism or excessive violence.

Dead, drowned and damaged teenagers are frequent; alcoholics and bums stagger through the pages; old people are often left on their own, quite literally, to die.

This may all sound pretty bleak, yet more often than not, Boyle allows for some form of corrective from the natural world: a dragonfly in the otherwise creaky “The Silence", in which a man goes on a three-year retreat where nobody is allowed to speak. Because of this rule, his wife is abandoned to her death. The insect offers a glimpse of hope.

In “What Separates Us From the Animals" it is light itself: “Let me tell you, everything in that room and the room beyond it shone as if we were seeing it for the first time, both of us, and when the sun broke free and poured through those spotless windows to pool on the shining floor, the glare was almost too much for us." Moments of silence and stillness provide respite for his embattled protagonists, when man and nature coexist peacefully in a timeless, perhaps even prelapsarian frame.

In “The Marlbane Manchester Musser Award", we get a fleeting glimpse of a writer who leads “a pretty hermetic existence". An excursion into the real world leads to his wrongful arrest; he decides not to go on such expeditions again.

That spirit of non-engagement infuses the whole collection (indeed, in his introduction, Boyle admits to not doing much research, instead finding inspiration in books and his imagination).

Boyle’s journeys into terrains other than California[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/northamerica/usa/californiaandsouthwest/] often reap rewards, as in “Sin Dolor", in which a doctor in a South American township befriends a boy who can’t feel pain: here Boyle puts his prose to poignantly effective use.

Perhaps the best piece in the collection, a novella called “ Wild Child[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/7316742/Wild-Child-by-T-C-Boyle-review.html] ", sees a feral boy brought in by a doctor in postrevolutionary France. Painstaking attempts to civilise him largely fail.

Here Boyle[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8480723/When-the-Killings-Done-by-TC-Boyle-review.html] revels in the things that he loves best: “Did he know he was human? He must have. He had no words to form the proposition, no way of thinking beyond the present moment, but as he grew he became less a creature of the forest and more of the pasture, the garden, the dim margin where the trees … gave way to cultivation."

However, Boyle’s other attempts at historical fiction can lack conviction: “Madam Knight", for example, in which a woman goes on a very long, very boring journey, is also very long and very boring.

Most of the pieces here communicate a wistful desire for fewer humans and more wildness: “After the Plague", one of a handful of experiments with speculative fiction, sees the vast majority of humans wiped out by a horrific Ebola-style virus: the protagonist doesn’t seem to mind very much, and in fact goes out of his way to avoid the other survivors.

Boyle can be prophetic or admonitory when it comes to the forward march of human technologies: he examines the internet in “Peep Hall" and cloning in “Admiral", while “Jubilation" is almost Ballardian in its dissection of a newly built society.

The animals (real or metaphorical) largely win; in Boyle’s world, technological progress cannot save us from ourselves.

This is an admirable collection, not least for its titanic strength. While I began to wish that Boyle were more adventurous in his vocabulary (although he has an odd preference for “tegument" over covering, he prefers to keep things simple), this is an important book that contains revelation, tension and beauty, even if reading it can feel like being arm-wrestled by a giant.

One odd thing: in his introduction, Boyle promises “laugh-aloud" stories. Maybe it’s an American thing, but I never even cracked a smile.

HIV vaccine possible after scientific breakthrough, study claims; Scientists hope to be able develop a vaccine to prevent HIV after capturing the most detailed picture yet of a key Aids protein

A vaccine to prevent HIV could be on the horizon after a major breakthrough in understanding the structure of disease, a new study reveals.

Scientists have determined the first atomic level structure of HIV’s 'envelope' protein, which they say is of great value for medical science.

The findings provide the most detailed picture yet of the Aids-causing virus's complex envelope, which help it enter human cells.

The understanding could help find parts of the virus which future injections could mimic to elicit a protective immune response.

Around 34 million people are infected with HIV and although drugs are used to manage many infections, there is no vaccine that can prevent new infections with the aim of ridding the world of the virus.

None of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection thanks to the challenges posed by the envelope protein, known as Env.

Env's structure is so complex and delicate, scientists have found it difficult to get the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it.

Professor Andrew Ward, of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), explained: "It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it's on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable."

In the study, researchers created a version of the Env three-component structure that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, but that retains virtually all the structures found on Env.

Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography the researchers were able to look at the new Env.

It was the first ever study of Env, and both methods resolved the structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before.

The study for Science Express revealed how Env assembles and undergoes shape changes during infection, and showed how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses – such as flu and Ebola.

Professor Ian Wilson, of TSRI, said: "Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine."

Professor John Moore, of Cornell University who helped with the study, said: "Now we all need to harness this new knowledge to design and test next-generation trimers and see if we can induce the broadly active neutralising antibodies an effective vaccine is going to need."
