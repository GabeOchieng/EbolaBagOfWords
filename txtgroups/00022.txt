the French Left's hatred of Sarkozy is his greatest asset

rench politics, never a happy place at the best of times, takes on a special hysteria when Nicolas Sarkozy appears. Just as an otherwise sensible New York friend once told me a decade ago, in all seriousness, that she'd like to kill the then president George W. Bush with a stake through the heart, and anti–Thatcher groups threw celebration parties when the Baroness died, the man some call the "elevator–shoed poison dwarf of Europe" provokes blinding rage in his critics.

Many of them, quelle surprise, belong to the media and chattering classes. Hence headlines on the Left and Right commenting on Sarkozy's "defeat" as he was elected to the head of the UMP party with 64.5 per cent of the vote last weekend. What they object to, of course, is what will happen next: his presidential bid in 2017.

No matter that François Hollande ranks at under 13 per cent in the opinion polls, unemployment has plateaued at 3.5million, and Marine Le Pen scores close to 30 per cent of the national vote in the polls, all but guaranteeing her a place in the 2017 runoff. In private, a Socialist senior adviser involved in the last two presidential campaigns may have told me "the only true rampart against Le Pen is Sarkozy", but she refused to be quoted. Sarkozy's return has been likened to the spread of Ebola and the Ten Plagues. The UMP electronic voting system was hacked for several hours with a Stuxnet–like virus, as if Sarko's victory was on a par with Iran acquiring a nuclear device.

Stopping Sarko at all costs means François Hollande has been regularly seeing two Le Monde reporters who have investigated scandals attached to Sarkozy's name, such as allegations that he was financed by the L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, and a possible implication in kickbacks for a Pakistani arms deal more than 20 years ago, of which he has already been cleared in the French courts. Ironically, it was the Le Monde reporters who gave Sarkozy's complaint that he was unfairly targeted by judges some substance. In their book Sarko s'est tuer, Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme revealed that François Fillon, Sarkozy's former PM, and his likely rival for the conservative nomination for the 2017 election, had begged Jean–Pierre Jouyet, the chief of staff at the Elysée Palace, and a personal friend of Hollande, to "hasten the judicial investigations" against the former president. "He's coming back! He will return!" Fillon reportedly said at a secret lunch with Jouyet, as if announcing the zombie apocalypse.

Sarkozy's enemies in his own camp hate him perhaps even more than most Socialists. The Davet–Lhomme book ended up harming Fillon far more than Sarko; but Sarkozy's own partisans (and he still has many) among the rank and file spoiled last weekend's proceedings when they booed Sarko's most serious contender for the presidency, Alain Juppé, the former prime minister under Chirac, and the mayor of Bordeaux, at a rally in his own city. Sarko didn't stop them in time. This was, to almost one third of the party members, a return of the old–style Sarko — and so they voted for his two rivals in the contest.

Can the "new" Sarkozy acknowledge his mistakes as he makes them? Yes, according to his entourage: he was apparently furious about the Bordeaux rally. He immediately extended a hand of peace to his UMP rivals, which seemed sincere, even though almost no one gives him credit for it.

But, in the end, the anti–Sarko frenzy may serve him well with the French: it has already given him the stature of an outsider, fighting the establishment on all fronts – no mean feat when you've already been president of the French Republic for a full mandate – and neatly stealing Marine Le Pen's USP.

The Ebola crisis will hit the fight against malaria

Back when West Africa was known as the White Man's Graveyard, missionaries lived in fear of blackwater fever. A side–effect of repeated exposure to malaria that signals imminent kidney failure, it gets a shuddering mention in accounts of tropical life, from George Orwell's Burmese Days to Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter.

Today, thanks to modern anti–malarial medicines, Western visitors who travel in Greene's footsteps need not fret so much. But among local people, malaria remains a major killer.

An estimated 560,000 people across sub–Saharan Africa died of it in 2012. In Liberia – a nation of just four million – malaria killed nearly 5,000 people last year. And it will probably claim far more than that this year, thanks to the decimation of the country's fragile health service by the Ebola outbreak, which has forced most of its major hospitals and clinics to close. For aid workers, the true human cost of the outbreak lies not just in the thousands of people killed by the virus, but the potentially far greater number who die from lack of medical attention – be it for malaria, a car accident, or even diarrhoea.

"In Liberia, they normally have thousands of deaths from malaria every year even when the public health service is functioning, so if you imagine how many more have died this year, it may be a multiple of that," says Richard Allan, director of the Mentor Initiative, a British NGO that trains Liberian health workers. The Telegraph is supporting this NGO – via the Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative – this year as part of its Christmas charity appeal.

A similar point was made by no less a figure than the Queen, during a meeting earlier this month in London with one of Britain's leading infectious disease experts at Chatham House, the international affairs think tank.

She told David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, that her own physician had pointed out that malaria was a greater killer than Ebola, and remarked: "After Ebola, we will still have malaria."

Malaria remains the biggest killer in Liberia, claiming 17 per cent of all deaths, followed by diarrhoea on 11 per cent, and HIV, tuberculosis and malnutrition on 5 per cent each.

So how many additional victims will these various killers claim this year as a consequence of the Ebola outbreak? That is hard to say. The chaos that accompanied the collapse of Liberia's health system back in the summer means there are no proper mortality statistics.

With the state health service in paralysis, much of the slack over the past six months has been taken up by private pharmacies – usually small shacks selling a few drugs. In the past two years, Mentor has trained nearly 300 of them in basic medical techniques, working on the principle that some health care is better than none. The "dispensers" have proved a lifeline in many communities, but they have also paid a price. Three are believed to have caught Ebola.

Due to concerns about Ebola transmission, Mentor has also had to suspend a malaria testing service that it had trained the dispensers in, because it requires a pinprick of blood from a patient.

While Liberia's health service is now in partial recovery, the other way forward is in encouraging every household to observe sound hygiene practices. And that is where the Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative comes in – the charity is planning a major new programme to train communities in disease control techniques for Ebola and other infectious illnesses.

If one positive thing can emerge from the Ebola crisis, it is that such epidemics may at least be curtailed in the future.

'If s like working in a war zone'

AsEbola cases near 7,000, Cherrill Hicks meets a British nurse recently returned from west Africa

One minute Elizabeth Hood was enjoying a garden party at the Palace; the next, the nurse and midwife was leaving her native Northumberland and catching a flight to West Africa, into the very heart of the deadly Ebola outbreak.

"It was surreal," she recalls, as we sit in a bar overlooking Newcastle's quayside. "The Palace garden party was for Red Cross workers, and it was lovely. There were miniature scones and a fruitcake from a First World War recipe – and chocolate cakes decorated with crowns. Prince Charles was there, and Princess Alexandra. Then, within a few days, I was on a plane bound for Sierra Leone."

In her early fifties, with a wonderfully dry wit, Hood comes across as modest and unassuming. Yet she has spent a large part of her professional life in all the crisisridden, war–torn parts of the world one can possibly think of. She was in Ethiopia during the Eighties famine – "I do believe Bob Geldof gave me a Live Aid badge"; in Iraqi Kurdistan during Saddam Hussein's reign of terror; in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake; Pakistan during the disastrous floods that year; and in Taliban–controlled Afghanistan for many years, training midwives and working as a "hygiene promoter".

What drew her to work in these places? "Travel opportunities," she says with a grin. But then she turns serious. Educating people about simple, life–saving practices such as handwashing and sanitation is an issue she is passionate about – and one which is also crucial in the battle against Ebola.

This summer, Hood was sent to Kailahun, a poor trading town near the Sierra Leonean border with Guinea, surrounded by jungle. It was in this area that the country's first cases of Ebola emerged last May. (The first case in the current outbreak, in a two–year–old boy, occurred in Guinea in December 2013.) Since then, the death toll has reached nearly 7,000, according to figures released yesterday, the vast majority of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone – this last still recovering from civil war and already ravaged by malaria and cholera.

Hood found conditions there dreadful. Hospital staff had no protective equipment, not even gloves. Ambulances were in short supply, and there was only intermittent water and electricity. People were living in fear. Those who could had fled; schools and banks had closed, and whole communities were in quarantine.

Travelling around the country by four–wheel drive, her job was to train and support local health workers and volunteers trying to prevent any spread of the disease, especially in rural areas, where it hit hardest. That meant educating local people about protecting themselves and their families, while also convincing the country's powerful chiefs and religious leaders.

Amid the terror and panic caused by Ebola, she strongly believes it was crucial to give people hope. "They were so frightened, and there is so much stigma attached to the disease.

If they have symptoms, they go into hiding and are looked after by their families who are then also at risk." She recalls how at the hospital in Bo, the country's second–largest city, several nurses simply ''ran away" when it emerged that an Ebola patient they had been caring for had died; in their panic, they may have unwittingly carried the risk of infection home to their own families.

"To overcome the fear, to stop people with suspected symptoms hiding, we had to give them hope," she says. "The message we wanted to get through was: 'If you have symptoms, don't go into hiding – go to the isolation hospital and get tested'."

There is no cure for Ebola. Trials on experimental drugs and vaccines are being fast–tracked, and earlier this month promising results from a new vaccine tested on 20 US volunteers were reported, with no adverse effects. Larger trials are to follow. Still, there is some evidence, says Hood, that with good supportive care in the early stages, victims are more likely to survive. "If you can bring down someone's temperature and blood pressure, prevent dehydration and make sure they get vital nutrients, it can make a difference."

Being quarantined may be frightening, she says, "but we would point out they were less likely to pass on the infection to their family".

Her teams, of more than 100 volunteers, also tried to persuade the families of the dead not to prepare the bodies for burial but to call in "body–management teams", since it is now thought that the traditional ritual of washing and kissing the body is a prime cause of the disease spreading. "Patients are highly contagious for six months after their death," she says. "But it's very difficult to persuade people to change rituals overnight.

"It is also hard to combat people's beliefs about Ebola – that it was sent by the government to kill the rebels, that only bad people get it, that it is caused by snakes or witchcraft.'' It is, though, important not to pass judgment, she cautions.

One piece of advice was to avoid physical contact and large gatherings – in a country where churches and mosques are often overflowing.

"It's hot there, so everyone sweats, and the infection can be passed on in a crowd," says Hood. "But this is Africa – people love large gatherings. It's just like Newcastle," she smiles, "– any excuse for a party."

Even harder advice for people to follow was not to eat bushmeat. Meat from monkeys and bats is a staple in the west African diet, but it is also implicated in the spread of Ebola. Yet even the trained volunteers she was working with were "horrified" at the thought of giving it up. "People did go on eating it – the monkeys were still being laid out on slabs in the market."

Hood admits she was scared for herself on occasion. So many health workers in Sierra Leone had died from the disease, including Sheik Umar Khan, the country's leading expert on haemorrhagic fever.

"It's just as frightening as working in a war zone," she says. "Even if you follow all the correct hygiene practices and wash your hands regularly, someone you are in contact with might not."

Her own health was at risk in other ways. She stayed in "very basic" guesthouses, often washing in water collected in buckets from the river: she is relieved that a recent test for bilharzia, a common parasitic infection, came back negative.

Hood has nothing but praise for the commitment and bravery of local nurses and volunteers; by contrast, she is scathing about the efforts of the international community.

She is strongly supportive of the Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative – a partnership between the UKsupported Masanga Hospital in the north of Sierra Leone and the Mentor Initiative, a British non–governmental organisation in Liberia, which The Telegraph is backing as part of its Christmas Charity Appeal this year.

Using interactive programmes that can be understood in local languages and animation in areas of low literacy, British medical and aid specialists will train health–care and community workers in educating people across the region about infection control.

Hood is currently working as a bank nurse at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, one of three UK hospitals outside London designated to treat Ebola casualties – and where last week two children were tested for the disease.

It's a long way from Sierra Leone, but she hopes to return. "The Sierra Leoneans are lovely. The people I worked with were committed, brave and had a fabulous sense of humour.

"They are very musical too: if you go into a room and introduce yourself to everyone, by the time you've finished, they'd have made up a song about you."

It's ironic, she says, that on the new Band Aid release, there are no west African voices. She does not want to come across as any kind of "saviour". "I hate the idea that we are going in to save them," she says. "The people there can overcome it themselves – if only they are given the resources."

Elizabeth Hood went to Sierra Leone as part of the British Red Cross emergency response unit

United Cacao sweetens Aim with flotation value of £23m

'Chocolate deficit' has fuelled doubling of cocoa prices in a decade as demand escalates

THE financial adage "invest in what you love" is about to get a lot easier for chocoholics. United Cacao is to float on London's junior Aim market today, making it the first publicly–listed pure–play cocoa bean plantation in the world.

On its pre–flotation roadshow to woo investors, the company handed out chocolate bars with an unusual list of ingredients – "freehold land, investment grade country, excellent growing conditions, proven management and tax free zone" – and a caution on the front that read, "Warning: may cause investor excitement" to potential shareholders. The listing comes at a time of unprecedented global demand for chocolate, with production problems in the major supplier countries prompting concerns about an impending chocolate shortage.

"This is an incredible opportunity to change the confectionery industry," Dennis Melka, the founder, chairman and chief executive of United Cacao, told The Daily Telegraph. "We're competing in an industry that really hasn't changed in 100 years."

The vast majority of the world's exported cacao is produced in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria, which means the industry is "resting on the back of three very fragile African countries", Melka says.

This corner of West Africa is susceptible to drought and disease, and fears that this region could be hit with Ebola from its infected neighbours, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, saw the price of cocoa surge by more than 10pc in September.

Although cocoa prices have since settled to their pre–summer levels, they are still about a third higher than they were 18 months ago, and have more than doubled in the past decade.

Lauren Bandy, food analyst at Euromonitor International, says: "Pests and diseases, weather (particularly El Nino) and political instability are standard factors fuelling the trend in escalating cocoa prices. None are new, and I expect they will always be there."

These factors, along with an increase in consumer appetite, particularly in China and India, have prompted several major chocolate manufacturers to warn that the so–called chocolate deficit, where demand outstrips supply, could reach 1m tonnes by 2020 and double that 10 years later.

This is part of the reason why Melka believes United Cacao can be "a positive force of change" in the industry.

United Cacao is based on the mouth of the Amazon in Peru, about 30 minutes away from Iquitos, the fifth–largest city in Peru and the biggest city in the world that is inaccessible by road. Melka calls it "the best place on Earth and the lowest– cost location to grow cacao."

He highlights the benefits of farming in Peru compared with West Africa: it's an investment grade country with positive fiscal balances, zero net debt as a nation, with freehold land, constant regular rainfall each month, a good tradition of agriculture and no export tax.

What's more, the cocoa bean is indigenous to the South American region. "All cacao on earth came from there – it's the home of cacao," Melka says.

"You have this innovation that you don't have in Asia and Africa – and no export tax, which means we're free to send [the cacao] anywhere on Earth."

United Cacao employs 400 local Peruvian staff, who are paid electronically via direct debit, and the company says it helps the farmers to plant their own cacao by lending where the banks will not.

The company prides itself on this ethical, sustainable approach, and of course charges its customers a premium for it.

United Cacao has approximately 320 hectares of planted crops to date and plans to increase that to 2,000 hectares by the end of 2015, using the proceeds from its IPO, before completing the planting of its existing 3,250–hectare estate a year later.

Shares will begin trading on the London Aim market tomorrow morning, under the ticker CHOC. United Cacao raised £6.4m from the sale of 5m shares at 128p each, and will have a valuation of £23m.

Melka says none of the company's early funders – its directors and private investors – exited their investments in the IPO, and Mr Melka bought an additional $1.4m (£0.9m) worth of stock.

Virtual Reality is real virtual empathy

Facebook’s $2 billion acquisition of headset maker Oculus Rift underscores how much investment is being made in Virtual Reality, a reality that can ease the end of life… and take people into other worlds more ‘real’ than their own.

A friend of mine’s grandmother is 101 years old and every night takes the radio to be with her to feel comforted by other voices in case anything happens to her overnight.

For a woman of her age, such an analogue approach to the end of her life is understandable, those who are middle-aged now would probably prefer to take a laptop or mobile to bed, but for younger people it is almost certain to be a Virtual Reality device.

Earlier this year in the US, terminally ill grandmother Roberta Firstenberg became too immobile to go outside and expressed a wish to her granddaughter, Priscilla that she wanted that more than anything else in the world.

Fortunately for her, Priscilla was a videogames artist and familiar with Virtual Reality and its possibilities. She contacted Oculus Rift, the makers of extraordinary VR headsets, who sent over a development kit to Priscilla to use with her grandmother.

After several tutorials and demos, Mrs Firstenberg became enamoured of the device and her granddaughter managed to mash together some of her favourite sights, sounds and smells for a virtual walk in the country.

Four weeks later, Mrs Firstenberg died, undoubtedly comforted at the end of her life.

The work of Generation X writer Douglas Coupland also illustrates how technology can help with those afflicted with physical trauma. While Coupland’s ideas seemed Utopian when written in 1990s, Mrs Firstenberg’s experience is likely to be replicated millions of times in the future because of the advancements in Virtual Reality.

The idea of hospices, or even ‘Euthanasia Centres’ supplying Virtual Reality headsets to their patients, along with comforting drugs, seems fanciful in 2014, but is likely to be mainstream thinking within a couple of years.

The technology is highly likely to be the game changer for empathetic experience; and not only for those close to death. The ability to be taken to other parts of the world to ‘feel’ what it is really like to be afflicted with Ebola or cowering under fire in Syria will be a very powerful experience and one that is likely to lead to more understanding.

It will certainly have more topical impact than re-recording a song about Africa that was relevant in 1984, but is now almost offensive in patronising the people that well-meaning pop stars are trying to help. A few sessions for these singers strapped to a VR headset and a real African experience would certainly improve their lyricism, if not their attitude.

Rewind FX is one UK company that is making huge strides in this area. Based not in London’s Shoreditch hub, but in Hertfordshire’s St Albans, Rewind FX works with some of the world’s biggest brands, organisations and games companies in Virtual Reality and ‘creates immersive realities and craft engaging stories’.

“Virtual Reality can be used to offer positive empathetic experiences, like allowing disabled people to transcend their disabilities and visit unreachable places, regaining their freedom of movement, as with our London Rift Experience.

“It can also be a powerful ‘understanding’ tool, providing people with an unparalleled level of immersion into someone else’s world. Recent viral videos such as 10 hours of walking in NYC as a woman, would be more impactful if the audience was able to actually ‘walk’ in the subject’s shoes through an VR experience,” said Solomon Rogers, Founder and Managing Director, Rewind FM.

Last month at a demonstration in London, I was lucky to see the technology for myself and enjoyed a two-minute experience as a Red Bull Air Racer, something that was as exciting as a recent, ‘real’ stunt flight I experienced with a wacky pilot mate of mine.

Other demos such as a ‘musical voyage’ through the Burning Man festival were less impressive, but Rogers’ earlier allusion to his company’s London Rift experience truly is a 360-degree ‘immersion’ into a different world.

While the release of Google Glass raised unrealistic expectations of wearable technology, Rewind FX’s content shows what can be possible as much as Oculus Rift’s headsets can ease another person into the next alleged life.

The experiences of Mrs Firstenberg and her wonderful daughter may be more about death than life, but digital content that makes human empathise by ‘being there’ is a different kind of reality that may be easier to live with than we think.

Telegraph Christmas charity appeal: The life-saving dogs who sniff out danger

As part of our 2014 charity appeal, The Telegraph visits the medical detection dogs who learn to smell cancer

“Without Magic, I’d be dead now. It’s as simple as that.” Claire Moon makes it sound so matter-of-fact.

She is certainly not going all soppy over the two-and-a- half-year-old labrador-retriever cross, that sits contentedly at her feet.

Mrs Moon is a hard-working NHS children’s nurse, full of down-to-earth commonsense, but she is also a long-time sufferer of an extreme form of Type 1 diabetes.

Eight years ago she lost her natural ability to spot surges, up or down, in her blood glucose levels.

“Sometimes they change by the minute, and I would be waking up all through the night to check them. If I didn’t monitor them and top up, I’d become unconscious”.

Magic is a medical alert assistance dog from Medical Detection Dogs (MDD), one of The Telegraph Christmas charities[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/telegraphchristmasappeal/] . He has been specifically trained to detect the scent Mrs Moon gives off when her blood sugar peaks or dips.

He warns her by putting his paw on her knee. If she is busy and ignores him, he will put his face right into hers. Mrs Moon can then inject more insulin or take sugar to stabilise her condition.

“Magic even brings me my kit, and wakes me up in the middle of the night if it is happening then. He sleeps at the foot of our bed,” says Mrs Moon, a married children’s diabetes nurse at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

Because her symptoms can come on when she is working, Magic accompanies her in his smart red MDD coat.

“I feel much more confident now with him at my side because I know I’m not just going to pass out in front of patients. And because I’m not waking every hour in the night to check my sugars, I have a lot more energy than before.”

When a colleague first mentioned MDD to Mrs Moon, she recalls thinking, “Yeah, yeah, right. I don’t need an assistance dog. I can look after myself.” But she couldn’t.

The collapses were leading to hospital admissions, and there were fears that worse could be on the horizon.

So she went along to an open day at the charity’s headquarters, on an old airfield outside Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire.

“I was amazed,” she recalls, “at what I heard and saw”.

The part of the brain that controls smell is 40 times more powerful in dogs than in humans, meaning they can detect odours at a concentration of one part per trillion.

It is a skill that has been harnessed in sniffer dogs, searching out drugs and contraband. But it was not until MDD came along that it was used to help those with conditions such as diabetes and Addison’s disease, which affects the adrenal glands.

Like all MDD dogs, Magic, donated to the charity as a puppy, went through the organisation’s 18-month course in socialisation – how to follow instructions, to behave well, to do what his owner said.

During that time he lived with a foster family near the charity’s offices. It has a strict no-kennels policy. He was then assessed and earmarked as a medical awareness dog, and was one of several introduced to Mrs Moon as possible companions.

“He was such a big clumsy whatsit,” she recalls. “He just fell into the room. It was like speed-dating, only with dogs. I fell in love on the spot.”

There followed eight weeks of specific training for Magic to get used to the smells particular to Mrs Moon and her diabetes – especially important because Magic is around others with diabetes when he goes with her to the hospital.

Then he came to live with Mrs Moon and her husband at their Stevenage home.

Training continued until Magic was fully accredited.

“For the past six months, he hasn’t missed a single high or low,” says Mrs Moon.

“He may look like a blond moppet, but he’s brilliant. Given how often my levels go up and down, and what the consequences could be for me if I didn’t notice, I’d say he’s saved my life about 1,500 times over that period”.

Or, to put it another way, Magic has saved the NHS the cost of the four to six hospital admissions someone with Mrs Moon’s symptoms might be expected to need over that period as a result of not being able to control her diabetes quickly enough.

And Magic’s training – at around £10,000 – costs roughly the same as one admission.

This, then, is not about getting sentimental over dogs – though you would have to be pretty cold-hearted not to warm to the sight of Magic’s big brown eyes keeping vigil over his mistress.

It is about potentially substantial savings to the health budget at a time when it is under sustained pressure.

At present MDD has 38 medical alert assistance dogs at various stages of their training, and a further 55 out with clients like Mrs Moon.

Some were handed over as puppies from litters. A few are rescue dogs, though MDD has to pick very carefully those suited to the demanding task.

And some are what the charity’s Rob Harris calls “career change dogs” – those that have been through extensive training to be guide dogs for the blind, but were finally judged to be too easily distracted by smells.

What made them unsuitable in one context makes them potential superheroes in MDD’s work.

The alert assistance dogs, though, are just one aspect of what MDD does. Mr Harris is the charity’s bio-detection manager. At the other end of the building, he is running a research trial.

He is working with Nan, a black ladrador, Teasel, a brown and white springer spaniel, and Jack and Kizzy, both liver-coloured cocker spaniels. They wait eagerly in their baskets while Mr Harris explains what they are about to do. The MDD set-up does not feel like a laboratory.

These are happy dogs, for loving foster homes, here to have some fun.

In 2004, MDD’s founder, psychologist Dr Claire Guest was part of a team that published a paper in the British Medical Journal showing that cancer had an odour and that dogs could smell it.

That led her to set up the charity in 2008, among other things to provide medical alert assistance dogs.

But then in 2009 Dr Guest’s own labrador, Daisy, alerted her to a cancerous growth in her breast by “boshing” the spot with her nose.

Dr Guest had not noticed any lump, but checked herself out, found something that concerned her and was then diagnosed by a mammogram and core biopsy.

She had caught her cancer early and made a full recovery, but it inspired her to set up a trial where dogs like Nan, Teasal, Jack and Kizzy are specially trained to sniff out breath samples from those with breast cancer.

The samples are provided by 15,000 patients at nearby High Wycombe Hospital, as part of the research project.

It works like an identity parade. First Jack comes in, bight-eyed and bushy-tailed. When instructed by Mr Harris, he runs round a shiny aluminium carousel sniffing at the eight pots of breath samples, each in an identical holder and section.

He stops confidently at number six, sits down, and looks up for a treat. He has found the odd one out — as he has been trained to do.

But what for Jack is so simple is also, potentially, a quick, cheap and easy way of detecting breast cancer, or a new means of regular screening.

Watching each dog confirm time after time that they can pick out the right pot is extraordinary.

This is clearly more than a learned trick. And similar results are being achieved with prostrate, bladder and renal cancers using urine samples.

“The trial is about evidence-building,” explains Mr Harris, and then moving to publication.

“There has been a lot of scepticism about dogs’ ability to do this, but here we are putting that to the test.”

If it can finally be proved – as there is no doubt in my mind given what I have been watching – it could have a vital role to play as an accessible method of early detection for a variety of cancers.

Or – more blue skies – it could be the basis for research to create an “electronic” equivalent of a dog’s nose to test samples in a lab.

The possibilities are huge, but right now for MDD their focus is to provide the evidence that will start opening these doors.

For Jack and his pals, though, it’s just one big game.

CHILDREN CLEARED OF EBOLA Two children tested for Ebola after arriving from an undisclosed location in Africa have been cleared of the virus, Public Health England (PHE) has said.

The children, whose ages have not been released, underwent precautionary tests in Newcastle for Ebola and malaria. "The overall risk to the general UK population of imported Ebola continues to be very low," PHE said.

Boris Johnson must have come across some slippery characters in his political career, but none as positively reptilian as a monitor lizard.

He managed to grab the lizard by the tail before it scampered away during yesterday's visit by the Mayor of London to Singapore's Botanic Gardens to endorse its bid to become a world heritage site. Mr Johnson was guided on his tour by Nigel Taylor, the gardens' director and a former head of Kew Gardens in London.

Kew Gardens has longstanding links with the Singapore gardens.

Kew provided the 22 Para rubber seedlings that helped to launch south-east Asia's rubber industry in 1877.

Mr Johnson said: "What was so amazing was to see the connection between London and the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It's a symbol of the transfer of knowledge.

"Don't forget that plants hold the key to so many medicines we are going to need to crack Ebola and these sorts of problems.

"Much of this lies in the study of plants, and this is a critical resource for the world."

Unesco's decision on Singapore Botanic Gardens' nomination could be reached by June 2015.

A British technology company has developed a unique platform for West Africa, a hi–tech training solution for unskilled front line carers fighting for lives. Matt Warman reports

The Ebola crisis in West Africa is moving inexorably closer to claiming 6,000 lives. By the end of January, just a couple of months away, experts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict 1.4m cases across 20 countries. Unprecedented numbers of lives, not to mention the economies of an entire region, are being ruined.

There is, as yet, no vaccine.

But British experts hope that technology may help halve today's 70pc mortality rate. The Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative aims to use computer software and tablets to train health care workers and survivors (thought to be immune and vital in the fight to contain Ebola) how to prevent the disease spreading, and build up trust with local communities.

The simple, initial idea is to make sure everyone knows exactly how to put on the personal protection equipment (PPE) and how to take it off again safely.

The Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative is one of three charities being supported by this year's Telegraph appeal, and with your help it could be up and running in 10 hospitals by Christmas. It's a partnership between the UK–supported Masanga Hospital in Sierra Leone, and the Mentor Initiative, a British NGO, already established in Liberia, which has vast international experience of training.

Immerse Learning is the technology company providing the software. Its chief executive, Tom Symonds, describes what he admits has been "a hugely challenging project", as a unique combination of knowledge and technology with an ability to iterate and improve. "This isn't about neat tech," he says, "it's about saving lives."

In practice, that means initially a single learning module that can run on basic computers. It will offer expert instruction from basic PPE used by those involved in triaging and screening, through to the full advanced kit – which involves eight stages for safely putting it on and 17 for safely taking it off.

The programme may look simple, with no text at all, but it represents the combined wisdom of experts including the World Health Organisation's Dr Simon Mardel. With a voiceover in Krio, the most prominent Sierra Leonean dialect, it offers hope that the damaging effect of what Symonds calls Chinese whispers may be diminished.

"One mistake in putting this equipment on can be fatal," he says. "With this training module, you could say to a healthcare worker, take yourself through it on a computer. We're aiming at people with no in–depth medical knowledge, but with a voiceover and a graphical experience, either on their own or with a trainer, we'll be teaching correct procedure every time."

Tom Gale is a consultant anaesthetist and director of assessment at Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry. Showing people how to be safe around Ebola before they meet any patients will massively increase their confidence, he says. "They won't be sitting there just listening to a PowerPoint. This platform is unique in its ability to increase engagement. It's making simulation accessible to all the health carers who need it. We're going to focus on regaining the confidence of the community and healthcare workers – putting PPE on will allow them to manage cases and see that they can make a difference."

Simple improvements, possible only because technology such as tablets will get the software to the right place at the right time, will make a tangible difference. "For the first time," says Symonds, "local people with almost no education will be taking the right steps, and given clear understanding of the impact of the right and the wrong decision. That's huge."

A British technology company is developing a unique platform for West Africa, discovers Matt Warman

The Ebola crisis in West Africa is moving inexorably closer to claiming 6,000 lives. By the end of January, just a couple of months away, experts at the US Centers for Disease Control predict some 1.4million cases across some 20 countries. Unprecedented numbers of lives, not to mention the economies of an entire region, look sure to be decimated.

There is, as yet, no vaccine. But British experts hope that using technology, today’s 70 per cent mortality rate could be cut in half. The Masanga Mentor Initiative aims to use computer software and tablets to train survivors, immune from the disease, in how to prevent the disease from spreading, and more importantly to build up vital trust between local communities and healthcare workers. The simple, initial idea is to make sure that everyone knows exactly how to put on the vital personal protection equipment (PPE) that can prevent the spread of the disease, and how to take it off again safely too.

The initiative is one of three charities being supported by this year’s Telegraph appeal, and with your help it could be training in ten hospitals by Christmas. It’s a partnership formed between the UK-supported Masanga Hospital in Sierra Leone, and the Mentor Initiative, which is based in Liberia and has vast experience and contacts stretching across the world.

The technology company providing the software is Immerse Learning. Chief Executive Tom Symonds describes what he admits has been “a hugely challenging project,” as a “unique combination of knowledge and technology with an ability to iterate and improve. This isn’t about neat tech,” he says, “it’s about saving lives”.

In practice, that means initially a single learning module that can run on basic computers available in the West African countries affected. It will offer expert instructions on how to put on basic PPE used by those involved in triaging and screening in a health centre, through to how to don the full, advanced equipment that takes eight stages to safely put on and 17 to safely take off. While the programme may look simple, with no text at all, it represents the combined wisdom of experts including the World Health Organisation’s Dr Simon Mardell, and using a voiceover in the most prominent Sierra Leonean dialect Krio, it offers hope that the hugely damaging effect of what Symonds calls Chinese whispers might be diminished.

We’re aiming at people with no in-depth medical knowledge, but with a voiceover and a graphical experience, either on their own or with a trainer, we’ll be teaching correct procedure every time.”

The greater potential comes with the software’s ability to be updated and improved whenever better techniques are discovered, and also in its potential to expand into a more comprehensive learning platform for healthcare.

Tom Gale is a consultant anaesthetist and also Director of Assessment at Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry. An expert in simulation training, he says showing people how to be safe around Ebola before they meet any infected patients will massively increase their confidence. “They won’t be sitting there just listening to a PowerPoint lecture,” he says. “This particular platform is unique in its ability to increase engagement. It’s making simulation accessible to all the healthcare who need it at the correct time. The thing we’re going to focus on is regaining the confidence of the community and healthcare workers – putting PPE on will allow them to manage the cases and see that they can make a difference and tackle this condition.”

In that sense, argues Gale, simple improvements, permitted only because new technology such as tablets will soon allow the software to be in the right place at the right time, will make a huge, tangible difference.

“For the first time,” adds Symonds, “local people with almost no education will be taking the right steps, and given very clear understanding of what the impact is of the right and the wrong decision. That’s huge.”

Lizard outruns Boris Johnson during botanic gardens race for world heritage status

Boris Johnson gave a lizard the fright of its life during the Mayor's tour of Singapore's botanic gardens to boost its bid for world heritage status

Well, you’d run as well wouldn’t you? With Boris Johnson chasing after him, the terrified lizard at Singapore’s botanic gardens was taking no chances.

Quick as a flash he scuttled into the undergrowth, safe from the reach of the Mayor of London, who was visiting the gardens to endorse it’s bid to become a world heritage site (WHS).

“Poor little lizard, being chased around,” said Mr Johnson, before returning to his tour by Nigel Taylor, the garden’s director and former head of Kew Gardens, in London.

London’s Kew Gardens has a long history with the Singapore gardens, to which it provided 22 para rubber seedlings in 1877 – kick-starting south east Asia’s rubber industry.

Mr Johnson said: “I think it’s absolutely stupefying. What was so amazing was to see the connection between London and the Singapore botanical gardens.

"They brought the plants here, the original rubber plants that were used to seed all the plantations of Asia, started the whole rubber industry, made it possible for us to drive cars, all the bicycles, condoms, you name it, all because they brought seeds from Kew which had been nicked from Brazil, planted them here. It’s just wonderful to see them and that it’s still going on.”

He added: “It’s a symbol of the transfer of knowledge the continuing toing and froing, the cross pollination and also don’t forget that plants hold the key to so many medicines we are going to need, vaccines, we are going to crack Ebola, these sorts of problems. Much of this lies in the study of plants and this is an absolutely critical resource for the world here.”

Mr Johnson also saw an orchid dedicated to Margaret Thatcher and visited a traditional lodge.

At the end of the tour, Marcus Agius, chairman of trustees at Kew, said: “We are here because we are celebrating a memorandum of understanding we are going to sign for five years, maybe ten, of increased cooperation between the royal botanic gardens at Kew in London and the botanic gardens in Singapore.”

Dr Taylor said: “The Singapore Botanic Gardens has a close and long relationship with Kew Gardens through the years, as both gardens share similar objectives in conservation, science and heritage.”

Singapore’s first bid for a Unesco World Heritage Site began with the submission of the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ official nomination dossier to Unesco in February this year. Unesco’s decision on Singapore Botanic Gardens’ nomination could be reached by June 2015.

Over–65s are discovering a new life online, thanks to a project that is building bridges between young and old, keeping minds active and loneliness at bay, says Sarah Rainey

Gladys Evans is old enough to remember the invention of the colour television, the days before household telephones and the advent of the computer. But as her nimble fingers dance across the screen of an iPad, it's hard to believe the 95–year–old was introduced to her first tablet just six months ago. "I love online shopping," she trills, tapping her way through a list of fur jackets on the M &S website. "Ooh, that's a nice style. Ninetysix pounds for that long one. It's not for me – it's for my daughter, who's getting married. Shall we send her an email about it now?"

Beside her in the living room of Abbeyfield care home in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, sits Laura Wanstall, an 18–year–old business student, guiding her through the web pages on the screen. "She's so patient with me – I'm very slow," says Gladys. "I'm not terribly good at the email yet. My hands get shaky. But it's easy to use; I think that's why I've taken to it." On her knee is a well–thumbed notebook, containing scrawled reminders on everything from how to find online knitting patterns to German translation tools. "I don't get out as much as I'd like, and this keeps my brain ticking over," she says, smiling.

Gladys's new–found enthusiasm for the internet is due to her participation in the Click! programme, an innovative intergenerational project designed to improve digital confidence and ability among the over–65s. Set up in 2012 as a response to government statistics showing that 4.8million people in this age group had never been online, the Click! programme operates in 26 of Abbeyfield's UK care homes, and is supported by nearly 100 volunteers aged between 16 and 25. Most of the charity's residents are elderly, lonely and infirm – and it is hoped that improving their digital skills will help combat this, by forging relationships and understanding across generations.

Designed to be part of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, which requires participants to volunteer as part of the award, Click! connects local young people with elderly residents. For an hour every week, over 12 weeks, they come into the home to help with their digital needs. From online banking to shopping, games, emails and video calls to friends and relatives abroad, the content of each session is personally tailored to the resident. Though some volunteers leave once the course is over, many end up returning time and time again, having made lifelong friendships.

Laura signed up after reading about the programme online.

"I have family members who have been in Abbeyfield, and I was looking to do some voluntary work, so I thought, 'Why not?'" she says. "At the beginning, people were a little intimidated by it. We did a group session and lots of people came – but quite a few said afterwards that they didn't think it was for them." Gladys, immersed in her shopping, chips in: "I think some of them were a bit scared and a bit past it – they couldn't take it all in." In the end, seven Abbeyfield residents joined the programme, led by four students from a nearby school.

Gladys uses the internet to shop, play solitaire and look up pictures that her daughter Adele, a photographer in Norwich, has uploaded to the web. "I still can't believe I can see them on the day she takes them," she says, proudly scrolling through colourful nature shots. "It's like she's right here." Now widowed, Gladys has three daughters, four grandchildren and three great–grandchildren. Her husband, John, was an RAF squadron leader, and they lived in Cheltenham before, 11 years ago, her health deteriorated and she came to Abbeyfield. "My family all use computers and talk the jargon – and I wanted to join in. It's natural these days; you grow up with the internet."

House manager Claire Snowdon says the effects of the Click! programme on the residents have been remarkable. "They're in high spirits after the sessions. Gladys will ask me to print off knitting patterns she's seen online; two of the other residents use the iPads to play each other at Scrabble. They like knowing the lingo – things like Skyping and WhatsApping – to impress their grandchildren. There's a real sense of achievement; this is something they never thought they could do."

Another of Wendover's digital converts is Jane Wordingham, 77, who moved into the home earlier this year. She was given an iPad in 2007 by her son–in–law, who was moving with her daughter to Australia, and has been learning ever since. "I started with a Tesco shop and took it from there," she explains. "When I lost my husband, I got more into it. I used to watch the children on their iPads, so I wasn't completely out of my depth. I got an email address, I started playing games and I do my banking online now, too. I still haven't mastered double–clicking, but I'm not bad at the rest."

For Jane, learning to use an iPad has also been something of a lifeline. Her daughter and family have now moved to Singapore, while some of her grandchildren are still based in Australia. Volunteer Georgia Lindstrom, 17, from Ivinghoe, has taught her to use the FaceTime app to make video calls to them, which she does every weekend. "I'll be sitting minding my own business, and suddenly there are chimes going off," she says, laughing. "I'll think, 'What's that loud noise?' before realising it's them ringing me on FaceTime. It's nice to know they're thinking of me." Jane is even on Facebook, which she uses to keep track of her grandson while he is travelling abroad.

The Click! project is designed to work both ways – while Abbeyfield's residents learn digital skills, the volunteers gain valuable lessons from the sessions. "It's sort of like a skills swap," says Claire. "The residents take great interest in the students' education, lives and future plans. They build friendships with people they wouldn't naturally meet – it's a real social thing; a highlight of the week."

Nearly 300 miles away, at another Abbeyfield centre just yards from the beach in Falmouth, Cornwall, Anne Roberts, 74, is dipping her finger into virtual paint pots dotted around a screen. A passionate artist, Anne enrolled in university after her husband died, and honed her skills through a fine art degree, where she developed a passion for etching and illustrating children's books. Devastatingly, last year, a stroke robbed Anne of the use of her right arm, meaning she was no longer able to do the hobby she adored. "Art has always been a very important part of my life," she says, wistfully. "It was a terrible time. I tried to go left–handed, but it was so frustrating. I had some very low times. I felt that I'd lost it all and everything I'd ever done was a waste of time."

Aware of how much her art meant to her, staff introduced Anne to the Click! programme, and 20–year–old volunteer Ruan De Wit. Ruan, a graphic design student at Falmouth University, helped Anne understand how to use the iPad and introduced her to some simple artwork apps, which Anne could use with her finger on her affected arm. "We set the iPad up and looked at some apps I use in my studies," he explains. "When I came back the next time, Anne had already drawn these amazing things. It took me by surprise. All I needed to do was show her which buttons to press and she got the hang of it. To see how much technology can aid her is very rewarding."

These days, though Anne has regained some movement in her right arm, she hasn't ventured back offline. "I haven't bothered," she says, smiling. "I'm hooked on the iPad. Ruan helped me find special programmes about threads and weaving and ancient textiles in Peru. And all the visual stuff is brilliant. I get my inspiration from living by the coast – the trees, houses, the shells on the beach – and here you can look straight out of the window and enjoy a beautiful glimpse of the sea."

Anne's only living relative is her son, who is based in Australia, and Ruan's company means more to her than IT support. "Ruan is a great help and a good friend. What he has done has given me hope."

Abbeyfield's Click! project changes lives. But it is expensive to run, and relies on donated iPads from supporters, which are lent out from the national headquarters. "Once residents get a feel for them, we encourage them to buy their own," explains Claire. "Older people like tablets because they're intuitive – swiping left or right instead of a mouse. This gives them an insight into why so many young people are glued to something in their hand. They realise that it's not just ignorance; there's a whole world out there."

The charity hopes donations to the Telegraph's Christmas Charity Appeal will provide much–needed funds for this new technology.

Back in Wendover, Gladys is busy securing a charger from the staff so that she can bring her iPad up to her room to continue shopping. "I haven't actually ordered anything yet," she confides, "but I hope it won't be long. My daughters might not be very happy if I start spending all my pension online. But I'm having great fun. I would love a laptop if I could get one on my Christmas list." She grins. "It's a wonderful life, with the world at your fingertips, isn't it?"

Digital exclusion

According to Office for National Statistics figures, 99 per cent of 16 to 24–year–olds have used the internet, while usage among the over–55s is considerably lower.

National statistics show that 29 per cent of people aged 55 to 64 have never been online.

Among the over–75s, usage is even lower: around three fifths have never accessed the internet.

A 2011 study found that 40 per cent of over–65s spent only 12 days a year in the company of a young person.

Meanwhile, 67 per cent said they felt they could learn something from young people.

Researchers estimate that by 2030, 700,000 elderly people will be cut off from government services, shops and local communities because of a lack of digital knowledge.

Doctor who gave Ebola nurse painkillers sues

A SPANISH nurse who became infected with Ebola while treating a patient in Madrid is being sued by her local doctor over her claims that the nurse was told to treat her symptoms with paracetamol.

Teresa Romero, who caught the deadly virus from a Catholic missionary last month, is facing legal action from a GP who claims that the feverish nurse never mentioned that she had been working in an Ebola ward.

The unnamed GP alleges that, had Miss Romero been more forthcoming, she would never have been simply sent home with paracetamol, a move that made the GP look incompetent and caused a national scandal when it was first reported in the Spanish media.

The GP has threatened legal proceedings for defamation, and has claimed through a lawyer that records from the clinic "bear witness" to her version of events.

The row over what was or was not said during the consultation at Miss Romero's local clinic is just the latest in a series of libel actions and legal fingerpointing to arise from Miss Romero's case, which has already done considerable damage to the reputation of Spain's health service.

Officials have already come in for heavy criticism over their alleged failure to give Miss Romero and her colleagues proper training and protective overalls when two elderly missionaries, who had been working in Liberia, were flown back to Spain for what was supposed to be expert treatment.

Miss Romero, who has since recovered, has already launched a €300,000 (£280,000) lawsuit against the Health Council of Madrid for comments about her own competence made by Javier Rodriguez, its senior official.

When it had been put to him that she had not had enough training in how to put on the special protective overalls, he had replied: "You don't need a master's degree to learn how to put the suit on."

In a third legal claim, Miss Romero, 44, is seeking another €150,000 (£130,000) for the loss of her pet dog, Excalibur, which was put down as a precautionary measure by the Spanish authorities.

She is also a joint litigant in a complaint filed by nurses at Carlos III Hospital demanding an undisclosed amount "for weaknesses in the implementation of security protocols in infections by Ebola," according to a note sent by the law firm to El Pais newspaper.

The legal squabbling in Spain came as François Hollande yesterday became the first Western leader to set foot in one of the countries hard–hit by Ebola. The French president visited the former French colony of Guinea, which has suffered 1,260 of the 5,600 deaths the virus has claimed so far.

It was announced yesterday that an Ebola treatment centre in the capital, Conakry, is to trial a 15–minute blood and saliva test for the virus, which currently takes five or six hours to diagnose.

Aid agencies believe that while the virus outbreak is now stabilising in Liberia, it may be at least another two months before it is brought under control across the wider region.

Marine Le Pen has the stuff of Thatcher, says her father

MARINE LE PEN has the "stuff of Margaret Thatcher", the Front National leader's father, Jean–Marie, claimed yesterday as her rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, was due to be elected head of the opposition UMP in a party vote.

Mr Le Pen, 86, who founded the far–Right FN in 1972, made the comparison with the Iron Lady a day before he was due to appear by her side at the party's biggest congress before the 2017 presidential elections she claims she can win.

Polls suggest Miss Le Pen could knock the Socialist president Francois Hollande out in round one but lose in a face–off with a centre–Right candidate. Asked whether he could see his daughter as the next French president, Mr Le Pen, said: "Of course, she has the stuff of [Angela] Merkel and [Margaret] Thatcher."

Mr Le Pen, whose racist outbursts – including one recently about Ebola solving France's immigration problems – have become an embarrassment to his daughter, insisted that he was likely to run for president of the south–eastern Provence–Alpes–Cote d'Azur region late next year despite his advancing age.

"It's very highly likely," he told Le Parisien, adding: "I do 50 press ups every morning and have a glass of wine at lunchtime." Mr Le Pen is at loggerheads with his daughter over the idea of changing the name of the FN to give it wider appeal.

Mr Le Pen said: "It is a brand that still allows us to win, that is lasting." In a separate interview, Miss Le Pen said that this weekend's congress would prepare for "the great democratic shake–up" in France, claiming she was the country's "last chance".

If elected in 2017, she pledged to hold a referendum on whether to pull France out of the EU six months after the vote.

She said she would step down if the answer was No, "like General de Gaulle".

Miss Le Pen was one of only five French nationals, alongside the economist Thomas Piketty, who made Foreign Policy magazine's 100 leading global thinkers — placed in the "challengers" category for "giving France its far–Right moment".

The FN has the wind in its sails, with its popularity driven by the record unpopularity of Mr Hollande and a centre–Right that is riven by deep divisions and corruption scandals.

The opposition centre–Right UMP hopes to put its leadership quarrels behind it today when its 268,000 party members elect a new head, with Mr Sarkozy, 59, almost guaranteed to win.

He faces stiffer than expected competition from Bruno Le Maire, a former Europe minister in his forties, who could take a quarter of the vote. Anything below around 70 per cent for Mr Sarkozy would be considered a disappointment and suggest he is losing his lustre, commentators suggest.

Mr Sarkozy hopes today's election will seal his triumphant return to front–line politics and be a springboard for him to run for re–election in 2017.

Marine Le Pen has "stuff of Mme Thatcher" claims father Jean-Marie ahead of key party congress she claims will prepare her election as president in 2017

Marine Le Pen has the "stuff of Margaret Thatcher", according to her father Jean-Marie.

Mr Le Pen, 86, who founded the FN in 1972, made the claim a day before he is due to appear by her side at the party's biggest congress before 2017 presidential elections she claims she can win.

Asked whether he could see his daughter as the next French[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/] president, Mr Le Pen, said: "Of course, she has the stuff of Merkel and Thatcher."

Mr Le Pen, whose racist outbursts – one recently about Ebola solving France's immigration problems – have become an embarrassment to his daughter, insisted that he would likely run for president of the southeastern Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region next year, despite his advancing age.

"It's very highly likely," he told Le Parisien, adding: "I do 50 press ups every morning and have a glass of wine at lunchtime."

Mr Le Pen is at loggerheads with his daughter over the idea of changing the name of the FN to give it wider appeal. Party members are due to fill in a questionnaire on the issue. Mr Le Pen said: "It is a brand that still allows us to win, that is lasting."

In a separate interview, Miss Le Pen said that she this weekend's congress was to prepare "the great democratic shake-up" in France, claiming she was the country's "last chance".

If elected in 2017, she pledged to hold a referendum on whether to pull France out of the EU six months after the vote, and to step down if the answer was No.

Miss Le Pen was one of only five French nationals who made Foreign Policy magazine's 100 leading global thinkers, in the "challengers" category, along with the likes of economist Thomas Piketty. The magazine said Miss Le Pen was added to its list for "giving France its far-Right moment".

Only eleven Ebola patients in British hospital in Sierra Leone

Britain’s flagship facility in Sierra Leone has treated just 28 patients so far, despite £230million investment to fight disease

The British government’s flagship hospital in Sierra Leone is caring for only eleven Ebola victims, it has emerged.

The Department for International Development has put £230million towards helping Sierra Leone fight Ebola, but only 28 people have been treated in the new facility since it opened several weeks ago.

Another hospital a few miles away is having to turn Ebola victims away from its doors, meaning that they return to their homes and risk further infection in the community.

The British response to the Ebola crisis is facing serious criticism locally for its management, and has been called a “complete mess”, by aid workers in Sierra Leone.

Questions have been raised about DFID's decision to hand the management of the new facility in Kerry Town, near the capital of Freetown, to the charity Save the Children.

Save the Children is currently facing a backlash from its own staff after it presented Tony Blair with a “global legacy award” in New York last week – despite privately acknowledging that he is a controversial and divisive figure.

Sir Edward Garnier, the Conservative MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston, said he was concerned about how few Ebola victims were being seen by the medics at Kerry Town.

"What strikes me is that this is not a good use of public money and it is not achieving its aims," he said. "The Connaught hospital in Freetown is overflowing and turning people away, back into the community, although they are infected with Ebola. This hospital has 92 beds, and they are almost all empty. It seems to be going very slowly."

DFID and Save The Children insisted that the plan had always been to scale up the new facility over time, despite the urgent demands by the World Health Organisation that there was an immediate response to the Ebola crisis.

The number of infections in Sierra Leone has continued to rise, while other countries are starting to gain control of the epidemic. Official figures from the World Health showed there have been 6,190 cases in Sierra Leone, including 136 healthcare workers, and 1,267 deaths.

The Kerry Town complex includes an 80 bed treatment centre and a 12 bed centre staffed by British Army medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the Ebola crisis. However, dozens of beds are lying empty.

The construction of the treatment facility was overseen by British Army Royal Engineers.

The site also hosts an Ebola testing laboratory run by British scientists to accurately diagnose patients.

The £230 million Ebola response package from Britain includes funding for supplies such as chlorine and protective clothing, burial teams to increase capacity and work with communities on new burial practices. The roll out of community care centres is also planned.

"Britain is today providing 211 Ebola beds in facilities that the UK has built, expanded or kept open - including 23 beds rolled out so far at Kerry Town - and 232 beds and places in community care centres where Ebola sufferers are going for initial care and diagnosis,” said a DFID spokesman.

"Save The Children, a major global NGO which includes the international health charity Merlin, was available and keen to take on the management of Kerry Town at a time when other NGOs were stretched and unable to do so."

A spokesman for Save The Children said: "The team has worked night and day to build a treatment centre from scratch within two months. We have always made clear we would work flat out to incrementally increase capacity. The total capacity of the facility will be phased in, as is accepted best practice, over the coming weeks, giving staff time to ensure a safe environment for patients and staff and reduce the risk of infection. In answer to questions about patients, I can confirm that as of this morning, 28 people have been treated for Ebola at the [centre]. This is a cumulative figure of those treated since opening."

Save the Children is managed by a board of trustees who include Mark Esiri, a long-term family friend of the Prime Minister, and Sir Alan Parker, the chairman of Brunswick. The Prime Minister was guest of honour at Sir Alan’s 50th birthday and the two men’s families have been on holiday together.

Sir Alan accompanied Mr Cameron on a trade mission to China in December last year and he was knighted a few weeks later.

Two children are being tested for the ebola virus in the North East, according to reports.

They are said to have recently arrived in the UK from Africa but there is believed to be uncertainty about which country they had been in and how recently.

It is thought the children have been taken for examinations at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary but it us unclear where they are originally from.

Public Health England have said it is ‘unlikely’ the children have ebola and they were also being tested for malaria.

The children’s results will not be known until Friday afternoon due to the tests taking 24 hours.

No imported case of Ebola haemorrhagic disease has ever occurred in the UK.

The recent outbreak in West Africa is thought to have claimed the lives of more than 5,600 people.

There are many dreadful things about the Ebola outbreak, but the worst is the world's indifference to it

A few months ago I read a blog of an MSF volunteer who found himself shouting[http://www.msf.org.uk/event/where-everyone-msf-report-launch]over the beautiful jungled canopy of Sierra Leone “Where is everybody”?

Today, four months after the World Health Organisation[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/] declared an international emergency, I did the same thing.

I had gritted teeth and clenched fists and it came out as more of a squeak than a war cry but still, my fury and incomprehension echoed his.

I always knew I would find it frustrating being unable to provide care as sophisticated as I would like for patients suffering, but this isn’t only about the unavailability of intensive care units and swishy machines that beep.

This isn’t only about watching young people die in a terrible way and being able to offer nothing but time-honoured words of comfort in badly accented Krio.

This is about people dying in triage tents with no access to any kind of medical therapy as there are no beds available.

This is about having to put desperately sick people in ambulances for five hours as that is how long it takes to get to the nearest treatment centre with space.

This is about laboratory turn-around times that mean that people negative for the disease sit in beds next to patients with profuse vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding for up to eight days, waiting for their test results.

This is about how the world knew that a nightmarish plague had hit west Africa and the world waited over six months and then sang a song about it.

Of course, I know that many agencies are contributing and working as fast as they can, and that there are some on the ground who have been advocating and campaigning for action for months.

I only arrived a fortnight ago so I can’t imagine how much more furious and frustrated they must be. Perhaps during my time here progress will be made and there will be improvement.

There are many dreadful things about the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] epidemic - the suffering, the squalor, and the undercurrent of fear that you could be next. For me at this point, by far the most terrifying is that nothing will change and the status quo of international turpitude will continue.

THOUSANDS of health care workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia could be given an experimental Ebola vaccine early next year after Glaxo–SmithKline said trials of the drug were encouraging.

The British pharmaceutical giant, which is co–developing the vaccine with the US National Institutes of Health, said each of the 20 healthy adult volunteers involved in its trial showed an "immunological response" and that the drug was "well tolerated".

Dr Moncef Slaoui, chairman of Global Vaccines at GSK, said: "We are very encouraged by these positive first trial results, showing this type of vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and can produce an immune response against Ebola in humans."

GSK added that development of the vaccine was progressing "at an unprecedented rate".

If phase–one trials in the UK, Switzerland and Mali produce similar results, GSK will vaccinate front–line health care workers against Ebola in affected countries.

David Cameron reportedly recommends former Health Secretary for key UN role

David Cameron is believed to be putting Andrew Lansley, the former Health Secretary, forward as Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs at the United Nations.

Mr Lansley, who was returned to the backbenches in the July reshuffle, would be in charge of the UN’s response to major crises in Syria, Iraq and South Sudan.

The Conservative MP’s time in charge of NHS reforms was not regarded as a success, and he was dropped from the Cabinet after a period as Leader of the House of Commons.

Lord Malloch Brown, the former UN Deputy Secretary General, questioned Mr Lansley’s skills and experience for the demanding role.

“I think this is frankly a case of political dumping,” Lord Malloch Brown told Channel 4 News [http://blogs.channel4.com/lindsey-hilsum-on-international-affairs/role-camerons-mate-lansley-appalling/4727] . “This is one of the most difficult, important jobs in the world. There are millions of people in desperate situations from Ebola victims to victims of war in Syriawho are highly dependent on the humanitarian activities of the UN.

“It’s an act of great cynicism to allow someone who does not have background and qualification in this area to be put forward.”

Mr Lansley would replace Baroness Valerie Amos. The Labour MP Grahame Morris has written to the Prime Minister about the appointment.

"Are you not concerned that the appointment of Mr Lansley would send the message that Britain sees the UN as a convenient dumping ground for failed Tory politicians?” wrote Mr Morris.

A spokesman for Mr Lansley said: “There will be a UN recruitment process and he would not wish to pre-empt that or take it for granted. The appointment is a matter for the Secretary-General.”

Mr Lansley was previously tipped as a future EU Commissioner, but lost out on that role this summer.

GlaxoSmithKline could start vaccinating thousands of frontline healthcare workers early next year following positive trials

Thousands of health care workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia could be given an experimental Ebola vaccine early next year after GlaxoSmithKline said trials of drug were "encouraging".

If phase-one trials in the UK, Switzerland and Mali produce similar results, GSK will vaccinate frontline health care workers against Ebola in affected countries.

The global death toll from Ebola has risen to 5,689 out of 15,935 cases reported in eight countries by November 23, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.

Almost all cases and all but 15 deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - the three hardest-hit countries, which reported 600 new cases in the past week, the WHO said in its latest update.

"The total number of cases reported in Sierra Leone since the outbreak began will soon eclipse the number reported from Liberia," it said. The former British colony has reported 6,599 cases against 7,168 in Liberia.

Bob Geldof was "not happy" with some of the artists who took part in the Band Aid 30 charity single, it has been claimed, as he urged fans to delete the single and buy it again.

Geldof, who helped compile the fourth release of Do They Know It's Christmas to raise money to fight the spread of Ebola, said he was concerned about the amount of money being raised. Speaking on Radio 1's Newsbeat, he said the 99p paid per download left organisers needing to sell "300 per cent" more than the original 1984 release to make the same amount of money. He has now urged fans who have downloaded the track to delete it, before downloading again to raise more money.

Those familiar with iTunes have already cast doubt on the plan, pointing out it would initially remain on the iCloud.

In the same BBC interview, One Direction singer Liam Payne disclosed that Geldof had praised them for not being "divas".

Payne added of other celebrities: "I'm not going to repeat the word he used to describe them but he wasn't happy with some people."

With its imitiation Fifties sitting room and a lifesize mock-up of a shopping street from yesteryear, Abbeyfield House is an ingenious care home that keeps its residents mentally engaged

Donate to The Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal [https://telegraph.charitiestrust.org/telegraphappeal.aspx]

“Have you noticed there are no mirrors?” asks Alastair Mulvie, at the end of an afternoon spent among dementia sufferers and their carers. As a so-called trained observer, I’m ashamed to admit that the absence of mirrors had not struck me. I’d been, too, busy poking around the imitation Fifties’-style sitting room, fitted out with wing chairs, a wireless, an early television and a bakelite telephone, where residents could slip comfortably back to that part of their lives they best remembered. How inspired. Even the botanical wallpaper was right.

I’d admired the mock K2 red telephone box in the hall, the post office counter and the bow-fronted “shop” stocked with products familiar to the elderly in their active days – Spel washing powder, Borwick Baking Powder, Cremo Oats. Abbeyfield [http://www.abbeyfield.com/] is a house of reminiscences and diversions. There’s too much going on to notice anything missing.

Music is soothingly audible all over the house, illustrated books left open on tables. A radio is babbling softly on the landings and a caged bird trilling somewhere upstairs gives the place an unexpected feeling of lightness. Two or three people are nodding over the pages of their “lifestory” books, a compilation of photos and words to remind them – and their carers – who and what they were. The pictures provoke a stream of reminiscences and a ready topic of conversation. This much is easy to appreciate.

But mirrors, or lack of them? Slowly it begins to dawn on me. How terrifying to wake up finding you have aged 50 years, not to recognise the hands on the bedclothes as your hands. Passing a mirror in the corridor and seeing a stranger reflected there is unnecessarily upsetting. Mulvie explains: “In their minds, some people have reverted to being 20 or 25. It can be alarming not to recognise their present selves. We try to take away that anxiety.”

In an enlightened place like Abbeyfield House, at New Malden in Surrey, the feared stereotype of the dull, tidy, institutional care home where lines of frail, subdued people are ranged blankly in front of a television has nowhere to take root. Stimulation is the watchword, together with thoughtfulness for individual needs and individual pasts. It’s significant that among the 36 elderly residents, all of whom are in a moderate or advanced stage of dementia and need specialist care, only three are currently on antipsychotic medication – and then at the lowest possible dose.

“Many homes have residents who are drug dependent, and that may be because they lack stimulation,” says Mulvie, head of fundraising for the Abbeyfield Society. “We find that giving people interests and helping them to engage with their surroundings helps to keep them off drugs by minimising the anxiety that so often goes with dementia. As time rolls back for them and recent memories tend to disappear, we try to help them recapture a level of remembrance.”

We are in a bright ground-floor sitting room, five of us, and Mulvie is talking quietly out of deference to the people who live here. “We are in their home. We are not necessarily invited.” One of care home’s slogans is: “You’re not our guest, we’re yours.”

Abbeyfield is a Hertfordshire-based charity with 500 homes across the country. Eighty-two per cent are dedicated to Supported Living (the elderly live independently but with a house manager), two per cent provide Independent Living with Care (such as help with dressing) and the remaining 16 per cent are Care Homes like the New Malden house, with expertise in dementia, a terminal illness often misunderstood as a natural part of the ageing process.

Michael Perrett’s 81-year-old wife, Sheila, has been at Abbeyfield House for more than two years. He spends three or four hours with her every day, helping her with meals because she won’t eat without him. Some months ago when he developed a chest complaint and could not travel, staff brought Sheila to visit him at home in Kingston where they have lived all their married life. On their 60th wedding anniversary, they invited the couple’s neighbours and relatives to a surprise party. “They know me. They welcome me. They check up on me. From the cleaning lady to the house manager, everyone is fantastic. I feel they look after me as well as my wife.”

He recalls the day it all started. They were out shopping in Bentalls and Sheila told him to wait in the courtyard while she chose him a birthday present. “I waited and waited. Three-quarters of an hour went by. I went through all the departments looking for her. Then I rang home. Sheila was there. She had travelled by bus. She had no explanation for it.”

Through accelerating dementia, he nursed her for three years, changing bedclothes in the middle of the night, constantly on alert, frightened for her safety. They were both prisoners of her condition. “I had to lock all the doors and take away the keys. Eventually I collapsed from the strain and ended up in hospital. I was just worn out.”

Abbeyfield has given him peace of mind and liberated him from the isolation of dementia caring. “When I come in, Sheila has a lovely expression, holds her arms out and says: ‘I do love you.’ She still recognises me, but not her twin sister, Mary. She doesn’t remember our life together and that’s one of the most difficult things. I used to read to her but now she shuts herself off.”

Mr Perrett, 82, takes me proudly through his wife’s lifestory book – her growing up, their wedding, their many walking expeditions, her retirement presentation. She is diminished now, her head drooped forward like a flower too heavy for its stalk. He cannot believe this is the woman who walked over half of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset with him. Yet leafing through the book is not unremittingly sad because he sees it as one of the simple, intelligent things Abbeyfield has devised to create interest and identity for even its frailest residents – and it works.

“We were always best pals,” he says. “She is more at ease here, we both are, than struggling at home. After lunch, she likes to cuddle up with me on the settee. She knows me as a nice boy, and a nice man. Even though she can’t respond when I talk to her, coming in here is something I look forward to every day.”

One of the most poignant rooms in the home is a small crepuscular nursery with soft toys, dolls, an old-fashioned cot and a bentwood rocking chair. Here, women who believe they still have a child, or who miss a child, can act out consoling maternal routines, nursing themselves back to security without the need for anti-psychotic medication.

John Rivers’ wife Margaret used to take care of the household accounts, did the cooking, shopping and washing and generally spoiled him, he admits. One day, she burst into tears over columns of figures and blurted out: “I can’t do this any more. I can’t think like I used to.” Soon, she could not remember her pin number. “It just gradually got worse and worse,” he recalls. “I had to dress and feed her. One night I found her sleeping fully dressed on the kitchen floor and couldn’t lift her up. After three months, I went to pieces, I really did.”

Margaret, 79, was a watercolourist and skilled teacher and writer on embroidery. John, 86, is a graphic designer. He rejected five “awful” care homes before finding the right level of specialist care and dedication at Abbeyfield. “It has given me a life back and Margaret is as contented as she can be. She can’t talk now, but I know she enjoys my company and that she is in a wonderful place.”

This month, Abbeyfield was in a shortlist of five for a “best dementia care home in Britain” award. As a leader in the field, it funds academic research and campaigns to improve the lives of older people. Currently, it is working on a prototype for a benign form of tagging that will prevent confused old people from entering the wrong bedroom and helping themselves to other residents’ possessions – a familiar source of distress in care homes.

It already has an electronic system to warn care staff when a resident who is at risk of falling attempts to walk unsupervised. Falls are one of the commonest causes of premature death.

The house manager, Danny Torsoo, knows all the residents’ likes and dislikes, their fears and foibles as well as their personal and medical needs. Using first names and often walking arm in arm, he converses gently with them, unhurried and attentive. Their physical and mental health is constantly assessed, their families kept in the loop. A person with dementia can forget how to eat and may not even recognise food because the part of the brain governing sense and smell may be damaged. “The skill is in knowing the residents, what they need and how to provide meet those needs” he says. “Once they have been offered a place here, we look after them until they pass on.”

At the heart of the Abbeyfield Society is an army of more than 4,000 volunteers, who are as dedicated as the staff to providing warmth, friendship and dignity through the trials of old age.

To many relatives, Abbeyfield House has become family, creating ties that are stronger than those with the community outside. It is an extraordinary testament that the person left behind after the death of a partner may well decide to live at the home even though they are not suffering from dementia.

Abbeyfield relies on the generosity of donors and fundraisers to secure its future. Most of its costs go to providing salaries for specialist staff, but constant dementia-friendly improvements to buildings and environment are needed. Abbeyfield House, New Malden, has plans for an indoor garden, an all-year-round gazebo surrounded by a sensory garden and to replace each anonymous bedroom door with a door that looks like the front door to a house.

NHS workers in Sierra Leone told they will not be guaranteed repatriation if they fall sick - despite lack of life-saving equipment in Freetown

British medics who have volunteered to fight the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone have accused the Government of failing to offer them proper emergency back-up if they get infected.

The government is planning to despatch up to 1,500 NHS volunteers to the west African nation over coming months, as part of a £125m aid programme[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11212080/British-Ebola-clinic-opens-for-patients-in-Sierra-Leone.html] that a force of 800 British troops began rolling out last month.

But officials have refused to guarantee that any medic who catches the virus will be flown back to Britain for treatment, insisting that most cases can be dealt by a British army clinic that has been set up in the capital, Freetown.

The ruling has caused disquiet among some medics, who point out that the British army facility is not equipped with either kidney dialysis machines or artificial lungs, both of which could be necessary for treatment of anyone with advanced Ebola symptoms.

They say the government should instead offer automatic repatriation for any medical worker as soon as they test positive for Ebola. At present, the Government says it will repatriate only on a "case by case" basis, which the medics suspect is a get-out clause to avoid public panic about Ebola coming to the UK.

"If a British national looks like they have symptoms of Ebola, they should on a plane within 12 hours in my opinion," said one senior medic. "Instead, the government wants to wait until somebody is sick enough that they might need dialysis, at which point you might not be fit for transport by plane anyway."

The medic issued the warning as the first tranche of 30 NHS volunteers arrived in Sierra Leone for a five-week stint working at Ebola treatment centres. Should any of them fall sick, they will be looked after in a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army medical experts specially set aside for health care workers.

Treatment for Ebola victims in the early stages is a relatively simple matter of ensuring that patients are properly fed and hydrated, and does not require sophiscated medical equipment. For that reason, the government says there is no need to offer automatic evacuation.

However, Ebola sufferers whose condition continues to worsen can require dialysis or ventilators. Some medics that believe that for that reason, it would be better simply to evacuate people immediately. The specialist evacuation planes that are used to transport Ebola sufferers also have limited ability to do so if the patient is suffering particularly acute symptoms.

"The plans are rather vague, and I think volunteers are owed some clarity," said the medic. "If they have tested positive for Ebola, they and their families have enough to worry about, without the additional factor of whether they are coming back to Britain or not."

Similar concerns are understood to have been shared by number of British consultants, and the matter is believed to have been raised with Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England.

In August, a British nurse, William Pooley[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11086333/British-Ebola-survivor-to-return-to-Sierra-Leone.html], was repatriated by RAF jet from Sierra Leone after contracting Ebola, and made a full recovery. However, some doctors fear that were there to be some unexpected Ebola outbreak in Britain, as has already happened in Spain and the US, public opposition to repatriating aid workers might grow, especially if it involved large numbers of volunteers.

There is also a concern that other British expatriates living in Sierra Leone might demand the same treatment.

"I think the government needs to see the way the public wind is blowing at the time," said the medic. "My feeling is that the politicians don't want to bring people back for treatment, but they don't want to actually say that."

A Department of Health spokesman said: “We are clear that whatever care is best clinically for a patient will be provided. If we need to medevac people, we can do that, but decisions must always be taken on a case by case basis. The clinical advice is that high quality supportive care, like keeping someone hydrated, is the best approach to treating Ebola."

Britain's security sector is booming, with sales up 20pc in a year and set to continue growing, according to new analysis by trade body ADS

Growing threats from terrorism[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11249614/Theresa-May-Britain-is-facing-greatest-terror-threat-of-its-history.html], computer hackers, diseases such as ebola[http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ffinance%2Fnewsbysector%2Findustry%2Fdefence%2F11247209%2FAvon-military-mask-technology-could-help-fight-ebola.html&ei=2550VKvQMdPSaOewgvgJ&usg=AFQjCNHCWC2_hHud30m5vYn81Fs5U2Hxew&bvm=bv.80185997,d.d2s] and tighter border controls have helped Britain’s security industry grow at a rate far outstripping the wider economy over the past five years.

A new study of the sector by trade group ADS found that between 2010 and 2013 the industry grew by 46pc to be worth more than £7.9bn in sales to the economy a year. Over the same period, Britain’s GDP rose 10pc.

The sector’s rate growth is accelerating, increasing by 20pc over the past year, and demand for British expertise is also strong from overseas, with 40pc of the industry’s turnover coming from export sales.

“The UK security industry touches almost every aspect of our day-to-day lives, from cyber systems protecting our online banking details; to counter terrorism; through the successful 2012 Olympic Games, and much more besides,” said Paul Everitt, ADS chief executive.

“This sector has carved a global reputation and the pace of growth revealed demonstrates it is already taking advantage of new demand.”

Showpiece events such as the Olympics are particularly important to demonstrate the sector’s abilities to an international audience. The security operation for the Games showcased the latest technologies such as bag scanners, biometric ID cards and facial recognition to ensure its safe and smooth running.

As the sector does not include manned guarding, the high-profile failure of outsourcer G4S to provide sufficient guards for the Games was overlooked by potential customers focused on the systems used to help protect the event.

According to ADS’s forecasts, the sector can expect the growth to continue, with the group predicting the global industry will double by 2017.

The industry is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, making up 90pc of the 11,500 businesses in a sector that directly employs 75,000 people.

The technology that goes into creating their products also means a heavy proportion of the the jobs they create are high value roles. Almost a fifth of people working in the sector work in research, design and engineering, helping push average salaries in security to £36,900, almost 40pc above the UK average.

Ebola diary: Eight days in an Ebola ward before test proves negative

After the long wait for an Ebola test, a patient is told he can go home

A wonderful thing happened today. I was able to give a patient in our unit the news that he tested negative for Ebola and was free to go home. He leapt out of bed and danced for joy, praised the Lord and us - and even, mortifyingly, bowed to our PPE clad feet. Throughout the unit, we could hear him singing and I know I’m not the only one who got a bit weepy.

And yet, there was a spectre at the feast. The way the system works is that when you attend a health care unit, you are immediately screened for symptoms of Ebola - fever plus abdominal pain, vomiting, headache and so on. The symptoms are pretty non-specific and can include anything from malaria to flu. If there is any suspicion of Ebola, you are admitted to an Isolation Unit such as ours - beds permitting - to be tested for the virus. And there you are kept until the results are available.

This is intended to be within 24 hours, but in reality can be up to eight days. Patients positive for Ebola are then transferred to Treatment Centres such as those run by Medecins Sans Frontieres, and negative patients are either discharged home or to the hospital depending on how sick they are.

The implications of delayed laboratory results are that those who turn out to be negative - such as our elated singing man - may be in beds next to positive patients, with profuse diarrhoea, vomiting and even bleeding. The potential risk of infection, despite all our best efforts at preventing cross contamination, is considerable. Patients are separated from each other by a wall of plastic sheeting; we use chlorine to decontaminate our gloved hands in between tending each patients; they are told to not leave their bed. But we just don’t know yet how many people will actually be infected with Ebola by being admitted to an Isolation Unit. I'm dreading the prospect of him returning and all the joy will vanish.

Emotions run high here which is unsurprising. Joy and despair walk hand in hand - as do the comical and the sinister. Hiccoughs for example. I am someone who hiccoughs a lot and have always found it an excuse to giggle. However, hiccoughs are a characteristic feature of Ebola - appearing quite late in the disease. Suddenly, that burpy squeak is a lot less funny.

Similarly, in wonderfully Sierra Leonean style, our drive to work yesterday was halted by an impromptu road block. Five achingly cool teenagers were filming a hip hop video on a main bridge into town. Today, we stopped in almost the same place, held up by a crowd of people who also initially seemed to be singing. It took a minute to recognize that this was the keening sound of grief - and to spot the menacing, Darth Vader figures of the PPE-clad burial team removing a corpse from a house.

Freetown feels like a city on a knife’s edge. Hilarity and nervous energy overlying an undercurrent of constant anxiety and an insidious, invisible killer. And yet life goes on. Hope the video makes it to YouTube.

Felicity Fitzgerald qualified as a doctor in 2006. She is paediatrician studying for a PhD in infectious diseases at the UCL Institute of Child Health. A month ago she volunteered to work in Freetown with the Kings Sierra Leone Partnership and is working at the Connaught Hospital Ebola Isolation Unit. This is her diary.

Celebrity critics should 'shut the f--- up' about Band Aid 30, singer Sinéad O’Connor says, as she hits back at unfair 'assumptions' about the singers involved

Artists should never have agreed to sing on the Band Aid 30[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/11233134/Band-Aid-30-in-pictures.html] single only to criticise it publicly later on, Sinéad O’Connor has said, as she hits back at its celebrity detractors.

O’Connor, the singer who appeared in the latest version of Do They Know It’s Christmas?, said disapproving critics should “shut the f--- up” about the song, which is raising money to treat ebola.

She has now issued a firm retort to celebrities who have condemned the lyrics and intentions behind the song, coordinated by Sir Bob Geldof, as she defends the artists who joined the cause.

Saying those who took part should never have done so if they did not like the concept, she added: "The assumption that anyone performing on the record has not privately given money is exactly that, an assumption."

Her words follow very public criticism from artists including Lily Allen[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11250602/Band-Aid-30-the-celebrities-who-are-turning-against-it.html], who has disclosed she declined to appear on the song because there was “something a bit smug about it”.

Emeli Sande, who did sing on the record, has now claimed she tried to write her own lyrics to the new version of the song[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11248749/Band-Aid-30-set-to-top-charts-as-Emili-Sande-criticises-lyrics.html], first recorded in 1984, and apologised if the song “caused offence”. She said: "I agree the lyric needs changing. In fact I feel a whole new song is required. Angelique Kidjo and I made and sang our own edits. Unfortunately, none of these made the final cut."

Damon Albarn, the Blur singer, has previously questioned whether the single was a suitable way of tackling the ebola crisis, adding there are “problems with our idea of charity” when celebrity campaigns “balloon out of nothing”.

When asked about the criticism, O’Connor told the Telegraph: “I think everyone should shut the f--- up.

“If you didn't like the lyrics you shouldn't have agreed to sing the song.

“I think it's smug of Lily Allen to say it's smug.

“The assumption that anyone performing on the record has not privately given money is exactly that, an assumption.

“And who gives a f--- what Damon f------ Albarn thinks?”

She added frankly: "Excuse my honesty, I'm too old for bull----."

The charity single, which features One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Bono, Chris Martin and Rita Ora, has already reached number one in the charts[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11248941/Band-Aid-single-storms-to-number-one.html], despite backlash about its lyrics.

It has become the fastest-selling single of 2014, after fans bought more than 312,000 copies in its first week after a high-profile publicity campaign.

Sir Bob has already urged fans to buy multiple copies of the single[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11249587/Bob-Geldof-Buy-Band-Aid-30-single...then-delete-it.html], after fearing the cheaper price of downloads - as opposed to physical singles - would affect the amount of money raised to combat ebola.

“In 1984 a single was £3.50, today it's 99p...That worries me," he said. "Even if you already have it, delete, download again.

"We need to sell 300 per cent more than we did then [in 1984] to even begin to make up the cash figure.”

Ninety–nine people have been tested for Ebola in hospitals across England this year.

The number was revealed in a Freedom of Information response by Public Health England (PHE).

PHE said the ages of patients tested for the deadly virus between Jan 21 and Nov 9 ranged from "under five" to 75 years old. Most of those tested had visited west Africa.

PHE refused to provide a breakdown of the number of men and women tested and the locations of hospitals where tests were carried out or the African countries visited by the patients.

As Band Aid 30's single soars to the top of the UK singles charts, we look at some celebrities turning against the track

Band Aid 30’s single Do They Know It’s Christmas? has soared straight to the top of the UK singles chart. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11248941/Band-Aid-single-storms-to-number-one.html]

The controversial recording, masterminded by Bob Geldof [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/11233149/Sir-Bob-Geldof-greets-artists-at-Band-Aid-30-recording.html], has sold more than 312,000 copies and is this year’s fastest-selling single, according to the Official Charts Company.

With all proceeds going towards the fight against Ebola in West Africa, the track outsold the other top five singles combined. It scored the biggest one-week sales since The X Factor’s James Arthur sold 489,000 copies of his winner’s single Impossible in 2012.

Its success comes amid a row over the lyrics, and complaints that the initiative “patronises” Africa.

The most recent concern has been voiced by pop singer Emeli Sandé, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/11235286/Band-Aid-30-Who-sang-which-line-in-pictures.html?frame=3107847]who was involved in the remake. She said that the song needed rewriting and apologised if the latest version “caused offence”.

The star posted a message on Twitter in which she said that the lyrics she and African artist Angelique Kidjo had recorded did not make the final version.

Sandé tweeted: “I’ve been having so many discussions about this all week. Here are my thoughts on the Band Aid single…”

Her message continued: “Yes, I agree the lyric needs changing. In fact I feel a whole new song is required. Angelique Kidjo and I made and sang our own edits. Unfortunately, none of these made the final cut.”

She added: “I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control.

“The sole objective is to raise awareness and money to provide medical aid to those suffering the Ebola outbreak, which is being worsened and amplified by poverty.”

Sandé is the first artist on the single to express her concerns. But MPs, charities and other celebrities have also taken issue with it. Here are a few of them:

Lily Allen

Lily Allen has said that she refused to take part in the song as she felt there was “something smug about it.”

She added: “It’s difficult to explain why I didn’t do it without sounding like a complete ****. I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.

Sir Malcolm Bruce

Scottish Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Malcolm Bruce told BBC radio 4: “Africa isn’t a country; it’s a continent with many different countries with many different challenges.

“There’s a danger that this kind of appeal is slightly patronising and gives the impression that Africa doesn’t have the capacity to do things for itself.”

Adele

Adele also chose not to be involved in the creation of the song. Instead she is said to have given a donation to Oxfam.

Speaking about Adele’s noticeable absence, Geldof said: “She’s not answering the phone… she’s not writing. She’s not recording. She doesn’t want to be bothered by anyone. She won’t pick up the phone to her manager. She’s bringing up a family, you know.”

Fuse ODG

British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG wrote [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/19/turn-down-band-aid-bob-geldof-africa-fuse-odg] : “Saying no to Bob Geldof is one of the hardest decisions I have had to make this year.”

He said that he was “shocked and appalled” by the content of the lyrics and was, “sick of the whole concept of Africa… always being seen as diseased, infested and poverty-stricken.”

Dawit Gebreselassie

In an interview with Al Jazeera, a financial analyst from Ethiopia, Dawit Gebreselassie 26, joked: “I would ask, does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia?

“Perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on January 7 could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is.

“Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.”

As Chuck Hagel announces his resignation as US secretary of defence, we examine what the change of leadership at the Pentagon will mean for the US

When Barack Obama picked Chuck Hagel[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/us-politics-video/11250666/Barack-Obama-praises-Chuck-Hagel-as-he-announces-US-defence-secretarys-resignation.html], a 68-year-old former Republican senator, to be his Secretary of Defence in 2013 he was supposed to be a safe pair of hands.

Officials hinted the White House[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/]wanted a low-key appointment after two years of Leon Panetta, the gregarious, bureaucratic street-fighter who wrote a book criticising Mr Obama[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/] .

A decorated war veteran with two Purple Hearts from Vietnam, Hagel was the first enlisted man ever to hold the position of Secretary of Defence.

Mr Obama hoped Mr Hagel’s status as a combat veteran would make budget cuts more palatable as the troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan.

But it went wrong from the very start, as Mr Hagel flubbed his Senate confirmation hearing.

He was accused of being hostile to the Israel[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/] lobby, having questionable view on gays in the military and even being soft on Iran.

But it was ultimately his softly-softly style that drew mounting criticism. It was leaked that he did not say much in cabinet meetings.

Supporters said Hagel wanted to “avoid leaks” and spoke his mind privately to the President.

But at Congressional hearings he looked lost. And was overshadowed by Gen Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who seemed to boss the show.

It seemed that he was happier away from the corridors of power, on the parade ground, addressing the ordinary troops.

He might have survived a four-year term, but then along came Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] and the rise of the Islamic State[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11050170/Chuck-Hagel-US-did-all-it-could-to-save-James-Foley.html], starting a new US war in the Middle East. Which hasn’t been going all that well …

And Chuck Hagel, a nice guy who never seemed to quite cut it in Washington, was suddenly the wrong face, in the wrong job, at the wrong time.

So Mr Obama let him go. Even though Pentagon officials said as recently as two weeks ago Mr Hagel expected to serve a full four years. No hard feelings, then.

Doctor who was working with patients near Freetown with Ebola patients is back in Italy for treatment

An Italian doctor who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone is being repatriated to Italy for treatment, health officials in Rome confirmed on Monday.

The doctor had been working since October 18 at a small clinic about 10 miles west of capital of Freetown with the humanitarian group Emergency before developing a fever, testing positive for the virus and being isolated, according to Italian reports.

Italian Health Ministry officials said the doctor was in a stable condition, did not have a fever during the night and was eating and drinking autonomously.

The Italian Air Force is transporting the doctor back to Italy on a special biocontainment flight Monday for treatment in the Lazzaro Spallanzani infectious diseases institute in Rome, the ministry said.

Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said all preventative measures were in place to guarantee maximum security for the doctor’s transport, treatment and recovery.

“The procedures for transfer of the Italian doctor who is positive for Ebola do not present any risk to the community,” Gianni Rezza, director of the Department of Infectious Disease at the Spallanzini clinic told the Corriere della Sera. “We have been ready for this possibility and are already equipped to manage the situation. It is our moral duty to provide therapy and support to co nationals struck by Ebola: better here than in Sierra Leone. We can resolve this safely.”

There are currently 26 Italian doctors fighting the Ebola epidemic with Emergency in Sierra Leone, where the epidemic is spreading at a rate of 100 new cases a day.

As part of a wider attempt to stem contagion to other areas of West Africa, Emergency on September 18 opened a small clinic in the coastal resort of Lakka, 10 miles west of the capital. It is there that the doctor became ill, according to Italian media reports. While the clinic is small, more than 100 doctors, nurses, logistics, cleaning and auxiliary staff from Italy, Serbia, Spain and Uganda work at the site. Emergency has been collaborating with the Department for International Development to open a 100-bed hospital near there in mid-December.

In a press release, Emergency said staff “follows specific protection protocols to avoid contagion and diffusion of the virus. But even so, no medical interventions in a grave epidemic like this can be completely risk-free.”

“We have activated a reentry procedure and we are hopeful,” Cecilia Strada, president of Emergency said in a report by the Turin daily La Stampa.

“All the personnel on site have been asked to communicate any possible symptoms so they can be isolated immediately.”

The group said due to privacy concerns neither the doctor, nor family members will be releasing statements.

Autumn Statement: why there won't be any giveaways

Chancellor George Osborne's options have become limited by weak wage growth and sluggish tax receipts

Higher borrowing and slower growth aren't what the Chancellor needs six months before the general election.

But George Osborne[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/] and his advisers at No 11 Downing Street will be sitting rather less comfortably ahead of December's Autumn Statement[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/] compared with six months ago, when all the talk was about giveaways and election sweeteners as Britain's economy boomed.

Politicians are already beginning to sound more gloomy. The Prime Minister declared this week that "red warning lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy". David Cameron outlined a catalogue of risks that could threaten Britain's recovery – Ebola, tensions with Russia and the eurozone slowdown were just a few.

To the cynics, it was the beginning of a long line of excuses. For others, the gloom has been overdone.

Growth may be slowing, but it remains robust compared with our neighbours. The UK is currently expanding at an annual rate of 3pc, and is on course to be the fastest growing economy in the G7 this year. Employment is booming, and the jobless rate continues to fall. Tumbling oil prices mean Britons are paying less for their fuel at the pumps, while a supermarket price war has also helped consumers at the checkouts.

But the feelgood factor remains elusive. Data this week showed the average pay packet for a full-time worker grew by just 0.1pc last year. The Treasury was keen to point out that for the 70pc of Britain's workforce who had been in a job for a year or more, the figure was 4.1pc. That's still a lot of workers feeling the pinch.

Weak wage growth has contributed to Mr Osborne's other dilemma. The Coalition must have been rubbing their hands when unemployment began falling like a stone last year. Almost three quarters of a million jobs have been created in the past 12 months. In normal times, you would expect that to be reflected in the Treasury's coffers.

However, borrowing is 6pc – or £3.7bn – higher so far this year than it was at the same point in 2013[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11245076/Chancellor-haunted-by-deficit-and-1.45-trillion-debt-pile.html] because of weaker tax receipts.

This means Mr Osborne faces a Herculean task to get this year's borrowing back on track. According to Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, "in order for borrowing to be 12pc lower this year as set out in the Budget, it would have to be a whopping £15bn or 40pc lower than last year in the last five months of the fiscal year."

A spokesman for the Treasury insisted that borrowing remained "in line with the Budget forecast". But the Government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, begs to differ. In a statement, it said a "number of factors" meant that the money the Treasury would rake in from taxes this year was "likely" to be lower than it forecast in March.

The OBR said three things were to blame. The first was weak wage growth and a surge in low-paid jobs. The Coalition raised the personal allowance to £10,000 this April. While this means workers have more money in their pockets, a higher tax-free allowance means the Treasury has not benefited from the jobs surge.

Britain's booming property market is also cooling down. Mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level in more than a year to 61,267 in September, from 64,054 in August, according to the Bank of England. Meanwhile, falling oil prices have depressed corporation and petroleum revenue tax receipts.

Whatever the excuse, a flick through the Treasury's Red Book from the June 2010 Budget illustrates just how slow the pace of deficit reduction has been.

Back then, the OBR believed Britain would borrow £37bn in 2014-15. Four years and a eurozone debt crisis later, Britain's borrowing is now on course to surpass £100bn this year according to some economists – around £10bn more than last year's deficit. All this means the chances of Mr Osborne pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the Autumn Statement look increasingly slim. Economists are now talking about even more austerity or tax hikes to make up the shortfall.

While Mr Osborne is still on track to meet his fiscal mandate and eliminate the cyclically-adjusted deficit – or the borrowing that stays behind even when the economy improves – within a rolling five-year deadline, the amount of belt tightening needed to achieve this now partly depends on a nebulous concept called the output gap, or difference between actual and potential output. The smaller the gap, the more austerity is needed to plug the black hole in Britain's public finances. The OBR estimates the current output gap is 1.4pc.

"We think there is a risk of a double whammy in the OBR's new figures: that the deficit is revised up, and the output gap is revised down – meaning that the goal [of balancing the books and posting a budget surplus] is even further away," said Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC. If that's the case, there's a lot more pain to come.

Lack of planning by the NHS each year brings problems with the worried well and A&E departments when winter strikes

The annual NHS bed crisis occurs with tedious predictability. Yet winter has a strange habit of arriving at around the same time every year. It's not difficult to predict – you just need a calendar. So I struggle to understand why it comes as such a surprise to those in charge of the NHS. The lack of planning and preparation for the inevitable winter stampede to Accident and Emergency departments is lamentable.

And this year's crisis has started even before the really bad weather has set in, according to figures released last week. These show that the number of people who have had to endure trolley waits has more than doubled compared with this time last year.

What's to be done? The current political rhetoric is to blame GPs. They are to blame because people who find it difficult to get appointments go to A&E instead. This is a shameful game of scapegoating.

The situation is far more complex. If anything, GPs should be applauded because they are seeing many more people each year, despite diminishing resources. Recent figures show that on average each GP in the country is providing an additional 1,450 consultations per year compared with five years ago. That's a productivity increase of about 10 per cent – pretty impressive, especially when you consider that nearly 11 per cent of the NHS budget was spent on GP services in 2005–06 and only 8.5 per cent by 2011–12. That's a cumulative loss of about £9 billion in real terms. Access to GPs is still unacceptably patchy but GPs are working flat out.

There are problems but it's not solely the fault of GPs. No, the spiralling crisis in winter A&E departments is partly to do with cuts to emergency services, partly to do with poor out–of–hours access to GPs, and partly to do with increasing population and changes in demographics.

Added to this are changes in immigration policy, which has made it harder for doctors from outside the EU – such as India – to come to work here. These doctors would often take the less attractive jobs, in inner–city surgeries and smaller hospitals for example, meaning that there are now serious shortages in some regions and some specialities.

It was reported last week that some A&E departments are spending vast amounts on locum doctors and nurses to cover shifts because they cannot get permanent staff. Many are routinely operating at only 60 per cent staff capacity, so is it any wonder there are long waits? But while a toxic mix of political factors have contributed to the current problems, there are also social and cultural factors too, not least the public's belief that they need to see a doctor for every little ache and pain. Speak to any GP and they will tell you how much time is wasted by people seeking help for minor ailments.

We are now a society for whom the vast majority has known nothing but a National Health Service, free at the point of access. One of the downsides is that people have a sense of entitlement without appreciating the cost of the service they are demanding. According to research conducted by the Self Care Forum, there are 57 million GP consultations a year for minor ailments that do not require a doctor's input. This equates to about one hour of each GP's time per day. Imagine the impact of freeing up GPs to see those who really needed them.

Research into why people bother their GP unnecessarily suggests it is due to the following: people not understanding the natural progression of symptoms, for example that a cold can last for several weeks; people perceiving symptoms to be more severe than they are; people wanting a "cure" for the problem, when over–the–counter (OTC) remedies would suffice; and people just wanting some reassurance.

The fact is that pharmacists can provide these last two services. This is what happens in other countries – such as Ireland, where people must pay to see the GP and so tend to find alternatives for managing minor problems.

"Self–care" – managing common, non–serious conditions with OTC products – is not a magical cure for all the pressures on the health service, but it's a start. A paracetamol from your pharmacist and bed rest could be just what the NHS needs to keep going this winter.

A mother on HIV medication can still infect her unborn child

The news that a woman from Milton Keynes, who is HIV positive, has conceived a second child with her husband is interesting on several levels.

First, the fact that both her husband – with whom she has conceived her children naturally, rather than via artificial insemination – has remained HIV negative and her first child who is now 21 months old is also negative, is testament to the remarkable impact that anti–retroviral medication has had on the lives of those living with HIV. Recent research has shown that people with HIV who are on medication can now expect to live as long as those without the virus – astonishing when you think that 20 years ago it was a death sentence.

Medication can now render the levels of virus in the blood to "undetectable", meaning levels are so low that the risk of infecting others is reduced to near zero.

The story is also remarkable because of this woman's courage in speaking out about being HIV positive when so much stigma is still attached to the condition. But, having said that, I am surprised at her apparently relaxed attitude.

While highly unlikely, there is a small chance that she could infect her unborn child and yet she says she tries "not think too much about it". I don't think that's an adequate response. I'm afraid that exposing a child to that risk because of your own selfish desire to have a family makes me acutely uncomfortable.

Where's Bob's next battle?

Thank goodness Bob Geldof (above) has taken on the Ebola crisis and is releasing a Christmas single to raise funds. After all, until he waded in, none of us knew anything about it. It seems to have passed him by that there has been an international aid effort going on for months, with scores of British doctors and nurses volunteering.

Apparently this isn't good enough. While pop stars donate their time, us mere mortals are expected to donate our money. Ebola, while undoubtedly serious and something that must be contained, is nothing compared with some of the biggest killers in Africa. Diarrhoea kills far more people than Ebola. Why hasn't Bob released a single about that?

Bob Geldof: Buy Band Aid 30 single...then delete it

Bob Geldof has urged fans to delete their downloaded Band Aid single - then buy it again

Anyone who downloaded the Band Aid 30 single[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopreviews/11234107/band-aid-30-single-review-one-direction.html] in aid of ebola should delete it and buy it again, Sir Bob Geldof has said.

Sir Bob, who has organised a fourth release of Do They Know It’s Christmas for charity, said he is concerned about the amount of money being raised, after the price of singles fell drastically.

Speaking on Radio 1’s Newsbeat, he said the 99p paid per download worried him, leaving organisers needing to sell “300 per cent” more than the original 1984 release to make the same amount of money.

He has now urged fans who have downloaded the track to delete it, before downloading again to raise more money.

Those familiar with iTunes have already cast doubt on the plan, pointing out it would initially remain on the iCloud.

The single, which features One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Bono, Chris Martin and Rita Ora, has already reached number one in the charts[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11248941/Band-Aid-single-storms-to-number-one.html], despite backlash from critics about its lyrics.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11248749/Band-Aid-30-set-to-top-charts-as-Emili-Sande-criticises-lyrics.html]

It has become the fastest-selling single of 2014, after selling more than 312,000 copies in its first week after a high-profile publicity campaign.

Sir Bob told the BBC: “In 1984 a single was £3.50, today it's 99p...That worries me. Even if you already have it, delete, download again.

"We need to sell 300 per cent more than we did then [in 1984] to even begin to make up the cash figure.”

A physical version of the single will be released on December 8, costing £3.99, boosting the song's chances of remaining at number one.

Sir Bob added: "Did I expect it [the success]? Yes I expected it but did I expect it in such vast, willing numbers? No I didn't.

"You just can't assume anything... You don't know if the audience is interested in this.

"Certainly they like the artists but are they interested in seeing the artist do just one or two tracks?"

A spokesman for the Official Charts Company said: "Band Aid 20 sold 200,000 each week for its first four weeks on sale - can Band Aid 30 keep up its sales momentum and beat its predecessor?

"It's possible - a physical version is set to be released in December, which means the track is still a serious contender for 2014's official Christmas number one."

Band Aid 30's feat means it is the fourth time a version of the song has reached number one.

This week's winner: Prague in perspective

My boyfriend and I visited Prague for a week this summer and would highly recommend a visit to the Czech National Monument on Zizkov hill, especially to those who have an interest in 20th-century Czechoslovakian history. It has an impressive museum with a moving exhibit to the student Jan Palach (as mentioned by Michelle Jana Chan in her piece ' Bohemian rhapsody[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/czechrepublic/prague/11231700/Prague-25-years-on-from-the-Velvet-Revolution.html] ', November 15). If you are walking from the centre you can walk through the Zizkov district, which has some great bars and restaurants – I recommend Pivovarsky Klub on Krizikova, which has fantastic local food and the largest beer menu I have ever seen – and then up to the monument through the peaceful Vitkov park. The National Monument’s best-kept secret, however, is a rooftop terrace with the best views over all of Prague.

Bohemian rhapsody revisited – every day

Michelle Jana Chan’s piece celebrated the freedom brought to Czechoslovakia by its Velvet Revolution of 1989. As I write this, it is November 17, the International Students’ Day and a national holiday in the Czech Republic. And how fitting indeed since students are the ones to be thanked for the courage they showed and the beatings they endured in Narodni Street at the hands of the Communist regime. They ushered in the future light by waving roses, ringing keys and making the “V” for victory sign.

I fell in love with Prague in the Eighties as I often went there from my home in Moravia (east of the country). I had an old street map on which I marked my various walks in different colours.

I like Prague a lot more now and have taken many people there. I am thankful that the fear, dirt and suspicion we had to live with have gone. November 1989 swept them all away and much more.

It took me a long time to overcome the days of watching my every word and every step. Nobody’s watching now.

Anna Howarth

Prague is evolving from the confines of communism at an increasing rate. In 2011 I worked in this magical city, visiting many areas of a romantic and unspoilt country. The “city of culture” describes Prague well, with its opera house, Rudolfinum concert hall, the Estates Theatre dedicated to works by Mozart, while underground (literally) you can find jazz clubs playing into the early hours.

Forget the stag parties that only appear between 2am and 6am. Indulge in the music and you will understand this city. In her excellent article, Michelle Jana Chan mentioned the Lucerna Passage, but surely the wonderful sculpture by David Cerny of an upside down horse hanging from the ceiling outside the cinema also deserved a mention? With ease of transport inside the city and beyond, I managed to visit the crystal factory at Nizbor, Krivoklat Castle in the Krivoklatsko National Park and Karlstejn Castle – all by train in a day earlier this month. Be adventurous, do your research using trains from the main station. Every village has a café or restaurant serving cheap, nutritious meals – you may develop a taste for dumplings.

Elizabeth Wills

Last December my husband and I flew to Prague on Boxing Day for a three-night break. Prague at this time of year is particularly atmospheric with a hint of snow and the bustle of the Christmas markets. After spending a day wandering around taking in the main sights and sampling the food at the market, we hired one of the guides who stand in the main square. The length of the walking tour, the price and the sort of sights we would like to see were agreed. Then followed a fascinating couple of hours visiting churches and buildings well off the beaten track and the former Jewish quarter with its tragic history. There was no rush to keep up with a group and we were able to discuss each place visited at leisure. We also discovered “The Black Theatre” with performances staged mainly in the dark by artists dressed in luminous costumes and audience participation encouraged, making for a lively evening.

Foot space on planes

Call me old-fashioned, but I have always treasured the view that the space under the seat in front of me is for my feet (“ Has Ryanair really changed?[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/ryanair/11212648/Customer-friendly-Ryanair-one-year-on-whats-really-changed.html] ”, November 8). Having paid for a bag in the hold, to then be told that I must sacrifice wriggle-space for my size 12s in order to put my small hand-baggage in my foot space, so that others can save money by filling the racks with suitcases, is not equitable. Remember when the overhead racks were designed and used for small hand-baggage? Aircraft are now flying with huge expanses of empty baggage holds, for the convenience and profit of the airlines. Let’s stand up for the knees and feet of air passengers.

Andrew Pennington

Room for disabled?

Will the option to go online and pick your desired hotel room apply to rooms offering access for the disabled too? ( Travel news[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/11213840/Tourist-attractions-still-failing-disabled-travellers.html], November 15.) More to the point, when will all rooms become “accessible” so that all any hotel guest would need to request would be either a wet room or a bath?

Surely this is not too much to ask in the modern era and would halt discrimination for disabled people. Too often a hotel is described as disabled accessible when on arrival it is discovered it clearly is not.

Band Aid at number one despite lyric concerns

BAND Aid 30's re–recording of Do They Know It's Christmas? reached number one last night despite concerns raised by the singer Emeli Sandé that the lyrics "caused offence".

Bob Geldof's charity single, released to raise money for the Ebola crisis, is the fastest–selling track of the year, but Sandé, who appears on it, claimed it should have been rewritten.

She spoke out as fellow singer Lily Allen said she rejected an offer to appear on it and would be donating "actual money" to charity instead because there was "something a bit smug about it".

Performers including One Direction, Coldplay's Chris Martin and Elbow's Guy Garvey gathered to record a new version of the track, on which some of the lines were changed to better reflect the cause. Critics have complained that the song reinforces negative stereotypes of Africa.

Sandé said on Twitter that both she and the African artist Angelique Kidjo had recorded their own lyrics but they did not make the final edit. She said: "I agree the lyric needs changing. In fact I feel a whole new song is required.

"I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control. The sole objective is to raise awareness and money to provide medical aid to those suffering the Ebola outbreak, which is being worsened and amplified by poverty."

Suited and booted, NHS medical 'heroes' fly out to fight Ebola

WITH its domed helmet, protective outer apron and thick boots, this is the kit NHS medics are depending on to save their lives as they fight Ebola in Africa.

More than 30 volunteers from Britain arrived in Sierra Leone yesterday, prepared to join the effort to combat the deadly virus.

The medical staff, who came from across Britain and flew from Heathrow on Saturday, were the first batch of NHS volunteers to be deployed by the Government after more than a thousand came forward to offer their services.

Among them are GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants, all of whom will work in treatment centres built by British Army Royal Engineers and funded by the Department for International Development.

The protective overalls they will wear, made by four British companies, leave no part of their body exposed and will be crucial in keeping them safe – although the risk of infection cannot be ruled out.

The volunteers have been warned that putting the suit on and removing it in the right order is essential for reducing the likelihood of contamination, and each set of kit must be burnt after use, except for the boots and visors.

After arriving in Freetown, the country's capital, early yesterday morning, the teams must complete a week of training and acclimatisation before they begin diagnosing and treating people.

With temperatures reaching more than 86F (30C), they will work shifts of only 45 minutes at a time to minimise the risk of heat exhaustion.

The time they enter a ward will be written on their plastic aprons to ensure they do not exceed the shift's time limit.

Almost a thousand British military, healthcare and aid workers are estimated to be helping tackle the crisis on the ground.

The protective suits have also been handed out to local health care staff in west Africa working at the British–built facilities.

The importance of protective clothing was highlighted when one of the doctors who treated a Spanish nurse with Ebola last month said the clothing he wore while doing so was ineffective.

Dr Juan Manuel Parra claimed that the suit he was given to treat Maria Teresa Romero Ramos had sleeves that were too short for him, leaving his bare skin exposed. He also complained that doctors and nurses who treated Mrs Romero initially wore just impermeable gowns and double surgical gloves, a hat and a face mask.

The overalls issued to the NHS staff are coated with a special plastic to stop bodily fluids, through which the virus is transmitted, from passing through.

The Department of Health has said previously that British workers sent to fight the outbreak in West Africa will not automatically be brought back to the UK for treatment if they become infected.

Instead, anyone infected will be dealt with on a "case–by–case" basis, meaning patients will only be repatriated if it is in their medical interest to do so.

This has already prompted concern, with one British worker saying last month that doctors volunteering to go to west Africa feel like they are being asked "to go over the top".

A Department of Health source said yesterday: "We do have contingency plans to transport patients if we need to but it would be based on whether it's in the best interest of the patient. [In some cases] flying them back can do more harm than good."

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, described the NHS volunteers as "heroes".

She said: "It is only because of their combined efforts that we stand a chance of defeating this disease."

PROTECTION HOW MEDICS WILL BE SHIELDED FROM THE VIRUS

VISOR

The eyes are a particular risk for infection , so the visor provides a screen for maximum protection, while at the same time maintaining visibility

APRON

The outer plastic apron provides an added layer of protection and is marked with the wearer's name, role and the time they entered the ward. This is to make sure they do not work too long on any one shift and are rotated with other staff

GLOVES

Not one but two pairs of gloves are worn – the inner gloves below the overalls and an outer set to provide an extra seal

BOOTS

The thick boots are easy to step in and out of and the high sides help to keep medics clear of potentially hazardous liquids on the ground

MASK

The mask directly covers the mouth – another of the most vulnerable areas for potential transmission. It has a breathable membrane to help let air through

OVERALLS

The white overalls are made of a lightweight material coated with a special plastic to stop blood and other viruscarrying bodily fluids from passing through

WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE

Beneath the gear, volunteers will wear lightweight scrubs to help keep cool, but when fully suited and working in temperatures of up to 86F they will soon face heat exhaustion – which is why they will work in shifts of 45 minutes.

The kit must also be put on in the right order to afford maximum protection and removed in a special sequence to reduce the risk of contamination.

When the work is done, all of the kit bar the boots and visor is burnt and replaced while the eye protection and boots are sprayed with chlorine to kill any trace of the virus so they can be re–used

'We do have contingency plans to transport patients if we need to but only if it's in the patient's best interest'

Thank goodness Bob Geldof (above) has taken on the Ebola crisis and is releasing a Christmas single to raise funds. After all, until he waded in, none of us knew anything about it. It seems to have passed him by that there has been an international aid effort going on for months, with scores of British doctors and nurses volunteering.

Apparently this isn't good enough. While pop stars donate their time, us mere mortals are expected to donate our money. Ebola, while undoubtedly serious and something that must be contained, is nothing compared with some of the biggest killers in Africa. Diarrhoea kills far more people than Ebola. Why hasn't Bob released a single about that?

Adding up the financial cost of disaster

Cambridge University academics are preparing top companies for the worst–case scenario, writes Marion Dakers

Imagine a social uprising, spawned from growing unease about inequality and fuelled by social media, which has sparked protests in 1,100 cities around the world. Pockets of violence are threatening to spill over into mob rule, and the global headquarters of a London bank have just been set ablaze. What does it mean for stock prices? The Judge Business School at Cambridge University has run this nightmare scenario and three other stress tests in an attempt to quantify the economic cost of a global disaster and help to prepare companies for unlikely but emerging threats.

Academics and private–sector experts have constructed scenarios with a one in 100 chance of happening in any given year, including a flu pandemic, a military conflict between China and Japan, and a cyber attack named Logic Bomb.

Insurance firms Catlin and Munich Re were involved alongside industrial giants BP and Lockheed Martin. The UK Research Councils are also providing funding for the stress tests, dubbed "catastronomics" by Cambridge.

Like the stress tests carried out in the banking sector, these scenarios are not predictions but worst–case hypothetical cases to ensure companies can withstand large shocks.

Dr Andrew Coburn, director of the advisory board at the university's Centre for Risk Studies, said: "Insurance companies like Lloyd's of London already have realistic disaster scenarios. We were requested to develop some stress tests for emerging risks that they don't model for already.

"We were able to link these scenarios to not just what insurance claims would be, but how they would affect the stock markets and investment portfolios of these insurance companies. They are hit by a double whammy."

At a time when several countries in West Africa are battling to contain the Ebola outbreak, the academics have run a "virus pandemic" scenario that imagines a new strain of flu starting in Sao Paulo, which infects half of the world and kills up to 25m people.

The insurance cost of the hypothetical catastrophe is estimated at up to $265bn and the total economic hit could reach $23trillion, say the researchers. Under this scenario, "equities are badly hit, although winners include the health care, pharma, telecoms and oil and gas sectors".

Dr Coburn said the centre is working on modelling the possible cost of the spread of Ebola, to be published in 2015.

Other tests being modelled include the growing threat of piracy, which would push up the cost of shipping and make some ocean trade routes inaccessible, and a spike in freezing weather conditions.

Several scenarios around cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are also being examined. More than a dozen insurers pledged earlier this month to work with the Cabinet Office to ensure firms can prepare for online security threats. Online attacks cost UK firms tens of billions of pounds a year, though estimates are imprecise due to companies under–reporting.

Under the stress test of the Logic Bomb cyber threat, a made–up technology firm named Sybil has its databases infected by a low–lying attack that creates increasing numbers of glitches and errors that eventually erode the ability of businesses to trust their IT.

The imagined attack lasts up to two years, and wipes $15trillion from the expected global GDP in that time. The researchers said the impact could be almost as large as the financial crisis that began in 2007.

As for insurers, they could expect their investment portfolios to lose up to 8pc of their value by the time the problem was fixed, with equities badly hit.

"This is a key part of what insurers do – they model for a 100–year investment return," said Dr Coburn.

The London riots of August 2011 pushed the FTSE 100 briefly into bear territory – where an index falls more than 20pc from its peak – with swings of more than 5pc during one day's trading. The academics at Cambridge predicted similar volatility in their "social unrest" stress test, although fixed–income investments such as bonds were expected to remain flat.

Band Aid single storms to number one

The single has become the fastest selling track of 2014, despite facing criticism for portraying a negative image of Africa

Band Aid 30's Do They Know It's Christmas? has stormed straight to the top of the UK singles chart.

Organised once again by Bob Geldof, the song has shifted more than 312,000 copies to make it the year's fastest-selling single, the Official Charts Company said.

The track, with all proceeds going toward the fight against Ebola in west Africa, has outsold the rest of the top five combined. It scored the biggest one-week sales since The X Factor's James Arthur moved 489,000 copies of his winner's single Impossible in 2012.

The massive sales haul of Band Aid 30 - which features Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, One Direction, Rita Ora and Bastille among its star cast - outshines Band Aid 20 in 2004 which sold 297,000 in its first seven days.

The 2014 version of Do They Know It's Christmas? has achieved this milestone without physical sales or streaming.

A spokesman for the Official Charts Company said: "Band Aid 20 sold 200,000 each week for its first four weeks on sale - can Band Aid 30 keep up its sales momentum and beat its predecessor?

"It's possible - a physical version is set to be released in December, which means the track is still a serious contender for 2014's official Christmas number one."

Band Aid 30's feat means it is the fourth time a version of the song has reached number one.

Its success comes despite controversy over its lyrics. Pop singer Emeli Sande has said the song needs rewriting and apologised if the latest version "caused offence".

The star, who is involved in the latest remake, posted a message on Twitter in which she said lyrics she and African artist Angelique Kidjo recorded did not make the final version.

There have been some complaints over the song's content, with some of the lyrics changed to reflect the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

Sande tweeted: "I've been having so many discussions about this all week. Here are my thoughts on the band aid single..."

Her message continued: "Ye, I agree the lyric needs changing. In fact I feel a whole new song is required. Angelique Kidjo and I made and sang our own edits. Unfortunately, none of these made the final cut."

She added: "I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control.

"The sole objective is to raise awareness and money to provide medical aid to those suffering the Ebola outbreak, which is being worsened and amplified by poverty."

New at number two in the singles chart is Clean Bandit featuring Jess Glynne. Real Love is the second collaboration between the two acts following their number one and million seller Rather Be.

Band Aid’s re-recording of Do They Know It’s Christmas? was expected to reach number one on Sunday, despite concerns raised by singer Emeli Sandé that the lyrics “caused offence”.

Bob Geldof’s charity single, released to raise money for the Ebola crisis[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/11238158/Watch-Original-1984-Band-Aid-Do-They-Know-Its-Christmas.html], is the fastest selling track of the year but Sande, who appears on it, claimed it should have been rewritten.

She spoke out as singer Lily Allen revealed that she had rejected an offer to appear on it because there was “something a bit smug about it”, suggesting that the artists involved were flaunting their success.

Stars including One Direction, Coldplay's Chris Martin and Elbow’s Guy Garvey were among those who gathered to record a new version of the track, on which some of the lines were changed to better reflect the cause.

Sande revealed on Twitter that both she and African artist Angelique Kidjo had written and recorded their own lyrics but they did not make the final edit.

Expressing concern about the final version, she said: "I agree the lyric needs changing. In fact I feel a whole new song is required. Angelique Kidjo and I made and sang our own edits. Unfortunately, none of these made the final cut.

"I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control. The sole objective is to raise awareness and money to provide medical aid to those suffering the Ebola outbreak, which is being worsened and amplified by poverty.”

Sande said that despite her reservations about the lyrics, she had no doubt that Bob Geldof had created the project with the best intentions.

The recording marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia.

Lily Allen said she would rather donate money to charity than appear alongside a raft of other celebrities in such a highly publicised drive to raise money.

She revealed she had received an email asking her to take part in the project but declined.

“I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that,” she said.

“It's like the ‘Success Club’ and I'm not really in that club. I don't think I'm above it all – I'm way below it. But there's something a bit smug about it.”

Cameron: world facing second economic crash

The Prime Minister has warned that a second global crash could be looming

David Cameron has said that “red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy” and a second global crash could be looming.

In a bleak assessment as the G20 summit draws to a close, the Prime Minister said there were early signs similar to those seen before the global recession six years ago.

There is a “dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty” with diplomatic, humanitarian and economic problems across the world, he warned, which potentially endanger Britain’s recovery.

Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said hedge funds, private equity firms and other parts of the unregulated “shadow banking” world will face increased scrutiny over the possible risks that they pose to financial stability.

“When the crisis hit, all these shadow banking risks collapsed back on the centre,” said Mr Carney, who is also chairman of the Financial Stability Board.

The board, which is charged with introducing changes to reduce the risk of another crash, has reached agreement on banking reforms but Mr Carney said there was still substantial work ahead to implement them.

The Prime Minister said the slowdown in the eurozone is affecting British exports and manufacturing.

Writing in The Guardian, Mr Cameron said[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/16/red-lights-global-economy-david-cameron] : “The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a possible third recession, with high unemployment, falling growth and the real risk of falling prices too.

“Emerging market economies, which were the driver of growth in the early stages of the recovery, are now slowing down. Despite the progress in Bali [trade talks in 2013], global trade talks have stalled while the epidemic of Ebola, conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal actions in Ukraine are all adding a dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty.”

The British economy was the fastest-growing in the G7, with “record numbers of new businesses, the largest ever annual fall in unemployment, and employment up 1.75 million in four years”, Mr Cameron said.

“But the reality is, in our interconnected world, wider problems in the global economy pose a real risk to our recovery at home,” he added.

Mr Cameron said retreating from the world or imposing extra tax and borrowing would only repeat past mistakes. He claimed the G20 communique negotiated at the summit endorsed Britain’s determination to use monetary policy to support growth and would not waver on his policy of paying down government debt.

The former prime minister, Sir John Major, told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One that people were “concerned and worried” that “none of the growth in the economy has yet reached wage packets or salary slips”.

Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “Working people are £1,600 a year worse off under [David Cameron’s] Government, borrowing is going up so far this year and exports have fallen behind our competitors.”

BRYONY GORDON

As a former party girl, I like to think I know how to entertain people. In those days this would involve: telling a story about a disastrous date/one-night stand; falling off a table I was dancing on; buying another round of drinks to keep the evening going. Trouble is, this doesn't really work with a small child. Everything I thought I knew about making people laugh has had to be reassessed. Every day my daughter gives me a look that says, "Come on, show me what you've got. Bring out the big guns. Entertain me. Otherwise, I am going to be a total nightmare." At first, tickling her and taking her to the swings was enough. Then we moved on to reading storybooks - or in her case, ripping up storybooks. Now she's 19 months and wants to spend all her time scaling toddler mountains, like a baby Bear Grylls. And so it is that we have discovered soft play.

I don't know if you've been to soft play. If you haven't, all I can say is: lucky you. Our nearest soft-play centre is like a giant padded cell, or one long episode of Total Wipeout, with things to climb and clamber on and, more importantly, fall off. Falling off things is currently Edie's favourite pastime, one that makes her laugh and laugh but leaves me a gibbering wreck. Then there's the sickly bubblegum smell they pump into the air. It is like being in a surly teenager's mouth. The other problem I have with soft play is the ball pit. I remember the joy of a ball pit as a child, but as an adult it terrifies me. I once heard a story about someone finding a poo at the bottom of all the balls. This may be an urban myth, but it's stuck with me. I basically find soft play nerve-shredding. It is not fun.

But Harry? Harry loves soft play. Maybe even more than Edie does. One Saturday they went down the giant slide 25 times, and then both pulled a "WAAHH!" face when I suggested we go and get some lunch. We might get a divorce over soft play.

"We've been here four hours now," I say to him each Saturday.

"Just five more minutes…" he pleads.

But that's not the worst thing about soft play. No. That happened last weekend, when a supermodel showed up with her millionaire-musician husband and their children. And this I have to tell you about…

Single again

LUCY CAVENDISH

Raymond comes back from America looking happy but exhausted. He collapses in the car, a large heap of a boyman, yawning. We've had virtually no communication since he left a week ago. This is fine by me as Raymond's retro-cool idea of not really bothering with social media or an up-to-date mobile phone has left me feeling sneakily proud of him.

However, it has felt odd, not hearing a jot from him. I spent the first day he was away listening to the news on the radio.

"What are you doing?" Leonard asked me as the sound of Big Ben pealed once more.

"Making sure Raymond's aeroplane hasn't crashed," I said.

He rolled his eyes at that. "You're paranoid," he said. But then Jerry got very worried about bombs and terrorists and Leonard heard about a case of Ebola in New York and they became as obsessed by the news as I was.

But here he is, Raymond. He comes into the house, hugs his siblings, hugs the dogs, kisses me and mooches off to bed.

"That it, then, is it?" says Leonard. He then disappears off to his own room and gradually the house gets back to where it was, as if Raymond has never been away…

That night, I go to a party. Raymond says he will babysit.

I set off, reluctantly. The lure of a Saturday night in with the children is so overwhelming, I almost bail. But this is a really good friend's birthday. So I troop up the motorway and sit for a bit and watch people go into her house. Everyone seems to be arriving with a someone else and here I am, again, on my own. It is all beginning to get a bit wearing. Suddenly there is a tap on my window. It is my friend A's husband.

"Hello," he says, beaming at me. "A has sent me out to get you. I thought you might like me to walk you in."

I feel awash with gratitude. What a kind thing to do. "Yes, please!" I say. As we walk in, he whispers, "This won't go on forever. You'll find a lovely someone. I know you will."

Then I see A coming towards me, smiling broadly, I think this is going to be a good party after all.

THE technology that allows soldiers to fight on while under chemical attack could be used to help combat the Ebola virus, according to one British manufacturer.

Avon Rubber, which produces gas masks used by more than 50 militaries to keep troops safe from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) contamination, says it has received enquiries from governments about how its products could be used.

"There's been a lot of panic buying at the low end of the market because of Ebola, people buying masks, goggles and suits," said Peter Slabbert, chief executive of Avon.

"We are positioned at the premium end of the market and are starting to see inquiries from the UK and US governments asking 'how do we protect against this threat in the long term?' "

About 75pc of Avon's protection division comes from making masks and the filters for them. The company is looking at how its products and expertise can be used in civilian applications.

Mr Slabbert said Avon's products have a "military look and feel" that could need changing for medical personnel.

He added that Avon's technology could allow doctors to treat Ebola victims more effectively.

Avon, based in Melksham, Wiltshire, is also looking at how equipment that allows troops to drink and keep cool could be used. The company, which last week reported annual sales flat at £125m and adjusted pre-tax profits up 21pc at £16.6m, said it sees the business opportunity as a medium to long-term proposition.

Japanese QE tsunami risks global meltdown

Red warning lights are flashing on the dashboard of the global economy," remarked David Cameron last weekend. The Prime Minister was highlighting, rightly, the plethora of economic and geopolitical risks currently stalking the world, all of which threaten the UK's fragile recovery.

Referring to a "dangerous backdrop of instability and uncertainty", Cameron pointed to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, Ebola, a slowdown among the big emerging economies of the East and, with a flourish, "a eurozone that's teetering on the brink of a possible third recession".

This outburst of economic honesty had little to do with any new-found interest in the dismal science on the part of our Prime Minister, of course, and everything to do with the forthcoming Autumn Statement on Wednesday 3 December.

The dire state of our public finances means that Chancellor George Osborne's Commons set piece will likely be light on spending giveaways and tax cuts. So the Tories are getting their spin in early, shoving the blame on to the rest of the world.

It remains true, though, that various global woes are now undermining the UK's recovery, slowing our exports and generally dulling investor confidence. I'm sure this is a message - "it's their fault, not ours" - that the Tories will be plying heavily in the run-up to the Autumn Statement and beyond. But the thing is that just a few hours after Cameron opined, his economic missive was already out of date. Because we must now add yet another risk to the litany of potential dangers dragging down global growth and which could even spark a 2008-style systemic meltdown. And that additional risk is Japan.

The Japanese economy contracted at an annualised rate of 1.6pc between July and September, we learnt last Monday. This return to recession was, to say the least, a shock. The consensus forecast was for an expansion of around 2pc during the third quarter. That's the target Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has set in the hope that economic expansion will help tackle Japan's national debt - which stands at around 240pc of GDP. Even this eye-watering debt ratio is set to go higher, with Japan now in recession for the fourth time since the onset of the financial crisis.

Since these disastrous growth data were published, Japanese politics has been upended. After just two years in office, the prime minister on Friday dissolved parliament, calling a snap election to seek a fresh mandate for "Abenomics", his strategy of reviving Japan's moribund economy with a mix of super-easy money, government spending and structural reform.

With the recent rise of Japan's sales tax from 5pc to 8pc being widely blamed for hindering recovery, Abe also delayed for at least 18 months a planned further increase to 10pc, even though that tax hike was previously presented as central to his debtreduction strategy. Despite that reprieve, voters aren't impressed. Polling data suggests more than two-thirds don't understand why Abe has called a shotgun election.

Since Cameron issued his verdict on the global growth outlook, we now know the world's third-largest economy has plunged back into recession. Why should that matter? Japan has been in and out of recession since the early 1990s, after all, with its infamous "lost decade" now firmly relabelled "the lost 20 years". Given that Japan has long been gripped in a vice of falling wages and economic contraction, why should a few more years make any difference to us? The reason why we should worry is that Japan's programme of quantitative easing is now wildly out of control, so much so that the country represents a major risk not only to itself, but also the rest of the world. With growth now reversed, and the power-crazed Abe determined to consolidate his hold on office, the danger is that the supine mandarins at the Bank of Japan turn up the dial to a degree that defies all credibility, sparking a crisis of confidence that spreads around the world.

This column has often criticised the unprecedented extent to which the Western world has relied on the printing of virtual money to try to secure a meaningful economic recovery. For QE, on the scale we've used it, is deeply counterproductive, and that's before you consider the potential chaos on financial markets when the monetary spigot is closed and pumped-up asset prices crash back to earth.

Rubbish, I hear some of you say, especially those who work for an investment bank or in the Treasury. The US Federal Reserve just ended QE and nothing happened. Financial markets sailed on. Yes, but almost no one who knows anything about financial markets really believes that the party really is over. Any sign of serious trouble on Wall Street, and the Fed will launch QE anew.

Aside from that, the European Central Bank is widely expected to soon follow its Anglo-Saxon counterparts, mimicking the US and UK forays into massive monetary creation. And even before that, the funnymoney baton has now anyway been passed back to Tokyo, soothing concerns that global equity markets will lack liquidity any time soon. For the Bank of Japan is now expanding its balance sheet on a quite extraordinary scale.

Immediately after the subprime crisis, Japan was actually relatively slow out of the blocks when it came to "extraordinary monetary measures". Having practised QE in the past, the Bank of Japan's balance sheet was already equivalent to around 20pc of GDP, compared with 6pc at the Fed and the Bank of England. Once Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, the UK and US rapidly expanded base money to 25pc and 30pc of GDP by mid-2013, a fourfold and fivefold increase respectively.

Over the same period, Japan grew its central bank balance sheet to around 40pc of GDP, a twofold rise, still massive, but smaller by comparison. That's why the yen strengthened, causing howls of protest from Tokyo's all-powerful export lobby. Since then, though, Japanese monetary policy has gone into hyperspace.

Under Abe, the Bank of Japan has expanded its balance sheet from 40pc to around 50pc of GDP over about 18 months. Then, at the end of October, Abe rolled the dice again, announcing a boost to a quite incredible 70pc of GDP over the next three years. By that time, Japan's monetary base will be close to the same size as that of America, even though the US economy is three times bigger and home to two and a half times more people.

This is preposterous. the Bank of Japan - and its supporters on financial markets from London to New York and beyond - claim Tokyo is trying to escape deflation and boost its economy. But Japan isn't refusing to grow because it needs more QE. The funny money, after all, barely enters the "real economy". While it boosts share prices, much of it just ends up as excess reserves parked by otherwise insolvent banks and financial institutions at their respective central banks.

QE does almost nothing to secure meaningful, sustainable growth. It's all about competitive currency depreciation and governments avoiding tough decisions - as central banks buy sovereign bonds. To say nothing of backdoor bank bail-outs. This is as true in Japan as it is everywhere else, only more so.

The danger is, though, that Japan's QE programme is now so vast that it could cause a wave of panic - particularly if rising Japanese interest rates spark fears of further monetisation, causing a sharp fall in the yen that then leads to a downward spiral.

The "red warning lights" are certainly flashing. Cameron was right - and probably more than he knew.

Avon military mask technology could help fight ebola

Avon, the company which makes military gas, is investigating how its expertise could help medics tackling deadly ebola

The technology that allows soldiers to fight on for hours while under chemical attack could be used to help combat the deadly ebola virus, according to British company Avon Rubber.

The company, whose protection unit produces gas masks used by more than 50 militaries[http://www.avon-protection.com/] to keep troops safe from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) contamination, says it is beginning to see enquiries from governments about how its products could be used.

“There’s been a lot of panic buying at the low end of the market because of ebola, people buying masks, googles and suits,” said Peter Slabbert, chief executive of Avon.

“We are positioned at the premium end of the market and are starting to see inquiries from the UK and US government looking more strategically, asking 'How do we protect against this threat in the long term?’ ”

About 75pc of Avon’s business is its protection division making masks and the filters for them, and the company is now looking at how its products and expertise can be used in civilian applications.

Mr Slabbert said Avon’s products have a “military look and feel” which could need changing for medical personnel working in ebola-affected areas, though this could be as simple as swapping out the predominately black pieces for white ones.

However, he added the Avon’s technology could also allow doctors to treat ebola victims more effectively.

“Outbreaks have tended to be in hot countries where working in a basic mask and suit can be unbearable because of the heat, so medical personnel can treat patients for about 20 minutes before they are exhausted and dehydrated,” Mr Slabbert said.

Avon, which is based in Melksham, Wiltshire, is looking at how protective equipment which allows troops to drink and keep cool could be used.

“Instead of working for just 20 minutes doctors could hydrate and keep cool,” Mr Slabbert said. “It would transform the way medical support can be provided.”

The company, which last week (November 19) reported annual sales flat at £125m and adjusted pre-tax profits up 21pc at £16.6m, said it sees the business opportunity as a medium to long-term proposition.

“This will be beneficial in three to six months’ time,” Mr Slabbert said. “The ebola pandemic suggests that people’s perception is that this is not going to go away.”

He said he saw similarities between current events and the situation following 9/11, which he said was a “huge driver” for the market for two to three years after the terrorist attacks as governments, organisations and individuals sought protection.

Avon also sees opportunities in becoming an adviser and training provider in the field, bringing its experience to bear in teaching people how to use protective equipment and work while wearing it.

“Even people with money to spend don’t know what to spend it on now,” Mr Slabbert said. He added that there were further potential for Avon in the decontamination of equipment which has been used in infected zones.

Recent chlorine gas attacks in Syria have also created further opportunities for the company with civilian organisations looking to protect their employees.

“Ebola is a real threat but what is going on in Syria raised awareness in the region of Avon and we’ve had a lot of interest in our traditional products,” Mr Slabbert said, with companies with operations in nearby countries such as Iran investigating how they can protect their staff.

Ebola 'hysteria' hits African safaris

Experts say bookings fall is irrational as tourist areas are far from affected regions. Natalie Paris reports

Tour operators have reported a sharp fall in visitors to Africa due to "hysteria" over Ebola, despite the fact that most tourist destinations are more than 3,000 miles from affected parts of the continent.

Chris McIntyre of the tour operator Expert Africa said that between the end of August and October, bookings were half what he would normally expect. While confidence had since improved, bookings still only amounted to 65–70 per cent of what they should be at this time of the year, with advance bookings for 2015 also down.

Firms running trips to Botswana's Okavango Delta have reported a drop–off in business of 30–50 per cent, while Jake Grieves–Cook of Gamewatchers Safaris, a former chairman of the Kenya Tourist Board, described the downturn as the worst he had seen for years. "Our Porini camps are running at 20 per cent less occupancy than last year as a result of the hysteria over Ebola," he said.

"There is no Ebola in Kenya and there are no direct flights from the affected areas in West Africa to Nairobi. There is also a big difference between the quality of medical facilities and care in Sierra Leone or Liberia, compared with Kenya.

"Those of us who live here are absolutely unconcerned about any risk of catching Ebola and there is more chance of being infected in the USA, where there have been several cases, than here, where there is not a single case."

Vivian McCarthy, director of Acacia Africa, agreed that Ebola was having an effect on inquiry levels, adding: "It is natural for travellers to be concerned at news regarding Ebola but would you not take a holiday in Turkey because of a disease, spread by direct contact only, in Goa?" The distance between a popular safari destination such as Botswana and the areas affected by the outbreak is more than 3,000 miles, the same as London to Qatar, or New York to Portugal.

"A tragic knock–on effect of the fall in visitor numbers to African safari parks and lodges is that the funding of conservation and anti–poaching measures is also falling," revealed Richard Madden, our safari columnist.

"As a consequence the most endangered species are even more at risk. What people often don't realise is how much conservation depends on tourism. When people stop going on safari, the wildlife suffers. It is as simple as that."

Visits to Kenya have also been affected by reports of terrorism on the coast.

Brian Jackman, one of Telegraph Travel's safari experts, has recently returned from Tsavo in Kenya, where, for two days this year, the park was completely empty – for the only time since it opened in 1948.

"The good news is that if you go now you can travel all day and not see another soul," he said.

McIntyre reported that the flip side of the situation was some spectacular reductions for many camps and safaris.

"We've seen some properties giving particularly strong discounts for short–term bookings, like 35 per cent off luxury camping in the Maasai Mara.

"It's notable that many of the parks, like the Maasai Mara, are much quieter than they'd usually be. Also that flight prices for trips to and from Africa are very low by their usual standards, albeit that most of these need to be booked in the coming weeks.

"So a handful of our savviest travellers are taking advantage of this and heading to Africa. Some are even booking flights for mid–2015, to guarantee the prices."

SHAKESPEARE'S Globe is determined to visit every country in the world to perform Hamlet, despite coming up against Ebola, war in the Middle East and Kim Jong–un's North Korean regime, its director has said.

Dominic Dromgoole, the Globe's artistic director, said that the company would include all countries in its tour, and he believed it was "plausible" to believe it will tick every one off the list.

It was "determined to try to get in everywhere", but performances in west Africa had already been postponed due to Ebola.

At the launch of the Globe's 2015 summer season, he said he "firmly believed" all countries should be able to see Hamlet. The company is 65 countries into its world tour, having been through eastern Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean. "The next leg is east Africa," he said. "We had to dodge west Africa for an original reason, which was avoiding pestilence.

"We're going to go across to Australia and through the Pacific islands, and hopefully work our way back to west Africa in the spring of 2016."

When asked whether he still planned to put on performances of the Globe to Globe project in North Korea, Mr Dromgoole said he "very much hopes so".

"We're determined to try and get in everywhere," he added. Meetings had already begun, with the plan still seeming "plausible".

The company announced productions of the Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, Richard II and Measure for Measure for its summer season.

The Globe will also put on King John for the first time since it opened in its current form on Bankside, London. Mr Dromgoole said the production would be the "last piece of the puzzle" for the Globe, which will now have put on 37 of the works understood to have been written predominantly by Shakespeare.

Carla Bruni to front France's version of Band Aid

Singer and wife of Nicolas Sarkozi will record charity single Noël est là or Christmas is Here

France’s former first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is to front a Gallic version of Band Aid to help tackle Ebola in West Africa. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11235431/Carla-Bruni-to-do-French-Band-Aid-song.html]

The supermodel-turned-pop singer will team up with a brochette of French stars to record Noël est là (Christmas is Here) with the label Mercury Music Group of Universal.

These will include Vanessa Paradis, Louis Bertignac, Lou Doillon, Jean-Louis Aubert, Zaz, Shakaponk, Izia Higelin, Thomas Dutronc, BB Brunes and rapper Joey Starr.

Bob Geldof, the co-creator of the original hit Do They Know It’s Christmas hit, intimated this month that the French version would include veteran crooner Johnny Hallyday – often dubbed “France’s answer to Elvis” - and Daft Punk – the double act behind planetary hit Lucky.

Neither was not on the list released by Mercury on Friday, but organisers said the final line-up was “not closed” so more could join the group.

Noël est là will be released on 1 December and will be accompanied by a video. All proceeds will go to Band Aid.

Miss Bruni-Sarkozy is married to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is expected to win a contest to reclaim control of his centre-Right UMP party next week – a post he hopes will be a springboard to run for another term in office in 2017.

The original 1984 Band Aid single, Do They Know It's Christmas, featuring singers like Wham, Boy George, Duran Duran, Sting and Status Quo, spent three weeks at number one and sold over three million copies in the UK and raising more than £8 million ($24m) worldwide for those starving in the Horn of Africa.

The record’s success inspired similar fundraising efforts in Canada, France, Spain and the United States and led to the Live Aid and USA for Africa concerts, which were broadcast in over 165 countries, raising about £95 million ($150m) for famine relief in Ethiopia.

The latest, fourth, UK version was recorded this month hosting big name acts including One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Chris Martin, Sam Smith, Sinead O’Connor, and Bono. It shot to the top of the charts in 50 countries, and Geldof said this week that sales totalled $1.7 million within about five minutes on iTunes.

However, not all artists welcomed Geldof’s new project, with rapper Fuse ODG turning down his Band Aid 30 invitation because of the song’s “negative” image of Africa and Damon Albarn suggesting that there are “problems with our idea of charity”.

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy has been embroiled in controversy of her own over her charity work while France’s first lady.

Last year, it emerged that her charitable foundation’s website cost French taxpayers 410,000 euros to set up while her husband was at the Elysée. Some 100,000 people signed a petition asking for her to pay the money back for the site.

A year earlier, she faced embarrassing accusations that she had used her influence with a major medical charity, Global Fund, to award £2.3 million to a musician friend in Paris so that he could develop a campaign to fight Aids. She denied any wrongdoing.

Shakespeare's Globe is determined to visit every country in the world, despite coming up against a few obstacles

Shakespeare's Globe is determined to visit every country in the world to perform Hamlet, despite coming up against ebola, war in the Middle East and Kim Jong Un's North Korean regime, its director has said.

Dominic Dromgoole, the Globe’s artistic director, vowed the company would include all countries in its tour, saying he believes it is “plausible” to believe they will tick every one off the list.

Saying they were “determined to try and get in everywhere”, he disclosed performances in West Africa had already been postponed due to ebola.

Speaking at the launch of the Globe’s 2015 summer season, he said he “firmly believed” all countries should be able to see Hamlet, despite protests about the North Korean regime.

The company is already 65 countries into its world tour, having been through eastern Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean.

“The next leg is east Africa,” he said. “We had to dodge West Africa for an original reason, which was avoiding pestilence.

“We’re going to go across to Australia and through the Pacific islands, and hopefully work our way back to West Africa in the spring of 2016.”

When asked whether he still planned to put on performances of the Globe to Globe project[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/william-shakespeare/10182211/Shakespeares-Globe-to-go-on-world-tour.html] in North Korea, he said he “very much hopes so”.

“We firmly believe every that country is every country, and being inclusive is better than not,” Dromgoole said.

“There are a lot of countries you would be concerned about, and according to what your politics are right across the spectrum there are a huge number of different ones.

“We’re determined to try and get in everywhere.”

He added meetings had already begun, with the plan still seeming “plausible”.

When asked about the likelihood of visiting the Middle East, he said the company had made an “enormous amount of friends” across the political spectrum who could build “secure relationships” to assist them with getting in.

They will be aiming to visit the area towards the end of the two-year tour, which is aimed at giving as many people access to Shakespeare as possible.

“We are very, very determined to get to as many places as we can, because that’s the point of doing it,” the director said.

“We have to be very careful, and we don’t want to put anyone in harm’s way – we get very good advice.”

The company has now announced it new 2015 summer season, with productions of the Merchant of Venice, As You Like It, Ruchard II and Measure for Measure.

The Globe will also put on King John for the first time since it opened in its current form, finally completes the entire works of Shakespeare plays.

Dromgoole said the production would be the “last piece of the puzzle” for the Globe, which will now have put on 37 of the works understood to have been written predominantly by Shakespeare.

Speaking at a press conference to launch the season, he said: ““This is a very significant moment for us.

“Doing the play that naturally attaches itself to Magna Carta, King John, is finishing a very big jigsaw puzzle that has been growing for 20 years.”

The play, directed by James Dacre, will be a celebration of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, and will tell the story of “a tangled world of ruthless politicking and fatal power struggles” in John’s reign.

The season will be entitled “Justice and Mercy”, as the Globe vows to examine the “strengths and weaknesses of judicial law and the various tugs-of-war between family, state, religion, love, sex and duty that have defined human morality for centuries”.

It will include a new play about Nell Gwynn, the lowly Satsuma-seller who rose to become mistress to King Charles II.

What is my 1984 Band Aid single worth?

The charity single has driven demand for Band Aid records and knicknacks from the 1980s. Telegraph Money looks at the "reunion effect" on the value of old records

The latest Band Aid single raised £1m for the fight against Ebola within just five minutes of being launched - but worthy charities may not be the only ones to benefit.

According to experts, merchandise produced during the 30-year history of the cause has jumped in value since the latest incarnation came to the public's notice.

Renewed hype over the celebrity fundraising campaign means that Band Aid and Live Aid items such as records, ticket stubs, concert programmes and t-shirts are more desirable - and so attract a higher price tag.

But Tim Jones of Record Collector magazine said a 1984 Band Aid single, in mint condition and with a signature from one or more of the singers, would fetch £20 to £30.

"If you were one of the people who stood outside the record launch and got some of the artists to sign it, you may get a higher price. If you managed to get tens of singers to sign it, and not just Bob [Geldof], you're looking at much, much more," he said.

Because of the first Band Aid single's popularity - it sold more than three million copies by the end of 1984 - it is not included in the Rare Record Price Guide, a list of records worth £10 or more compiled by Record Collector magazine.

For a more lucrative sell, try selling on old concert memorabilia.

A pristine ticket stub from the original Live Aid concert, staged in July 1985 as a follow-up to the previous year's single, could be worth £100. More than double this sum for a signed copy.

Currently a concert "package" of the original ticket, t-shirt and programme is selling for £200 on eBay. A ticket from the 1985 concert is on offer for £20.

"The concert was such a landmark performance that you'd definitely have an easier time selling high-value memorabilia," Mr Jones said.

A concert programme or clothing bought on the day would also be worth around £50, Mr Jones estimated. "As usual, it's all down to condition," he said.

He added that the "reunion effect" meant vintage items increased briefly in value when old bands got together again.

"Reunions definitely produce a short-term spike in people's interest," he said.

During a Led Zeppelin reunion concert in 2007, for example, the value of records produced over the band's 40-plus-year history almost doubled.

Even mass-produced records will feel the effect, as well as the rarer releases. "Band Aid was produced in mass numbers but records and merchandise may still have a higher value," Mr Jones said.

How my dog sniffed out breast cancer and saved my life

Five years ago, Dr Claire Guest's labrador Daisy discovered a lump in her owner's breast. Now, Dr Guest has founded Medical Detection Dogs - one of the Telegraph's Christmas charities

At the gatepost of Dr Claire Guest’s bungalow in rural Bedfordshire, a stone bust of a labrador stands guard. At the sound of tyres crunching on gravel, it seems to spring to life: there is a flurry of raucous barks and the sound of a tail thumping on the ground. These barks, however, are coming from inside the house, where the statue’s real-life incarnation – a bundle of rust-red fur and boisterous paws – is defending the front door.

“Down, Daisy!” laughs Claire, squeezing into the hallway. “Who needs a doorbell with this one around?” As she moves through the house, Daisy seems glued to her side, gazing up at her owner with big, loyal eyes. When Claire goes upstairs, the dog perches on the edge of the sofa, tongue lolling, impatient for her return. It’s a scene many dog owners would recognise – but these two are closer than most, because five years ago, Daisy made a discovery that saved Claire’s life.

It was August, 2009 and Claire, a scientist and animal behaviour expert, had been training Daisy to use her sense of smell for medical purposes. Struck by the intelligence of animals, after years of intensive research, she had become convinced that dogs could be used to detect human conditions – from low blood-sugar levels in diabetics to cancerous cells in the otherwise healthy – using nothing but their noses. The part of the brain that controls smell is 40 times more powerful in dogs than humans, meaning they can detect odours at a concentration of one part per trillion.

One afternoon, Claire took a break from work at a nearby hospital to take Daisy and her other two dogs for a walk. “I lifted the back of the car up, and the other two jumped out – but Daisy sat staring at me,” she remembers. “Then she boshed into me a couple of times, prodding my chest with her nose. It was really weird; she’s not an invasive dog. But she pushed into me again. I said, 'Silly girl, go away,’ and she leapt out. We went for a walk, and all the while I was thinking, 'That really hurt.’”

That evening, Claire, now 50, felt the place on her chest where Daisy had pushed her. “I thought there was something there; a lump,” she says. A trip to the doctor confirmed that there was a cyst in her left breast – the exact spot her dog had pinpointed – and she was sent for further investigation. Following a mammogram and a core biopsy, Claire learnt that she had breast cancer.

“The surgeon said I was incredibly lucky for it to be diagnosed so early. It was as deep as a breast cancer can be, so by the time I’d felt anything, it would’ve been too late.” She had a lumpectomy and her lymph nodes removed, followed by five weeks of radiotherapy – and is now cancer-free. She owes her life, she believes, to her dog.

“All I could think was, what a difference Daisy has made,” she says. “I might have had to have aggressive chemotherapy. I might not have survived. That’s what made me decide: right, we’ve got to discover what’s going on.”

As she speaks, her hand is draped around the labrador; Daisy’s paw, in return, rests on Claire’s knee. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by animals, particularly the relationship we have with them,” she explains. “I did psychology at Swansea University and was involved in one of the first studies of the effects of dogs on humans: why, when you stroke a dog, does your blood pressure go down? While studying, I worked as a nurse in a vet’s surgery, where I learnt an awful lot about the bond we have with animals.”

After university, Claire became involved with the charity Hearing Dogs for Deaf People, and, in 2002, joined forces with Dr John Church, a retired orthopaedic surgeon, who had written a letter to The Lancet claiming that dogs could detect bladder cancer from urine.

“We gathered a team from Buckinghamshire NHS Trust, and worked on a study that was published in the British Medical Journal in 2004,” she says. “It was the first publication in the world that showed, without a doubt, that dogs could smell cancer and that cancer had an odour. It was a revelation.”

The researchers were swamped by international interest in their trial – but, back in Britain, they faced scepticism. “People said: 'Well, that’s all very interesting, but how’s it going to help me?’ And they had some mad idea that we wanted to put a dog in every waiting room in the country. That wasn’t the plan at all. I was really deflated by all this negativity. I genuinely believed that dogs were going to save lives.”

But Claire and her team refused to give up. They set up a training centre in Milton Keynes, and supporters donated animals: retired gun dogs, failed guide dogs (“the ones that get distracted by a smell and make their owners walk into a lamppost”), spaniels, labradors and other “inquisitive, happy little dogs”. Claire founded the charity, Medical Detection Dogs (MDD), in 2008 – and began harnessing the connection between dogs and humans for a range of medical purposes: to nudge sufferers of severe Type 1 diabetes that their blood sugar is low; to alert Addison’s patients of the onset of an attack; even to sniff out cancer cells.

The dogs work in a laboratory where tubes containing breath or urine samples are placed on a carousel. They are trained, using a hand-held clicker (to reinforce correct behaviour) to stare intently at a sample they believe contains “abnormal” cells. They are then rewarded with a tennis ball or treat.

Training a medical assistance dog costs around £11,000 (including placing it with the individual) and takes around six weeks; cancer dogs take six months and cost £6,000 to train, with £5,000-a-year maintenance costs. MDD currently has around 55 working dogs, and a waiting list of 100 clients, many of them severely ill and unable to survive without support. “The differences we see are incredible,” says Claire. “Fewer paramedic call-outs; fewer hospital stays; people whose lives are utterly transformed by these animals.”

The charity has launched a groundbreaking breast-cancer trial, involving 1,500 patients at Buckinghamshire NHS Trust, to determine whether dogs can detect mutated cells from breath samples. If successful, Claire hopes the results could improve diagnosis rates, by starting screening earlier and offering regular check ups to those who have already had cancer.

“To start with, I was careful what I said: I didn’t want to alienate people,” says Claire, fondling Daisy’s ears. “But now I say: 'Come on, this information could save lives. We have a duty to try.’” Scepticism about what MDD does has finally turned to fascination – and she hopes the Telegraph’s Christmas Charity Appeal will raise its profile further, bringing in much-needed funds for training and research.

“The future is really exciting. We’re working with manufacturers of 'electronic noses’, who are trying to replicate what the dogs do in technology. The way I see it, our work has only started.”

Her eyes come to rest on Daisy. Now 10, the dog who detected her cancer is due to retire soon. Since diagnosing Claire, she has become the MDD’s foremost sniffer dog, screening 6,500 samples and correctly indicating over 500 cases of cancer. This week, she became the first dog since the rescue mission of the 7/7 bombings to be awarded the Blue Cross medal.

“I got her when she was eight weeks old,” recalls Claire. “She’s always been like a best friend. She was a little puppy, trotting along beside me, looking up. Just like she is now. She’s a very gentle soul; totally unique. And I am so proud.

“I worry about her grey hairs – that’s the one sadness: whatever you do, a dog is never going to live as long as you. But this one has taught me more than I ever could have imagined.”

Comment: If Kim Jong-un won't face a war crimes court, then who on earth will?

The UN vote to refer North Korea to the Hague is a noble gesture - too bad it won't succeed

In the endless guessing game about what really goes in the court of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, two questions are causing even more intrigue than normal. The first is whether the portly Mr Kim has had to have surgery on his feet, the result of tottering around in Cuban heels designed to boost his height. And the second is whether those same feet are now are now quaking in their boots at the prospect of being referred to the International Criminal Court.

As The Telegraph reported on Wednesday [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11239659/UN-panel-demands-North-Korea-human-rights-investigation.html], the human rights committee of United Nations general assembly has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a move to have Mr Kim investigated by the Hague for crimes against humanity. The move follows February's UN report into Pyongyang's appalling human rights record, in which the author, the Australian judge Michael Kirby, likened the regime variously to the Nazis, the Khmer Rouge and Russia under Stalin.

Unlike some more excitable UN functionaries, who are fond of hurling similar insults at Israel and America, Judge Kirby backed up his claims with cold and chillingly sombre research. He spent much of 2013 hosting a roving UN inquiry panel that held evidence-taking sessions from North Korean expats in London, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo - everywhere, in fact, except Pyongyang, where they were refused entry.

The result of this gruesome human rights roadshow was a 372 page report [http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/coidprk/pages/commissioninquiryonhrindprk.aspx] - the length of a medium-sized horror novel - which detailed everything from torture and slavery through to mass murder in prison camps [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11238975/Eight-reasons-why-North-Korea-should-be-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.html], where bodies are routinely burned and the ash used as fertiliser.

Indeed, when I spoke to Mr Kirby on the eve of Tuesday's UN vote, he told me: "These images reminded me of what awaited General Eisenhower and General Montgomery when they arrived at the camps in occupied Europe in 1945."

Of course, we knew much of this already. All Mr Kirby's report did was compile it into a single, detailed dossier - intended, as he puts it, to ensure that the world could never again say it didn't know what was going on, as some nations did after Auschwitz. Mr Kirby even took the trouble of writing directly to Kim Jong-un himself, politely requesting him to take "all reasonable and necessary measures" to stop such horrors, although he says has yet to receive a reply.

The reason being, sadly, that Kim Jong-un himself knows that it is very unlikely that he will ever find himself at the Hague, or even named in an indictment. For while Tuesday's UN vote was backed by 111 votes to 19 against, the final say will be with the UN security council, where North Korea's old friend, China, and possibly also Russia, will almost certainly veto any ICC referral. North Korea's behaviour has tested even Beijing's patience in recent years, but allies are still allies, and besides, like every other country with a dubious human rights record itself, China is reluctant to encourage the ICC to cast stones that might one day come its way too.

This, of course, is simply business as usual in terms of the realpolitik of international diplomacy: the self-interest of nations like China and Russia on the UN security council are two good reasons why the UN is often powerless to stop atrocities in different parts of the world, and why US-led coalitions often choose to act alone. But the case of North Korea demonstrates it particularly starkly. As Mr Kirby, who was sometimes reduced to tears by what he heard during his inquiry [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/10413950/UN-inquiry-chief-reduced-to-tears-by-North-Korea-brutality.html], puts it: "If North Korea is not, objectively, a case for referral to the prosecutor at the ICC, it is hard to imagine a case that would be."

Still, while the report's author may clearly end up disappointed, the world' other remaining Stalinist-throwback nations will see it as a strategic victory. Before Tuesday's vote at the UN even got underway, there was a separate motion to de-fang the resolution by Cuba, which wanted it replaced by an anodyne statement that simply encouraged more dialogue with Pyongyang, and omitted all mention of prosecutions. As Mr Kirby points out, this is the same Cuba that another inquiry found had supplied weapons to a North Korean boat that was stopped in the Panama Canal in July 2013, in breach of a global arms embargo on Pyongyang. So no conflict of interests there then.

Still, North Korea isn't the only country that Cuba has been extending the hand of friendship too recently. Only last month, Hugo Swire, a junior foreign office minister, b ecame the first British government minister to visit Havana in nearly ten years [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11200459/Hugo-Swire-first-UK-minister-to-visit-Cuba-in-almost-decade.html], [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11200459/Hugo-Swire-first-UK-minister-to-visit-Cuba-in-almost-decade.html] discussing trade and investment and Cuba's contribution of some 250 doctors to fight Ebola alongside British medics in Sierra Leone.

Yes, of course, human rights were also raised - alongside the cause of gays, lesbian and trans-sexuals, who are apparently a cause close to the heart of Raoul Castro's daughter, Marie [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-british-ministerial-visit-to-cuba-in-10-years] la. But on the matter of getting Kim Jong-un that bit closer to the ICC, where he very clearly belongs, the meeting clearly produced little progress. Small wonder that Kim Jong-un has never felt the need to write back to Mr Kirby.

Why Adele was right to ignore Bob Geldof and Band Aid

Bryony Gordon wonders why, when it comes to charity, the rich and famous donate their precious time while the rest of us must donate our money

I have so many problems with the latest Band Aid single [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/11235487/Band-Aid-30-the-reaction.html] that I don’t really know where to begin, but begin we must so let’s get going with the fact that two-thirds of the line-up are unrecognisable to anyone over the age of 30 – not least Bono, who in the group photo [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/11235286/Band-Aid-30-Who-sang-which-line-in-pictures.html?frame=3108490] looks as if he’d rather be anywhere else than at the feet of a YouTube Vlogger (Zoella) and slightly to the left of a bloke who once lost The X Factor (Olly Murs).

Still, that’s not really a bearing on the single as such – it’s more a sign of how out-of-touch I am with popular culture, that when I looked at the picture my thoughts were 'gosh, it looks like a school photo on mufti day!’, followed by 'thank goodness for One Direction – making elderly women feel young since 2010’.

My real problem is Geldof’s insistence on shaming Adele for not appearing on the track. “Adele is doing nothing,” said Geldof at the weekend. “She’s not answering the phone… she’s not writing. She’s not recording. She doesn’t want to be bothered by anyone. She won’t pick up the phone to her manager. She’s bringing up a family, you know.”

This is as condescending as the song itself – do Africans know it’s Christmas? Given that over 500 million people living there are Christians, we must presume the answer to that is yes – and worse, it is a form of bullying that has sneeringly been dressed up as do-gooding.

The message is loud and clear, even if the music isn’t: Geldof is here to save West Africa from Ebola, and Adele, with her peculiar un-celebrity desire to sod the limelight as she brings up a toddler, is a selfish little woman who must be publicly humiliated.

Later, we learnt that Adele had quietly made a private donation to Oxfam. But in the shallow, self-promoting world of celebrity, the simple and silent act of handing over money to charity is not the done thing – that’s what we impoverished plebs do.

Instead, the rich and famous donate their precious time, and for this they expect to be celebrated and congratulated, as if before they flashed their expensively whitened teeth in the video for a song, we had no idea that Ebola was a problem, or that thousands of Africans were spending their last days on this earth in unimaginable horror, bleeding from every orifice, unable even to be comforted by their family and loved ones.

“Give us your f***ing money,” was Geldof’s message way back when, and it is his message now – you all dig deep and give up your hard earned cash because these famous people who make millions singing songs have deigned to give up a few hours of their time on a weekend.

“We really can stop this… foul little plague,” said Geldof when he appeared on BBC Breakfast yesterday morning, with no mention of the Disasters Emergency Committee [http://www.dec.org.uk/], which has raised £20 million for the region, or Medecins sans Frontieres [http://www.msf.org.uk/?gclid=CPLOg4KxhsICFUr4wgodD1EA7g], who have been out there since March.

It’s not the troops deployed to Sierra Leone who are going to make a real difference – that honour will go to Geldof and his merry army of pop stars, even though they probably think a hazmat suit is a creation by a hot new designer.

Which all reminds me of something Noel Gallagher said during Live 8 nine years ago: “Correct me if I’m wrong, but are they hoping that one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick fifteen-minute break at Gleneagles and sees Annie Lennox seeing 'Sweet Dreams’ and thinks 'f**k me, she might have a point there, … we should really drop the debt, you know’. It’s not going to happen, is it?”

But anyone who refuses to go along with Geldof is pilloried or sworn at; so, when a Sky News presenter asked him a perfectly reasonable question yesterday morning about the tax practices of some of the artists featured on the song, his only answer was “it’s b******s”. This is the kind of response you might expect from a 21-year-old with a YouTube channel, but from a 63-year-old trying to engage the public in a subject as grave as Ebola, it just seems churlish. How can he expect us to take him seriously if he cannot behave in a serious manner himself?

Nobody wants a world full of Ebola, but nor do I want a world full of Malaria and HIV and Tuberculosis and numerous other diseases – not to mention conditions such as hunger and poverty - that are destroying the lives of many millions of Africans every day.

Certainly, I don’t want to be told how to behave philanthropically by a man worth an estimated £32 million, a man who is said to use tax avoidance schemes (it is telling that when a journalist asked him two years ago how much tax he paid, Geldof exploded at her, saying: 'My time? Is that not a tax?’ Well, no, Bob, it isn’t).

I don’t want to be implored to give charitably by a band that travels in separate private jets because they don’t get on ( One Direction [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/11235286/Band-Aid-30-Who-sang-which-line-in-pictures.html?frame=3107835] ), or by a man who avoids Irish taxes while simultaneously telling the Irish government to help developing countries (Bono).

“It really doesn’t matter if you don’t like this song,” said Geldof as he launched it, “what you have to do is buy this thing.” But do we? Really? If we don’t, does this make us unfeeling and uncaring, or does it mean that we have already donated money to the cause, or a different cause, even?

This, I think, is my main objection to Band Aid 30: it is all predicated on a belief that the British public are mean-spirited and uncharitable, when in actual fact nothing could be further from the truth. It’s time the likes of Geldof stopped asking us to give money, and like Adele, started donating some themselves. Charity, after all, begins at home.

The Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative is part of the international effort to control Ebola, educating local communities to prevent practices that spread the virus

Donate to The Telegraph Christmas Charity Appeal [https://telegraph.charitiestrust.org/telegraphappeal.aspx]

The spread of Ebola in West Africa has reached crisis point. Nearly 5,000 people have died and more than 13,000 people have been infected, while the number of unreported cases is expected to be at least double that. Nobody can say for certain how far it has, or will spread in the coming months. Reports that some areas are ''Ebola free’’ or that the danger is receding are regarded as premature by many public health experts. The US Centers for Disease Control has claimed there could be 1.4 million cases by January.

Currently hundreds of thousands of community care workers need to be trained across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – as well as 15 further “at risk” countries identified by the World Health Organisation – to bring the disease under control.

The Masanga Mentor Ebola Initiative has been created to meet the shortfall in training: a partnership formed between the UK-funded Masanga Hospital in Sierra Leone, and the Mentor Initiative, which is a British NGO, established in Liberia, with substantial training experience and contacts world-wide.

The network is led by British medical and aid specialists who have worked together for 20 years in humanitarian emergencies and are an established part of the international crisis effort already. The aim is to help educate communities across the region about infection control and to discourage practices, rituals and behaviours that are helping to spread the virus.

The training packages are being developed by healthcare workers on the ground and can be easily distributed, to even the most inaccessible rural locations across Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Training is focused on tablet-based interactive programmes that can be understood in local languages and make use of animation where adult literacy rates are low.

It will be delivered by local people, helping to rebuild the trust between healthcare workers and desperate communities that has been damaged in some areas.

Ebola survivors are key to managing the disease because they are believed to be immune. The partnership will work closely with survivors to help teach others in their community.

Currently the mortality rate is 70 per cent, but it is hoped through better education this can be halved.

The next few months are critical. By Christmas, training will be underway in Masanga Hospital and nine other partner hospitals (which represent 20 per cent of the primary healthcare in Sierra Leone), as well as the slums of Monrovia.

Beyond that, it will be rolled out across West Africa with lasting impact on the current epidemic, future outbreaks, and other infectious diseases.

Ebola diary: no touching, and a constant stink of chlorine

The fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone is a struggle of sweat, toil and burnt hands - but the people here have it worse

I reek of chlorine. Chlorine is the first thing I smell when I wake up and when I move I waft swimming pools … I’m beginning to wonder if I’ll ever smell of anything else. And yet it is a comforting smell as no damn filovirus is getting past my 1 in 10 chlorine. Chlorine is now a way of life in Sierra Leone – not only for those working directly with Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] patients, but at the door of every shop and café, even at road blocks. In fact, pretty much the whole of Freetown now smells of chlorine.

In the Isolation Unit at Connaught Hospital, the odour almost overpowers all the less sanitary smells that go with such sick patients. I have been learning the complicated and disciplined dance of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE), during which your hands get dunked in chlorine at least 10 times and often more frequently if you’re feeling particularly paranoid. This is great as each dunking feels like an added layer of protection against any lurking particles that might be lingering on your gloves – but chlorine burns are unexpected occupational hazard of the job. Yikes they sting!

Another unexpected hurdle for me has how hard I’ve found it adjusting to having no physical contact with anyone. When I first arrived and even now when I instinctively move towards someone to shake hands, or touch them on the elbow, welcoming smiles become slightly fixed grimaces and people ever so slightly recoil, as you would do from a snotty, overfriendly child, or a muddy dog. Some bolder types have worked around this by knocking elbows – a greeting termed an “Elbowla”. Dark humour is a saving grace here.

It is that humour and positivity that changes the world in the Isolation Unit from one of horrors to one in which I feel it is a privilege to work. I have been welcomed as a “Pikin Doctor” (Paediatrician) with huge smiles and laughter and now cries of “Hey Pikin Doctor” follow me through the hospital grounds. The enthusiasm of the welcome is a little unnerving. Yes, I am a paediatrician, but before arriving here my experience of managing children with Ebola was minimal (read non-existent). That said, we are all, as a community of health care workers, working out how best to manage this disease, so I’m in good company.

And working we certainly are. The gruelling physicality of shifts in the unit would put any boot camp to shame, and time off is mostly spent in writing protocols, making plans, debating what is and isn’t feasible in a setting such as ours, and reminding ourselves that we really should talk about something other than Ebola. I’ve only been here a few days and am pretty tired – my admiration is enormous for the local workers and those who’ve been here since the outbreak began.

However you only have to see one patient with Ebola to understand exactly why. It is a nightmarish disease altogether but what will always haunt me is the expressions of extreme terror of those dying of the disease. I’ve never seen anything like it before. They are suffering personified. Anything we can do to try to mitigate the horrors justifies any amount of sweat, toil and burnt hands.

Felicity Fitzgerald qualified as a doctor in 2006. She is paediatrician studying for a PhD in infectious diseases at the UCL Institute of Child Health. A month ago she volunteered to work in Freetown with the Kings Sierra Leone Partnership and is working at the Connaught Hospital Ebola Isolation Unit. This is her diary.

X Factor: Stevi is a nice enough guy, but it's unlikely that Sir Bob will be calling him up for Band Aid 40

Following last night's Big Band bonanza, Jay's X Factor dreams came to an end...

One hour of live primetime television, two very serious matters to clear up: the devastating spread of Ebola and the next act to be voted off X Factor.

Debuting this year’s Band Aid single on the results show was always going to feel a little jarring. How do you go from a harrowing clip of dying children to a Stevi Ritchie sing-off performance without one feeling a little trivial compared to the other? Well, you invite Sir Bob Geldof along, of course – four Band Aids in and, in the best possible way, he’s a dab hand at making you feel uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable and therefore more likely to part with cash for a good cause. It helps that the song is half-decent too – unlike the consciously noughties Band Aid 20, which featured a rap from Dizzee Rascal, this version sounds pretty true to the original – complete with Bono, as ever, stealing the best line. The fact that two acts on this year’s single found fame through X Factor – One Direction and Olly Murs – made its presence on the show feel a little more natural too.

Buy Olly Murs tickets here > [http://tidd.ly/7443a93f#nf]

The aforementioned Olly Murs does have rather a lot to answer for, though. The inexplicable ascent of an average-looking Essex call centre worker is surely what inspires people like Stevi Ritchie to audition for talent shows in the first place. With just four weeks to go until the live final, isn't it about time we dispensed of the novelty acts and let the ones who can actually sing get through?

Apparently not. Because tonight Stevi found himself in the bottom two for the first time – alongside Jay James, who narrowly avoided being voted off last week, against Paul Akister. Jay is the better singer, nobody disputed that, but because Mel B and Cheryl F-V like to wind Simon Cowell up (“I’m genuinely confused”, claimed Mel, despite telling Stevi “I just don’t get it” when he murdered his Big Band medley a mere 24 hours previously), they chose to keep Stevi in, which took the vote to deadlock once again. So, had the public voted for Jay, the handsome Welsh dad with the pleasant voice? Of course not – instead they’ve fallen for the self-styled cheeky chappy who bought you some risqué chocolates in last year’s office Secret Santa. Still, if Stevi finds himself in the bottom two again next week, it seems unthinkable that he would be kept in against any of the other remaining acts. Sure, he seems like a nice enough guy, but it's unlikely that Sir Bob will be calling him up for Band Aid 40.

I have so many problems with the latest Band Aid single that I don't really know where to begin, but begin we must so let's get going with the fact that most of the lineup are unrecognisable to anyone over 30 – not least Bono, who in the group photo looks as if he'd rather be anywhere else than at the feet of a YouTube vlogger (Zoella) and slightly to the left of a bloke who once lost The X Factor (Olly Murs).

Still, that's not really a bearing on the song – it's more a sign of how out–of–touch I am with popular culture: when I looked at the picture my thoughts were, "Gosh, it looks like a school photo on mufti day!", followed by "Thank goodness for One Direction – making elderly women feel young since 2010".

My real problem is Bob Geldof's insistence on shaming Adele for not appearing on the track. "Adele is doing nothing," said Geldof at the weekend. "She's not answering the phone… she's not writing. She's not recording. She doesn't want to be bothered by anyone. She won't pick up the phone to her manager. She's bringing up a family, you know."

This is as condescending as the song itself – let Africans know it's Christmas? Given that more than 500 million people in Africa are Christians, we must assume they are already aware of the concept – and, worse, it is a form of bullying dressed up as do–gooding. The message is clear, even if the music isn't: Geldof is here to save West Africa from Ebola, and Adele, with her peculiar desire to sod the limelight as she brings up a toddler, is a selfish little woman who must be publicly humiliated.

Later, we learnt that Adele had quietly made a private donation to Oxfam. But in the shallow, self–promoting world of celebrity, the simple and silent act of handing over money to charity is not the done thing – that's what we impoverished plebs do. Instead, the rich and famous donate their precious time, and for this they expect to be celebrated and congratulated, as if before they flashed their expensively whitened teeth in the video for a song, we had no idea that Ebola was a problem, or that thousands of Africans were spending their last days on earth in unimaginable horror, bleeding from every orifice, unable even to be comforted by their loved ones.

"Give us your f–––––– money," was Geldof's message way back when, and it is his message now – you all dig deep and give up your hardearned cash because these famous people who make millions singing songs have deigned to give up a few hours of their time on a weekend.

"We really can stop this… foul little plague," said Geldof when he appeared on BBC Breakfast yesterday, with no mention of the Disasters Emergency Committee, which has raised £20 million for the region, or Médecins sans Frontèries, that has been in the affected area since March. It's not the troops deployed to Sierra Leone who will make a real difference – that honour will go to Geldof and his merry army of pop stars, even though they probably think a hazmat suit is a creation by a hot new designer.

But anyone who refuses to go along with Geldof is pilloried or sworn at; so, when a Sky News presenter asked him a perfectly reasonable question about the tax practices of some of the artists taking part, he replied "it's b–––––––". This is the kind of response a 21–year–old with a YouTube channel might give, but from a 63–year–old trying to engage the public in a subject as grave as Ebola, it is churlish. How can he expect us to take him seriously if he cannot behave seriously himself?

I don't want a world full of Ebola, but nor do I want one full of HIV, malaria and numerous other diseases – not to mention hunger and poverty – that are destroying many millions of African lives. Certainly, I don't want to be told how to behave philanthropically by a man worth an estimated £32 million, a man who is said to use tax–avoidance schemes (it is telling that when a journalist asked him two years ago how much tax he paid, Geldof exploded at her, saying: "My time? Is that not a tax?" Well, no, Bob, it isn't). I don't want to be implored to give charitably by a band whose members travel in separate private jets amid rumours they don't get on (One Direction), or by a man who avoids Irish taxes while telling the Irish government to help developing countries (Bono).

"It really doesn't matter if you don't like this song," said Geldof as he launched it, "what you have to do is buy this thing." But do we? Really? If we don't, does this make us uncaring, or could it mean we have already donated to the cause, or a different cause, even?

This, I think, is my main objection to Band Aid 30: it is predicated on a belief that the British public are mean–spirited and uncharitable, when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. It's time the likes of Geldof stopped asking us to give money, and, like Adele, started donating some themselves. Charity, after all, begins at home.

Queen fears 'malaria comeback'

The Queen fears malaria will make a comeback because attention is being focussed on ebola

The Queen has expressed concern that malaria is not getting enough attention due to the Ebola outbreak, a medical professor has said.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was visiting foreign affairs think tank Chatham House in central London to launch a new leadership academy.

She met with Professor David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

According to him, she said: "After Ebola we will still have malaria."

He added: "She was very interested in Ebola because she said her doctor had told her that there were more people dying from malaria every week than are dying from Ebola - and he was right.

"She's afraid that malaria will have a comeback because of the fact people are not paying enough attention to it."

Prof Heymann said the Queen is correct because children with fever will have trouble being seen due to hospitals being occupied with Ebola sufferers.

He said there is "a great fear" that there will be an increase in deaths from common childhood diseases like malaria and diarrhoeal diseases.

He described the Queen as "very perceptive".

He added: "This should not detract attention from Ebola. It's a very terrible disease.

"But on the other hand what the Queen has done is call attention to other infectious diseases."

He added: "She asked a very piercing and important question which means that she has analysed clearly the world situation of disease and she's come to this conclusion which is the right conclusion."

A royal source said: "She was concerned that efforts to address Ebola should not detract from work to combat other health threats in West Africa."

During her visit, the Queen removed a brick from the wall between Chatham House - the Royal Institute of International Affairs - and neighbouring Ames House to symbolise the expansion next door.

The institute said it was creating The Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs to offer leaders the chance to develop skills to deal with major policy challenges and the critical issues facing the world.

Before unveiling a plaque to mark the occasion, the Queen, wearing a light green skirt and jacket, said: "I am delighted that the Royal Institute of International Affairs had launched this academy as it approaches its first centenary anniversary. I wish the institute every success for this new initiative."

The Queen has been patron of the Royal Institute of International Affairs since 1952.

In 2006, she listened to a debate at the institute under the famous Chatham House Rule which means the identity and affiliation of the speakers and participants cannot be revealed or reported in a bid to aid free discussion.

Smallpox, polio and HIV: the fights we're winning against infectious disease

Only one human disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated entirely. But great strides have been made against lots of other major killers

You are, probably, incredibly lucky. You are probably reading this in a developed country, and you are definitely reading this in the 21st century. And that means you almost certainly haven't got polio or diphtheria; you almost certainly haven't got malaria, or hookworm; you certainly haven't got smallpox.

The reason you haven't got those diseases is simple: the protective measures of modern medicine. In many cases, that means vaccination. the process of using weakened or related strains of a disease to, essentially, prepare the body's immune system to deal with the real thing has become a vital tool against disease - and has made huge strides towards eradicating some diseases altogether. But other methods have also contributed to mankind's extraordinary success in the fight against infectious disease.

Smallpox

Smallpox, in the 18th century, was a huge killer: 10 per cent of the British population died of the disease, rising to 20 per cent in urban areas; one in three deaths in childhood were caused by smallpox. Patients died of septicaemia or internal bleeding.

Then an English physician called Edward Jenner tested the folk theory that people were less likely to get smallpox if they had been exposed to cowpox, a related but far less deadly disease. He tested this through the (to modern eyes) wildly unethical means of infecting the eight-year-old son of his gardener with cowpox[http://www.jennermuseum.com/vaccination.html], and then, when he recovered, "variolating" him - exposing him to smallpox itself. The boy did not develop smallpox, on that occasion or on any of the subsequent occasions Jenner exposed him to the disease, so Jenner concluded that cowpox did indeed offer protection. (The word "vaccine" comes from the Latin "vaccus", cow)

Jenner's experiments began in 1796; he published his research in 1798. In 1853, after half a century of argument and opposition, vaccination against smallpox was made compulsory in Britain by an act of Parliament in 1853.

One hundred and twenty-seven years later, in 1980, the World Health Organisation declared that the disease eradicated, after no cases had been recorded anywhere in the world for more than two years. The virus now only exists in laboratory stocks. It is the only human disease to have been eradicated by deliberate human actions. (Rinderpest, a disease of cattle, has also been eradicated.)

Polio

The strides made against the spread of poliomyelitis, a virus which in a small minority of cases causes terrible muscle weakness, spread via faeces in drinking water. It was one of the leading causes of disability well into the 20th century, and as recently as 1980 there were still an estimated 400,000 cases worldwide. But thanks to a worldwide vaccination programme, and improved water sanitation, in 2013 there were just 385 recorded cases - and that is up from the previous year, when there were only 223.

While polio is down to a fraction of a percent of its earlier prevalence, getting rid of the last few cases has been extraordinarily difficult. This is partly due to religious opposition to vaccination, which some Muslim leaders have claimed is an American plot to sterilise Muslims[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/15/6/09-0087_article] .

Malaria

The "war" against malaria is far from won - it still kills between 500,000 and 2.7 million people a year, depending on whose estimates you trust. But simple measures, such as the handing out of insecticide-laced mosquito nets, have reduced its incidence remarkably, and it is entirely eradicated from the Western world: it used to be endemic in the southern United States, much of Europe, and even the marshes and fens of south-east England.

As Janet Hemingway, director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/11081271/Are-we-winning-the-war-against-mosquitoes.html] : "In a number of countries, we have won the battle already. It used to be in many more countries than it is today. We've pushed it back from the boundaries, we've pushed it back in Latin America; places such as Mexico, for instance, there's very little transmission going on. We've pushed it back from parts of Asia; Sri Lanka is almost malaria-free. Thailand is pretty much malaria-free, but used to have very high transmission." Even in the last few decades, malaria cases have dropped by 20 per cent. The world is, slowly, winning against this particular disease.

Guinea worm disease

The crippling disease Dracunculiasis is caused by a parasitic worm. The WHO had hoped to eradicate it by 1995, but is well behind schedule - although there is still huge success to report. In the last quarter century, the number of recorded cases has gone down from nearly 900,000 to just 148, and only five countries reported cases of the disease last year.

Measles

We don't tend to think of measles as a dangerous disease, and some idiots in Britain avoid vaccinating their children with the fantastically safe and effective MMR triple jab vaccine and, incredibly, even take their children to "measles parties" to get them infected with the actual virus. But as recently as 2005 it killed nearly 750,000 people worldwide[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/immunization/newsroom/news_wha_2010_measles_eradication/en/] . In just three years that number dropped to 164,000, according to the WHO, through the use of cheap vaccines - roughly $1 per child[http://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2014/nov/13/measles-eradication-plans-have-stalled-says-who] .

The WHO says, though, that progress has stalled [http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/wer/en/] : by 2012 the number had fallen as low as 122,000, but last year it popped back up to 145,000. The organisation blames that on the disease falling down the agenda as other, more dramatic outbreaks such as Ebola have taken centre stage. Meanwhile, in Britain, the unfounded panic over an entirely illusory link with autism led to a nearly 10-fold increase in the number of cases, although that number, mercifully, is dropping once more.

HIV/Aids

The UN wants to eradicate the HIV virus by 2030 [http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140721_galvanizing] . That is an extraordinarily ambitious goal - there are more than 35 million people infected with the virus worldwide,[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/gho/hiv/en/] and it causes about 1.6 million deaths per year. There is no vaccine; the best method to slow its spread is by changing human behaviour, to get people to use condoms, and that is notoriously difficult. What's more, the bulk of the cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, often in some of the poorest parts of the world, where it is hardest to get the education and supplies needed for a public health drive.

None the less, there has been huge success. According to the UN, there has been a 33 per cent drop in infections since 2001, and a 29 per cent drop in deaths[http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2571_AIDS_by_the_numbers_en_1.pdf] . Eradicating the disease in the next 15 years is probably not going to happen, but, as with almost all infectious diseases, humanity is moving, slowly and jerkily, in the right direction.

Bob Geldof urges everyone who has bought the Band Aid 30 single to "buy it again today" after it became the fastest-selling single of the year

Bob Geldof has greeted the news that the Band Aid 30 single has sold 206,000 copies by telling everyone who bought it to buy it again.

Downloads of Do They Know It’s Christmas? have so far raised £198,000 for Bob Geldof’s charity campaign to halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa, and it is the fastest-selling single of 2014. The figure is based on first-day sales and Sunday pre-orders.

The 1984 Band Aid single sold around 200,000 copies in its first two days (the Official Charts Company said it could not give exact figures for that time period).

However, the original raised more than three times as much money, as copies cost £3.50 whereas today's download costs 99p.

Hailing the sales as "incredible" and "beyond out wildest expectations", Geldof released a statement saying: "Here's todays ask. EVERYONE who bought the track yesterday BUY IT AGAIN TODAY!!!! Go. Go. Go UK!!! Keep buying this record and don't you DARE speak to anyone who has not bought it!! It's so cool living in this country at times like this. WOW!!!!"

He added: "Let's keep this thing going. We need to. Let's keep leading the world on this. Let's try and beat the record set by the first Band Aid. Harry, Ed, Sam, Rita, Ellie, Bono - all of us are watching you and how incredible you are. We challenged you and you responded beyond our wildest expectations."

Although the single cannot be downloaded twice onto the same device via iTunes, it can be "gifted" to a friend. It is also possible to pre-order a physical copy of the single, which is being released in two weeks' time.

The download was released at 8am on Monday morning. Geldof claimed that the campaign had already raised “a million quid” before its release after the video was shown on Sunday night’s edition of The X Factor.

A Band Aid 30 spokesman said the £1 million figure comprised text donations and pre-orders of the single.

The current total has not been disclosed but it is under £2 million.

This version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? is the fastest-selling single since the Military Wives’ 2011 Christmas number one, Wherever You Are.

GP walk-in clinic in Hereford sealed off as health chiefs confirm patient with history of travelling to West Africa tested for Ebola

An Ebola scare was sparked after a patient using a GP walk-in centre was tested for the killer virus.

The GP Access Centre, next to an Asda supermarket in Hereford, was sealed off on Monday afternoon.

Health chiefs confirmed a patient who had a history of travelling to West Africa was being tested for Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] .

A Public Health England spokesman said: "PHE can confirm it has received a sample for precautionary Ebola testing, involving an individual from Hereford County Hospital with a history of travel to West Africa.

"Ebola is considered very unlikely but testing is being done as a precaution.

"Based on the evidence-based risk assessment protocol, we are confident that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure there is no risk to public health.

"It is important to remember that as yet, there has never been a case of Ebola diagnosed in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person.

"We have advised all front line medical practitioners dealing with patients to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas. Following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing.

"Should there be a positive case in the UK, this information will be made available to the public."

Marie Williams, who was in the clinic when it was closed, said: "We were in there at the time and although my daughter has a potential life threatening condition if she is poorly they refused to give me any info on what had happened."

A spokesman for Primecare, which runs the service, said: "As a precautionary measure and in line with standard infection control guidelines the NHS health care centre in Belmont Road, Hereford has been closed after patient with a suspected infectious disease was seen.

"The patient has now been transported to hospital."

Asda confirmed the supermarket remained open and was not affected by the Ebola scare.

A spokeswoman said: "The store and the GP Access Centre are two separate entities with two different entrances.

"You do not have to walk through the store to enter the centre. We were informed about the closure but the supermarket remained open."

The centre, which is listed on the NHS website as being in the "Asda Building" was re-opened to patients on Monday afternoon.

Deaths from the current outbreak have now reached more than 5,000 in West Africa.

It became an instant hit when released by Sir Bob Geldof in time for the 1984 festive season, and now "Do They Know It's Christmas?" is getting a makeover to raise money for Ebola.

The original recording featured U2, Duran Duran and Paul McCartney and reached number one in the chart shows of 14 countries.

The song went platinum in the UK, selling more than 3.5 million copies over its 30-year lifetime.

It has been rerecorded this year to raise money to fight Ebola in west Africa and features a host of modern artists including Ed Sheeran and One Direction[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopreviews/11234107/band-aid-30-single-review-one-direction.html] .

India's Narendra Modi jokes that Tony Abbott “shirt-fronted” Australia by forcing the nation to sit through successive speeches by him, Xi Jinping and David Cameron

Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, jokingly accused Tony Abbott of “shirt-fronting” the Australian people after forcing them to put up with successive speeches in parliament by himself, Chinese president Xi Jinping and British prime minister David Cameron.

Drawing laughter and applause from the gathering of Australian MPs – including a healthy chuckle from Mr Abbott – Mr Modi drew on the Australian leader’s recent threat to “shirt-front” Vladimir Putin over the MH17 plane attack.

The term, used in Australian football and rugby league, describes aggressively grabbing an opponent or knocking them to the ground.

“I am the third head of government you are listening to this week,” he told Australia’s MPs.

“I don’t know how you are doing this. Maybe, this is prime minister Abbott’s way of shirt-fronting you! But, I am truly honoured and humbled by this opportunity to speak to you.”

Mr Cameron also used the term during his address last Friday, joking that he feared he would be “shirt-fronted” by Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, during a recent encounter with her in Italy.

“Only last month your foreign minister strode across the room towards me at a summit in Italy,” he said. “I wondered for a moment whether I was heading for what I am told we now need to call a 'shirt-fronting'!

"But no, Julie, who is a great friend of Britain, said that Australia would add 100 beds to our Ebola treatment facility in Sierra Leone — typical Australia, always there with action, not words.”

Mr Modi, Mr Xi and Mr Cameron were all in Australia for last weekend’s G20 summit in Brisbane and received personal invitations from Mr Abbott to address special sessions of parliament in Canberra.

During the G20 summit, the Australian media noted that Mr Abbott was largely cordial towards Mr Putin, even though Mr Putin dispatched naval vessels to Australia’s northern border in an apparent pre-emptive response.

However, Canada’s prime minister Stephen Harper offered his hand to Mr Putin and – according to his spokesman – said: “Well, I guess I’ll shake your hand, but I only have one thing to say to you: you need to get out of Ukraine.”

SIR – This week Matt Taylor, the Rosetta mission scientist, was criticised for wearing a T-shirt that many viewed as objectifying women. Boris Johnson was outraged[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/11234620/Dr-Matt-Taylors-shirt-made-me-cry-too-with-rage-at-his-abusers.html] at the reaction, but he should note that the bulk of the criticism came from individual scientists who were concerned that incidents of this kind may put off women and girls from entering science.

The physical sciences have a skewed gender ratio, largely because they are seen as “boys’ subjects”, but also because scientific establishments are often hostile work environments for women.

Dr Taylor appears sincere in his contrition and, more generally, has himself presented a welcome counterbalance to the unfortunate and inaccurate image of the dull, lab coat-clad scientist.

Dr Niall Deacon

St Albans, Hertfordshire

SIR – The reason for the shortage of engineers and scientists in Britain[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11204563/UKs-engineering-shortage-must-and-can-be-fixed.html] is that applied maths was replaced by pure maths at secondary level in the Seventies.

Applied maths uses maths to solve problems. It is essential to teaching and learning engineering and the sciences. Pure maths is the study of mathematical conundrums, with no practical application.

This short-sighted policy destroyed Britain’s engineering and scientific tradition and expertise and has produced two generations of mathematically illiterate adults. The skill shortages have had to be made up by migrant workers.

Applied maths should be reintroduced at secondary level and pure maths offered only at A-level and above.

Peter Wedderburn-Ogilvy

Froxfield, Hampshire

SIR – Margaret Stamper makes a valid point[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/11226027/Letters-Dont-underestimate-the-value-of-an-arts-degree.html] . In the late Sixties, when I was reading engineering at university, a lecturer expressed his opinion that most grammar school headmasters’ understanding of engineering was that each student, upon graduating, would receive a blue boiler suit and a chromium-plated oil can.

However, a far worse problem is the proliferation of people who describe themselves as engineers when they are nothing of the sort. The media and public’s exposure to this confuses people’s understanding of what it takes to become an engineer and what they actually do.

This often influences young people to avoid engineering, to the detriment of our nation.

John Farquhar

Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire

SIR – My brother, a professor of engineering, was attending an EU conference. His German counterpart, who was introduced as “Herr Doktor Professor”, asked him how his students referred to him. My brother’s reply was: “Bob.”

Claire McCombie

Woodbridge, Suffolk

</br>SIR – It is unfortunate to see discrimination appearing in the arena of sports again, after homophobic abuse was hurled at referee Nigel Owens[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/news/11230230/England-players-offer-their-backing-to-Nigel-Owens-after-fans-homophobic-insults-of-referee-at-Twickenham.html] during the England v New Zealand rugby match at Twickenham.

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) has an obligation to ensure that any such behaviour is swiftly dealt with. A person fearful of being subjected to abuse cannot enjoy equal opportunities, since it puts them off wanting to participate in the game. The RFU must send a clear message that abuse will not be tolerated at any level.

Michael Goitein

London EC2

</br>SIR – Michael Deacon’s defence of the BBC drama The Fall[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11228749/the-fall-bbc-2-murder-women-gillian-anderson.html] justifies the portrayal of sexual violence towards women by saying that it happens in today’s society, so it is acceptable to show it.

Dramas are for entertainment; they are not documentaries. We might also question to what extent the graphic depiction of these crimes stimulates and encourages those with the potential to commit them.

Tim Nixon

Braunton, Devon

</br>SIR – Why is it that some women cannot wait to attack other women over their child care decisions[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/11223218/As-a-stay-at-home-mum-Im-happier-than-Ive-ever-been.html] ?

The issues are not simple. I do admire those women who stay at home with their children, but I would probably have had a breakdown. Neither path is easy, but as my wise health visitor said to me, “It is good that you know yourself”. We need to stop vilifying each other and work towards a society that can truly offer women a choice.

Jacky Maggs

</br>SIR – Having been in the hospitality industry all of my working life, I can confirm that Bernard Powell is indeed in the minority[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/11221496/Letters-after-the-poppies-go-there-is-still-a-year-round-centre-of-remembrance.html]in thanking hotel staff he had never seen.

That said, last week I received a letter from a client of my hotel, thanking “those we never see in the kitchen and those who make our beds”. Perhaps he had read Mr Powell’s letter?

Eric Marsh

Hathersage, Derbyshire

</br>SIR – Horticulture is being portrayed as both unskilled and frivolous as regards the pollarding of lime trees in New Palace Yard[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11231986/MPs-criticised-for-picking-leaves-off-Parliaments-trees-because-it-is-cheaper-than-raking-them-up.html] .

This is a necessary part of the trees’ maintenance in order to keep their shape and size. As a professional horticulturist it saddens me to see such a negative response to the craft.

Andrew Hellman

Tollesbury, Essex

SIR – While I have every sympathy for Annabel Honeybun, the poor “Westminster stripper” employed to remove the leaves, I’m not surprised if the choice of planting isn’t to everyone’s taste.

An avenue of mature lime trees may have a sonorous effect, but a pleached lime allée has long been regarded as a labour-intensive foreign import. Popularised in this country by Sir Walter Scott, it’s a rather grand garden feature that has gone in and out of fashion ever since.

Sadly, there’s no sign of oak outside the House of Commons. Keats’s “green-robed senators” have been relegated back to the forest, it seems.

Carol Lofthouse

London W4

</br>SIR – Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, promises longer sentences for those who are involved in assaults while in custody.

Surely this will only add to the problem of overcrowding. A far better approach would be to question why such violence occurs. It could be due to pure frustration at the long hours prisoners are locked up, or because courses are continually cut.

Prisoners should have the chance to learn new skills so that they leave with some sense of purpose. Lengthy confinement in a small space only results in boredom and resentment.

G H Crampton

Kingsbridge, Devon

</br>SIR – Failure to manage human rights issues in complex supply chains could pose significant risks to investors.

Consequently, we call on the Government to ensure that the Modern Slavery Bill, which is being debated this week, makes certain requirements of those who manage supply chains. They must provide evidence of a process for identifying human rights risks, highlight which parties have been involved in this assessment, and detail the actions taken to address those risks, alongside appropriate sanctions. Listed companies should consider the issue as part of their annual reports to shareholders.

</br>SIR – I could not disagree more profoundly with Professor Krashen’s letter[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/11223550/Letters-Tories-scored-an-own-goal-with-European-Arrest-Warrant-pandemonium.html]on language learning among older children and adults.

The greatest weight of evidence suggests that if children do not acquire a language in their early years, it is much more difficult to do so later on. The Department for Education has recently added credence to this by reducing the age for learning a foreign language in the national curriculum to seven (Key Stage 2). My concern is that even this is too late.

Unfortunately the current policy is already under threat, due to a lack of sufficiently well qualified language teachers at Key Stage 2.

Dr Carol Hayes

Staffordshire University

</br>The Government must sort out its aid priorities

SIR – I agree wholeheartedly with William Pender that enshrining overseas aid in law is ludicrous[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/11231535/Letters-A-new-Gatwick-runway-is-the-best-option-for-the-public-and-politicians.html] . However, I disagree equally with his contention that such aid ought to be provided only when “it is in Britain’s vital interest”.

While many estimable British charities do a superb job across the globe, there are some situations – the latest being the dreadful Ebola crisis – where government resources are essential. I am proud that our government has sent experts from the British military to assist and I do not begrudge a penny of the taxpayers’ money involved. Indeed, I would be happy to see far more spent in this area.

What I do not want is any of my tax going in “aid” to countries whose governments spend billions on nuclear weapons and space programmes; and I certainly do not want a fixed percentage of Britain’s GDP spent on overseas aid purely for the sake of attaining an arbitrary target.

John Waine

Nuneaton, Warwickshire

SIR – Mr Pender does not go far enough.Instead of sending funds overseas, they should be made available to the industrial and commercial markets in Britain to construct and supply that which is needed by recipient countries, such as hospitals, housing, water treatment and roads.

Thus British workers, British taxpayers and the overseas countries will all be satisfied and the problems of the current system reduced considerably.

Howard Rigg

Ponteland, Northumberland

</br>Jam-packed

SIR – Our health service is struggling, there’s a shortage of housing, the roads are congested, the electricity supply is just about coping, schools are full to bursting; and Greencore wants to import 300 people[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11220116/Sandwich-company-seeks-employees-from-Hungary.html] to make sandwiches.

I recently attended a cremation service when, after the curtain had been drawn and Sinatra had entertained the assembled, there was an outburst of applause. I’m not sure whether it was for Ol’ Blue Eyes or in the hope that the recently departed would oblige with an encore. The curtain remained closed.

BOB GELDOF'S efforts to promote the new Band Aid single were curtailed when he refused to stop swearing during a live television interview, forcing producers to cut him off.

Faced with criticism of the record, which is raising funds for the fight against Ebola, Geldof twice responded with the word "b––––––s".

In the midmorning interview on Sky News, Geldof was asked for his response to critics who claim that some of the millionaire pop stars appearing on the record are tax avoiders. "There are a lot of detractors saying, 'Look at a lot of those people in that room; if they all paid their taxes in the right way we wouldn't need these kind of fundraising singles'," Jayne Secker, the presenter, said.

"I think they're talking b––––––s," Geldof replied. After an uncomfortable silence, the presenter admonished: "Pretty colourful language. If you could not use any more, we'd appreciate it." But asked to respond "less colourfully" to accusations that the record is patronising to Africans, Geldof said: "Complete and utter b––––––s." The interview was suspended, with Secker telling viewers: "I'm afraid we have to apologise for that language again, and there we have to leave it." The reworking of the Do They Know It's Christmas? single, first recorded in 1984, has already raised more than £1million in sales and pre–orders.

It is top of the iTunes chart in 48 countries and is expected to be number one in the official chart on Sunday. The video received more than 120,000 views on YouTube in eight hours.

Carla Bruni, France's former first lady, is to record a French version.During the original LiveAid concert Geldof gave an infamous interview appealing for donations, in which he swore, saying "F––– the address, let's get the numbers". It has gone down in folklore that he told the audience to "give us your f–––––– money".

Doctor is second Ebola victim to die in America

A DOCTOR from Sierra Leone has died of Ebola in a Nebraska hospital, becoming the second victim of the virus to die in the United States.

Dr Martin Salia had been working in his home country when he contracted the virus and was evacuated to the US at the request of his American wife.

He arrived at the Nebraska Medical Centre, one of four hospitals intended as a bulwark against an Ebola outbreak in the US, on Saturday but was already in a critical condition. Medical staff fought to save his life but his death was announced yesterday.

"It is with an extremely heavy heart that we share this news," said Dr Phil Smith, director of the biocontainment unit where the 44–year–old was being treated. "Dr Salia was extremely critical when he arrived here, and unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we weren't able to save him."

Dr Salia was the 10th person to be treated for Ebola in the US. Only one other patient, a Liberian man who arrived in Texas unaware that he was carrying the virus, has died. The eight others have all made full recoveries.

Dr Salia was a legal resident of the US and had two children with his wife, Isatu, who lives in Maryland.

The US State Department agreed to organise his evacuation from West Africa after his wife said she would reimburse the government for the cost.

Dr Salia first began to show symptoms of Ebola early this month, but an initial test for the virus came out negative, according to the Washington Post.

A week later, after his symptoms returned, he took a second test which showed he had been infected.

He had worked at the United Methodist Kissy Hospital outside Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, for three years.

A total of 5,177 people across eight countries have been killed by Ebola in the latest outbreak, according to the World Health Organisation.

World is running out of chocolate, producer warns

THE world may be running out of chocolate, leading confectioners have warned, as demand continues to outpace the rate of production and push up prices.

Barry Callebaut, the world's largest chocolate manufacturer, is the latest company to express concerns of a global cocoa shortage by 2020. In its annual results, the Zurich–based company said it sold 1.72m tonnes of chocolate in the year to August 31, an 11.8pc increase on the previous year.

This demand, and a combination of bad weather, fears of Ebola and crop disease, had driven cocoa prices up by 25pc from £1,600 per tonne to more than £2,000 per tonne. If the trend continued, the price of a chocolate bar could soon become unsustainable, it said.

Two years ago, Fiona Dawson, the then president of Mars Chocolate UK, also warned the industry might be in trouble.

Despite the "slight surplus" recorded by Barry Callebaut this year, so–called chocolate deficits, where cocoa demand outstrips supply, are becoming the industry norm. Last year the International Cocoa Organization said it expected cocoa use to exceed output by 70,000 tonnes, reaching 1m tonnes by 2020.

Band Aid 30: Let's not forget Paula Yates - the woman who inspired it all

As Bob Geldof rallies the latest pop stars to release a reworked version of Band Aid, many have turned their thoughts to his late wife - Paula Yates - the woman who inspired his humanitarian work. Claire Cohen reports

As rock stars, boy bands, YouTube vloggers and one original cast member (Bono, of course) come together to record a new version of Band Aid – exactly 30 years after the first charity single stormed the charts - there’s one notable absence.

Paula Yates, Bob Geldof’s partner of 20 years and the mother of three of his children, (four if you count Tiger Lily, Yates’ daughter with INXS singer Michael Hutchence) tragically died 14 years ago, on September 17, 2000.

Yet it was she who many consider to have been the brains behind the original Band Aid. And it was she who became the driving force that inspired (and helped) Geldof to rally the most famous pop stars of the Eighties to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.

This time round the target is Ebola. Africa remains at the heart of Geldof’s mission to feed the world.

Indeed, such is his conviction that Chancellor George Osborne has even agreed to waive VAT on sales of the single - a reworked version of Do They Know It's Christmas? - so that every penny will go towards helping the charity effort.

Yates would no doubt be proud.

But where – many have wondered aloud – was the rock journalist and TV presenter’s name this week?

For (as Geldof freely admitted in his book Is That It?) it was Yates who inspired the Geldof household to humanitarian work.

The catalyst was Michael Buerk’s now infamous and unflinching dispatch from Ethiopa, as shown on the six o’clock news, which lifted the curtain on the desperate situation in Africa. Yates found the report so distressing that she had to leave the room, in tears, half way through.

The next morning, a note appeared on the family fridge and a tin above it: ‘Ethiopa. Everyone who visits this house from today onwards will be asked to give £5 until we have raised £200 for famine relief’.

Friends remember this as typical Yates – she was the domestic heart of the household; Geldof more attuned to the world stage.

But it was she, with her career in music journalism, who made many of the contacts Geldof so dearly neeed for the original Band Aid to work.

Indeed, backstage at Live Aid - a year later in the summer of 1985 - many of the pop stars involved reminisced about having been asked to perform on the single by Yates [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1493268/How-apt-it-is-for-this-man-shaped-by-the-loss-of-his-mother-and-wife-to-become-a-crusader.html] .

One only has to look at her wedding photo to Geldof [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2133720/From-riots-rock-royalty-How-photographer-went-capturing-conflicts-snapping-musics-biggest-stars.html] to see her surrounded by what amounts to the cast of Band Aid - her adoring coterie - inclduing David Bowie, the Kemp brothers, George Michael, Simon Le Bon and Tony Hadley. In one image, they even pretend to weep - presumably at their loss; Geldof's gain.

What's more, it was Yates who put Geldof in touch with his Band Aid partner Midge Ure – he just happened to be appearing on TV show The Tube (which she presented with Jools Holland) the night he'd first come up with the idea to put out a charity single.

Yates, of course, appears fleetingly in the original Band Aid video. It went on to raise £8m within a few weeks of its release in 1984. Last night, a few minutes after its TV premiere during the X-Factor, the latest version had already raised more than £1m and shot to the top of the iTunes chart.

Little wonder, then, that Yates's friends took to social media to remember her.

Twitter: Josephine Fairley - Let's not forget who first had idea to raise money for Africa - & inspired Bob... #BandAid30 [https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23BandAid30]: Josephine Fairley - Let's not forget who first had idea to raise money for Africa - & inspired Bob... #paulayates [https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23paulayates]: Josephine Fairley - Let's not forget who first had idea to raise money for Africa - & inspired Bob... http://t.co/7n35g5MLV2 [http://t.co/7n35g5MLV2]: Josephine Fairley - Let's not forget who first had idea to raise money for Africa - & inspired Bob...

Fairley, who was Yates's best friend and godmother to Peaches, told me: “I just wanted her important, inspirational role to be remembered.”

There are many today, who feel just the same way.

Global demand for chocolate is outpacing the rate of cocoa production. By 2020, the world could see a chocolate deficit of 1m tonnes

The world could be running out of chocolate, leading confectioners have warned, as soaring demand continues to outpace the lagging rate of production, pushing up the price of chocolate.

Barry Callebaut, the world’s largest chocolate manufacturer, is the latest candy giant to express concerns of rising prices and a global cocoa shortage by 2020.

In its annual results, the Zurich-based company said that growing demand had led it to sell 1.72m tonnes of chocolate in the year to August 31, an 11.8pc increase on the 1.54m tonnes sold in the previous year.

This demand, along with a combination of bad weather, Ebola fears and a crop disease, drove cocoa prices up by 25pc from £1,600 per tonne to more than £2,000 per tonne.

If this trend continues, the price of a chocolate bar could soon become unsustainable -- and Barry Callebaut is not the first major chocolate manufacturers to say so.

In a lecture in 2012, Fiona Dawson, who was at the time the president of Mars Chocolate UK, warned that the chocolate industry could be in trouble[http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Ingredients/Mars-urges-action-on-cocoa-to-beat-shortage] .

“The global cocoa sector may suffer a one-million tonne shortage by 2020 because of the increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms,” Ms Dawson said. “It’s just not sustainable.”

Despite the “slight surplus” recorded by Barry Callebaut this year, so-called chocolate deficits, where cocoa demand outstrips supply, is becoming the industry norm[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/15/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-maker-says-were-running-out-of-chocolate/] .

Last year, the International Cocoa Organization said it expected cocoa use to surpass output by 70,000 tonnes. That deficit is expected to reach 1m tonnes by 2020, and could hit 2m tonnes by 2030.

Lauren Bandy, food analyst at Euromonitor International, told The Telegraph, “When it comes to cocoa, the general rule of thumb is that demand outstrips supply and this has been the case for the last few years although 2013/14 has actually seen a 40,000 tonne surplus."

This widening gap is partly due to slowing supply. A disease called Frosty Pod Rot has ruined about a third of the world’s cocoa crop, while a drought in Ivory Coast and Ghana -- which account for 70pc of global cocoa production -- has hurt farming in West Africa. Relatedly, cocoa farmers have started looking for more lucrative means of income, such as corn and rubber production.

Meanwhile, global chocolate demand is soaring. Asian and Middle Eastern markets can’t get enough of the stuff, and chocolate’s five largest markets -- the US, the UK, Russia, Germany and France -- continue to grow.

“China and India now have a very sweet tooth and so increased demand for cocoa from this region has been putting pressure on global supply,” Ms Bandy said. She added that Western tastes for dark chocolate, which uses more cocoa than regular milk chocolate, are also fueling the rise in cocoa prices.

Let’s not get carried away. Hamish Smith, commodities economist at Capital Economics, told The Telegraph, “Even with rising demand, according to International Cocoa Organisation data, the aggregate cocoa bean deficit over the last ten years has only been 22,000 tonnes.”

Ms Smith added, “But of course, with more than half of the world’s cocoa production coming from Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana, there is always a risk that falling output in the two leading producers could lead to global shortages of cocoa beans.”

Warnings such as those from Barry Callebaut and Mars echo similar sentiments from other industry giants.

A study commissioned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011 found that climate change could lead to cocoa shortages[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/8965683/Chocolate-will-become-an-expensive-luxury-item-due-to-climate-change.html]and turn chocolate into a more expensive, luxury item.

Angus Kennedy, editor of trade magazine Kennedy's Confection, has also spoken out on the matter. He said last year that the chocolate bar of the future will be sludgy in texture and sweeter in taste[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chocolate-could-run-out-2020-2913505], as cheaper ingredients such as sugar and vegetable oil will be used instead of the more expensive cocoa.

“I have tasted the chocolate bar of the future and it’s nothing like the chocolate we know and love,” said Mr Kennedy, who predicted that the world’s supply of cocoa beans would run dry by 2020.

London chocolatier Marc Demarquette told the Independent in 2010 that the £1 chocolate bar “will be a thing of the past”. In the same article, John Mason of the Ghana-based Nature Conservation Research Council said that “ in 20 years, chocolate will be like caviar[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/chocolate-worth-its-weight-in-gold-2127874.html] . It will become so rare and expensive that the average Joe just won’t be able to afford it.”

It is top of the iTunes chart and all but certain to be number one on Sunday. The video had over 120,000 views on YouTube in its first eight hours, although it is not known how many of those viewers followed a link to donate.

Ebola is not black magic. It is a virus than can and should be contained

I’m writing this somewhere over Morocco[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/morocco/] and my stomach is tied in little knots of excitement and just a hint of trepidation. I’m en route to join the King's Sierra Leone Partnership which is currently running the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] Isolation Unit in Connaught Hospital, Freetown. After a year of happily living in PhD-land, which has mostly involved wrestling with pipettes, I’m hurling myself into the biggest outbreak ever of a virus the very name of which makes people blanch. Bonkers. Clearly.

And yet there really isn’t anywhere else in the world I should be. I’ve always hero worshipped those who volunteered for Medecins Sans Frontieres and similar crisis response NGOs, and wondered if I‘d have the guts to go myself. Furthermore this is my field: bugs, viruses, bacteria, fungi, other disgusting parasites and the war we wage on them. I’m single, with no kids – my only dependants being my pot plants, and I am not currently on a clinical rota, which would tie me into working set times in a hospital. I knew my family would be supportive, albeit rather anxiously. This was what struck me two months ago when I initially thought of volunteering: who else should be staffing these treatment centres but people like me? This is potentially one of the most important events in the field of infectious diseases that will occur in my lifetime.

This is not to say that when the idea first came to me it wasn’t also associated with a hearty dose of fear. One of my colleagues asked me if I felt like I was “going over the top”. But the more I read and understood about Ebola, the less scared I became. This is a virus after all, not black magic. A horrific virus that has been laying waste to three countries, but a virus that can and should be contained. This is the resounding message I’ve heard from health care workers currently in country and those returning. We have to scale up treatment centres, both to offer effective care to sufferers and crucially to separate those infected from uninfected. Every day that there are Ebola victims unable to access a treatment centre is a day the virus will win. But the overriding mood among those working in the outbreak is not one of despair or fear, but of a huge energy and determination to get things done. There is so much to do and to understand about the virus and its manifestations: who is more severely infected, what is the best method of providing fluids (via drip or orally), whether there may be some protective factors … the list goes on.

The weeks ahead will be gruelling, heartbreaking, and hugely physically demanding – I’m sure I will live to regret a facetious comment that my hot yoga addiction would prepare me for the sweatbox of personal protective equipment. That said, I know I will hate leaving in five weeks and be eager to return as soon as I can possibly swing it. Sorry Mum.

Felicity Fitzgerald qualified as a doctor in 2006. She is paediatrician studying for a PhD in infectious diseases at the UCL Institute of Child Health. A month ago she volunteered to work in Freetown with the Kings Sierra Leone Partnership and is working at the Connaught Hospital Ebola Isolation Unit. This is her diary.

Band Aid 30 uses Zoella the vlogger to spread the message

The charity Christmas single to raise money to fight Ebola uses vloggers to help promote the track

It was first written 30 years ago, but it appears Band Aid has moved firmly into the 21st century as it signs up its first ever "vloggers" to spread its message to the internet generation.

Internet stars including blogger Zoella Sugg are to appear on the Band Aid 30 single, as Sir Bob Geldof and his team look to capture the attention of social media-obsessed teenagers.

YouTube sensations Zoella, her brother Joe and Alfie Deyes, have more than 12 million subscribers between them, and will sing on the chorus of Do They know It's Christmas?, making them the first non-musicians ever to take a starring role in the song's four incarnations.

The vloggers are expected to give the song more global exposure to a teenage audience than ever before, with their loyal followers likely to propel the single to number one.

The trio will sing on the chorus of the track, which is released on Monday and will raise money to combat Ebola.

The final version, which was finished in the studio at 4.20am on Sunday, was premiered during the X Factor results show, just days after the line-up was announced.

Its final format is said to be a surprise even to the singers involved, with a source claiming they were not told which lines they would end up singing until the final moments before release.

It features stars including One Direction, Coldplay's Chris Martin, Emeli Sande and Seal, and has been put together once again by Sir Bob Geldof, Midge Ure and Bono.

Notable absences include singer Adele, and David Bowie, who had been invited to record as a guest of honour. Last week, Sir Bob disclosed he had personally asked the Bowie to reprise his introduction to the song, which has been released in 1984, 1989, 2004 and 2014 with different line-ups.

At the time the single and video were played, the reclusive singer had not signed up.

Foals, who were originally announced on the line-up, did not take part in the end, with a spokesman saying it had not been logistically possible and that the band had not been invited in time.

Rita Ora and Sam Smith have sung on the record but were not included in the studio picture due to schedule clashes.

One Direction, the boy band, have been given the famous opening lines, and are followed by the likes of Ed Sheeran, Bastille, Ellie Goulding, Clean Bandit, Olly Murs, Sinead O'Connor, Jessie Ware, Angelique Kidjo, and Paloma Faith.

Fans of the previous version of the charity single have already expressed their surprise at the inclusion of the vloggers, who are not famed for their musical talent.

Responding to critics online, Zoella said: "If you were asked to help raise awareness and money for Ebola by Bob Geldof would you seriously say no?"

Alfie Deyes described the recording session as "the most surreal day of my entire life", adding: "I'm so thankful to be involved with @BandAid30! Let's make a real change."

Their involvement will be considered quite a departure for the Band Aid phenomenon.

Despite their influence on YouTube, Sir Bob has already implored fans not to seek out the single for free online but to ensure they bought it.

Announcing the charity single, which will raise money for the fight against Ebola in West Africa, last week, he said: “What I really want to stress is that this free music thing does not work for us at all.

"Like I said 30 years ago, it really doesn’t matter if you don’t like this song. It really doesn’t matter if you hate the artists. It really doesn’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording. What you have to do is buy this thing.

“Don’t download it [free]. Don’t just look at YouTube. Pay for everything.”

Damon Albarn struck a blow against the charity single, questioning whether it was a suitable way of tackling the Ebola crisis.

He told Channel 4 news[http://www.channel4.com/news/damon-albarn-band-aid-africa-music-blur-frontman-video] : "There are problems with our idea of charity, especially these things that suddenly balloon out of nothing and then create a media frenzy where some of that essential communication is lost.

"It starts to feel like it's a process where if you give money you solve the problem, and really sometimes giving money creates another problem."

When he was told there was just one African-born performer on the track, he replied: "That's great, just a few more would be nice and also maybe go there - all those people who are making that."

Carla Bruni to do French Band Aid song

Former French first lady to record French version of Band Aid song

France's former first lady, the singer and ex-supermodel Carla Bruni, is to record the French version of the Band Aid song to raise money for the fight against Ebola.

"I have asked Carla Bruni to do it in France, to translate it into French, so they're going next," the project's founder, Bob Geldof, told the BBC.

Bruni's agent confirmed her involvement to The Telegraph. Reports said that the wife of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy was planning to record the single with French groups that include Daft Punk.

Geldof said a German version was also in the works but criticised Germany for not doing enough to help fight the deadly virus whose current outbreak was first reported in March and has killed more than 5,000 people, almost all in West Africa.

"The Germans aren't doing enough, frankly. Obviously the French have sent their troops to help in Guinea and of course the British, the squaddies are down in Sierra Leone," said the Irish singer.

"The Germans are the most powerful economy in Europe. They are laggards and they shouldn't be.

"It's as dangerous for them as it is for us. This thing is a flight away from us," he said.

One Direction, Bono and Chris Martin are among the artists who feature in the video for the new Band Aid song which was shown for the first time on British television on Sunday.

The song was made available to download on Monday, with a CD version to be released three weeks from now. A US version is also planned.

Bruni, 46, has relaunched her stage career since her conservative husband was defeated in the 2012 presidential election by the Socialist François Hollande, and last year released her latest album titled Little French Songs.

She is paid more than two million euros (£1.6 million) a year as the face of the Italian jewellery brand, Bulgari.

Bruni, who married Mr Sarkozy in 2008 just months after he divorced his second wife Cecilia, continued recording music while she served as first lady but largely gave up stage appearances during her five-year stint as first lady.

Channel 4, 8.00pm

In the same vein as last week's interactive show, How Rich Are You?, the current–affairs programme here turns to matters of personal finance. The Spectator's editor and Telegraph columnist, Fraser Nelson, leads this report on a new inequality betwee the haves and have–nots in post–recession Britain and looks at the widening gap between the richest and the poorest members of society.

This film documents the experience of British–born doctor Javid Abdelmoneim, as he works at a treatment centre in Sierra Leone. Giving an insight into the lives of those with the viral disease and their families, it's worth watching, especially for the uplifting moments when cured patients get to leave the centre.

'Vloggers' become first non–musicians to feature on Christmas charity single as Bob Geldof tries to win over their millions of teenage fans

THEY are not noted for their singing, have never released a single and hardly anyone over the age of 21 will have heard of them, but three YouTube "vloggers" yesterday took their place alongside some of the world's biggest pop stars in the latest incarnation of Band Aid.

Bob Geldof sought to spread the charity single's message to the internet generation by signing up Zoella – real name Zoe Sugg – her brother, Joe, and her boyfriend, Alfie Deyes, to sing on the chorus of this year's version of Do They know It's Christmas? The trio, who have close to 13million YouTube subscribers between them, are the first non–musicians to take a starring role in the song, which was first released in 1984. The vloggers are expected to give the song more global exposure than ever before, and it is hoped that their loyal followers will help to propel the single, which will raise money to combat Ebola, to number one.

The final version, which was finished in the studio at 4.20am yesterday and is released today, was premiered last night during The X Factor results show.

Its final format is said to be a surprise even to the singers involved, with a source claiming they were not told which lines they would end up singing until the last minute.

It features more established stars including One Direction, Coldplay's Chris Martin, Emeli Sandé and Seal, and has been put together once again by Geldof, Midge Ure and Bono.

Notable absences include the singer Adele, who was said to have ignored pleas for her to participate. Last week, Geldof disclosed he had asked David Bowie to reprise his introduction to the song, which has been released in 1984, 1989, 2004, but the reclusive singer had yet to respond.

Foals, who were originally announced on the line–up, did not take part, while Rita Ora and Sam Smith sang on the record but were not included in the studio picture because of schedule clashes. One Direction, the boy band, were given the famous opening lines. Fans of the previous version of the charity single have already expressed their surprise at the inclusion of the vloggers.

Responding to critics online, Zoella, 24, a beauty and fashion blogger, said: "If you were asked to help raise awareness and money for Ebola by Bob Geldof would you seriously say no?" Deyes, 21, who runs the Pointless blog and YouTube channel in which he shares his seemingly random thoughts with fans, described the recording session as "the most surreal day of my entire life", adding: "I'm so thankful to be involved with @BandAid30! Let's make a real change."

Their involvement, along with that of Zoella's brother, who specialises in online pranks, represents a considerable departure for the Band Aid phenomenon. Despite their influence on YouTube, on which users do not have to pay to watch videos, Geldof has already implored fans not to seek out the single free of charge online but to ensure they buy it.

He added: "Like I said 30 years ago, it really doesn't matter if you don't like this song. It really doesn't matter if you hate the artists. It really doesn't matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording. What you have to do is buy this thing."

Premature birth plays a part in four infant deaths in 10

PREMATURE birth kills more under–fives globally than anything else, and is now responsible for four out of 10 deaths of children under school age in Britain.

Of the estimated 6.3million deaths worldwide of children under the age of five in 2013, complications from preterm births accounted for nearly 1.1million deaths, according to findings published in The Lancet.

The UK has one of the highest rates of death as a result of premature birth in Western Europe, alongside Serbia, Slovenia, Denmark, Switzerland and Poland.

In 2013, the mortality rate for under–fives in the UK was 4.9 deaths per 1,000 – more than double the rate of 2.4 per 1,000 in Iceland, the country with the lowest rate.

Child death rates across the world have been falling since 1990. But in the UK the rate has slowed, and the decline between 2000 and 2013 was half that seen between 1990 and 2000.

Last year, 3,800 under–fives died in the UK, and around 1,400 were premature, around 38 per cent of all deaths of under–fives.

It is believed that the rise in the number of women choosing to give birth in their late 30s and early 40s is partially responsible for the increase.

In England and Wales, 9.5 per cent of premature births are to mothers aged 40 and over compared with 6.9 per cent in mothers aged 20–24. Poverty and smoking in pregnancy also increase the risk.

"This marks a turning of the tide, a transition from infections to neonatal conditions, especially those related to premature births, and this will require entirely different medical and public health approaches," said Dr Joy Lawn, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

Dr Lawn is a member of the study's research team and an adviser to Save the Children.

"The success we've seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth," she said.

Since 2000, the worldwide mortality rate of children aged under five has declined dramatically, from 76 to 46 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013, an annual reduction rate of 3.9 per cent.

The prevention of deaths from pneumonia, diarrhoea, measles, HIV and tetanus has had the most impact in reducing child mortality.

In contrast, global preterm mortality rates have declined at only two per cent annually, and have slightly risen in the UK from 36 per cent to 38.7 per cent.

For the first time in history, the complications of preterm birth outrank all other causes as the world's number one killer of young children.

Some of the highest rates of preterm deaths are in West Africa, particularly in the countries which have been struck by Ebola, where the risk will now be even higher given the medical challenges faced in those countries, notably Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Four large research projects have begun to discover the unknown causes of premature birth and find effective ways to prevent or delay preterm births. Precisely what triggers the start of labour before a pregnancy runs to term remains a mystery. More than half of premature births occur spontaneously.

One research project is working to identify the source of the electric signals that initiate labour to discover whether the process is triggered by mother or foetus.

Researchers are also studying how poverty, nutrition, pollution, stress and other factors may play a role.

Risk factors linked to premature births include obesity and high blood pressure. These also are risk factors for both stillbirths and birth defects.

Today, Britain will join more than 200 countries holding events for World Prematurity Day.

Passengers from Mali will face additional screening at US airports as Ebola surgeon in Nebraska remains in a critical condition

The US authorities have added Mali to the countries whose passengers will face additional screening.

Enhanced measures will come into force today, the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and the Department of Homeland Security said in a joint statement.

Mali will join Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia as countries from which passengers will face additional restrictions.

“The CDC recommended this measure because there have been a number of confirmed cases of Ebola in Mali in recent days, and a large number of individuals may have been exposed to those cases.”

Travellers will be subject to three weeks monitoring, which will include taking their temperature twice a day, watching out for symptoms such as fever and vomiting as well as liaising with the local medical authorities.

Even though there are no direct flights between the USA and Mali, passengers whose journey originated from the west African country will be routed through five airports which specialise in screening.

Special teams are in place at JFK airport, New York; Dulles in Washington, O’Hare airport, Chicago; Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta and Newark.

Mali has been a source of concern since the death of an Imam, who had entered the country from neighbouring Guinea, last month.

Although he was never tested there were a string of Ebola deaths in the weeks that followed including that of a nurse who treated him and a woman who washed his body.

Authorities in the country are trying to track down more than 400 people who could have been in contact with those who died of Ebola.

In all the latest outbreak of Ebola has claimed more than 5,000 lives in a number of west African countries.

In America one patient, Thomas Duncan, a Liberian has also died of the disease. However a number of other sufferers, including several doctors, have been successfully treated.

The latest, Craig Spencer was declared free of the disease last week.

But the condition of Dr Martin Salia, a Sierra Leone surgeon, who arrived in the US on Saturday is causing increasing concern.

The 44-year-old doctor is being treated at a special unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha.

A spokesman for the hospital said he was in an “extremely critical” condition.

“This is an hour-by-hour situation,” Dr Phil Smith, who is supervising the treatment, said,

“We will do everything humanly possible to help him fight this disease.”

David Cameron hails G20 plan to boost world economy by $2 trillion

Prime Minister backs G20 agreement at summit in Brisbane, Australia

David Cameron has hailed an agreement by the G20 economies, claiming it could deliver "extra jobs, extra growth and a boost to the world economy".

The G20 group, meeting in Australia, signed up to a goal of lifting collective GDP by an additional 2pc by 2018, which if fully implemented is predicted to add 2.1pc - the equivalent of more than $2 trillion (£1.25 trillion) - to the global economy and create millions of jobs.

Mr Cameron said the gathering in Brisbane also sent a "very clear message" to Russian President Vladimir Putin of the unity between Europe and the US in demanding that he de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine or face tougher sanctions.

Mr Putin - who left the summit early, saying he needed to get back to Moscow in time to grab some sleep before going to work tomorrow - was left in no doubt that he stands at a "crossroads" in Russia's relationship with the rest of the world, said the Prime Minister.

The PM joined other EU leaders to discuss possible co-ordinated action over Ukraine with US President Barack Obama, ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow to consider possible further sanctions.

Mr Cameron said the discussions with Mr Obama had also "put rocket boosters" under plans for an EU/US free trade deal, which the PM said could add £10bn to the UK economy and would be "good for Britain, good for jobs and good for families".

He vowed to take on opponents of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), dismissing as "nonsense" claims that it could harm the NHS.

He said Britain would "play a very positive part" in funding a Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries cope with the impact of global warming, after Mr Obama promised a $3bn American contribution during his visit to Australia.

A joint statement issued by Mr Obama, Mr Cameron, Germany's Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Italy's Matteo Renzi, Mariano Rajoy of Spain and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council reaffirmed their commitment to "comprehensive and ambitious negotiations" on the transatlantic trade deal, directing negotiators to "make all possible progress over the coming year".

Critics of the TTIP deal have warned it will open the NHS up to private US healthcare firms and undermine European food and environmental standards.

But Mr Cameron said: "It's important we start taking on the opponents of this deal and start exposing the arguments against," which he said were "very weak".

Dismissing claims it will damage the NHS, he insisted: "That's nonsense. It's our National Health Service. It's in the public sector. It's going to stay in the public sector. That's not going to change. It will remain free at the point of use. There is no threat, I believe, from TTIP to the National Health Service."

And he added: "The opportunities for Britain of trading more with the USA are clear and there for all to see."

Mr Cameron acknowledged the hoped-for boost to the world economy from this weekend's agreement would depend on all G20 countries making good on promises to implement reforms to lift growth and private sector activity.

But he said: "I think we have made some important steps forward that will help on the growth and jobs people want in Britain."

The OECD has said that achieving the 2.1% GDP target would be the equivalent of "adding another Australia and New Zealand to the world economy", he said, adding: "If everyone keeps these promises we will see extra jobs, extra growth and a boost to the world economy."

International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde had said the UK and US were "leading the pack" on economic performance as they went into the summit, said Mr Cameron. But he said he was not "complacent" about the recovery, noting the continuing threat of a return to recession in the eurozone and security shocks like the Ebola epidemic in west Africa and the instability in Ukraine.

Mr Cameron persuaded Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to put Ebola on the agenda at Brisbane, and he said discussions on what was "the biggest world health crisis we have faced in many years" had been "purposeful", with new commitments of money and health workers.

A statement released last night said the G20 members were "committed to do what is necessary to ensure the international effort can extinguish the outbreak".

Russian president leaves early following Western criticism over ukraine crisis

VLADIMIR PUTIN is to leave the G20 summit in Australia early after holding a tense meeting with David Cameron over Russia's actions in Ukraine.

The Kremlin confirmed that the Russian president will leave the summit venue in Brisbane before an official lunch today.

He revised his schedule after facing public criticism from several Western leaders. Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister and host of the summit, threatened to "shirt front" Mr Putin - an Australian Rules football term for a barge to the chest. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, told Mr Putin: "I guess I'll shake your hand, but I'll only have one thing to say to you - get out of Ukraine."

Mr Cameron, for his part, held a 50-minute meeting with Mr Putin yesterday. Russia is believed to have deployed more forces on Ukraine's border and sent troops and tanks over the frontier into an enclave held by pro-Moscow rebels. During talks described as "robust", the Prime Minister told Mr Putin that Russia had reached a crossroads.

The Kremlin could either obey a ceasefire agreement signed in Minsk on Sept 5, withdraw its troops from Ukraine and work to reduce the bloodshed, or Moscow could stay on its present course and risk tougher European sanctions. Asked whether he could trust the Russian leader, Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I take people as I find them. The sad thing is that, to date, undertakings given in the Minsk agreement have not been followed, but the right thing to do is to continue to engage. So far we haven't seen his actions follow up the statements that he's given on previous occasions."

Mr Cameron added: "It's very important Russia understands what's at stake and gets a very clear message. There's a real choice here: there's a different and better way for Russia to behave that could lead to an easing of relations, but at the moment he's not taking that path."

During the meeting, Mr Cameron and Mr Putin "agreed to disagree" on several areas, including the Russian leader's claim that none of his troops is inside Ukraine.

The Prime Minister said that drones should be deployed to monitor military movements on the ground in eastern Ukraine and across the border with Russia - an idea that Mr Putin claimed to support. Mr Putin also said that he was prepared to accept a ceasefire and to stop the flow of Russian weapons to the rebels in eastern Ukraine. He added that he was prepared to recognise Ukraine as a "single political space".

As for whether these relatively conciliatory statements amounted to progress, Mr Cameron was said to be "realistic". The Russian leader has broken earlier pledges to end his support for the rebellion in Ukraine and photographic evidence contradicts his claim that no Russian troops are in the country.

A Kremlin spokesman gave a more upbeat account of the meeting, saying that Mr Putin and Mr Cameron had addressed the "fundamental causes of the current breakdown of relations" between Russia and the West. The European Union is now considering whether to impose further sanctions on Russia. So far, these measures have been focused on powerful Russian individuals and state-owned companies in the energy, defence and banking sectors. The question is whether the EU will have the unity and the resolve to impose further "sectoral" sanctions.

EU foreign ministers will discuss this at a meeting in Brussels tomorrow. However, agreement is unlikely to be rapid, particularly as Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, said last Wednesday that the time was not right to consider any further sanctions. Rather than punish specific sectors of the Russian economy, a more likely outcome is that the EU will add more names to a list of people subjected to travel bans and asset freezes.

Mr Putin deployed a flotilla of Russian warships to the Indian Ocean off Australia, in an apparent show of strength before the summit. Mr Cameron described this as a display of "international machismo".

During a speech in Brisbane, President Barack Obama voiced his fears for the future security of the Pacific. Without mentioning China by name, he warned of the possible consequences of the territorial disputes between Beijing and its maritime neighbours, saying how arguments over "remote islands and rocky shoals" could "threaten to spiral into confrontation". The Asian powers had to choose between "conflict or cooperation and oppression or liberty".

Mr Obama added: "An effective security order for Asia must be based not on spheres of influence or coercion or intimidation, where big nations bully the small, but on alliances, international law and international norms that uphold the peaceful resolution of disputes."

The G20 summit also discussed the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. A statement promised that all the member countries would do everything possible to "extinguish the outbreak" as rapidly as possible, adding that the G20 would also "address its medium-term economic and humanitarian costs".

Mr Obama confronted Australia and other G20 members over their reluctance to tackle climate change. "Every nation has a responsibility" to deal with this problem, he said, contradicting Mr Abbott who has chosen to focus the Brisbane summit on jobs and economic growth. Mr Obama promised that America would contribute £2billion to the Green Climate Fund that aims to help developing nations cope with the effects of global warming. Last week, the US struck a deal in Beijing to ensure that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030.

Mr Cameron said that "Britain has more than played its part", noting: "We were the first country in the world to have climate change legislation. We've seen a significant cut in our carbon emissions. We set up the world's first green investment bank."

Joe Shute meets the British doctor helping West Africans protect themselves from the deadly spread of Ebola

IT IS three little sisters that Dr Simon Mardel finds hard to forget. The youngest was nine, the oldest 13, desperately sick and alone in the stifling wards of a makeshift tent hospital in Gueckedou Province, Guinea, West Africa.

Normally, he says, children are less likely to contract Ebola because they are not involved in caring for the dying. But when their mother fell ill, there was nobody left to help.

"Ebola is a very messy disease. People get diarrhoea and are so weak they can't make it to the lavatories so those who look after them are easily exposed to the virus,'' he says. ''These three little girls had taken their mum's linen and clothing to wash, and they all got infected. One died, another nearly pulled through. Only one survived.

"Bear in mind those little girls had lost other close family members, then their mother. The one that lived saw her sisters die as well."

Such is the terrible cruelty of Ebola, a virus Dr Mardel knows better than perhaps any other medical professional in the world.

The 57-year-old, who was made OBE in 1993, has worked for 30 years in humanitarian crisis zones from Afghanistan and Sudan to Srebrenica as well as on the Sars and Bird Flu outbreaks of the past decade.

Ebola, he says, is different. "It's as destructive as war."

He has witnessed the virus cut swathes through generations, and take colleagues, including close friends. But when, earlier this year, Dr Mardel flew to Guinea, where the first Ebola case in the current outbreak was reported in a two-yearold boy last December, it was a situation unlike anything he had ever experienced.

He was there to compile a report for the World Health Organisation. "I don't think it was ever in control," he says. "After a week I could see this nasty mixture of ingredients and started to think this needs to be highlighted. I was sending sections of my report back early."

Yet little changed. The problems he identified: poor infection control and limited communication, a damaging lack of trust between the local population and health care workers, and suspicion of the international crisis effort, have since spun out of control.

The problems were not confined to Guinea, but Sierra Leone and Liberia too, with Ebola killing close to 5,000 people and infecting more than 13,000.

The US Centers for Disease Control has warned that there could be 1.4million cases by January. Such is the number of unreported cases - estimated to be at least double those known about - that 15 other countries are deemed "at risk".

This week, a nurse in Mali became the second person to have died there from Ebola.

"In my heart I think Ebola is in more countries," Dr Mardel says. "The unrecognised cases are likely to be propagating even outside of the 'at risk' countries.''

Dr Mardel who, when not seconded to disaster zones, is a consultant in emergency medicine at University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, was briefly back in Britain earlier this month.

We met at the 500-year-old farmhouse just outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria that he shares with his wife of 20 years, Susan, a nurse at a local hospital, and children Amelia, nine, and Findlay, 13.

He has recently returned from Nigeria, where Ebola arrived in July via a Liberian diplomat. Seven people died as a result. Last month the country was declared Ebolafree. "Nigeria got lucky," Dr Mardel says.

Now he is heading to Sierra Leone in a new role for an international health agency. He boasts vast experience already of this crisis, not least the "epidemic of fear", which has seen people abandon hospitals and riot on the streets. In September eight people, including health workers and journalists trying to raise awareness of the virus, were beaten to death with machetes and clubs in a remote village in Guinea.

Dr Mardel is clear about what must be done. "You have to change attitudes and beliefs. You only do that with really smart educational tools and techniques. The scale on which it has to be done is enormous." Currently hundreds of thousands of community care workers need to be trained across West Africa.

Dr Mardel is the inspiration for, and a key backer of the Masanga Mentor Initiative — supported by The Sunday Telegraph as part of its Christmas charity appeal — which has been created to help fill this void.

It consists of a partnership between the UK-funded Masanga Hospital in Sierra Leone and the Mentor Initiative, a British NGO with vast experience of education and training, which is already established in Liberia.

Led by British medical and aid specialists, its aim is to help educate local communities about infection control and to discourage dangerous practices, behaviour and rituals.

Volunteers are being recruited across Sierra Leone and Liberia and will be taught to use laptop-based interactive training methods that can be understood in local languages and which make use of animation in remote areas where adult literacy is low.

Such community engagement, Dr Mardel says, alongside simple infection control measures, could halve the current mortality rate of 70 per cent.

"At every level, the Masanga Mentor Initiative comes into this. It's got tools that will get across the reality, and simplify and demystify infection control.

"Also it has a foothold in each country. It will convince people of the need to do this, and explain in a more engaging way."

Given the speed with which containment needs to take place among the thousands of cases, and the fact that sufferers are taken away to die alone in sprawling tent encampments, it is unsurprising that local people have become alienated from those trying to help.

In Guinea and Liberia, they call them the Cosmonauts: the men and women in white biohazard suits who arrive to whisk suspected cases — and bodies — away.

Many refuse to open their doors to them, preferring instead to treat dying relatives at home and bury them in the family plot.

Dr Mardel experienced first-hand that mistrust that exists during his trip to Guinea in May. The first days of his three-week stay were spent in the capital, Conakry, surveying its run-down Donka Hospital — known by some, wearily, as "Donka Bonkers". Then he flew up country to the town of Gueckedou.

"The missing ingredient has been hearts and minds, and part of that is information. You have to convince people this is what they have to do to protect themselves.

"It is so easy to create the unintended consequences if you don't spend time with the community talking before you go in. The most important bit of protection equipment is a smile.

"Bear in mind all the neighbours are watching. If they and the family see you in all this [biohazard] stuff, it puts the fear of God into them."

The virus is transmitted through human contact, exposure to the saliva, blood, vomit, faeces, urine and tears of sufferers; health care workers are the most at risk. "If you make a mistake," says Dr Mardel, "it's unforgiving." This outbreak has already taken the lives of prominent doctors in Sierra Leone and Liberia. By the end of the summer, 240 health care workers had developed the disease and only half survived.

More are dying every week with disastrous consequences for the health care infrastructure of the region.

Dr Mardel has seen it before, in Gulu, northern Uganda, in 2000, which prior to this year's epidemic was the world's largest with 224 deaths.

Those infected included 29 health workers, including his friend, Dr Matthew Lukwiya. Tears fill the doctor's eyes when he thinks of him.

"We lost a lot of staff in Gulu — but Matthew, that really hurt. It's the people who work the hardest who are the most exposed."

The Masanga Mentor Initiative is in its fledgling stages, but by Christmas training will be under way at Masanga Hospital and nine other partner hospitals, as well as the slums of Monrovia.

Beyond that, it will be introduced across West Africa. Dr Mardel says key to the success of the project is the use of technology to deliver simple messages.

"We aren't reaping the benefits of modern techniques as we should. The way the Masanga Mentor Initiative is going to utilise them is exactly the way we need to go."

Nobody on the ground believes this crisis is anywhere near the end, and porous borders will continue to facilitate Ebola's spread. The size of this outbreak, Dr Mardel says, represents a "turning point" in public health. "Guinea was the worst place I've seen for lack of running water and health facilities.

"Nobody will ever again say it is OK to not have things up to standard. In West Africa and the rest of the world."

At the heart of containing this crisis, says Dr Mardel, is education. It underpins everything that the Masanga Mentor Initiative stands for: hope from the chaos left in Ebola's wake.

New version of Band Aid's 'Do They Know It's Christmas' to help Ebola's victims

In 1984 Bob Geldof's Band Aid wanted to "feed the world" in response to the Ethiopian famine. But now a new generation of pop stars wants to heal it, raising money to fight the scourge of Ebola

They were the words which, 30 years ago, moved the nation to raise millions for the starving in the Horn of Africa, topping the charts and becoming one of the biggest charity singles ever. Now the lyrics of Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas have been reworked to meet the challenge of a contemporary nightmare – the scourge of Ebola.

A new generation of pop stars flocked on Saturday to the same recording studio where the original Band Aid single was recorded in 1984, to produce their own version of the song to raise money to help the fight against the disease which is ravaging through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea and leaving thousands dead in its wake.

Where the aim of Bob Geldof and Midge Ure’s original song was to “feed the world”, Band Aid 30s mission is to “heal” it.

Moved by the plight of those west African countries where Ebola has claimed at least 5,500 lives and left their health care systems in crisis – just as he was prompted by television’s ‘biblical’ images of the Ethiopian famine of 1984 – Geldof invited the likes of One Direction, Emile Sande and Ed Sheeran to West London’s Sarm studios to record the new single.

He had already amended his now legendary 1984 lyrics to fit today’s crisis, so that the line about drought “Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears”, has been replaced by “Where a kiss of love can kill you – and there’s death in every tear”, in reference to the way Ebola is transmitted through physical contact and bodily fluids.

Another change is the new central verse: “No peace and joy this Christmas in West Africa/The only hope they’ll have is being alive/Where to comfort is to fear/Where to touch is to be scared/How can they know it’s Christmas time at all.”

This replaces the original’s imagery of famine and starvation: “And there won’t be snow in Africa this Christmas time/The greatest gift they’ll get this year is life/Where nothing ever grows/No rain or rivers flow/Do they know it’s Christmas time at all?”

Significantly Geldof has also dropped the soul searing line – sung by Bono – “Well tonight thank God it’s them/Instead of you”, which punctuated the original song as an apparent rebuke to western audiences. This has been replaced by the words: “Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you”.

The song retains the now famous line from the original chorus, “Feed the world/LET them know it’s Christmas time”, but also introduces the twist “Heal the world, let them know it’s Christmas time again”.

Artists taking part in Saturday’s recording, which was set to culminate on Sunday with the finished single and accompanying video being shown on The X Factor at 8pm, where Elbow, Seal, Sinead O’Connor, Angelique Kidjo, Foals and Rita Ora.

They were stepping into the fundraising shows of acts such as Wham, Boy George, Duran Duran, Sting and Status Quo, whose original song spent three weeks at number one and sold over three million copies in the UK and raising more than £8 million ($24m) worldwide.

The record’s success inspired similar fundraising efforts in Canada, France, Spain and the United States and led to the Live Aid and USA for Africa concerts, which were broadcast in over 165 countries, raising about £95 million ($150m) for famine relief in Ethiopia.

Today’s stars arrived for their recording session with similar ambitions in mind.

Niall Horan, of One Direction, said: “Hopefully it gets to number one and raises a lot of money for a really worthy cause.” Ellie Goulding said she was “quite excited, a little bit nervous – it’s quite a big thing”, while Guy Garvey, the singer with Elbow, said it was “a real privilege” to have been invited.

Even before it was completed the Band Aid 30 single was boosted by the announcement by George Osborne, the Chancellor, that he would not levy VAT on its sales.

Geldof said on arriving at the Notting Hill studios: “I’ve just spoken to the Chancellor George Osborne and he’s said we can have all the VAT back on the record. So 100% of any income from this record, no tax whatsoever. If the government is prepared to do that, then come Monday at 08:00 when every station plays this track across the nation, buy this thing. Don’t go looking for it free. Buy it.”

Bono, who sang on the original recording, criticised rich countries for failing to honour aid pledges as he arrived.

He said: "We've been trying to make this kind of event a thing of the past - we want to make Band Aid history - for quite some time.

"If every country had the values of Great Britain and kept the promises they make at these big G8 meetings and the like we wouldn't have to be standing here."

Dr Martin Salia, physician infected with Ebola virus arrives in US for treatment

Dr Martin Salia, a physician infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in the United States for treatment.

The Sierra Leone citizen, who is a US permanent resident, will be the 10th person with the disease to receive medical care in the United States.

Dr Salia, 44, was loaded onto a gurney and then encased in a plastic bubble, before being taken by taken by ambulance to the biocontainment unit at the University of Nebraska medical centre in Omaha.

He will be the third patient to be treated at the Nebraska medical centre, one of four hospitals in the United States specialising in treating the disease.

The physician, who lives in Maryland with his wife and two children, had been working at the Kissy United Methodist Hospital in Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, when he fell ill.

Kissy is not an Ebola treatment unit, although Dr Salia did work at three other medical centres.

He was tested positive for Ebola, a virus that has killed more than 5,000 people and infected more than 14,000 in West Africa.

He is understood to be in a worse condition than the other Ebola sufferers who have returned to the United States for treatment

Isatu Salia, his wife, said she had spoken to her husband over the phone. He sounded weak, but did understand what was happening.

Thus far only one of the patients treated for Ebola in the United States this year have died, he was a Liberian, Thomas Duncan.

Another eight have survived and last week Grant Spencer, a doctor who returned to New York with the virus, was declared free of the disease.

Chancellor won't levy VAT on Do They Know It's Christmas? to raise funds for ebola

George Osborne has announced he will waive the VAT on sales of Bob Geldof’s band aid single.

Mr Geldof, the Boomtown Rats frontman, and Midge Ure are re-recording Do They Know It’s Christmas to raise funds to fight ebola in West Africa.

“Just spoke to the remarkable Bob Geldof. Told him we'll waive VAT on #BandAid30 so every penny goes to fight Ebola,” the Chancellor wrote on Twitter.

He later added: "It's fantastic that he's got so many musicians together again to help fight Ebola - and I wanted to make sure every penny raised goes to combat this terrible disease.

“Whether it's the British public or their government, we are united in helping lead the world efforts against Ebola.”

Mr Geldof said: "Amazing, that the Government has just said 'Fine, keep the tax'."

Goods can be exempted from VAT, levied at 20 per cent, if they are to raise funds for charity.

The song was originally written and performed in 1984 to raise funds to fight the Ethiopian famine.

Artists on the track include One Direction, Chris Martin, Sam Smith, Paloma Faith and Ed Sheeran.

Other artists confirmed for the song include Bastille, Elbow, Emeli Sande, Foals, Jessie Ware, Sinead O'Connor and Underworld.

Geldof has asked David Bowie to record an introduction for the single, and Tracey Emin will create the artwork for the record.

The original Do They Know It's Christmas single stayed at number one for five weeks, selling 3.7 million copies.

It featured some of the biggest-selling artists of the day: Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, U2, George Michael, Paul Young and Culture Club.

Mr Geldof has said he fears the song will not raise as much money in an age of free downloads, and urged supporters to part with their money.

"It really doesn't matter if you don't like this song, it really doesn't matter if you hate all the artists. What you have to do is buy this thing," Geldof said.

The lyrics have been "retweaked" so the focus is less on hunger, as it was in the 1984 original.

'Britain has to be prepared to walk away from the EU’

But the new Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, a noted Eurosceptic, is now more confident of 'meaningful’ restrictions on immigration – and spiking Ukip’s guns

Even 4,500 miles away in the intense heat of West Africa, the European Union is never far from Philip Hammond’s thoughts. The Foreign Secretary has just spent a day seeing the devastation left in Sierra Leone by the deadly Ebola virus, but he is now on the front line of a battle to prevent a Conservative meltdown caused by the upcoming Rochester and Strood by-election.

With Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine and the rise of jihadist groups such as Isil in the Middle East, Mr Hammond is struggling with the busiest overseas policy agenda faced by a foreign secretary in years. But, in the official residence of the High Commissioner in Ghana ahead of a seven-hour flight back to the UK, his focus is on the EU, immigration, and the by-election.

Ahead of Thursday’s crucial vote, which the Conservatives face losing to Ukip, Mr Hammond has chosen to go further than even David Cameron in warning that Britain could leave the EU if the country does not gain control over its borders. Britain must get “substantial, meaningful reform” from Brussels ahead of the in-out referendum Mr Cameron has pledged to hold in 2017, Mr Hammond says. He makes clear that the Government is now “prepared to stand up from the table and walk away”.

The next seven days will be critical for the Tories and could do more to determine the outcome of May’s general election than any other moment in the last four years. If the Conservatives lose badly to Ukip defector Mark Reckless – as pollsters predict – it could trigger a crisis for the Prime Minister that will lead many in his own party to conclude that they cannot win the election.

Senior Conservatives believe that the only way to confront the “existential threat” posed by Nigel Farage and Ukip is to take an increasingly hard line on immigration and EU reform.

And Mr Hammond does just that by making clear that “we have to be prepared” to leave the EU if reforms to the immigration system are resisted. “We’re in the beginning stages of a negotiation and – first of all, never, never go into any negotiation unless you’re prepared to stand up from the table and walk away,” he says. “We have to be prepared to. In this case it isn’t even our decision because there’s going to be a referendum at the end of this process.

“We have to be candid with our European Union partners as we’re negotiating about what we think the verdict of the British people would be. I’d like to be telling my German counterpart honestly, if you draw the line there, I don’t think we’re going to get this past the British public in a referendum – but if you could move your line to there, I think we might.”

When Mr Hammond replaced William Hague in July’s reshuffle, it was seen as a promotion that took Britain closer to leaving the EU.

Mr Hammond is a noted Eurosceptic and has said he would vote to leave the EU if Britain is unable to achieve substantial reforms. In recent months, he has not disappointed those in the Tory party who passionately support an EU exit by saying that it is “lighting a fire under the European Union” by holding an in-out referendum.

Mr Hammond appears to concede that when he stood in Mr Cameron’s Downing Street office and accepted the role of Foreign Secretary, he took it thinking Britain would ultimately leave the EU. However, following a series of behind-the-scenes negotiations with his counterparts across Europe, he now says he is “much more optimistic” that Britain can get reforms to the immigration system that will lead to a vote to stay in the EU.

He makes clear that a vote to stay in Europe is “definitely not a certainty”, but adds: “I’m much more optimistic about that now than I was before I started doing this job because – perhaps I read too many newspapers – I slightly had the impression that I was going to be going into battle as a lonely voice. And what I found in fact, was that I was going in and saying this is our problem, and people were saying we completely get it, it’s our problem, too.”

In recent weeks, a series of European leaders including Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to torpedo Mr Cameron’s attempts to reform EU freedom of movement rules. Mrs Merkel told Mr Cameron that Germany would not accept any of his demands on freedom of movement. German officials were reported to have said that they would be prepared to countenance the possibility of a “Brexit” if the Prime Minister insists on changing the rules that allow an unlimited number of EU citizens to come and live and work in the UK.

But Mr Hammond insists it is “nowhere near as black and white” as the noises off from within the Bundestag would suggest. “It isn’t the case that either the Germans agree that we can have total control of our own borders, or we’re never going to do a deal with the Germans,” Mr Hammond says.

“If your ambition is that we have total unfettered control of our own borders to do what we like, that isn’t compatible with membership of the European Union, it’s as simple as that. And people who advocate that know jolly well it is not compatible with membership of the European Union. So if that’s what you want, you’re essentially talking about leaving the European Union.”

The Foreign Secretary makes clear that his negotiations can result in Britain having the “ability to avoid the kind of destabilising movements that we’ve seen over the last decade or so”.

It is not the case that Britain will be unable to actively reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK, Mr Hammond insists. Plans floated in recent weeks by senior Conservative sources suggested that Mr Cameron wants to announce plans for quotas – limiting the number of EU migrants who can come to the UK annually.

After those plans were firmly rejected by allies – including Germany – that idea looked to have been scrapped. But Mr Hammond suggests that the possibility of quotas in all but name is still very much an option. It is just a question of the language and tone used during the negotiations, he says.

Britain will push for a “stretched definition” of existing EU treaties, Mr Hammond says. It will allow freedom of movement rules to be altered without treaty change, something Germany has said is impossible.

Asked if the idea of imposing quotas on EU migrants is now dead, Mr Hammond says: “There are bits of language which make things more difficult. I wouldn’t go into a discussion with my European colleagues talking about quotas. But I might be talking about a mechanism that delivered the same kind of outcome. But if you put a word like quota on the table, you immediately cause shutters to go up. So I think it’s about exploring the ideas and engaging, talking and that’s what we’re trying to do now. This negotiation isn’t going to begin until after the next election. What we can do at this stage is try to understand where people’s red lines really are, what they’re really thinking.”

In an attempt to recover from the expected loss to Ukip in next week’s by-election, Mr Cameron will in the coming weeks give a major speech on the EU and immigration to try to convince Ukip voters to return to the Conservative Party. The message will be that only Mr Cameron and the Tories can deliver change for those angry Ukip voters.

Some people are seeing Mr Cameron’s speech as his last throw of the dice on immigration before voters go the polls in May. According to Mr Hammond, it is a roll of the dice that may just work.

Tusk Conservation Awards: Protecting the forests of Kenya

Nigel Richardson meets a young Kenyan who has become an environmental 'vision bearer’

David Kuria, the second of the nominees for this year’s Tusk Award for Conservation in Africa, took me to a high ridge at the southern extremity of the Aberdare mountain range in central Kenya. On a clear day, you can see Mount Kenya, about 120 miles to the north-east, and the skyline of Nairobi, 30 miles to the south. Today, however, it was hazy and we contented ourselves with views below our feet of rolling forested hills. This is Kikuyu Escarpment Forest, 42-year-old Kuria’s home patch and the precious environment he has fought to preserve for his people over the past 20 years.

In 1994, he said, “it was a busy forest – but for exploitation, not conservation. There was a lot of charcoal burning, overgrazing, stealing of hardwood species, even hunting of small antelope.” Just out of university, Kuria was smart enough to realise that this evergreen montane forest, a habitat for elephants, bushbuck and a rare bird called the Abbott’s starling, would disappear in a generation – and with it a community’s lifeblood – if action wasn’t taken.

He describes himself as a “vision bearer” – and that vision manifested itself in a grassroots organisation called Kenvo (Kijabe Environment Volunteers), which he established in the mid-Nineties to support the communities living on the edge of the forest. “Our main work was to train people and tell them this forest was theirs,” he said, “and to tell the government that this is a community-based institution that needs to be listened to.”

Twenty years later, charcoal burning and illegal logging have been eradicated from the forest, and Kenvo, whose core staff “are from less than one kilometre from the forest edge”, have squared the circle that is at the heart of all conservation issues: “We have shown it’s possible to balance development goals and conservation goals.”

This is a poor rural community where people still survive on the notional dollar a day and eke a subsistence living from the land. But from youngsters in schools to old farmers apparently set in their ways, the people have been encouraged into new ways of behaving and working that are transforming their lives.

The cornerstone of this approach has been the “rehabilitation” of the forest – the replanting of indigenous species, plus some fast-growing conifers for timber – consolidated by schemes to provide other sources of income and welfare such as chickens (for eggs), beekeeping and “biogas” (fuel generated by waste products, which obviates the need to take firewood from the forest).

Kuria took me to meet one of the oldest Kenvo members, a farmer named Stephen Kusero, who keeps bees (the honey is sold collectively through Kenvo) and has a new biogas facility that runs off the daily dung of his single cow. Kusero turned on his cow-powered gas hob to demonstrate – and Kuria couldn’t resist warming his hands above its strong flame. “It feels good when you see something you started a long time ago actually working,” he said.

At Matathia Primary School, Kuria introduced me to the deputy headmaster, James Thuo, who admitted that a decade ago he knew nothing about trees and land management. Now, thanks to training by Kenvo, he has transformed the surroundings and spirit of the school. “There was nothing here,” he said as we walked through a grove of indigenous trees, planted by the children, that provide shade and a congenial environment.

Beyond the trees are a plant nursery and a vegetable garden, where the children “learn the proper management of the land” that they will carry with them into adulthood. The children take the seedlings and vegetables home to their families. Items are also sold commercially to provide a source of funding for the school. “We have come so far with these guys,” said Thuo, referring to Kenvo. “They have given the school a new look.”

The situation at another school, Kitilikini, proves there is a long way to go. The schoolyard was bare and rocky, devoid of trees and shade. Wind whipped the red earth into our eyes. Kuria had brought the headmaster a planting plan and suggested he visit Matathia Primary School to see what can be achieved. “It’s a hard job, but we’ll do it,” he said.

Our last stop was Osutwa Camp, a joint tourist venture between Kuria’s ethnic group the Kikuyu and the Maasai . The traditional thatched buildings occupy a peaceful spot on a sweep of hillside, where foreign tourists used to come to walk and birdwatch (scaremongering about terrorism and Ebola has driven them away in recent months, much to Kuria’s frustration).

It’s the symbolism as well as the commercial potential of the camp that means so much to Kuria, who helped build it with his own hands. “The Maasai are pastoralists. We [the Kikuyu] are farmers. We have fought over water for a long time. But this camp shows that if we work together to conserve this environment, we will have everything.”

And if he wins this year’s Tusk Conservation Award? “Such awards, they remove the suffering you have gone through,” he said. “And more importantly, it shows I do not have to live in Nairobi to help my people. You can start change from within and it can become a demonstration that all things are possible.”

Tusk Conservation Awards

The Tusk Trust ( tusk.org[http://tusk.org] ) is a British charity, with the Duke of Cambridge as its patron, which supports conservation projects in Africa. Its Tusk Conservation Awards, in association with Investec Asset Management, recognise work in the field. In addition to the Tusk Award for Conservation in Africa, sponsored by Land Rover, it will be making an award for lifetime achievement, the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa, at a ceremony in London on November 25.

The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3582 1284; theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk[http://theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk] ), which supports the work of the Tusk Trust, tailor-makes community conservation safaris across Kenya. A seven-night stay combining Saruni Samburu in the north with Leleshwa, a private conservancy bordering the Maasai Mara National Reserve, and a day at the Kenvo project costs from £3,819 per person. Flights from London are with Kenya Airways ( kenya-airways.com[http://kenya-airways.com] ).

THREE OF THE BEST: SCIENCE PODCASTS

BEST OF DIGITAL & PODCASTS

Science Hour tgr.ph/1tEqiX1

Uploaded every Sunday, this stimulating podcast from the BBC World Service contains edited highlights from the network's four science–and–technology themed programmes – Discovery, Click, Health Check and Science in Action.

One of the things I like about it is that, unlike many other science podcasts, which tend to focus largely on stories from their country of origin, it has a bracingly international outlook — so it's no surprise to find a story about smart street lighting in Copenhagen butting up against an exploration of the links between the West African bushmeat trade and the recent Ebola outbreak.

Minute Physics tgr.ph/1y9z4wM

This absolutely wonderful video podcast aims, in its own words, to "give the world a better understanding of reality using stick figures and bad puns." Scripted and animated by a bright American physics postgraduate called Henry Reich, each episode explains a big idea or answers a puzzling question — why is the sun yellow and the sky blue? — through a series of beautifully simple time–lapse drawings. Episodes are typically about three minutes long; and it never ceases to amaze me how much Reich manages to get across in so short a time.

Science Talk tgr.ph/10sZy1h

Presented by the writer Steve Mirsky, this fine podcast from Scientific American magazine provides a regular dose of science–related talk from across the pond. Recent highlights include the author Dan Falk on the rich seam of scientific discovery that runs through Shakespeare's work; and a particularly good trio of episodes explaining the achievements of this year's Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry and Medicine.

24 Hours in Police Custody

CHANNEL 4, 9.00PM

Having cornered the market in televising maternity wards and A&E departments, Channel Four has continued to push the technical and narrative boundaries of fly–on–the–wall documentary–making with this frequently gripping series set in Luton Police Station. At its best, 24 Hours in Police Custody has furnished shocks, laughs and tragedy to rank alongside the year's most cannily plotted TV dramas. After investigating accusations of domestic abuse, paedophilia and murder in previous weeks, its denizens tackle their final case of the series tonight.

Acting sergeant Wil Taylor describes his job as "unrelenting carnage", which suggests there might be more to it than dealing with after–hours drunks or petty theft. And so it comes to pass: tonight, Taylor and his team investigate a case of possible people–trafficking when three Eastern European sex workers are arrested during a raid on a brothel. Unless, of course, it's the women who are running the brothel themselves. It's another ethical minefield, and the patience and ingenuity of Luton's finest is impossible not to admire. Equally, as so often with the series, the personal stories of the officers themselves prove almost as compelling as the cases they handle. Taylor was once a sports–obsessed law student and is now a double amputee; needless to say, he doesn't allow this to impair his ability to do his job. Another series must surely be in the offing but, in the meantime, can a call from Channel Four to the fire brigade be far away?

Dispatches: How the Rich Get Richer

CHANNEL 4, 8.00PM

In the same vein as last week's interactive show, How Rich Are You?, the investigative current affairs programme here turns to matters of personal finance. The Spectator's editor and Telegraph columnist, Fraser Nelson, leads this report on a new inequality between the haves and havenots in post–recession Britain and looks at the widening gap between the richest and the poorest members of society.

The Missing Evidence

CHANNEL 5, 8.00PM

The identity of Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper has long been a much–debated mystery. Now, after dedicating 30 years of his life to research, journalist Christer Holmgren has a new theory that he believes can bring an end to 130 years of speculation.

Intruders

BBC TWO, 9.00PM

In this fifth episode of the baffling supernatural thriller, Gary (Tory Kittles) reveals to Jack (John Simm) that he knows more about Bill Anderson's murder than he had previously let on. Meanwhile, possessed child Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) starts to understand more of Marcus's memories.

Panorama: Ebola Frontline

BBC ONE, 10.35PM; SCOT, 11.05PM; NI, 11.35PM

This emotionally charged film documents the experience of British–born doctor, Javid Abdelmoneim, as he works at a treatment centre in Sierra Leone. Giving an insight into the lives of those with the viral disease and their families, it's worth watching, especially for the uplifting moments when cured patients get to leave the centre.

Toast of London

CHANNEL 4, 10.50PM

This second series of Matt Berry's sitcom is deliciously funny. This week, after ruining his return to the West End stage, bumbling actor Steven Toast (Berry) is on a mission to land an announcing role on a university quiz show. But will he be able to impress the host?
