Correction Appended

THE spread of Ebola from western Africa to suburban Texas has brought with it another strain of contagion: conspiracy theories.

The outbreak began in September, when The Daily Observer, a Liberian newspaper, published an article[http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod] alleging that the virus was not what it seemed — a medical disaster — but rather a bioweapon designed by the United States military to depopulate the planet. Not long after, accusations appeared online contending that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had patented the virus[http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/ebolapatent.asp] and was poised to make a fortune from a new vaccine it had created with the pharmaceutical industry. There were even reports that the New World Order[http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2359-the-new-world-order-bio-war], that classic conspiracy bugbear involving global elites, had engineered Ebola in order to impose quarantines, travel bans and eventually martial law.

While most of these theories have so far lingered on the fringes of the Internet, a few stubborn cases have crept into the mainstream. In the last few weeks, conservative figures like Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham have floated the idea that President Obama had sent aid to Africa, risking American lives, because of his guilt over slavery[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/10/03/this_sound_bite_is_all_the_proof_you_need_that_political_correctness_is_destroying_this_country] and colonialism[http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/09/26/ingraham-suggests-obama-is-willing-to-expose-am/200913]. And just days ago, the hip-hop artist Chris Brown took to Twitter[https://celebrity.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/chris-brown-thinks-ebola-is-a-form-of-population-control-133357155.html], announcing to his 13 million followers: “I don’t know ... but I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control.”

Conspiracy theories have always moved in tandem with the news, offering shadow explanations for distressing or perplexing events. Though typically dismissed as a destructive mix of mendacity and nonsense, they often reflect societal fears.

“Conspiracy theories don’t have to be true to tell us something about ourselves,” said Michael Barkun, a professor emeritus of political science at Syracuse University and the author of “Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America.” “They’re not effective as accurate accounts — they’re effective as expressions of anxiety.”

The notion, for example, that health officials are conspiring with Big Pharma to consciously spread — and then cure — Ebola as a profit-making venture might sound like the plot to a cheesy summer thriller, but in fact it touches on a genuine aspect of our health care system, said Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law and the author of “Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture.”

“The truth is that we do rely on private corporations to develop and produce our pharmaceuticals,” he said. “While we may not like that fact, it’s not so hard or paranoid to imagine private companies acting in their own best interests.”

The theory works, Professor Fenster added, because it is “truthy,” to borrow from the comedian Stephen Colbert. Which is to say, it has just enough veracity “that it rings true when carried to Ebola,” he said.

It’s not surprising that populist and anti-government conspiracies are rampant at a moment when opinion polls suggest that our trust in government has reached a record low. In fact, most theories pit those who perceive themselves as powerless against a dominant cabal of secretive elites.

That model certainly seems to fit the allegation that the Department of Defense created Ebola in a military lab to loose on the world as a Malthusian device to reduce the population. “Conspiracies against the powerless tend to be effective because the masses often feel that way,” James F. Broderick, an English professor at New Jersey City University and co-author of “Web of Conspiracy: A Guide to Conspiracy Theory Sites on the Internet,” said. “They reflect and reinforce the idea that ordinary citizens are victims of the government.”

OUTBREAKS, as a genre, have long attracted conspiracy theorists, beginning in medieval times when the Jewish leaders of Toledo, Spain, were blamed for having spread the Black Plague. More recently, the AIDS epidemic was also said to have been caused by a government plot.

The Ebola virus, experts say, is classic conspiracy theory fodder: a silent killer that penetrates the body undetected and lies dormant for weeks. Its sources are obscure, its symptoms horrific.

“Diseases in particular are suited to conspiracy because they are invisible and invisibly transmitted,” Professor Barkun said. “Our senses can’t tell us exactly how the danger spreads. The theory has an answer for what mystifies and frightens.”

Many conspiracy theorists pride themselves on having inside information, but in the case of Ebola such alleged information, or misinformation — the government is in on it! — can erode the public trust when it’s needed most.

“If these were just opinions that people spouted off on talk radio or at dinner parties, you could argue that there wasn’t much harm,” Professor Broderick said. “But to have the C.D.C. debased in public as a puppet of the New World Order or of major corporations is obviously a dangerous proposition.”

Nonetheless, some scholars find value in conspiracy theories because they allow us to vent and give voice to hidden fears.

“I view these things as a way of framing the world, of offering us narratives,” Professor Fenster said. “And they’re not necessarily a bad thing. Conspiracy theories are something that’s available in American discourse as a way of telling stories, as a way of explaining who we are.”

Correction: October 26, 2014, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article last Sunday on the conspiracy theories about Ebola referred incorrectly to the spread of a different disease. The Black, or bubonic, plague was not caused by a viral agent but by bacteria.

Eurozone as the Fright Epicenter

The markets are right to worry about the eurozone, the epicenter of fright last week. Its three big economies — Germany, France and Italy — are stuck, each in their own way.

There is, in theory, a grand bargain that might shift the malaise. This would involve deep structural changes by Berlin, as well as Paris and Rome; quantitative easing[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/q/quantitative_easing/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] by the European Central Bank[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_central_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org] to increase inflation; and some loosening of fiscal straitjackets.

But such a deal — hinted at by Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, in his Jackson Hole speech in August — is unlikely to materialize soon, if at all.

In the meantime, the region is being battered by shocks from outside and within. The external shocks are the slowdown of emerging economies, especially China; the dispute with Russia over Ukraine; the Ebola outbreak; and the war against the Islamic State.

As if this were not enough, the euro zone continues to inflict wounds on itself. The latest was Greece’s rush to get out of its bailout program. The bond markets reacted by pushing Greek bond yields up last week to such a level that Athens’s ability to stand on its own two feet is off the agenda for the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, an election may be held in Greece early next year. That would probably be won by the radical left Syriza party, which wants to write off half the government’s debts — and that could cause contagion in Italy, whose debts are 137 percent of G.D.P.

So why would the euro zone not adopt Mr. Draghi’s grand bargain? Because the politics is hard.

Italy, to be fair, is overhauling its labor market, civil justice system and constitution. But Matteo Renzi, the prime minister, has just published a budget that is light on spending cuts. He is also not doing enough to reduce the government’s debt through privatization.

France published a budget last week that pushed back to 2017 a plan to cut its deficit below 3 percent of G.D.P. It is not doing enough to liberalize its labor market or cut the size of its welfare state either.

If Rome and Paris were asking for extra fiscal wiggle room to finance investment while cutting current spending, they would deserve support. As it is, their actions could provoke a confrontation with the European Commission on the grounds that they flout euro zone fiscal rules. What is more, the Italian and French actions are causing concern in Berlin. German politicians do not like the idea of rules being broken.

Berlin, meanwhile, is digging in its own heels as others try to push it to increase investment spending and overhaul its economy. The government is fixated on balancing its budget next year. This goes further than a so-called “debt brake,” which legally requires close to a balanced budget.

The German people are so convinced that debt is sin that even the S.P.D., the center-left party in the grand coalition, is committed to the balanced budget. Sigmar Gabriel, its leader, said last week there were “no economic policy grounds” to abandon the plan. But he announced sharply reduced growth forecasts for both this year and next, to 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.

Germany certainly needs to increase investment, as its infrastructure is decaying. But it is doubtful how much benefit this would be to other euro zone countries. It might, therefore, be more productive for Germany’s partners to focus on structural overhauls — in particular, the need to free up its services markets. Almost every craft and profession is covered by a guild, which requires long years of training and keeps competition out of the market. The result is that Germany has high-quality but expensive services.

If Berlin could be persuaded to open up its markets, this could eventually be an important source of business for other European Union countries. It could also give German consumers a wider range of cheaper services to spend their money on.

The snag is that Berlin does not seem inclined to move on this either, because the guilds are politically well entrenched. It is happier to lecture other countries about how to restructure their own economies than to listen to suggestions about what to do at home.

That said, it is still worth trying to break the impasse. One sliver of hope was an initiative announced this month by Mr. Gabriel, the S.P.D. leader, and the French economy minister. They are going to come up with some joint suggestions about how the two economies could reform themselves.

But who is going to be the deal maker? Mr. Draghi could play a useful role. But his clout in Germany seems to have declined a bit. Both Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, and Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, the central bank, have criticized the E.C.B. for some of its unorthodox policies.

Donald Tusk, the incoming European Council president, who coordinates the positions of European leaders, does not seem suited to play the same deal maker role as the current president, Herman Van Rompuy. Mr. Tusk does not speak English well and his country, Poland, does not use the euro.

That leaves the burden of cutting a difficult deal to Jean-Claude Juncker, who becomes president of the European Commission next month. He had better get to work, and fast.

For Republicans, Hard Lessons From a Key State
By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

If Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress next year — which is looking probable two weeks before the elections — House Speaker John A. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, could use some guidance from North Carolina: Don’t overreach.

As of now, in a race that could go either way, the incumbent senator, Kay Hagan, a Democrat, is a slight favorite over the Republican Thom Tillis for one reason: The challenger is speaker of the state’s Republican-led House of Representatives, which is about as unpopular in North Carolina as Congress.

The Hagan campaign calculates it offsets any national tide favoring Republicans by linking Mr. Tillis to the party’s rule in Raleigh, the state capital. The senator always refers to her opponent as Speaker Tillis, not Mr. Tillis, Thom Tillis or Tillis. That might be a credential in some states. Not North Carolina.

Previously, Republicans were salivating over their prospects in the state. Mr. Tillis turned back right-wing primary challengers and was the strongest general-election candidate. Allies including the Koch brothers and Karl Rove’s group spent millions assailing, and presumably softening up, Ms. Hagan.

But Mr. Tillis is haunted by the unpopular record of the Republicans who control state government. They slashed taxes, especially for the affluent; cut social services; prevented the expansion of Medicaid[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] for poor people; alienated women’s rights activists and enacted measures making it harder to vote that principally affected black and young voters.

Republicans say Mr. Tillis has finally gotten his footing and is competitive, maybe even a point or two ahead; private Democratic polling shows a steady advantage for Ms. Hagan of about three points.

The Republican candidate passes up no opportunity to link Ms. Hagan to President Barack Obama, whose favorability in the state is about five points below his mediocre national rating. Obamacare, the scandal over substandard care for veterans and gridlock in Washington are portrayed as Obama-Hagan messes.

Last week, the Tillis campaign was playing up the role of the president and the Democratic senator in the rise of Islamic State and the handling of a potential Ebola epidemic. “Senator Hagan has to be held accountable,” Mr. Tillis said in an interview in Goldsboro. “She has not pounded the table at the Obama incompetence.”

Similar criticism has been leveled at Democrats elsewhere. But Ms. Hagan has an advantage: She can use Mr. Tillis’s unpopular record as fodder for attacks by linking him to the state government’s decisions to defund Planned Parenthood, reject pay equity for women, refuse Medicaid expansion and cut voting opportunities. These issues energize the Democratic base, women and minorities. The conflict is most heated on the topic of education, a top issue this year in North Carolina. Mr. Tillis claims Democrats are falsely accusing him of cutting funding for schools, which he says has increased. Democrats say funding didn’t keep up with population growth and inflation, so the amount allotted was a reduction.

This may be the most expensive race per voter in the United States, with a final tally, counting spending by outside groups, of as much as $100 million. With both sides flush, money probably won’t be a determining factor.

What is critical for Ms. Hagan — Democrats must win this race to have a shot at retaining their Senate majority — is the so-called ground game: the voter identification and turnout effort. Democrats, who report they’ll have 10,000 volunteers, are optimistic, especially when it comes to the black community, agitated by Republican action in state government.

Republicans say that victory depends on holding the libertarian candidate, a pizza deliveryman who drains more support from Mr. Tillis, to under 5 percent of the vote. Ultimately, though, this race will probably be decided by whether voters on Election Day are thinking about their distaste for Mr. Obama and Washington or their negative feelings about Republicans and Raleigh.

The Ebola scare

I promised myself I wouldn’t do it, but I did: While flying from D.C. to Dallas last week, just after the news came out that an Ebola-infected nurse had been allowed to fly while running a fever, I went back and read the opening pages of Stephen King’s ‘‘The Stand.’’

In King’s epic, perhaps his finest, a superflu with a 99.4 percent fatality rate accidentally escapes from a desert laboratory and lays waste to civilization. King being King, supernatural developments ensue for the survivors. But the book is at its most terrifying in the unraveling with which it opens, when the only bogeyman that matters is a hacking cough that spreads and spreads and spreads.

To reread these pages now - in a time of national, well, not panic but least disquiet over the handling of Ebola inside our borders - is to be struck both by parallels and by crucial differences between the scenario King conjured and what we fear today.

The parallels lie, not surprisingly, in the realm of official incompetence. King’s superflu escapes because various computerized safeguards fail; it spreads because of interagency chaos in chasing down patient zero; it compromises a C.D.C. facility whose safeguards turn out to be insufficient. The chaos swirling around the Dallas Ebola infections has followed this kind of pattern: the patient sent home undiagnosed; the unprepared hospital and the infected nurses; the C.D.C.’s weird slowness in taking over; the confident governmental assurances giving way to blame-shifting, double talk and the appointment of a political hack as Ebola princeps ... er ... sultan ... er, czar.

But the differences are interesting as well. King’s novel, infused with 1970s-era paranoia, imagines a government that blunders constantly but is also malignantly competent - brilliant enough to design a superflu capable of killing 99 percent of humanity, tyrannical enough to suppress media reports with martial law and murder, ruthless enough to swiftly spread the superflu behind the Iron Curtain to make sure our enemies go down with us.

This part of the novel’s vision is of a piece with all of modern conspiracy culture, which requires a certain level of omnicompetence to sustain its theories about covered-up alien landings or 9/11 inside jobs.

But conspiracy culture, while always resilient, has had a tough go of it of late. From the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina and various Obama-era debacles, the public has been steadily conditioned to fear government incompetence much more than it fears secret conspiracies against the public good. Instead of the Bilderbergers and the Trilateralists and the cigarette-smoking man, it’s Mike ‘‘heckuva job’’ Brown and George ‘‘slam dunk’’ Tenet and whoever was allegedly in charge of the V.A. hospital system who haunt our collective unconscious these days. People still indulge the occasional ‘‘House of Cards’’-style fantasy of all-powerful political puppetmasters, but what actually scares us is the idea of the Ebola epidemic being managed by the gang from ‘‘Veep.’’

I suspect that’s part of why Obama-era scandals that may actually involve secret government machinations - from the N.S.A. revelations to the harassment of journalists and the politicized overreach of Lois Lerner’s I.R.S. division - haven’t fixed themselves in the public imagination, at least among people who don’t have an explicit ideological or political interest at stake. Wisely or not, Americans have trouble imagining the White House that gave us the HealthCare.gov rollout micromanaging partisan I.R.S. chicanery, or the national security bureaucracy that couldn’t see 9/11 or the Islamic State coming doing anything all that Machiavellian with a firehose’s worth of online data.

Likewise with Ebola: Of course you can find wild conspiracy theories, but the idea of a successful government cover-up - secret body bags, muzzled journalists - is basically laughable. Instead, the baseline anxiety is all about bureaucratic incompetence exacerbated by insouciance, with conservatives fearing that a liberal administration won’t be willing to go far enough - in terms of travel restrictions and quarantines - to effectively contain the disease’s spread.

Because plausible arguments have been offered for and against a travel ban, the administration’s actual response will be an interesting case study. As much as the authorities have fouled up so far, we’ve only had a few infections. If the White House continues to resist calls for more dramatic measures, and we manage to contain Ebola domestically, then the president and his appointees will look more competent and levelheaded than their critics - a result that’s all too rare these days.

Given the track record, however, it’s easy to imagine somewhat less fortunate results, and travel restrictions increasingly seem like an appropriate hedge against ongoing domestic incompetence.

But it would be welcome, and then some, to watch a competent strategy unfold that rendered that opinion obsolete.

And then, our faith in government’s effectiveness partially restored, we can all get back to worrying about what’s being secretly cooked up in the Nevada desert.

In Liberia, the work for ambulances never stops; About 15 crews available in capital, where Ebola cases constantly multiply

Racing along cracked and bumpy roads here, Gordon Kamara shouted into his cellphone over the shrieking sirens of his ambulance. The phone had been ringing nonstop since 5 a.m.

‘‘Not today! Not today!’’ Mr. Kamara, an ambulance nurse, yelled later in the day. ‘‘We are on the opposite side of town!’’

The calls have all been the same in recent weeks: from friends, friends of friends, extended family, complete strangers. All of them have loved ones sick with Ebola and beg him to come quickly. Seven days a week, Mr. Kamara and his crew span Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, in a donated, old American ambulance — with California license plates still attached.

‘‘It never stops,’’ said Mr. Kamara, getting another call the moment he hangs up.

The 15 or so ambulance teams bolting around the city have had many days of hard choices like this. Hundreds of new Ebola cases are reported each week in Monrovia, with many more never accounted for. And over the course of the epidemic, only a small percentage of them have ever made it to a hospital.

‘‘We see it flow through the communities; first one, then many,’’ Mr. Kamara said. ‘‘The map is being painted red with the virus.’’

To confront the spread of Ebola, some community groups have stepped in, motivated by altruism, desperation and, in some cases, political opportunism.

In some neighborhoods, teams of volunteers fan out to track victims and educate households on staving off the virus, though their pockets are so shallow that they often do not have enough supplies, like chlorine, to thwart the epidemic’s advance.

Mr. Kamara does not work for the government. He does not even have a dispatcher to tell him where to go or which patients to pick up. Instead, his team is financed by an opposition member of Parliament, Saah H. Joseph, who imported two used American ambulances to Monrovia this year.

At the end of a recent 15-hour shift, Mr. Kamara took his final patient of the night, a 17-year-old girl, to an Ebola treatment center. Wrought with fever, she had stripped off her clothes in the back of the ambulance and had fallen off the stretcher, lying twisted and barely conscious on the floor.

‘‘If she does not get treatment,’’ Mr. Kamara said, ‘‘she will die.’’

But as soon as they arrived, he and his team were turned away. All the beds were full. The center, meant to house 50 patients, was packed with 85.

‘‘We could either leave her on the ground to die, or return her to die at home,’’ Mr. Kamara said. ‘‘There’s no hope here. We try our best. But we cannot do more than we can do.’’

Most days, Mr. Kamara and his team work from sunrise to long past sunset, often sleeping in the ambulance for rest. On a slow day, he has ferried 10 to 15 new patients from their homes to Ebola treatment centers. On a busy day, the number has been 20 to 30.

‘‘When there are beds at the centers, we can do our work,’’ Mr. Kamara said. ‘‘When there aren’t, we must sit and wait,’’ he added, explaining that his ambulance would sometimes wait outside a hospital for hours, with a patient in the back, until a treatment slot opened up.

Mr. Kamara is no stranger to suffering. More than a decade ago, he worked as a combat medic during Liberia’s civil war.

‘‘It is nothing compared to this,’’ he said. ‘‘The bullets you can get away from. Ebola is hidden within our own families.’’

He takes many precautions at home. With his constant exposure to the virus, he sleeps in a separate house from his six children to prevent them from getting sick. In the past five months, he has seen them only a few times.

‘‘It’s a very lonely virus,’’ Mr. Kamara said. ‘‘Not just for me, but for the entire country. We are all together but all alone.’’

As he returned the 17-year-old girl to her home, Mr. Kamara explained to her brother why they had brought her back.

‘‘We didn’t want to leave her outside and alone,’’ he said. ‘‘We will come back to pick her up tomorrow in the morning and try again.’’

Her brother calmly accepted the news. He thanked the ambulance crew for trying and opened the door as they carried her limp body inside the house.

She died the next morning before the ambulance team could return.

‘Ebola Cruise’ Returns to Texas
By JACK HEALY

GALVESTON, Texas — In the end, there was never any risk of the Ebola virus aboard what became known as the Ebola Cruise.

Last week, the announcement that a passenger on the Carnival Magic was a Dallas lab supervisor who had handled an Ebola patient’s sample transformed a weeklong Caribbean jaunt into a high-seas drama showcasing anxieties over the spread of the virus. Passengers used hand sanitizer, avoided touching railings and offered elbow taps instead of handshakes.

As rumors swirled through the sundecks and dining rooms, the hospital worker and her husband agreed to quarantine themselves in their room. Belize refused to allow the worker to be flown home through its international airport, and Mexico declined to let the ship’s passengers make a day trip to Cozumel. On Saturday afternoon, as the ship headed home, a Coast Guard helicopter swooped in to fetch a blood sample from the hospital worker, to cheers and applause from passengers.

On Sunday morning, the cruise ship returned to port here on schedule, and health officials confirmed that the hospital worker had tested negative for Ebola. She and her husband had been taking their temperatures and never showed any fever or symptoms of the disease. They drove home on their own after leaving the ship before dawn. A few hours later, the remaining 4,000 passengers streamed off the ship.

“We made it!” Christina Castile cheered, throwing her arms skyward as she left the cruise terminal. “Thank the Lord.”

Ms. Castile, 49 from Dallas, and other passengers said they never worried they were at risk of contracting Ebola, which is spread through close contact with a sick person, or their infected bodily fluids. But they said that the lab worker at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, like the Ebola-infected nurse whose flight to Ohio set off waves of panic, could have prevented much of the concern by simply staying home.

“She should have taken on her own more aggressive precautions,” said John Cascio, 63, a Navy veteran and retired electrician. “If you’re in contact with it, you just don’t do things like that.”

Carnival officials said the hospital worker’s movements had not been restricted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when she boarded the cruise ship on Sunday. But the C.D.C. put her and other health-care workers on a more active watch regimen, and on Wednesday federal officials asked that the cruise line’s medical team to monitor the woman.

Aboard the ship, passengers watched news of quarantines, school closings and people being sent home from work, and worried that Ebola fears alone would force them to stay on the ship for the next three weeks.

“We didn’t know what to think, what to do,” said Deborah Louis, 51.

But for the most part, passengers said the cruise carried on as normal, minus the missed excursion to the island of Cozumel. The captain gave regular updates. People continued to pack the dining rooms and the pool. They sent their children down water slides and tweeted photographs of fellow passengers lolling in deck chairs.

“It’s not chaotic at all,” Eric Lupher, a television reporter with 7News in Denver who was on board, said in an interview on Saturday afternoon. “There might be some people hiding in their room, but about 95 percent of the people are still drinking and partying.”

Health officials said the ship did not need any special cleaning, but Carnival said it would nonetheless give the Magic “a very comprehensive and aggressive cleaning and sanitizing,” before it departed for its next voyage later on Sunday. Carnival also offered the passengers half off their next cruise, and gave each person a $200 credit.

Passengers said that by last night, most of the anxieties had evaporated. The ship served champagne with dinner on Saturday night. People thronged souvenir shops to buy T-shirts and jewelry with their $200, or spent it at the bar or in the casino.

“I never saw anybody crying or panicking,” said Victor Baras, as he carried his luggage away from the ship. “It was pretty normal.”

When the Ebola outbreak in West Africa began to escalate a few months ago, the writer Richard Preston was working on a children’s fantasy novel. He dropped that and called David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. “I said, ‘I’ve got to get back to Ebola,’ ” Mr. Preston said. “I’ve got to cover this.”

Mr. Preston first incited public fears about Ebola 20 years ago with “The Hot Zone,”[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/30/books/books-of-the-times-a-visit-to-the-biohazard-battleground.html] his thrillerlike narrative that details the virus’s origins and scientists’ struggle to understand and stop it. The book, which has sold 3.5 million copies, could perhaps be classified as dystopian nonfiction. Stephen King called it “one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever read.” With fears about Ebola rising once more, “The Hot Zone” has been in high demand: Mr. Preston’s publisher has released 150,000 more copies in recent months, and the book has reappeared on the New York Times best-seller list and on Sunday ranked No. 23 on Amazon.

This week, The New Yorker is publishing Mr. Preston’s latest reporting on the virus, a dispatch about the efforts to sequence its genome intertwined with a narrative about a doctor’s doomed effort to treat the disease on the front lines. In a telephone interview, Mr. Preston spoke about his decades-long quest to understand the virus. These are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. It has been more than two decades since you started writing about Ebola. How has your understanding of the virus evolved?

A. It’s changed a great deal. We know a lot more about Ebola in the intervening 20 years. Initially, there were a lot of fears that Ebola could mutate to become the airborne Andromeda strain that would wipe us all out. With what we know now about the genetic code of the virus, Ebola does not travel through the air in airborne form and is very unlikely to mutate that way. Another thing that’s been learned about Ebola is the mutation rate. The virus is continually mutating as it’s moving through the human population. It’s testing out its new environment. One of the biggest concerns is that all of our drugs and tests and vaccines for Ebola need to be adjusted. We can adjust the tests, but we need to watch how the virus is doing. We have a whole bunch of new tools that we never had in the 1990s. We now have the ability to use genetic sequencing machines to read the code of the virus again and again. This is like making a video of the virus moving in real time. We now have our eyes on the enemy.

Q. Some of your descriptions of the virus and its symptoms in “The Hot Zone” have been called inaccurate and hyperbolic. Are you planning to release an updated version of “The Hot Zone” with information related to the current crisis?

A. Yes, I am dying to update the book. I want to make the clinical picture of the virus more clear and accurate. In the original “Hot Zone,” I have a description of a nurse weeping tears of blood. That almost certainly didn’t happen. When a person has Ebola, the eyes can turn brilliant red from blood vessels leaking and blood oozing out of the eyelid. That’s horrifying, but it’s not someone with tears of blood running down their face. I want to fix that. The other thing that’s happening with Ebola today is there have been more outbreaks, and virologists are constructing a tree showing how they are related. The names of the viruses and the relationships have changed, and I want to get that into “The Hot Zone.” Finally, I’m going to put in an introduction in which I place the story of “The Hot Zone” in today’s context.

Q. There are reports that “The Hot Zone” is being developed into a TV series for Fox. Will it be based on the book and the earlier outbreak you covered, or the current crisis?

A. I feel pretty confident that they’re going to want to move the story into the current situation. Fox bought the rights to the book way back when, and there was this attempt by Fox to make a movie out of “The Hot Zone,” and it tended tragically in a Hollywood disaster involving Robert Redford and Jodie Foster and Ridley Scott. But the rights have been sitting at Fox ever since. The original screenwriter for the Fox movie and the producer Lynda Obst teamed up and have proposed a TV series to Fox.

Q. Will the show be fictional or based on your reporting?

A. It’s been the impulse in Hollywood to fictionalize it. I keep telling them: “Don’t do that. Don’t turn it into another predictable Hollywood drama.”

Q. You wrote about the threat of Ebola decades ago, and the fear sort of faded. Is it surreal to see it reappear so dramatically and so close to home?

A. It’s wrenching. We’re getting a feel for the magnitude of human suffering and fear, and it’s awful. I was very surprised when this huge outbreak began and seemed to get bigger and bigger. I’d turned away from writing about Ebola and wrote about the world’s largest living things, the Redwood trees, and most recently, I’ve been writing a fantasy novel for kids that I’ve been working on for years.

Q. Besides its extreme fatality rate, what’s so terrifying about Ebola?

A. Here’s what’s terrifying about Ebola. Ebola is invisible. It’s a monster without a face. With the science that we have now, we can perceive Ebola as being not one thing but as a swarm, and the swarm is moving through the human population and expanding its numbers. It has the qualities of a monster. It’s the most important character in “The Hot Zone.” It’s the nonhuman other that all human beings are contending with in many different ways.

Q. Your brother is the techno thriller and horror novelist Douglas Preston. Do the two of you share writing tips and read drafts of each other’s work?

A. We often talk shop. Doug’s books, quite a few of them have grisly aspects. People will ask us: “I’ve read your books and read your brother’s books and they’re so gruesome. Did you have a terrible childhood?” No, we had a happy childhood. It comes from storytelling around the dinner table. We all just got into the habit of telling weird and interesting stories.

Dozens Declared Free Of Ebola Risk in Texas

DALLAS — At least one chapter of the Ebola saga neared a close here Sunday, as most of the dozens of people who had direct or indirect contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died of Ebola here, had been told by officials that they were no longer at risk of contracting the disease.

Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, Louise Troh, who nursed him in their cramped apartment while he suffered from diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and who was put under state-ordered quarantine, was set to be declared Ebola-free by officials at the end of Sunday. So, too, were the paramedics who drove an ailing Mr. Duncan to a hospital and health care workers who drew or processed his blood. And a mandatory quarantine was lifted for a homeless man who later rode in the same ambulance as Mr. Duncan before it was disinfected.

The 21-day monitoring period ended Sunday and Monday for nearly all the roughly 50 people. It concludes as federal health officials are tightening the guidelines for the protective gear worn by health care workers treating Ebola patients.

Two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas who treated Mr. Duncan — Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson — have contracted Ebola. Although officials have not determined how they became infected, they have focused on their use of personal protective gear. In an appearance on Sunday on the news talk show “Meet the Press,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the federal National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said new federal guidelines for hospitals will be issued requiring personal protective equipment that completely covers all parts of the skin. He said the previous recommendations were based on a World Health Organization protocol designed for treating people in Africa and not for American hospital settings.

“It became clear that we needed to modify that protocol where no part of the body is exposed,” Dr. Fauci said.

At the Pentagon, officials announced they were forming a 30-person military medical team to respond to any additional Ebola cases in the United States and “provide short-notice assistance to civilian medical professionals.” Relatives of Ms. Vinson, one of the nurses treated, released a statement Sunday that said she was cleared to travel by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before her Oct. 10 flight from Dallas to Cleveland, and by Dallas County health officials before her Oct. 13 return flight from Cleveland to Dallas. Before boarding her return flight, she reported her temperature three times, and each time was cleared to fly, her family said.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., had publicly stated that because Ms. Vinson was being monitored, she should not have boarded the return flight, although it later became clear the agency had allowed her to fly.

“Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful,” the statement read. “She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else,” it added.

In a statement, Ms. Troh expressed relief that the Ebola threat in the Texas cases was drawing to a close, but sadness over the death of Mr. Duncan.

“We are so happy this is coming to an end, and we are so grateful that none of us has shown any sign of illness,” Ms. Troh said in the statement. “We have lost so much, but we have our lives and we have our faith in God, which always gives us hope. Even though the quarantine is over, our time of mourning is not over. Because of that, we ask to be given privacy as we seek to rebuild our home, our family and our daily living.”

Ms. Troh — along with her 13-year-old son, Timothy, and the two young men who shared the apartment with her and Mr. Duncan — were removed from the contaminated apartment several days after Mr. Duncan was hospitalized. They were moved to a residence provided by a local benefactor. Local leaders and Ms. Troh’s pastor, the Rev. George Mason, had been looking for a place for them to move but had trouble finding a landlord willing to rent to them. They appeared to have found a single-family rental home for them to move into temporarily. Their old apartment was gutted, and many of their personal belongings were incinerated. “What she wants more than anything else is to get out of there with those boys and, in her language, be an American,” the pastor said. “She’s an American and she wants to live her life and be respected because she’s done nothing wrong.”

An unnamed Dallas philanthropist plans to donate tens of thousands of dollars to Ms. Troh, the officials said.

Michael Wayne Lively, 52, never met Mr. Duncan, but he was rushed to Presbyterian hospital on Sept. 28 in Ambulance No. 37, and that was all it took to drastically change his life for three weeks. Paramedics used the same ambulance to ferry Mr. Duncan to Presbyterian and before No. 37 was taken out of service and decontaminated, they answered the call to pick up Mr. Lively.

Originally from Lumberton, Miss., Mr. Lively has been a homeless drifter in Dallas for years. After Mr. Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, Mr. Lively was being monitored but went missing for a time, spreading fear throughout Dallas that a man at risk of Ebola was wandering the city. He was found, and handed a state-issued order forbidding him from leaving Presbyterian hospital and from receiving any visitors without prior approval.

The order — known as a communicable disease control order — was similar to the one handed Ms. Troh and the three others in the apartment. If Mr. Lively and the others did not comply, they were threatened with criminal prosecution or civil court proceedings. Officials said a total of seven people have received the orders in Dallas — Ms. Troh and the three others; Mr. Lively; and two community members.

All of those whose monitoring was coming to an end had been potentially exposed to Mr. Duncan before he was admitted and put into isolation at the hospital on Sept. 28. They have been released from monitoring in stages. At least 14 of them had been released by Saturday. Others were released Sunday afternoon and some, like Ms. Troh, were released midnight Sunday. A few others may be released after Monday, officials said.

“It’s a significant hurdle for us to get over,” Mayor Mike Rawlings said. “It brings a little bounce in our step, because we know the science is working.”

The Ebola virus has an average eight-day to 10-day incubation period, but federal health officials recommend monitoring exposed people for symptoms for 21 days.

Dozens of others continue to be monitored. On Sunday, federal officials released updated numbers and said they were monitoring 149 people total, including the contacts of Mr. Duncan as well of Ms. Pham and Ms. Vinson. Most of those 149 are health care workers who treated Mr. Duncan. But some of them are passengers on a Frontier Airlines flight that Ms. Vinson took from Cleveland to Dallas the day before she showed symptoms. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said passengers on that flight, and those on Ms. Vinson’s first flight from Dallas to Cleveland, were at low risk.

Ohio health officials reported Sunday that they had been in touch with 153 people across 16 counties who might have contacted Ms. Vinson during her visit there in the days after Ms. Pham was diagnosed, but before it was determined that she, too, had Ebola. None of the 153 had been diagnosed with Ebola, but three were under quarantine, the state reported. It was unclear whether the Ohio numbers were included in or separate from the federal monitoring.

At Summa Akron City Hospital, workers have been practicing their response to an Ebola case. In addition to planned drills, doctors said, there have already been two false alarms in which Summa patients believed themselves to be at risk for Ebola but turned out not to be.

In Spain, officials said Sunday that tests showed that a nursing assistant who had been infected with Ebola has no traces of the virus left in her bloodstream. The medical worker, Teresa Romero, 44, contracted Ebola after caring for priests who got Ebola while doing missionary work in West Africa. Officials said Ms. Romero must undergo at least one more Ebola test to make sure she is virus free.

Frances Robles contributed reporting from Dallas, and Mitch Smith from Akron, Ohio.

A nation of survivors is unbowed by Ebola; Reporter's Notebook

Liberians have become accustomed to living with demons.

Long before Ebola arrived, they endured two decades of civil war that snuffed out 200,000 lives and ignited acts of barbarism that laid waste to Africa’s first independent country. The war produced mad generals who led ritual sacrifices of children before going into battle, naked except for shoes and a gun. It produced amphetamine-fueled 10-year-old fighters wielding M16s while toting teddy bear backpacks, and rapists who wore Halloween masks and wedding gowns.

When it finally ended in 2003, what was left was a nation of survivors, a place were nearly every person of a certain age has a painful story to tell.

I know this all too well; as a native Liberian who emigrated to the United States, my family has our own war stories. One sister was kidnapped and fought to protect her year-old son while marching for days behind rebel lines; another sent her son away to avoid the war and spent two years — two years — hiding deep up country in an area known only as Territory 3C, far from the worst of the conflict, after witnessing gunmen disembowel a co-worker in front of his son.

I have long stopped asking people what happened to them during the war. But as I moved in recent weeks around this city where I was born, reporting about the Ebola epidemic, I became that there is a strength here that I had never before realized.

My friend Wael Hariz, a Lebanese national living here who had been away for several months, said he returned in late September expecting the worst, after watching the coverage of Ebola overseas. Standing just off Tubman Boulevard, Monrovia’s main drag, at midday, he looked at the cars, taxis and pedestrians going by. ‘‘I had forgotten, after what they’ve been through, how resilient people here are,’’ he said.

They came by that resilience the hard way. This is a staggeringly beautiful place, where tropical rainforests give way to pure white, sandy beaches dotted by coconut trees. But the average Liberian lives on $1.25 a day, has no access to clean water and doesn’t have a flush toilet at home. The average Liberian lives with mother, father, aunty, uncle and second cousins, sharing mattresses in cramped two-room shanties painted dark colors to ward off the equatorial sun. When one of those family members gets sick, the average Liberian picks through the muddy potholed dirt roads to Tubman Boulevard to hail a taxi to get to the nearest clinic.

When Comfort Fayiah, 32, was turned away from a private hospital that demanded $450 last month, she gave birth to twins in the dirt near Du Port Road; passers-by surrounded her to try to give her what privacy they could, while a local woman and man delivered the two girls, Faith and Mercy.

The new demon, of course, is Ebola, which has killed more than 2,000 Liberians and struck double that amount, crippled the country’s health system, ground the economy to a standstill and made international pariahs of anyone with a Liberian passport. Those facing it close up are fearful of what could happen and often angry that they are largely left on their own.

But many Liberians are treating the disease with much the same resignation as the killers of the past — accepting that the threat is there and doing their best to navigate around it. They wash their hands with chlorine, they walk up to the laser thermometers at the entrances of public buildings. They still take care of family members who fall ill because there’s no other alternative.

I have been trying to be as unruffled as my former Liberian compatriots, but I’ve been living in the United States for too long now. My tolerance for risk has gone way down.

I have been consumed with worry. My oldest sister is a health care worker in Liberia who is deeply involved in the Ebola response. Another sister, Eunice, is a pensions manager at the Firestone rubber company; every day pensioners line up outside her office 35 miles from Monrovia and reach their hands toward her to receive their checks. My 9-year-old niece, Nyepu, who has sickle-cell anemia, has been locked in the house since July and is bursting at the seams to get out; I have nightmares that she will escape and the worst will happen.

Packing to come here, I brought water rehydration tablets for one sister, a box of latex gloves for the other and a portable DVD player for my niece. Visiting Eunice and her family, I admonished Nyepu not to touch me — I’ve been in an Ebola treatment unit. When Eunice and I took a selfie together to send to our third sister back in the States, we made sure not to touch.

Two days after I arrived in Monrovia, news broke that someone had been diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the first such case in the United States. American officials said they were not releasing the name, citing patient confidentiality, but Liberia’s health minister, Dr. Walter Gwenigale, was having none of it. ‘‘I throw that out the window,’’ he said during a meeting with visiting health officials. ‘‘There is no privacy in Ebola.’’

Just like people in the United States, everyone in Monrovia was talking about the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient in Dallas. The biggest question here was whether the United States would stop Liberians from coming to America. It’s not as if many of them get visas anyway; the fortress that is the United States Embassy, perched on a hill in the diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point, is so barricaded that even a recent high-level American delegation had to wait outside for 20 minutes before being passed through the gates.

But what if President Obama pulls out the United States troops he has sent to build treatment units? When Mr. Duncan died, the first Ebola fatality in the United States, there was suspicion in Monrovia of both governments. ‘‘They wanted him to die, to teach us a lesson’’ not to try to go to America in hopes of surviving the disease, a friend told me.

Her tone was matter of fact. Life here comes with a higher level of risk.

A few days ago, I traveled into the country to cover President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. I stayed overnight in Gbarnga but had to return to Monrovia, four hours away, at 5 a.m. One of the president’s security detail, Varsay Sirleaf, hopped into the car with me. ‘‘She doesn’t want you going alone,’’ he said.

I knew it was pointless to argue. Besides, the road was part dirt, potholed, and dark; one flat tire and I could be done for. About 30 minutes after setting out, on the blackest stretch of the road, the headlights picked up a form on the side. ‘‘Stop!’’ Mr. Sirleaf yelled. ‘‘That’s a body.’’ He jumped out of the car, grabbing a flashlight and a pistol. ‘‘Lock the doors,’’ he said, and took off.

My mind immediately went to the civil war, to magic soldiers jumping out of the bush. It was quiet except for my heart beating.

Finally, Mr. Sirleaf returned. ‘‘He wasn’t dead,’’ he said. ‘‘He was drunk. I woke him up, and he went into the bush.’’

I couldn’t believe he had just gone up to a body on the side of the road. ‘‘It could have been an ambush!’’ I said. ‘‘He could have had Ebola!’’

Mr. Sirleaf looked at me. ‘‘That’s what y’all do in America?’’

He turned back toward the front, looking ahead. Then, he spoke.

‘‘You can’t just leave somebody on the side of the road to die.’’

Life in Ebola quarantine: Locked away for 21 days of fear

The refrigerator in Youngor Jallah’s small apartment broke down last week, and it did not take long for the stench of rotting food to grow unbearable. But when she reported the problem to the front office, the complex’s manager said that a repairman would not be sent until Monday.

That is the expiration date for the 21-day, self-imposed quarantine that Ms. Jallah, her partner and her four children have endured since the day her mother’s boyfriend, Thomas Eric Duncan, was hospitalized with Ebola. Because her mother was at work, it was Ms. Jallah, 35, who last cared for Mr. Duncan, making him tea and handing him a thermometer — but, she said, never touching him — before summoning an ambulance.

The complex’s manager urged Ms. Jallah to move her food to the apartment across the stairwell, which has been empty since a renter decided against moving in after hearing about the neighbors. When the landlord sent a maintenance man to deliver the key, he arrived wearing two pairs of rubber gloves.

So it has been in Quarantine Nation. As the Ebola scare spreads from Texas to Ohio and beyond, the number of people who have locked themselves away — some under government orders, others voluntarily — has grown well beyond those who lived with and cared for Mr. Duncan before his death on Oct. 8.

The discovery last week that two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas had caught the virus while treating Mr. Duncan extended concentric circles of fear to new sets of hospital workers and other contacts.

Officials in Texas said on Thursday that nearly 100 health care workers would be asked to sign pledges not to use public transportation, go to public places or patronize shops and restaurants for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for Ebola. While not a mandate, the notices warn that violators ‘‘may be subject’’ to a state-ordered quarantine.

When officials disclosed that one of the infected nurses had flown from Dallas to Cleveland and back before being hospitalized, nearly 300 fellow passengers and crew members faced decisions about whether to quarantine themselves.

The next day, a lab technician who had begun a Caribbean cruise despite possible exposure was confined to a stateroom. Medical workers, missionaries and journalists returning from West Africa — especially Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where Ebola is rampant — are also staying home.

Howard Markel, who teaches the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, said the quarantines recalled the country’s distant epidemics of cholera, typhus and bubonic plague.

‘‘Ebola is jerking us back to the 19th century,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s terrible. It’s isolating. It’s scary. You’re not connecting with other human beings, and you are fearful of a microbiologic time bomb ticking inside you.’’

While a quarantine is designed to protect those on the outside, it also fuels the community’s fear, and sometimes its cruelty. In Payson, Ariz., paranoia ignited after word spread that a missionary who had traveled to Liberia on a church trip was spending three weeks under a self-imposed quarantine with his wife and four children. The missionary, Allen Mann, strung yellow caution tape and a ‘‘No Trespassing’’ sign around his front door and left a bucket in the yard for neighbors to drop off food and treats for his children.

While most neighbors understood there was scant risk that Mr. Mann, 41, had carried the disease home, rumors nevertheless coursed around town that he had tested positive for Ebola and would soon be medically evacuated. Mr. Mann said an anonymous commentator on a local news website had suggested burning down his house.

‘‘People had this lynch-mob mentality,’’ he said.

As with other aspects of the Ebola response, the criteria for recommending or requiring quarantine have often seemed ad hoc, random and evolving.

In Dallas, the four people who shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan during his brief visit from Liberia have been the only subjects of a state-mandated quarantine.

With their apartment contaminated, they were moved to a residence provided by a local benefactor.

It has been particularly wrenching for Louise Troh, 54, Mr. Duncan’s girlfriend, who has had to mourn his passing in isolation. When her pastor, the Rev. George Mason, arrived to break the news of Mr. Duncan’s death and she collapsed to the floor in tears, he could not console her with a hug.

On his regular visits to the house, he stands three feet away and signals his affection by crossing his arms over his chest.

Mr. Mason said it was not yet clear where Ms. Troh and her 13-year-old son, Timothy, would live once their quarantine ends on Monday. Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s top official, said it had been hard to find a willing landlord.

Ms. Troh has taken comfort in cooking Liberian food and talking to relatives by phone, Mr. Mason said.

She listens to gospel music on a CD player, while Timothy and the two young men in the house, Oliver Smallwood and Jeffrey Cole, kill time watching action movies.

‘‘They all want to get out,’’ Mr. Mason said. ‘‘They want their liberty and to be able to touch and be human beings. But they fear they’re not going to be normal human beings again. When I asked them if they heard about the second nurse, Oliver looked at me and said, ‘Are they going to blame us for that?’’’

The day after Mr. Duncan’s illness was diagnosed, Ms. Jallah and her family received verbal instructions to stay inside. Her partner, Aaron Yah, who had not been exposed to Mr. Duncan, was cleared by county and federal health officials to leave the apartment after four days, the couple said.

After a week, the officials told Ms. Jallah, who has had no symptoms, that she could take occasional trips to the store but should avoid public transportation. She has left the apartment only a few times, partly out of obligation and partly because of the shunning she faces wherever she goes.

‘‘If I even go to the store and I see a fellow Liberian, they run away,’’ Ms. Jallah said. ‘‘They don’t understand. They think we have the Ebola, that’s what they think — that even by speaking to them, saying hi to them, that they’re going to get it.’’ She paused: ‘‘No one wants to die.’’

Ms. Jallah has also had to care for her children, ages 2 to 11, who have been kept out of school, and she and Mr. Yah are still unwelcome at their jobs as nursing assistants.

With so many people indoors for so long, their two-bedroom apartment is predictably chaotic. When not trampolining off the couches, 2-year-old Prophet and 4-year-old King are crashing into each other in pint-size plastic cars. Their wailing is punctuated by the incessant chirp of a smoke alarm in need of a battery. Soap operas blare on the giant-screen television, interrupted by occasional Ebola news updates.

‘‘I don’t have anything to do,’’ Ms. Jallah said, ‘‘just sit here with these children fighting each other.’’

The numbing boredom of confinement competes with the profound anxiety of twice-a-day screenings for fever and other symptoms. The first week, Ms. Jallah could not stop placing her hand on her children’s backs, checking for heat. ‘‘I am surprised that my kids didn’t get sick,’’ she said.

The ordeal is just starting for Byron Watters, 46, and his wife, Tiffany Bramwell-Watters, 39. When the couple saw a photograph on television of Amber Joy Vinson, the second nurse from Dallas infected with Ebola, they realized that Ms. Bramwell-Watters had been sitting next to the nurse in the Cleveland airport during a two-hour weather delay.

‘‘We had contact,’’ Mr. Watters said. ‘‘We’re not sure if the lady spit on her, spoke to her, coughed on her, sneezed on her.’’

The couple’s employers have asked them to stay away from work for at least three weeks, and they have shut themselves into their Dallas apartment. Friends have been dropping off food, and Mr. Watters, an information technology technician, is trying to work from home.

‘‘I’ll probably get on my wife’s nerves,’’ he said. ‘‘But we’ve been married long enough to know when to stay away from each other.’’

American health officials move to stifle ‘hysteria’

Working to halt the spread of Ebola in the United States and quell fears that some say have spread out of control, a top health official said Sunday that tough new hospital protocols were about to be announced, while President Obama cautioned against giving in to ‘‘hysteria.’’

Only a handful of Americans have been infected with the disease and just one person — Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian — has died from it in the United States, while more than 4,000 have died in West Africa. But hundreds of Americans are now being monitored for possible exposure.

On Sunday, a cruise ship that had been denied permission to dock in Belize or Mexico because a passenger had handled one of Mr. Duncan’s test samples, arrived in Galveston, Tex. The worker was found not to have the virus, Carnival Cruise Lines said.

In Ohio, officials announced that residents being monitored for Ebola exposure would not be allowed to leave the country and needed to arrange for additional monitoring if they traveled domestically.

Amber Joy Vinson, a nurse from Dallas, had flown to Cleveland and back after treating Mr. Duncan. She was later found to be infected.

As calls for a ban on travel from West Africa continued to grow, Mr. Obama sought to place the threat in perspective.

‘‘What we’re seeing now is not an ‘outbreak’ or an ‘epidemic’ of Ebola in America,’’ he said in his weekly radio address. ‘‘This is a serious disease, but we can’t give in to hysteria or fear.’’

Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday on NBC’s ‘‘Meet the Press’’ that new guidelines for those working with Ebola patients would require wearing full protective gear ‘‘with no skin showing.’’

Dr. Fauci said the hospital that treated Mr. Duncan had followed World Health Organization guidelines formulated with the African bush in mind and that they would be adjusted to account for more complicated procedures.

Cuba’s Impressive Role on Ebola

Cuba is an impoverished island that remains largely cut off from the world and lies about 4,500 miles from the West African nations where Ebola is spreading at an alarming rate. Yet, having pledged to deploy hundreds of medical professionals to the front lines of the pandemic, Cuba stands to play the most robust role among the nations seeking to contain the virus.

Cuba’s contribution is doubtlessly meant at least in part to bolster its beleaguered international standing. Nonetheless, it should be lauded and emulated.

The global panic over Ebola has not brought forth an adequate response from the nations with the most to offer. While the United States and several other wealthy countries have been happy to pledge funds[http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2014/10/233091.htm], only Cuba and a few nongovernmental organizations are offering what is most needed: medical professionals in the field.

Doctors in West Africa desperately need support to establish isolation facilities and mechanisms to detect cases early. More than 400 medical personnel have been infected and about 4,500[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/case-counts.html] patients have died. The virus has shown up in the United States and Europe, raising fears that the epidemic could soon become a global menace.

It is a shame that Washington, the chief donor in the fight against Ebola, is diplomatically estranged from Havana, the boldest contributor. In this case the schism has life-or-death consequences, because American and Cuban officials are not equipped to coordinate global efforts at a high level. This should serve as an urgent reminder to the Obama administration that the benefits of moving swiftly to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/end-the-us-embargo-on-cuba.html] far outweigh the drawbacks.

The Cuban health care workers will be among the most exposed foreigners, and some could very well contract the virus. The World Health Organization is directing the team of Cuban doctors, but it remains unclear how it would treat and evacuate Cubans who become sick. Transporting quarantined patients requires sophisticated teams and specially configured aircraft. Most insurance companies that provide medical evacuation services have said they will not be flying Ebola patients.

Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday praised “the courage of any health care worker who is undertaking this challenge,” and made a brief acknowledgment of Cuba’s response. As a matter of good sense and compassion, the American military, which now has about 550 troops in West Africa, should commit to giving any sick Cuban access to the treatment center the Pentagon built in Monrovia and to assisting with evacuation.

The work of these Cuban medics benefits the entire global effort and should be recognized for that. But Obama administration officials have callously declined to say what, if any, support they would give them.

The Cuban health sector is aware of the risks of taking on dangerous missions. Cuban doctors assumed the lead role[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/world/americas/in-haitis-cholera-fight-cuba-takes-lead-role.html?pagewanted=all] in treating cholera patients in the aftermath of Haiti’s earthquake in 2010. Some returned home sick, and then the island had its first outbreak of cholera[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article1954303.html] in a century. An outbreak of Ebola on the island could pose a far more dangerous risk and increase the odds of a rapid spread in the Western Hemisphere.

Cuba has a long tradition of dispatching doctors and nurses to disaster areas abroad. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Cuban government created a quick-reaction medical corps and offered to send doctors to New Orleans. The United States, unsurprisingly, didn’t take Havana up on that offer. Yet officials in Washington seemed thrilled to learn in recent weeks that Cuba had activated the medical teams for missions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

With technical support from the World Health Organization, the Cuban government trained 460 doctors and nurses on the stringent precautions that must be taken to treat people with the highly contagious virus. The first group of 165 professionals arrived in Sierra Leone in recent days. José Luis Di Fabio[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/hac/network/who/co_cuba/en/], the World Health Organization’s representative in Havana, said Cuban medics were uniquely suited for the mission because many had already worked in Africa. “Cuba has very competent medical professionals,” said Mr. Di Fabio, who is Uruguayan. Mr. Di Fabio said Cuba’s efforts to aid in health emergencies abroad are stymied by the embargo the United States imposes on the island, which struggles to acquire modern equipment and keep medical shelves adequately stocked.

In a column[http://www.granma.cu/idiomas/ingles/cuba-i/19octubre-articulofidel.html] published over the weekend in Cuba’s state-run newspaper, Granma, Fidel Castro argued that the United States and Cuba must put aside their differences, if only temporarily, to combat a deadly scourge. He’s absolutely right.

La Impresionante Contribución de Cuba en la Lucha Contra el Ébola

Cuba es una isla pobre y relativamente aislada. Queda a más de 7,000 kilómetros de los países africanos donde el ébola se está esparciendo a un ritmo alarmante. Sin embargo, debido a su compromiso de desplazar a cientos de médicos y enfermeros al eje de la pandemia, Cuba podría terminar jugando el papel más destacado entre las naciones que están trabajando para refrenar la propagación del virus.

La enorme contribución de Cuba, sin duda, forma parte de sus esfuerzos por mejorar su estatus en el escenario mundial. Aún así, debe ser aplaudida e imitada.

El pánico que ha generado la epidemia alrededor del mundo no ha producido una respuesta adecuada por parte de las naciones que tienen la capacidad de contribuir. Aunque Estados Unidos y otros países han ofrecido su disposición a contribuir dinero, únicamente Cuba y unas pocas organizaciones no gubernamentales están proporcionando lo que se necesita con mayor urgencia: profesionales médicos dispuestos a atender pacientes.

Los médicos en África occidental necesitan urgentemente apoyo internacional para construir centros de aislamiento y poner en práctica mejores mecanismos para diagnosticar pacientes, antes de que desarrollen síntomas avanzados. Más de 400 profesionales médicos han sido infectados y, aproximadamente, 4,450 pacientes han muerto. Dado que se han diagnosticado unos pocos casos en Estados Unidos y Europa, las autoridades médicas temen que el virus pronto podría volverse una crisis mundial.

Es lamentable que Washington, el principal contribuyente financiero a la lucha contra el ébola, no tenga vínculos diplomáticos con La Habana, dado que Cuba podría terminar desempeñando la labor más vital. En este caso, la enemistad tiene repercusiones de vida o muerte, ya que las dos capitales no tienen mecanismos para coordinar sus esfuerzos a alto nivel.

Para la administración Obama, este dilema tiene que enfatizar la idea de que los frutos de normalizar la relación con Cuba conlleva muchos más beneficios que riesgos.

De los extranjeros que trabajan en África occidental, los médicos cubanos van a estar entre los más expuestos y, es muy posible, que algunos contraigan el virus. La Organización Mundial de la Salud está coordinando la labor de los médicos, pero no está claro cómo manejaría la atención y el traslado de aquellos que llegaran a enfermarse. Para transportar pacientes con ébola se necesitan equipos de expertos y aviones equipados con cabinas de aislamiento. La mayoría de compañías de seguros han dicho que no están dispuestas a trasladar pacientes con ébola.

El Secretario de Estado John F. Kerry elogió el viernes el “coraje de todo profesional médico que está asumiendo este desafío”, e hizo una alusión breve a la contribución de Cuba. El Ejército estadounidense ha desplazado aproximadamente 550 soldados para respaldar a las autoridades médicas en los países afectados. Sería cuestión de sentido común y compasión que el Pentágono les ofreciera asistencia a los cubanos, en caso de que alguno se enfermase. Por ejemplo, debería darles acceso al centro médico que construyó en la capital de Liberia, y ayudar con la evacuación de médicos enfermos. Es indispensable reconocer que la labor de los especialistas cubanos contribuye al esfuerzo mundial.

Sin embargo, las autoridades estadounidenses, insensiblemente, se han rehusado a indicar si estarían dispuestos a brindar algún tipo de apoyo.

Miembros del sector médico en Cuba son conscientes de los riesgos que toman al asumir misiones peligrosas. Médicos cubanos desempeñaron el rol principal en la lucha contra el cólera en Haití, después del terremoto de 2010. Cuando algunos regresaron enfermos a Cuba, la isla tuvo que combatir el primer brote de la enfermedad en una década. Si el ébola llegara a Cuba, representaría un desafío más serio para la isla y la región, lo que elevaría el riesgo de que se dispare el número de casos en el hemisferio.

Cuba ha enviado médicos y enfermeros a zonas de desastre durante décadas. Luego del huracán Katrina en 2005, el Gobierno en La Habana ofreció enviar a equipos médicos para atender heridos en Nueva Orleans. Líderes estadounidenses rechazaron ese ofrecimiento. Pero se alegraron al oír, en días recientes, que Cuba estuviera movilizando un grupo para misiones en Sierra Leona, Liberia y Guinea.

Con apoyo técnico de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, el gobierno cubano capacitó a 460 médicos y enfermeros en cuanto a las estrictas precauciones que son necesarias para atender a los pacientes que padecen un virus altamente contagioso. El primer grupo, conformado por 165 profesionales, llegó a Sierra Leona en días recientes. José Luis Di Fabio, el representante de la entidad de salud, dijo que el equipo enviado a África incluye médicos que han trabajado anteriormente en la región, lo cual los hace aún más valiosos. “Cuba cuenta con un personal de salud muy competente”, dijo Di Fabio, quien es de origen uruguayo.

Di Fabio dijo que las sanciones que Estados Unidos mantiene sobre la isla han generado dificultades para el sector médico, ya que varios centros carecen de equipos modernos y suministros suficientes.

En una columna publicada este fin de semana en el diario del Gobierno cubano, Granma, Fidel Castro argumenta que Estados Unidos y Cuba deben poner a un lado sus diferencias, así sea temporalmente, para combatir una amenaza global. Tiene toda la razón.

Fear of Ebola Closes Schools and Shapes Politics

In the month since a Liberian man infected with Ebola traveled to Dallas, where he later died, the nation has marinated in a murky soup of understandable concern, wild misinformation, political opportunism and garden-variety panic.

Within the escalating debate over how to manage potential threats to public health — muddled by what is widely viewed as a bungled effort by government officials and the Dallas hospital that managed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States — the line between vigilance and hysteria can be as blurry as the edges of a watercolor painting.

A crowd of parents last week pulled their children[http://www.wapt.com/news/hazlehurst-parents-concerned-with-principals-trip-to-africa/29135134] out of a Mississippi middle school after learning that its principal had traveled to Zambia, an African nation untouched by the disease.

On the eve of midterm elections with control of the United States Senate at stake, politicians from both parties are calling for the end of commercial air traffic between the United States and some African countries, even though most public health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a shutdown would compound rather than alleviate the risks[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/business/experts-oppose-ebola-travel-ban-saying-it-would-cut-off-worst-hit-countries.html].

Carolyn Smith of Louisville, Ky., last week took a rare break from sequestering herself at home to take her fiancé to a doctor’s appointment. She said she was reluctant to leave her house after hearing that a nurse from the Dallas hospital had flown to Cleveland, over 300 miles from her home. “We’re not really going anywhere if we can help it,” Ms. Smith, 50, said.

The panic in some way mirrors what followed the anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] attacks of 2001 and the West Nile virus[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/west-nile-virus/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in New York City in 1999. But fed by social media and the 24-hour news cycle, the first American experience with Ebola has become a lesson in the ways things that go viral electronically can be as potent and frightening as those that do so biologically. The result has ignited a national deliberation about the conflicts between public health interest, civil liberties and common sense.

“This is sort of comparable to when people were killed in terror attacks,” said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychology in the department of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine.

Ms. Silver studied and wrote about people who heavily consumed media after the bombings at the Boston Marathon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/boston_marathon/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in 2013 and “what we found is that individuals who were exposed to a great deal of media within the first week reported more acute stress than did people who were actually at the marathon.”

In his work on panic in various disasters, Anthony Mawson, a visiting professor in the School of Health Sciences at Jackson State University in Mississippi, found that while physical danger is presumed to lead to mass panic, in actual physical emergencies “expressions of mutual aid are common and often predominate.” But the threat of an illness that has infected only two people in the United States appears to have had the opposite effect, inciting a widespread desire to hide and shut things down.

“Obviously there’s fear,” said Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in an interview Sunday on ABC. He said fear of the disease is dramatically outstripping current risks. “We always get caught when we say zero,” he said. “Nothing is zero. It’s extraordinarily low, much less than the risk of many other things which happens to them in their lives.”

The health care system, which has urged calm, has at times sent mixed messages that can promote fear. “There are two elements to trust,” said Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon. “One is competence and one is honesty. The hospital in Dallas changed its story three times. So while most people know there are very few cases and this is not an easily transmissible virus, they also know the human system for managing this is imperfect, and they don’t know whether they are getting the straight story about it.”

Republicans, finding both public health and political messages, have made a similar case against the government response.

“If this was one incidence where people thought the government wasn’t doing what the government was supposed to do, it would be much less of a reaction than we see now, where there’s this long list of the government being one step behind, whether it’s the border, the IRS, the Secret Service,” Senator Roy D. Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “Now this health concern is more real than it would be if there wasn’t a sense that the government is just not being managed in a way that people would want it to be managed.”

With fear riding high, Democrats, particularly those running for office, have supported a travel ban.

“Although stopping the spread of this virus overseas will require a large, coordinated effort with the international community,” said Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, a Democrat in a tight race[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/17/?entry=2782&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0], “a temporary travel ban is a prudent step the president can take to protect the American people.”

As is often the case in contemporary American life, parents have been at the forefront of the concerns.

In Mississippi, the middle-school principal who attended a funeral in Zambia was declared healthy by the C.D.C., but he still agreed to take a paid vacation to quell fears. There was no parallel panic over Enterovirus D68, which has infected at least two young children in the state.

Also last week, a teacher at an elementary school in Strong, Me., was placed on a 21-day paid leave when parents told the school board that they were worried he had been exposed to Ebola during a trip to Dallas for an educational conference.

On its website, the Maine district explained that though it had no evidence to support a leave, “the district and the staff member understand the parents’ concerns. Therefore, after several discussions with the staff member, out of an abundance of caution, this staff member has been placed on a paid leave.” In Rock Island, Ill., a Liberian immigrant named Barhyeau Philips said he and his family would be confined to their home for the next few weeks in a voluntary quarantine, unable to go to work or send a child to high school, because of the community response to the arrival of his 21-year-old daughter, Jennifer, from Liberia.

Fear has also manifested itself in commerce. Julian Goldberg, who owns an Army goods store in downtown Louisville, said several acquaintances had urged him to start selling protective gear along with military clothing and equipment. “I hate to see the nation in a state of fright,” he said. “But Ebola was not born yesterday. Even if it had to swim across the ocean, it was going to get here somehow.”

Several schools in the Dallas area closed last week[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/us/obama-may-name-ebola-czar-after-amber-joy-vinson-flight-causes-concern.html] to do deep cleanings after school officials learned that parents of some of the children had been aboard a Frontier Airlines flight with Amber Joy Vinson, one of the two nurses who became infected with the virus after treating the Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan.

Ryan Galloway, whose son is in third grade at Lake Pointe Elementary in Dallas, said he believed that at least half the children stayed home from school Thursday.

“It’s not really much of a crazy, afraid panic where everybody is hiding in their homes like a zombie apocalypse,” he said. “Everybody is not wanting their children to be exposed, obviously, and they are expressing concern, but I wouldn’t say there is crazed panic.”

At the apartment complex where Ms. Vinson lives in Dallas, Tara Wagner, a children’s behavioral therapist, said she saw one resident don a mask. “I thought that it was a sign of ignorance,” said Ms. Wagner, 25, adding that she was bothered that residents from other states seemed to be demonizing Dallas. “I think the hysteria is coming from other cities,” she said. “I am kind of like, ‘Y’all don’t even live here!’ ”

Reporting was contributed by Abby Goodnough from Louisville, Ky., Frances Robles and Jack Healy from Dallas, and John Peragine from Rock Island, Ill.

A Tool to Preserve Passing Moments on a Fickle Internet

Updated, 1:00 p.m. | Added a mention of the underlying software, which is freely available for others to use.

When you use a service like Facebook or Twitter, you are exploring a constantly changing world. New items pop up as you scroll down. The screen morphs as you move past a video that begins to play automatically or click on a button to pull up someone's comments on a post. And that's just now -- both services looked very different just a few years ago and will continue to change.

So how could you share the experience of Facebook as it is today with someone who has never used it? A screen shot of the social network does not convey how it actually works. You could use screen-recording software to follow your every movement on the site, but like the home movies of old, that can be tedious to view.

What makes the Internet special is the ability to delve into the details or follow odd little side roads. On Facebook, that might mean a detour to see the wedding photos of a long-lost friend, or read a heartfelt essay on the death of a parent, or follow the public conversations on topics like the Ebola virus.

Right now, there's no way to preserve that kind of complex, immersive experience. But Rhizome, a New York nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and conserving digital artwork, is trying to build a new kind of data recorder to do just that.

Rhizome has already developed a rough prototype of a tool that records all the content you experience on a website as you click around, then uses that information to create a simulation of the website that you or someone else can explore again however you want.

This week, the organization, which is affiliated with the New Museum, plans to publicly demonstrate the technology, which it calls Colloq. It has recorded the Instagram portion of a performance art project by the artist Amalia Ulman, who assumed four different stereotypical female roles over the course of several months and posted material on Instagram and Facebook under those identities.

As you can see from this sneak peek, the simulation is far better than any screen shot, allowing a user to click on individual photos and see the likes and comments.

''As close as possible, you're going to get the experience of interacting with the actual site,'' said Jon Ippolito, a professor of new media at the University of Maine who has advised Rhizome and is familiar with the tool. ''It is reconstructing it, bit by bit, in a technology that is very close to the original and allows users to explore it interactively the way they could with the original.''

Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome's digital conservator, said the group's initial goal was to help artists preserve their digital works so that future visitors could see them as they were intended to be displayed. Rhizome also plans to make its tool available to scholars conducting social research.

The archiving software was developed in conjunction with Ilya Kreymer, a former programmer for the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, and he has made the underlying code freely available for others to use or modify.

The technology, which is adaptable to many sites, has many potential applications, like capturing important moments in history or culture.

Zachary Kaplan, Rhizome's community manager, said he wished the tool had been around to capture the online discussions about race after the events in Ferguson, Mo., in August. The conversations were prominent for a week or two on networks like Twitter and Facebook but are now hard to pull up. ''If you can't see it, you can't discuss it,'' he said.

Eventually, Rhizome hopes to make a consumer-friendly version of its tool that anyone can use.

Last week, the Knight Foundation awarded Rhizome a $35,000 grant to refine its prototype.

Chris Barr, director of media innovation at the foundation, which provides seed funding to many projects, said Rhizome's preservation goal was important, especially as giant companies like Facebook and Twitter repeatedly change their sites and as services like the once-prominent Friendster and GeoCities shut down.

''These companies are controlling the pipes for large amounts of human information, and their algorithms are changing on a daily basis,'' he said. ''How do we archive and preserve these dynamic experiences that are shaping our culture?''

The work of Rhizome and others who copy content from websites poses some sticky legal and ethical questions. Facebook and many other sites generally have limits on how data from their services can be captured and reused. Rhizome has not yet discussed its simulation tool with the leading social networks, and it is quite possible that they will try to block it.

A spokesman for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment.

Facebook, which has complex privacy rules to limit who can see what, poses special challenges.

Ms. Ulman, who works from Los Angeles and London, said that the Facebook portion of her performance drew far more comments and interaction than the Instagram posts, but she was reluctant to record that. ''No one really knew I was performing,'' she said. ''It would be really complicated to archive that and keep the privacy of people.''

But Professor Ippolito, who is a co-author of a new book on digital preservation called ''Re-collection: Art, New Media, and Social Memory,'' said that giving people the tools to record their activities on Facebook and other sites was important to allow people to regain control over their own data.

''It puts the ability to capture data back in the hands of the individuals,'' he said. ''The user is in the driver's seat, instead of the social network that now owns that user's information.''

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Rhizome's technology recorded a portion of a performance art project posted over several months by the artist Amalia Ulman.

Democrats Diverge From Obama on Ebola

Good Monday morning from Washington, where midterm elections are just over two weeks away, and Republicans currently have a 69 percent chance[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/] of gaining control of the Senate. President Obama is back home in Chicago and heading to the polls early[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/19/?entry=2806] to vote for some old friends, Hillary Rodham Clinton joins Steven Spielberg for a Los Angeles fund-raiser, and opponents of the voter ID law in Texas have vowed to fight on[http://www.texastribune.org/2014/10/18/us-supreme-court-texas-can-enforce-voter-id/].

Ebola may be contained so far in America, but the political impact of the virus is spreading ​rapidly.

Democrats running in conservative states worry that the Obama administration’s stumbling response to Ebola’s arrival in the United States is generating anxiety among voters — and reinforcing the Republican message that the world is a frightening place and President Obama is not equipped to manage it.

​That is why ​we have seen Democratic candidates in ​recent days criticizing the administration’s approach and forcefully urging the president to impose a ban on those traveling to the United States from West Africa.

​Federal health officials ​continue to ​oppose the ban, saying it will do little to contain the disease​, but the public overwhelmingly favors it, polls show​.

With just two weeks to go before Election Day, ​some Democrats are ​growing frustrated with what they see as the ​administration’s mishandling of the crisis and ​want to express their independence from Mr. Obama, who is deeply unpopular in states with pivotal Senate contests.

“Arkansans have every right to be upset,” said Senator Mark Pryor, who is among the most vulnerable of the Democratic incumbents. “Mistakes have been made where mistakes cannot be made.” He appeared Friday with the head of Arkansas’ health department at a news conference. Mr. Pryor and Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina called on Mr. Obama to institute the travel ban, as did Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate nominee in Georgia.

​It was especially striking on Sunday to see so few Democrats, with the exception of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, vigorously defending the president’s leadership on Ebola.​

David Axelrod, the former Obama adviser, ​vented on Twitter[https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/523930905904422914] about the politicizing of the health crisis. “Caustic mix: Public health issue, falling news ratings and pols in the final weeks of election = unconscionable hype and demagoguery.”

– Jonathan Martin

Throwing Cold Water on a Georgia Governor’s Ebola Theory

One of the stranger theories about Ebola surfaced in the governor’s debate on Sunday between the incumbent, Nathan Deal, and the Democratic challenger, Jason Carter.

Mr. Deal faced ridicule for days last week in offering what seems like an easy cure[http://mdjonline.com/bookmark/25941175], readily available in every home.

“Water kills the Ebola virus,” he said in an interview.

It was a remark that quickly evolved into a punch line and which on Sunday he blamed on the state’s public health commissioner.

Mr. Carter didn’t let him off the hook, saying it “was inappropriate last week for the governor to say that water cures Ebola.”

The Libertarian candidate in the debate, Andrew Hunt, a scientist and expert in nanotechnology, also did not spare his criticism of the governor. “We cannot have our leaders making such statements and then not retracting them ever,” he said. “That is bad.”

Colorado Democrats Need Ground Game to Live Up to Reputation

There’s more on the line for Democrats in the Senate race in Colorado than the re-election of Senator Mark Udall.

A Udall victory is essential if the Democrats are going to keep control of the Senate map. But the party’s reputation is at stake, too: Its members want to prove that the voter turnout model pioneered in Senator Michael Bennet’s surprise victory in 2010 and in President Obama’s ability to carry the state two years later still works in their favor.

Mr. Udall is falling behind his Republican opponent, Representative Cory Gardner. Two polls from last week show the senator trailing: CNN[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/colorado-senate-poll/] (four percentage points) and Quinnipiac[http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/colorado/release-detail?ReleaseID=2096] (six points).

There was no let-up over the weekend for both men, with even an upbeat Mr. Gardner acknowledging, “We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.”

At the same time, Mr. Bennet has been reminding voters that he, too, was down in the polls in 2010 but managed to eke out a victory that he said amounted to a difference of about one vote per precinct statewide.

Democrats, after being outspent on television in recent days, say they will also have a significantly larger presence on television than Republican groups for the last two weeks of the campaign.

What We’re Watching Today

President Obama will take advantage of early voting and cast his ballot in Illinois before attending a Democratic National Committee event.

Hillary Rodham Clinton heads to Los Angeles for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fund-raiser with a guest list that includes Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw.

Secretary of State John Kerry is in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the inauguration of Joko Widodo, the president-elect.

Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez, a possible attorney general candidate, speaks about the economy at 1 p.m. at the National Press Club[http://www.press.org/events/npc-luncheon-secretary-thomas-perez-us-department-labor] in Washington.

At Brooklyn High School, Sanders Is Just a Name on the Wall

Bernard Sanders, the Vermont senator, is getting more national attention these days as he weighs a run for president.

But back at his old high school in Brooklyn, Mr. Sanders is not even the most famous political alumnus.

Or the second-most.​

O​ther graduates of James Madison High School include Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom the school’s mock courtroom is named and who graduated in 1950. New York’s senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, got his diploma there in 1967, a year after Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator.

In 2008, Madison High placed Mr. Sanders on its crowded Wall of Distinction, alongside four Nobel Prize winners, famed historians, the radio personality “Cousin Brucie,” and Judith Sheindlin, a.k.a. Judge Judy.

The socialist senator spent that day talking about his experience at Madison High and “how it enabled him to get where he is today,” said Jodie Cohen, the principal.

She called him a “gentleman” and “down-to-earth,” but didn’t recall thinking of him as a future presidential candidate. And even if he made it to the White House, Ms. Cohen didn’t foresee the school’s name being changed.

“But I believe,” she said, “that he would come back.”

What We’re Reading Elsewhere

New York Today: Protesting an Opera

Good morning on this chilly Monday.

The Middle East conflict gets an operatic treatment tonight.

As “The Death of Klinghoffer”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/arts/music/mets-death-of-klinghoffer-remains-a-lightning-rod-.html] opens at the Metropolitan Opera, protesters are expected to gather outside Lincoln Center demanding that the production be canceled.

John Adams’s 1991 opera tells the story of Leon Klinghoffer, a Jewish American who was kidnapped and killed by Palestinian terrorists aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship in 1985.

The protesters say it is anti-Semitic and glorifies terrorism.

Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former Gov. George Pataki and two U.S. congressmen are expected to speak outside Lincoln Center.

And demonstrators plan to protest in 100 wheelchairs during the performance. (Mr. Klinghoffer was a wheelchair user.)

The general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb, has said the opera may be Mr. Adams’s finest work, and the opera house is promoting the production with the slogan: “See it. Then decide.”[http://klinghoffer.metopera.org.proxy.bc.edu/]

Demonstrators appeared outside Lincoln Center on opening night of the Met’s season nearly a month ago.

At the end of the final dress rehearsal on Friday, The Times reporter Stephen Farrell told us, “Mr. Gelb addressed the cast and crew.”

“He said that security had been stepped up outside the opera house, and backstage, in case protesters try to get into the auditorium and disrupt the performance itself.”

On Sunday, Mr. Farrell observed a police car already in place there, and a police community affairs officer posting “No Parking Monday” signs on Columbus Avenue.

“They want to be ready, just in case,” he said.

Here’s what else you need to know for Monday.

WEATHER

Don a beanie[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/03/28/t-magazine/28twoshot-wagoner-slide-28BY/28twoshot-wagoner-slide-28BY-jumbo.jpg]. It’s 43 degrees in Central Park.

The mercury may climb as high as 58[http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&lon=-73.96940231323242#.VETRDkh8FI6] but the wind chill will hunker in the 40s.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Ebola victims.

The Spanish nurse who was the first person to contract Ebola outside West Africa has now tested negative for the virus.

An Ebola symposium is part of the annual World Health Summit in Berlin today, and European Union foreign ministers address the outbreak in Brussels.

• Campaign business.

President Obama finishes a two-day campaign swing in Illinois today after a week of addressing the Ebola crisis.

On Sunday, he visited rallies[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/us/back-on-trail-obama-aids-maryland-democrat.html] at a Maryland high school and a Chicago gymnasium for the states’ Democratic candidates for governor.

• A morning of calm.

After three consecutive nights of confrontations between the police and protesters in Hong Kong, the protests turned quiet after midnight[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/world/asia/hong-kong-protester-arrested-in-inciting-others-to-confront-police.html] today.

Two pro-democracy lawmakers quieted the crowd, while the police said they would reduce the number of officers deployed.

• Search for hikers ends.

Nepal ended rescue operations[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/86276ad7629145c3977d6f35bcf7a177/rescue-operations-cut-down-nepal-trekking-trail] today in its northern mountains, saying it believed all hikers stranded by a series of blizzards and avalanches that left dozens dead have been rescued.

• Departures at the top in Japan.

Two ministers appointed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet only a month ago stepped down today. Both women had been accused of election improprieties.

• From rags to ruler.

Joko Widodo, who was born in a slum, was sworn in today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/asia/joko-widodo-is-sworn-in-as-indonesian-president.html] as president of Indonesia, completing an improbable rise to lead the world’s fourth most populous nation.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are mixed to start the week.

European markets ended down about 1 percent after SAP and Philips[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-20/europe-index-futures-rise-after-four-week-rout-for-stocks.html] disappointed investors. Japanese stocks[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/19/business/19reuters-markets-global.html] led a rally in Asia.

• IBM blamed a “marked slowdown in client buying behavior” in September for its weaker third-quarter profits, announced today.

IBM also said it would pay an Abu Dhabi company $1.5 billion to take over its unprofitable chip-manufacturing operations.

• Apple releases its quarterly earnings after the market closes, but the period does not include the record-breaking first weekend of sales for its new iPhones.

The company also opened Apple Pay, its mobile payment system,[https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/apple-pay/] for business today.

• Marc Andreessen, the tech investor, said today that he is leaving eBay’s board[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/20/business/20reuters-ebay-director.html].

He had been warring with the activist investor Carl Icahn over whether the company should spin off PayPal, which it recently agreed to do.

• Another 200 of McDonald’s Russian restaurants underwent safety inspections, in what many see as retribution for Western sanctions over Russia’s Ukraine involvement.

OVER THE WEEKEND

• Texas’ voter identification law was upheld by the Supreme Court, leaving in place a rule requiring voters to have government-issued photo ID for the November election.

BACK STORY

The justices of the Supreme Court, who returned to the bench this month for the new term, have the ultimate job security: They can stay for life.

Still, some call it quits. Of the 112 justices in all, 54 retired or resigned.

At the moment, there are three former justices still living.

John Paul Stevens, the third-longest-serving justice, retired in 2010 after 35 years. The 94-year-old released a book[http://www.npr.org/2014/04/26/306837618/justice-stevens-six-little-ways-to-change-the-constitution] in the spring suggesting some tweaks to the Constitution.

Sandra Day O’Connor, the court’s first woman, had said she wanted to stay longer, but retired in 2006 because her husband was ill; he died in 2009.

She has remained active since leaving the court, even filling in[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/SB124994271588320565] on federal appellate courts across the country.

David Souter, never a creature of Washington[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/02/AR2009050202248.html], has kept a lower profile since retiring in 2009. He returned to New Hampshire, where he reads and occasionally hears cases.

As he told The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/retired-justice-david-h-souter-the-luckiest-guy-returns-to-his-books/2011/09/10/gIQA0Iw0KK_story.html] in 2011, “I drove north from Washington with no regrets about the prior 19 years or about the decision to try living a more normal life for whatever time might remain.”

Good evening.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Their day in court.

Plans for jury selection [http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/10/20/tsarnaev-lawyers-due-court-boston-marathon-bombing-case/wHqk2xANsxNbzNwTtk0TxN/story.html]began today for one of the men accused in the Boston Marathon[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/boston_marathon/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] bombing. (The other, his older brother, was killed.)

Meanwhile in Washington, a Libyan militant suspected of being the ringleader in the 2012 attack on American diplomats in Benghazi pleaded not guilty[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/militant-pleads-guilty-benghazi-attacks-26316715].

Trials of people accused of terrorism — in American courtrooms — present a multitude of hurdles, but making sure these men have a jury of their peers is not one of them, says Adam Liptak, our Supreme Court correspondent.

“The supposed right to a trial by a jury of your peers is an adage, not a legal doctrine,” he says.

“The Constitution guarantees only the right to an impartial jury, and the Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a cross-section of the community,” Mr. Liptak says.

“But there is no requirement that the members of the jury share the accused’s distinctive characteristics.”

• Fighting another outbreak.

“Calls for an Ebola travel ban are more reflective of the divided political climate than of any actual public health need.”

That’s our business reporter Jad Mouawad, on how the travel industry sees the some politicians' demands[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/us/fear-of-ebola-closes-schools-and-shapes-politics.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=first-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] that travelers from West African countries ravaged by the Ebola outbreak be kept out of the United States.

Most public health experts remain convinced that travel bans don’t stem the spread of epidemics, he says, and believe that instituting one now “would do more harm than good.”

“It would further cripple societies that are struggling to cope with the epidemic and make travel by international aid workers a lot harder,” Mr. Mouawad says.

And anyway, he adds, “it could never guarantee with 100 percent certainty that it would stop sick people from entering into the United States.”

• Big deal.

Headline after headline today declared that Warren Buffett[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/warren_e_buffett/index.html?inline=nyt-per] had lost $1 billion[http://www.cnbc.com/id/102102189] — “before lunch,”[http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/10/20/warren-buffett-just-lost-1-billion-on-this/] some added.

The problem was a sharp drop in IBM’s stock in premarket trading. Mr. Buffett’s immensely profitable investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, has a 7 percent stake in the information technology giant.

But our financial columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin, says Mr. Buffett is such a big player, you could write those headlines all the time.

“I’m sure last week when the market was down, he lost several billion dollars,” Mr. Sorkin tells us.

“And I’m sure when the market came back on Friday, he made several billion dollars more.”

Mr. Sorkin says that, “Given that his company is worth 300-some-odd billion dollars, a billion dollars in a day is a walk in the park, a big zero.”

“Pocket lint to him.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed up. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.9 percent.

TONIGHT

• Food science.

The “Top Chef” icon Richard Blais treads through at least a little of Alton Brown’s former territory, looking at the science and psychology of food choices in “Hungry Games.”[http://blog.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2014/09/food-network-hungry-games-richard-blais/]

Beijing Donates $6 Million for Food Aid in Ebola Fight
By JESS MACY YU

The Chinese government, eager to show it is committed to the fight against the Ebola epidemic, announced on Monday that it was donating $6 million to the United Nations World Food Program. The assistance is to be divided equally among the three West African countries hardest hit by the epidemic: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The donation comes as the outbreak has contributed to serious food shortages. Borders and markets have been closed, flights have been canceled and livestock and crops have been abandoned as people try to flee to areas perceived to be safer.

The World Health Organization has said the epidemic, which since March has infected more than 9,200 people and killed nearly 5,000, is on the verge of widening into a food crisis. At a meeting at the United Nations compound in Beijing on Monday, a spokesman for the World Food Program said that China’s donation would help the agency purchase vital food staples such as rice, lentils and fortified cereals to feed 300,000 people for one month.

The World Food Program is seeking to raise $179 million by February for emergency food aid to help patients in Ebola treatment centers, increase supplies in affected areas and feed Ebola survivors, many of whom have suffered severe weight loss because of the disease and need enhanced nutrition during recovery.

China is one of 10 countries that have contributed to the World Food Program’s effort, joining the United States, which donated $12.6 million, and Japan, which gave $6 million. The donation announced on Monday brings the Chinese government’s contribution in the fight against Ebola to $38 million, portions of which have gone to the World Food Program, the World Health Organization, the African Union and directly to individual African countries.

The latest donation comes after China, which is a leading trading partner to many African countries and whose companies are heavily invested in the continent, has been urged to take a more active role in the Ebola fight. With about one million Chinese citizens living in Africa, including 20,000 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, China has also faced criticism for not sending as many personnel as the United States, which has committed 4,000 troops to West Africa this month and donated $175 million.

Chinese officials have portrayed China as being at the forefront of the Ebola fight, emphasizing the importance of humanitarian aid in Chinese foreign policy. At the meeting on Monday, Liu Junfeng, deputy director general of the Department of Aid to Foreign Countries, reiterated that China was one of the first countries to respond to the Ebola crisis, sending medical teams and equipment, and helping distribute rations on the ground in Liberia and Guinea. In September, two Chinese aircraft also arrived in Africa carrying mobile laboratories for Ebola disease control and prevention.

“Humanitarian aid plays a vital role in Chinese foreign policy; it shows that China reacts to international appeals, providing aid and cash to minimize the impact of disasters,” Mr. Liu said. “With regard to the food shortages, China considers this of great importance, and has pledged $2 million to each of three countries to provide food aid to the local population.”

The World Food Program’s director for China, Brett Rierson, praised the Chinese government’s efforts to address the crisis. But he suggested on Monday that Chinese companies could be doing more, given their considerable commercial interests in Africa.

“What I see here is the Chinese government stepping up, the health workers putting their lives on the line, and the general public stepping in, for instance with an online donation platform that will be launched in a few weeks by Tencent,” Mr. Rierson said, referring to a popular Internet portal in China. “But what I am asking is, where are the Chinese billionaires and their potential impact?”

Citing the recent $50 million donation from the foundation of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and $25 million from Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to fight Ebola, Mr. Rierson expressed hopes that wealthy Chinese individuals and corporations would do more.

Obama Returns to Trail With a Blue State Focus

Late Edition - Final

UPPER MARLBORO, Md. -- President Obama jumped back on the campaign trail Sunday after a week of grim Ebola news, with a rally at a high school here aimed at lifting the fortunes of Anthony G. Brown, the state's lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for governor.

In a jam-packed gymnasium, Mr. Obama urged the mostly African-American crowd of 8,000 to shake off any midterm malaise and show up on Nov. 4 to put Mr. Brown in the governor's mansion.

''There are no excuses. The future is up to us,'' the president said, his voice rising above the roar of the enthusiastic crowd. ''If you want better policies out of Washington, you've got to vote for them. If you want better policies in Maryland, you have to go vote for them.''

Mr. Obama accused Republicans of betting that Democrats will not show up in November. But, he insisted, ''I'm banking that strategy is not going to work.''

The latest Washington Post poll in Maryland showed Mr. Brown with a nine-point lead over Larry Hogan, his Republican challenger. But the survey also showed Mr. Brown, who is black, drawing only 77 percent of African-American voters. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 97 percent of the black vote in the state, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research.

At the rally, Mr. Obama urged the audience to reject a Republican philosophy that he said had been thoroughly discredited in recent years.

''They keep on offering the same tired, worn-out theories,'' Mr. Obama said of the Republicans, citing tax breaks, looser regulations and a reduced safety net. ''We have tried all those things. We tried 'em before I came into office. We know they did not work.''

Before Mr. Obama's speech ended, a steady trickle of people had departed, leaving some empty seats. And an immigration activist interrupted the speech, holding a sign demanding that ''#Not1more'' immigrant be deported. As the crowd bellowed the protester away, Mr. Obama suggested that he ''should have been protesting the folks that are blocking'' an immigration overhaul.

Mr. Obama's appearance on behalf of Mr. Brown and a rally scheduled later in the day for Pat Quinn, the Democratic governor of Illinois, were the president's first small steps back on the campaign stage ahead of the midterm elections. The two candidates are eager for the star power that Mr. Obama still brings when it comes to firing up the core constituencies in the party: women, African-Americans, Latinos and gays.

In Chicago, an energized Mr. Obama whipped up a crowd at a gymnasium at Chicago State University, urging people to support Mr. Quinn when early voting begins on Monday.

''You've got to grab your friends. You've got to grab your co-workers,'' Mr. Obama told about 6,200 people, adding that he planned to vote on Monday morning in Chicago.

Mr. Quinn, who is running against Bruce Rauner, the Republican nominee, is a longtime Obama friend. The president described him as someone who is not slick, not packaged -- someone who deserves the votes of people in Illinois.

''Pat is real. He is who he is. He's not trying to front. He's not trying to pretend,'' Mr. Obama said. ''He's out there fighting for you.''

The president has been delivering a campaign stump speech for months, but only at fund-raising events, and largely for high-dollar donors who have helped to provide Democratic candidates a financial edge this season.

In those events, Mr. Obama has been unapologetic about his policies, arguing that they have repaired an economy that was in tatters, increased domestic energy production, restored home values and reduced the school dropout rate.

At the fund-raisers, Mr. Obama has also been critical of Republicans in Congress, a group that he says has blocked a vision that a majority of Americans share. He has urged the donors to fight against what he calls a ''congenital problem'' for Democrats: their unwillingness to turn out in midterm elections as they do in presidential years.

Mr. Obama's return to the public stage with a similar message is intended to help solve that problem in the final stretch, as Democratic candidates seek to ensure that their must-have voters show up on Election Day.

But the visits to Maryland and Illinois were also a reminder of where the president's message is not welcome -- the many conservative-leaning states where Democratic Senate candidates are struggling because of the president's sinking popularity.

Maryland and Illinois are, after all, heavily Democratic states where the candidates should have little trouble winning elections. The fact that Mr. Obama used his valuable time to campaign there, with only 16 days left, was proof that his power to help is severely constrained.

White House officials had once hoped to help Democratic candidates drive an economic-themed message focused on the minimum wage and issues of importance to women.

Instead, the president has had to attend to one crisis after another: the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the downing of a passenger plane there; the escalation of the conflict in Iraq and Syria; the beheading of Western hostages; the angry protests in Ferguson, Mo., in the wake of the killing of an unarmed black youth; and, most recently, the Ebola virus in West Africa and the United States.

It is unclear exactly how those crises will affect the outcome of races next month. But it is certain that they have diverted the president's attention from the message he had hoped to deliver. And his handling of the foreign crises is increasingly unpopular, adding to the worry among Democrats.

China Versus America

Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
SINGAPORE — Let us take it as a given that the post-1945 world order with the United States as dominant nation has begun to unravel, that China is rising to inherit the earth, that the unease of our times has much to do with that difficult transition, and that violent conflict is a normal accompaniment to the passing of the baton from one great power to the next. America stood tall at the end of World War II. It also stood on a vast field of corpses.

Let us further posit the far-fetched hypothesis that humankind has learned from history. It must then be determined to avoid another conflagration. Happy talk of hyper-connectivity is not enough. The dream of the victory of enlightened self-interest in the name of the collective good on a shrinking planet was an ephemeral late 20th-century illusion. What will matter above all is the capacity of the United States and China to avoid fatal misunderstanding. In a state of mutual incomprehension, clashing interests will escalate.

How far China and America are from understanding each other became clear to me the other day as I listened to George Yeo, the former Singaporean foreign minister. He set out his view of the United States as a “missionary” power filled with the righteous conviction that it must usher the earth to liberty and democracy, and of China as an anti-missionary power convinced by its own bitter experience of foreign domination that nonintervention in the affairs of other states is a necessary form of respect. Far from cynical exploitation, Yeo argued, China’s non-judgmental approach to other powers was above all a reflection of its own history, a form of moral rectitude. The West’s perception of Chinese bullying and ruthless mercantilism was just plain wrong.

Yeo is a highly intelligent and thoughtful man with a deep knowledge of China and considerable experience of life in America. I can’t help seeing cynicism in China’s readiness to extract resources from the realms of dictators or democrats and its unreadiness to do as much as America in stopping Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or the killers who call themselves Islamic State. I am sure that, for President Xi Jinping of China, the sight of America getting enmeshed in another Middle Eastern skirmish has its satisfactions. But Yeo made me wonder. Can the missionary mindset begin to comprehend the non-missionary worldview, or even accept such categorization?

The core problem is two forms of exceptionalism, the American and the Chinese. The United States is an idea as well as a nation. Americans, even in a battle-scarred inward-looking moment such as the present, are hard-wired to the notion of their country as a beacon to humanity. President Obama’s foreign policy is unpopular in part because he has interpreted a popular desire to regroup as license to be satisfied with hitting singles and avoiding strike-outs. That is the attitude of an unexceptional nation, which can never be America’s self-image.

But Chinese exceptionalism is no less powerful. It holds up China as a uniquely non-expansionist power over millennia of history, bringing harmony in a Confucian expression of its benevolence — a China standing in contrast to the predatory West. The Communist Party, with its mantra of “peaceful rise,” has fashioned an effective pillar of its ideology through the integration of Middle Kingdom thought. As Joe Studwell, the author of “How Asia Works,” put it to me in an e-mail, the party with “not much socialism to cling to, has reached into Middle Kingdom exceptionalism by resurrecting Confucius, starting Confucius Institutes all over the world.” The result, as Yuan-kang Wang, an associate professor at Western Michigan University, has written in Foreign Policy[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/05/the_myth_of_chinese_exceptionalism], is a widespread belief in “historical China as a shining civilization in the center of All-under-Heaven, radiating a splendid and peace-loving culture.”

Exceptionalism, in all its forms, is tenacious. Tell Tibetans about China’s peace-loving culture. Tell Iraqis about America’s dedication to liberty. The contradictions, and failings, within the beliefs do not diminish them. I believe, still, in the overall beneficence of American power, the fundamental yearning of the human spirit for freedom, and the unique American identification with that desire. Xi’s clampdown on the Internet, his attempt to clean up corruption when corruption must be endemic to any one-party state, his expansionism in the South China Sea, and his difficulties with a stubborn pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong all strike me as demonstrating the internal contradictions of “harmony” and “peace” within a Chinese system that has generated prosperity but increasingly stifles the open debate more prosperous people want.

Europeans, with their experience of 20th-century devastation, would argue that all forms of exceptionalism are dangerous, the missionary and non-missionary equally so. They have settled for less in the interests of quiet. America and China will not do that in the foreseeable future, and so their relationship must be viewed with guarded pessimism. In war’s aftermath there are no exceptions to human suffering.

The New Health Care
The Upshot
On an Antibiotic? You May Be Getting Only a False Sense of Security

The best way to prevent transmission of Ebola in the United States is to identify and quarantine those with the disease as soon as possible. However, the first Ebola patient in this country was, unfortunately, released after going to an emergency room, even though he had symptoms indicative of the disease. He was sent home on antibiotics[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

The antibiotics were, of course, of no use in treating Ebola. They’d be of no use for any viral infection, for that matter. Even if the patient had actually had a sinus infection[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/sinusitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], as his doctors initially believed, antibiotics probably wouldn’t have done much[http://summaries.cochrane.org.proxy.bc.edu/CD000243/ARI_antibiotics-for-acute-maxillary-sinusitis] for that either.

Yet antibiotics are regularly prescribed in this manner. Cases like this highlight a real, but often ignored, danger from their overuse: a false sense of security.

As a pediatrician and a parent, I’ve seen many protocols and procedures that require the use of antibiotics for a number of illnesses that may not necessitate them. These plans are in place, ostensibly, to protect other children from getting sick. They rest on the idea that someone on antibiotics is no longer contagious.

This is, tragically, often not the case. If you’ve had a small child with pinkeye, you know that few diseases can get your toddler banned from preschool faster. Most of the time, he will not be able to return to school until he has been on antibiotic drops for 24 hours[http://www.webmd.com/children/features/your-child-too-sick-for-school].

This assumes, of course, that the pinkeye is caused by bacteria. Often, it is not. Up to 20 percent of conjunctivitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/conjunctivitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] can be caused by adenovirus alone. Pinkeye caused by a virus will be completely unaffected by any antibiotic drops; children will be infectious long after receiving them. Moreover, physicians are pretty much unable to distinguish between[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC214099/#!po=50.0000] bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.

Even if we were, there’s little evidence than 24 hours of antibiotic drops do much of anything to render a child noncontagious. Most of the outcomes studied include things like “early microbiological remission,[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.bc.edu/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001211.pub3/full]” which means eradicating the infection by Day 2 to 5 of therapy. However, some children still haven’t achieved this outcome even by Day 6 to 10. Drugs simply work differently in different people.

Strep throat[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/strep-throat/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] isn’t much better. Resistance in group A streptococcus, the cause of strep throat, is negligible. Yet even with proper therapy, it can be very difficult to eradicate the pathogen from carriers[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/6105559?dopt=Abstract]. This has led to outbreaks among family members and closed communities even when people are properly treated.

Even in the best-case scenario, being “on an antibiotic” isn’t much protection for others. And often, antibiotics offer no protection at all.

Only about a quarter of children who have acute respiratory tract infections[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/134/4/e956.long] (including sinus, ear, throat and bronchial problems) have an illness caused by bacteria. But about twice that number are prescribed antibiotics for their symptoms. These extra drugs provide no useful benefit. Although they might make the patients feel better through a version of the placebo effect,[http://nyti.ms/1xJZENG] they certainly don’t prevent transmission of nonbacterial pathogens from one person to another. So if they give people a false sense of reassurance that they are no longer contagious, leading them to relax their usual precautions, the antibiotics are most likely doing harm. (This is separate from the other kind of harm usually associated with antibiotic overuse: stimulating resistance in either the bacteria you’re trying to treat, or in other bacteria that happen to be present in the body.)

Every time a patient comes to the office with an upper respiratory infection[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/common-cold/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and we prescribe an antibiotic, we imply that we’ve taken care of the problem. We give patients an incorrect impression that the drug will make them better, and will begin to kill off the germs affecting them. We also give the impression that they will be less of a risk to their friends, family and close contacts. After all, they’re “on an antibiotic.”

Confronted with this information, physicians will often fall back on the excuse that their patients “demand” it. But too often, it’s physicians, not patients or parents, who are the problem.

A study published in 1999[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/10103291] in the journal Pediatrics examined expectations and outcomes regarding visits to the pediatrician for a child’s cold symptoms. The only significant predictor for an antibiotic prescription was if a physician thought a parent wanted one. They wrote one 62 percent of the time when they assumed a parent expected a prescription, but only 7 percent of the time when they thought parents didn’t. However, it turned out that the doctors often guessed wrong as to what parents actually desired.

Another study, published in 2003[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/14634611] in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, had similar findings. Doctors were more likely to prescribe an antibiotic for diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] when they assumed that patients expected it, but they correctly guessed patients’ expectations only a third of the time. Physicians were also more likely to prescribe antibiotics for patients with bronchitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/bronchitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and other respiratory infections if they believed patients wanted them, but correctly identified those expectations only about a quarter of the time[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/17467120]. In yet another study, physicians even prescribed antibiotics to 29 percent of patients who didn’t want them[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/14521641].

It’s time that we stopped viewing the overuse of antibiotics as a victimless crime. According to reports[http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/12/records-chart-ebolas-march-through-body/], Thomas Eric Duncan showed up in the emergency room with a 103-degree fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a headache[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/headache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and abdominal pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/abdominal-pain/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. He rated that pain an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. After receiving tests, he was thought, perhaps, to have sinusitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/sinusitis-chronic/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and was given an antibiotic. I cannot guess what was in the physicians’ heads that day, but I think it’s likely they thought the antibiotics would do little harm, and potentially some good.

We physicians may believe that antibiotic prescriptions are what patients want, but it may be time to recognize that they are sometimes more for us than for them. Moreover, the false sense of security they provide may do more harm than good.

W.H.O. Declares Nigeria Free of Ebola

GENEVA — The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] declared Nigeria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/nigeria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Africa’s most populous nation, officially free of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] infections on Monday, calling the outcome the triumphal result of “world class epidemiological detective work.”

The announcement came 42 days after the last reported infection in Nigeria’s outbreak, twice the maximum incubation period for the Ebola virus.

The Nigerian response was upheld by the W.H.O. as an example of the measures other countries can take to halt the spread of the epidemic, which is concentrated in the three West African countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

“This is a spectacular success story that shows that Ebola can be contained,” the W.H.O. said in a report on its website[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/20-october-2014/en/index2.html]. But it also expressed caution that Nigeria cannot relax its defenses against the deadly virus.

More than 9,000 people have become infected and more than 4,500 people have died in the epidemic, and the number of infections is still doubling every month, the W.H.O. has reported.

Although infection rates have slowed in some districts of the three worst affected countries, the organization has also reported the spread of the disease to new areas, including districts of Guinea bordering Ivory Coast.

Nigeria’s outbreak started in July when Patrick Sawyer, an American of Liberian descent, traveled by air from Liberia to Lagos, the country’s biggest city, starting a chain of infection that spread the disease to 19 other people and resulted in eight deaths.

Mr. Sawyer died five days after arriving, but the disease spread to Port Harcourt, Nigeria’s oil industry[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] hub, after a close contact of Mr. Sawyer’s flew there for treatment, adding to fears that Nigeria faced what could become West Africa’s worst epidemic.

Nigeria’s success in averting that outcome started with the action of Ameyo Stella Adadevoh, a doctor at First Consultant Hospital in Lagos who diagnosed the Ebola virus in Mr. Sawyer and later died of the disease. Together with Benjamin Ohiaeri, the hospital director, Dr. Adadevoh had insisted on keeping Mr. Sawyer isolated despite threats of legal action by Liberian officials demanding his release.

Other important Nigerian actions cited by the W.H.O. included the quick response and close coordination of public health authorities and international organizations to isolate and treat patients, and the detective work of contact tracing teams.

The teams drew on the experience of Nigeria’s anti-polio program to identify and monitor on a daily basis nearly 900 people who had contact with those infected with the disease.

Still, Nigeria, like Senegal, which was declared free of Ebola on Friday, is susceptible to new cases by virtue of its proximity to the West African epicenter, health authorities warn.

Nigeria also is at risk of becoming a victim of its own success. The W.H.O.'s representative in Nigeria, Rui Gama Vaz, said that Ebola patients in the epicenter may now seek entry to Nigeria in an effort to get lifesaving care.

“Many desperate people in heavily affected countries believe that Nigeria must have some especially good — maybe even “magical” — treatments to offer,” a W.H.O. statement said.

Obamacare losing power as a weapon; Letter From America

Remember the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s signature health care plan? Of course you do: For four years, it was at the epicenter of a vicious partisan battle in the United States, the subject of town meetings, congressional debates and talk show vitriol, not to mention the target of more than 800,000 negative television ads that cost an estimated $450 million.

Then there was the disastrous rollout in late 2013, caused by computer glitches that cost the program precious credibility at a critical time.

That’s what most people remember — which might explain why some Republicans seeking election next month are still running attack ads against the health care law. The problem with that narrative is the program is proving to be a success, and yet the health care initiative — arguably the most significant piece of social legislation in decades — is no longer a prominent part of the Democratic agenda.

‘‘The program has turned a corner,’’ said Anton Gunn, a former South Carolina state legislator and health care expert, now on a fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. According to government figures released in September, 7.3 million people had signed up and paid for health plans delivered by state and federal exchanges as of mid-August; the total is more than 10 million if children on parental plans are included, according to Mr. Gunn.

Not bad for a program that opponents argued would ruin small businesses, put families at risk, force citizens to drop existing insurance policies and generally destroy America with a lethal dose of European-style socialism.

Never mind that most Europeans like their health care systems, and were typically horrified to learn that some 40 million Americans had no health insurance at all. The fact that the number of uninsured is now dropping should be good news not only for the United States itself, but also for its image in the world.

Yet Democratic candidates are largely shying away from the issue in this election season, as described in a recent talk at Harvard by Amy Walter, an editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan group that analyzes campaigns. Democrats have calculated that they have nothing to gain by bringing it up. For one thing, most Americans are unaffected by the new plans because they are insured through their employer. For another, health insurance is the kind of complicated issue that gets little traction on the campaign trail.

What does resonate in the Republican-leaning states is the word Obamacare, the informal if widely used name for the program that serves as a handy proxy for an increasingly unpopular president. This is where the ads have had their biggest effect. ‘‘They don’t like him, so they don’t like it,’’ said Mr. Gunn.

But as the program picks up enrollees, even Obama-bashers are having to shift targets. ‘‘It’s not the focus of the G.O.P. anymore,’’ Mr. Gunn said. ‘‘They’re onto other issues — ISIS, Ebola, which I’m sure they’ll figure out a way to blame Obama for.’’

Already, some of the health program’s fiercest opponents are turning themselves into pretzels over the issue. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, running for re-election in Kentucky, has argued that ‘‘the best interest of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare, root and branch,’’ while at the same time, defending Kentucky’s health insurance exchange, which has enrolled 500,000 people.

Experts expect enrollment to climb to 13 million people after the second application period opens on Nov. 15. They also predict that state lawmakers will start to see a political benefit to participating in a program that obliges states to expand Medicaid, the program that subsidizes health care for the poor, at the federal government’s expense.

Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, recently wrote that the attraction of federal funds and the votes of the newly insured ‘‘may gradually trump ideology,’’ prompting the 23 states that initially refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion to opt in.

‘‘Once we’re past the election season, we can start working on testimonials about Obamacare, calling people out on it,’’ Mr. Gunn said. Until then, the program’s supporters are staying mum.

In U.S., Ebola cases spread fear far and wide

In the month since a Liberian man infected with Ebola traveled to Dallas, where he later died, the United States has marinated in an ominous soup of understandable concern, wild misinformation, political opportunism and garden-variety panic.

Within the escalating debate over how to manage potential threats to public health — muddled by what is widely viewed as a bungled effort by government officials and the Dallas hospital that managed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States — the line between vigilance and hysteria can be as blurry as the edges of a watercolor painting.

A crowd of parents pulled their children out of a Mississippi middle school last week after learning that its principal had traveled to Zambia, an African nation untouched by the disease.

On the eve of midterm elections with control of the United States Senate at stake, politicians from both parties are calling for the end of commercial air traffic between the United States and some African countries, even though most public health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a shutdown would compound rather than alleviate the risks.

Carolyn Smith of Louisville, Ky., last week took a rare break from sequestering herself at home to take her fiancé to a doctor’s appointment. She said she was reluctant to leave her house after hearing that a nurse from the Dallas hospital had flown to Cleveland, over 300 miles from Ms. Smith’s home. ‘‘We’re not really going anywhere if we can help it,’’ said Ms. Smith, 50.

The panic in some way mirrors what followed the anthrax attacks of 2001 and the West Nile virus outbreak in New York City in 1999. But fed by social media and the 24-hour news cycle, the first American experience with Ebola has become a lesson in the ways things that go viral electronically can be as potent and frightening as those that do so biologically. The result has ignited a national deliberation about the conflicts between public health interest, civil liberties and common sense.

‘‘This is sort of comparable to when people were killed in terror attacks,’’ said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychology in the department of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine.

Ms. Silver studied and wrote about people who heavily consumed media after the bombings at the Boston Marathon in 2013, and ‘‘what we found is that individuals who were exposed to a great deal of media within the first week reported more acute stress than did people who were actually at the marathon.’’

In his work on panic in various disasters, Anthony Mawson, a visiting professor in the School of Health Sciences at Jackson State University in Mississippi, found that while physical danger is presumed to lead to mass panic, in actual physical emergencies, ‘‘expressions of mutual aid are common and often predominate.’’ But the threat of an illness that has infected only two people in the United States appears to have had the opposite effect, inciting a widespread desire to hide and shut things down.

The health care system, which has urged calm, has at times sent mixed messages that can promote fear. ‘‘There are two elements to trust,’’ said Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon. ‘‘One is competence, and one is honesty. The hospital in Dallas changed its story three times. So while most people know there are very few cases and this is not an easily transmissible virus, they also know the human system for managing this is imperfect, and they don’t know whether they are getting the straight story about it.’’

Parents have been at the forefront of the concerns.

In Mississippi, the middle school principal who attended a funeral in Zambia was declared healthy by the C.D.C., but he still agreed to take a paid vacation to quell fears. There was no parallel panic over enterovirus D68, which has infected at least two young children in the state.

Also last week, a teacher at an elementary school in Strong, Me., was placed on a 21-day paid leave when parents told the school board that they were worried he had been exposed to Ebola during a trip to Dallas for an educational conference.

In Rock Island, Ill., a Liberian immigrant, Barhyeau Philips, said he and his family would be confined to their home for the next few weeks in a voluntary quarantine, unable to go to work or send a child to high school, because of the community response to the arrival of his 21-year-old daughter, Jennifer, from Liberia.

Fear has also manifested itself in commerce. Julian Goldberg, who owns an Army goods store in downtown Louisville, said several acquaintances had urged him to start selling protective gear along with military clothing and equipment. ‘‘I hate to see the nation in a state of fright,’’ he said. ‘‘But Ebola was not born yesterday. Even if it had to swim across the ocean, it was going to get here somehow.’’

Spanish health officials said on Sunday that tests showed that a nursing assistant who had been infected with Ebola has no traces of the virus left in her bloodstream, Manny Fernandez and Kevin Sack reported.

The medical worker, Teresa Romero, 44, contracted Ebola after caring for priests who got Ebola while doing missionary work in West Africa. The officials said Romero must undergo at least one more Ebola test to make sure she is virus-free.

For Travel Pros, Ebola Fears Create Teaching Moments

Among the things that would come in handy for business travelers concerned about the possible effects of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on international travel is a map of the world.

On that map, the Ebola outbreak can be marked at crisis levels in a handful of West African countries, with a few confirmed cases elsewhere, including three in the United States. In the United States and Spain, a small number of people who came into contact with Ebola are also under medical observation. But concerns are growing about the effects in the business travel industry, which will account for about $1.18 trillion in global spending this year, according to the Global Business Travel Association.

The concerns reflect the growing fears about Ebola contagion, heightened by anxiety-inducing news: a transit station in Dallas shut down when a train passenger was wrongly thought to have vomited on a platform; a cruise ship blocked from a port call in Mexico last week because a passenger, quarantined on board, worked in the lab of a Dallas hospital where an Ebola patient died; schools in some places shut down because an employee might have been on the same airplane that carried an Ebola patient; a harrowing report in this newspaper on Sunday that Texas planned to instruct nearly 100 health care workers to avoid public transportation, shops and restaurants for the 21-day maximum incubation period for Ebola.

The business travel industry is warily monitoring the situation, aware of the huge losses suffered during the panic in the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic in Asia in 2003.

“We’ve seen this before with SARS, and we’re trying to learn from that experience,” Greeley Koch, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, said in a telephone interview from Copenhagen, where the group’s three-day global conference opened on Sunday. “With SARS, people did start to panic. We were hearing of flights being only 20 percent full.”

Because of the SARS crisis, passenger traffic at Hong Kong International Airport was off 85 percent in May 2003, compared with May 2002. That summer, I visited Hong Kong, where business travel was so weak that I found a harbor-view suite at the luxury Peninsula Hotel for $39 a night. The same suite today costs more than $1,900 a night.

Over the weekend, 500 business travel executives arrived to attend the conference in Copenhagen, said Jack Riepe, a spokesman. “There were no cancellations because of Ebola,” he said.

However, there was obvious concern. On a questionnaire, about half of the executives said their travelers expressed at least some concern about exposure to Ebola, and 15 percent said their travelers expressed “strong concern.” Half supported the idea of a travel ban to and from the affected countries in West Africa. And asked whether they were confident in the capabilities of regional and international health authorities to confine Ebola, two-thirds said yes — but a third replied that they had “lost confidence” in authorities, echoing growing criticisms that world health organizations have botched the response to Ebola.

“Certainly the latest news reports are drawing more concern about travel, and I think that mood could worsen if the sense grows that this is not getting under control,” said Michael McCormick, the executive director of the Global Business Travel Association. The organization said that in an online survey of members, 80 percent said that the Ebola crisis had had little or no impact so far on business travel. But most said they were stepping up efforts to keep travelers informed.

“The mood we getting here is, let’s not panic; let’s do the right thing for our employees and also try to make sure the governments are doing the right thing,” Mr. Koch added from Copenhagen.

The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents more than 51,000 pilots in North America, also called on government agencies to perform better. In a statement, the union also called for airlines to “remain vigilant in reviewing protocols and procedures for cleaning and sanitizing aircraft cabin interiors following a possible exposure event.”

That was a reference to an incident in which a Dallas hospital worker who later tested positive for Ebola took a Frontier Airlines flight from Dallas to Cleveland on Oct. 10, then returned Oct. 13 on an airplane that made five additional flights before being taken out of service. Authorities are now trying to notify[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/media/releases/2014/s1016-cdc-expands-passanger-notification.html] about 800 passengers in all who flew on those flights to arrange follow-up health checks.

As of the weekend, more than 4,500 deaths had been attributed to Ebola, most of them in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where most commercial air travel has stopped. No commercial flights from the United States directly serve those West African countries. But the effects on travel are being felt throughout the vast African continent nevertheless.

“Not to in any way question the horror of Ebola in West Africa, but some people hear the word Ebola and think Africa is just one big country, rather than 54 individual countries.” said Hayden Turner, who operates a company based in London that runs safari trips in Namibia, South Africa and other countries in Africa — thousands of miles away from the affected areas.

Safaris and eco-tours are a major part of African tourism. In Namibia, tourism accounts for almost 15 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. But Ebola fears have severely affected the safari business, even though safaris are centered far from the affected areas, said Mr. Turner, who also does television travel programs about travel in Africa. “I’ve definitely seen a huge drop in inquiries,” he said in an interview from Copenhagen.

“People have gotten a little lazy about understanding geography,” he added.

U.S.
On Ebola Response, Congressional Republicans Put New Focus on Visa Suspensions

WASHINGTON — Republican leaders, conceding the futility of a flight ban from Ebola-afflicted West Africa, are refining their response to the outbreak, pressing to suspend visas for travelers and create “no boarding” lists.

But a supercharged political atmosphere is making legislative nuance difficult two weeks before midterm elections and days before a hearing on Friday on the Ebola response called by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a panel riven by partisan division. Republicans on the campaign trail continue to goad Democrats to embrace a broad travel ban, although no direct flights to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea exist.

Democrats are slamming Republicans for slashing the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and other federal agencies charged with stopping the spread of Ebola, even after the White House circulated talking points to House Democrats in advance of a hearing last week that said funding had been adequate.

“Even within a constrained environment, the administration has prioritized C.D.C. funding over the years with significant increases for control of infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier],” the memo said. “The administration has also included significant increases for C.D.C. within the Prevention and Public Health Fund and other sources.”

Days of news media fixation, mounting public concern and political pot-stirring have created an odd dichotomy in which leadership aides on Capitol Hill are urging caution while candidates on the campaign trail are pressing hot buttons. House Republican leadership aides have repeatedly said lawmakers are not calling for an actual ban of airline flights, even as the likes of Senator Mitch McConnell[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/mitch_mcconnell/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Ted Cruz[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ted_cruz/index.html?inline=nyt-per], Republican of Texas, have done just that.

Because there are no direct flights from the countries afflicted with Ebola, a flight ban would have to ground connecting flights from Brussels, Amsterdam and other European cities.

The Republican leaders of the House Homeland Security Committee, in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, clarified that they would like a temporary suspension of visas to travelers from the Ebola-affected nations “while simultaneously permitting a robust effort by the U.S. government and global health agencies to combat this vicious disease in West Africa.”

Mr. McConnell, said a spokesman, Don Stewart, was “using shorthand” last week when he said, “It would be a good idea to discontinue flights into the United States from that part of the world.” He, too, supports a temporary suspension of visas, a position put into legislative language on Monday by Senator Marco Rubio[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/r/marco_rubio/index.html?inline=nyt-per], Republican of Florida, who vowed to press visa-suspension legislation when Congress returned in November.

In reality, Republicans are not planning a legislative response, at least for now, Republican leadership aides said Monday. They merely want their voices heard.

“The president has the authority to put a travel ban into effect right now,” said Kevin Smith, spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_a_boehner/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Ohio. “The speaker has not ruled out bringing the House back to address the Ebola crisis if our oversight efforts demonstrate a need for legislation to help combat the spread of the disease.”

Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, who signed the Homeland Security Committee letter, said he would like a “hard stop” to travel from the afflicted countries but added, “That’s not going to happen.”

Democratic leaders have kept largely quiet. Democratic leadership aides said Monday that they hoped the all-clear given on Sunday to Dallas residents who had been exposed to the one Ebola patient to die in the United States could defuse the latest political tempest, just as fears over the militant Islamic State and Mexican border breaches dissipated.

Most Democrats continue to adhere to the Obama administration’s position on travel restrictions, which were laid out last week in the talking points. That document emphasized that travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were already screened on departure, and again on arrival.

“Imposing a ban would give travelers an incentive to evade detection, conceal their travel history and, therefore, make it much harder for us to ensure they are screened before they enter the U.S.,” the document stated. “In addition, the only way we can eliminate the risk of Ebola to the American public is to stop the outbreak at the source. That means we need to surge resources to West Africa, and imposing a travel ban would only make it harder to move critically needed personnel and supplies to these countries.”

Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, took up the cause on Monday. “At the end of the day,” he said, “election-year posturing about a travel ban wastes precious time that should be spent mobilizing to attack this disease at its source — in Africa — so it does not continue to end up on our shores.”

On Nov. 6, two days after the midterm elections, the Senate Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing on the government’s response. Aides released data on Monday showing the C.D.C.’s budget, at $6.8 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, was just shy of its 2009 peak of $6.9 billion and well above the $6.3 billion the agency received in the 2013 fiscal year, when across-the-board cuts pinched almost every government function.

But Democrats maintain that if the 2004 C.D.C. budget were adjusted for inflation, it would be above $7.5 billion. Republicans counter that funding for Ebola would be sufficient if the issue was prioritized, a position not far from that of the White House.

43 People Declared Free of Ebola After Possible Contact With Victim

DALLAS — Giving this city a measure of calm for the first time in weeks, 43 people who had direct or indirect contact with the Liberian man who died here of Ebola were declared Ebola-free on Monday.

The 43 people who were released from monitoring had all been potential contacts of the Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, before he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Sept. 28. Ultimately, a total of 48 people are expected to be cleared of any risk of contracting Ebola in the coming days and will start rebuilding their lives, after a 21-day isolation that amounted to a self-imposed quarantine for some of them and a more serious state-ordered quarantine for others.

City officials, local philanthropists and Wilshire Baptist Church were working to donate money to Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, Louise Troh, and her family for new housing, clothing and other items, now that they were found to be free of Ebola symptoms.

“There’s no question today is a milestone day,” Mayor Mike Rawlings told reporters Monday. He spoke for the first time of another “magic date” officials were now focusing on: Nov. 7, when all of those who are still being monitored in Texas, including dozens of nurses and other hospital workers, will have passed the 21-day maximum incubation period for the virus.

The mayor’s remarks came the day after the family of one of the infected nurses at Presbyterian hospital, Amber Joy Vinson, 29, said she had received permission to fly from both the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as Dallas County.

A member of the family’s legal team said Ms. Vinson had even asked Dallas County health officials for a private plane to fly her home from a weekend trip to Ohio, but officials assured her that her concerns were unfounded.

Ms. Vinson was away on a personal trip to her hometown in Ohio when she learned that a co-worker, Nina Pham, had tested positive for the deadly virus, the member of the family’s legal team said. Unsettled, she asked her contact at the county health department who had called her for an update on her health whether a secure flight could be arranged as a precaution, he said.

“Amber was particularly concerned considering that Ms. Pham, being a capable nurse who followed the same Dallas county mandates, had become infected,” her family said in a statement. “Officials assured Amber that her concerns were unfounded because her temperatures were within the appropriate measures and asymptomatic in all other areas.”

County Judge Clay Jenkins, Dallas County’s chief executive, told reporters Monday that Ms. Vinson spoke to her contact at the Dallas County health department but that the ultimate decision to allow her to fly came from the C.D.C. in Atlanta.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., had publicly stated that because Ms. Vinson was being monitored for possible exposure to Ebola, she should not have flown on the return flight. His comments suggested that the fault lay with Ms. Vinson, but it has become clear that Ms. Vinson had checked in with health authorities.

Asked if Ms. Vinson was owed an apology, Mr. Jenkins replied, “Amber Vinson did nothing wrong. To the extent that it would help her family in healing, on behalf of the joint team — one team, one fight — and the decision makers who made that decision, I apologize for us.” He later said he was unaware Ms. Vinson had requested a private plane.

In Dallas on Monday, no one was underestimating the seriousness of the disease, which has led to more than 4,500 deaths in Africa and which continues to pose a potential risk to those being monitored in Texas and beyond. But while some of those on the edges of the three Ebola cases have worried about exposure, the end of the monitoring period on Monday for some of those who saw, lived with and touched Mr. Duncan was a reminder of Ebola’s mysteries and misperceptions.

“It speaks to the fact that while Ebola is scary, it’s not that contagious,” said Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, an infectious disease specialist in Pittsburgh. That Ms. Troh in particular did not become infected has astonished many given that she and Mr. Duncan shared a bedroom while he was symptomatic. She had spoken of caring for him while he sweated profusely, had a fever and suffered from diarrhea. Ebola is not an airborne illness, but it can be transmitted to those who have direct contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic victim.

“She is very lucky that whatever her exposure was the virus was not able to transmit to her,” Dr. Adalja said, adding that researchers were studying whether a person’s genetic makeup might make him or her less susceptible.

Shortly before she was released from monitoring at midnight Sunday, Ms. Troh released a statement, declining to give interviews but thanking people for their support.

Ms. Troh, her 13-year-old son, Timothy, and two young men in their 20s had been staying with Mr. Duncan at an apartment. Following Mr. Duncan’s hospitalization, they have been living under quarantine at a Catholic retreat donated by the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas, the Most Rev. Kevin J. Farrell. Officials revealed who the donor had been for the first time on Monday.

Eight of those who were released from monitoring Monday were schoolchildren, including Ms. Troh’s son. School officials were working to help them return to their campuses and ensure they were welcomed. Four of those eight students went back to school on Monday, and the rest were expected to return Tuesday.

“I talked to Louise last night on the phone, and her feeling towards this morning was one of fear, fear at how she and the young men would be accepted, how they would be treated, whether they would be seen as disease carriers,” Mr. Jenkins said Monday.

School officials said they believed the transition would be a smooth one for the eight students. The four students who went back to school on Monday showed up for classes one day earlier than expected.

“They were obviously eager to return back to the school environment and decided on their own to attend,” Mike Miles, the district’s superintendent, said in a statement.

In Texas and in Ohio, hundreds of people who had direct or indirect contact with either Mr. Duncan or the two infected nurses continued to be monitored.

Kevin Sack contributed reporting.

In Raising Immigration, G.O.P. Risks Blowback After Election

WASHINGTON — New Hampshire has one of the smallest populations of illegal immigrants in the country. Only about 5 percent of its 1.3 million residents are foreign-born, and 3 percent are Hispanic.

But tune into the Senate race between Scott P. Brown[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/scott_p_brown/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, and you might think the state shares a border with Mexico, not Canada.

When someone called a talk radio show to ask Mr. Brown about global warming the other day, Mr. Brown immediately started talking about border security. “Let me tell you what I believe is a clear and present danger right now,” he said, brushing aside the caller’s concerns about the environment. “I believe that our border is porous.”

Footage of agents patrolling[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e6Ot6qDkPs] the rocky, arid Southwestern landscape is featured in Mr. Brown’s ads — not quite the piney highlands of New Hampshire.

A political group[http://www.secureamericanow.org/secure_america_now_announces_advocacy_campaigns_in_key_senate_races] led by prominent conservatives like John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, attacked Ms. Shaheen last week with a video that juxtaposed two alarming images: a horde of people rushing a fence, presumably along the Mexican border, and a clip of Islamic militants right before they beheaded the journalist James Foley, a New Hampshire native. The ad was pulled after the Foley family complained.

Republicans have long relied on illegal immigration to rally the conservative base, even if the threat seemed more theoretical than tangible in most of the country. But in several of this year’s midterm Senate campaigns — including Arkansas and Kansas, as well as New Hampshire — Republicans’ stance on immigration is posing difficult questions about what the party wants to be in the longer term.

Some Republicans are questioning the cost of their focus on immigration. Campaigning on possible threats from undocumented immigrants — similar to claims that President Obama and the Democrats have left the country vulnerable to attacks from Islamic terrorists and the Ebola virus — may backfire after November. At that point, the party will have to start worrying about its appeal beyond the conservative voters it needs to turn out in midterm elections.

“You should never underestimate the ability of the Republicans to screw something up and blow an ideal opportunity,” said Ralph Reed, an influential conservative who has battled with hard-line Republicans to take a more charitable view on immigration.

“There is a sense in which, I think, the overwhelming desire to gain control of the Senate has kind of so fixated the party’s strategic brain trust that trying to get a hearing on long-term strategic issues doesn’t seem to be possible at the moment,” he said.

Still, immigration could be important to voters in states that do not have significant immigrant populations, and that seems to be the calculation of the campaign of Mr. Brown and others.

Much of the harsh talk on immigration today may have to do with simple math. In the states that Republicans need to win to retake the Senate, Hispanics are a sliver of the electorate. Nationally, they make up 11 percent of eligible voters. But in the eight states with close Senate races, fewer than 5 percent of eligible voters are Latino, according to a new Pew Research report[http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/10/16/latino-voters-and-the-2014-midterm-elections/].

Colorado is the only state with a competitive Senate race where Hispanics make up a significant share of the electorate — 14 percent. As a result, Republicans there have steered clear of making immigration policy an issue. Faced with polling that showed immigration could help Representative Cory Gardner, the Republican Senate nominee, strategists there still decided not to focus on it.

Instead, the Republican-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/chamber_of_commerce_us/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is running ads in Spanish in Colorado featuring Jeb Bush[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wltxw2lo_m0&feature=youtu.be], the former Florida governor and possible 2016 presidential candidate.

In Kansas, where Hispanics account for 6 percent of eligible voters, the opposite scene is unfolding. The campaign of Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican, has been running an ad reminiscent of the infamous 1994 spot[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLIzzs2HHgY] by Gov. Pete Wilson of California that showed immigrants racing across a busy highway to enter the country illegally. Mr. Roberts’ ad depicts[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUzNKMXqYkM&list=UUp7_3Je4VtJODR1HL2xXhGw] two shadowy figures climbing a fence. “Illegal immigration is threatening our communities and taking jobs away from Kansans who need them,” the announcer says.

Opposition to the immigration bill that passed the Senate last year (and has languished in the House since) has become a focal point for many Republican candidates who denounce any “amnesty.” And the split between Republicans who support an overhaul and those who do not has led to some awkward moments on the campaign trail.

In New Hampshire, Mr. Brown slammed the Senate bill as too lenient just hours before Senator Marco Rubio[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/r/marco_rubio/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the Florida Republican who helped write the legislation, went to campaign for him.

In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, the Republican Senate nominee, held a campaign rally with Mr. Bush at the end of September. But after Mr. Bush made the case for an immigration overhaul, Mr. Tillis quickly tried to put distance[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/politics/jeb-bush-returns-to-fray-and-finds-going-rough.html] between them, saying, “You have to make it clear that amnesty shouldn’t be on the table.”

Republicans who want to see a broad-based immigration overhaul say the debate is unhelpful.

“Those that support the status quo are supporting amnesty,” said Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the Chamber of Commerce. “And we hope this election is about leadership and governing, instead of all talk, no action.”

It is not just Republican candidates who are focusing on immigration to the concern of many in the party, but outside groups. Citizens United, the conservative political organization, is running ads in states like Arkansas attacking Democrats for being too easy on people who entered the country illegally.

“Mark Pryor voted against building a border fence? What was he thinking?” says one commercial from the Citizens United Political Victory Fund that goes after the Democratic senator who is fighting to hang on to his seat.

David Bossie, president of Citizens United, said the issue of immigration was resonating at the moment because of how it played into the broader notion that the government was failing on a number of fronts, from fighting the Islamic State to responding to Ebola. “Can we trust the government to secure the border?” Mr. Bossie asked.

As for any long-term damage Republicans could suffer by alienating Hispanics, Mr. Bossie said, “I don’t go through life trying to calculate every single possible way things can and can’t go, because that’s an incredibly negative, jaded way to do things.”

The Quality of Fear

There’s been a lot of tutting-tutting about the people who are overreacting to the Ebola virus. There was the lady who showed up at the airport in a homemade hazmat suit. There were the hundreds of parents in Mississippi who pulled their kids from school because the principal had traveled to Zambia, a country in southern Africa untouched by the Ebola outbreak in the Western region of the continent. There was the school district in Ohio that closed a middle school and an elementary school because an employee might have flown on the same plane (not even the same flight) as an Ebola-infected health care worker.

The critics point out that these people are behaving hysterically, all out of proportion to the scientific risks, which, of course, is true. But the critics misunderstand what’s going on here. Fear isn’t only a function of risk; it’s a function of isolation. We live in a society almost perfectly suited for contagions of hysteria and overreaction.

In the first place, we’re living in a segmented society. Over the past few decades we’ve seen a pervasive increase in the gaps between different social classes. People are much less likely to marry across social class, or to join a club and befriend people across social class.

That means there are many more people who feel completely alienated from the leadership class of this country, whether it’s the political, cultural or scientific leadership. They don’t know people in authority. They perceive a vast status gap between themselves and people in authority. They may harbor feelings of intellectual inferiority toward people in authority. It becomes easy to wave away the whole lot of them, and that distrust isolates them further. “What loneliness is more lonely than distrust,” George Eliot writes in “Middlemarch.”

So you get the rise of the anti-vaccine parents, who simply distrust the cloud of experts telling them that vaccines are safe for their children. You get the rise of the anti-science folks, who distrust the realm of far-off studies and prefer anecdotes from friends to data about populations. You get more and more people who simply do not believe what the establishment is telling them about the Ebola virus, especially since the establishment doesn’t seem particularly competent anyway.

Second, you’ve got a large group of people who are bone-deep suspicious of globalization, what it does to their jobs and their communities. Along comes Ebola, which is the perfect biological embodiment of what many fear about globalization. It is a dark insidious force from a mysterious place far away that seems to be able to spread uncontrollably and get into the intimate spheres of life back home.

Third, you’ve got the culture of instant news. It’s a weird phenomenon of the media age that, except in extreme circumstances, it is a lot scarier to follow an event on TV than it is to actually be there covering it. When you’re watching on TV, you only see the death and mayhem. But when you’re actually there, you see the broader context of everyday life going on alongside. Studies of the Boston Marathon bombing found that people who consumed a lot of news media during the first week suffered more stress than people who were actually there.

Fourth, you’ve got our culture’s tendency to distance itself from death. Philip Roth once wrote: “In every calm and reasonable person there is a hidden second person scared witless about death.” In cultures where death is more present, or at least dealt with more commonly, people are more familiar with that second person, and people can think a bit more clearly about risks of death in any given moment.

In cultures where people deal with death by simply getting it out of their minds, the prospect of sudden savage death, even if extremely unlikely, can arouse a mental fog of fear, and an unmoored and utopian desire to want to reduce the risk of early death to zero, all other considerations be damned.

Given all these conditions, you wind up with an emotional spiral that develops its own momentum.

The Ebola crisis has aroused its own flavor of fear. It’s not the heart-pounding fear you might feel if you were running away from a bear or some distinct threat. It’s a sour, existential fear. It’s a fear you feel when the whole environment seems hostile, when the things that are supposed to keep you safe, like national borders and national authorities, seem porous and ineffective, when some menace is hard to understand.

In these circumstances, skepticism about authority turns into corrosive cynicism. People seek to build walls, to pull in the circle of trust. They become afraid. Fear, of course, breeds fear. Fear is a fog that alters perception and clouds thought. Fear is, in the novelist Yann Martel’s words, “a wordless darkness.”

Ebola is a treacherous adversary. It’s found a weakness in our bodies. Worse, it exploits the weakness in the fabric our culture.

Health
Ethicist Calls CPR Too Risky in Ebola
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

The Ebola crisis has prompted a leading medical ethicist to raise an uncomfortable end-of-life question that doctors may have to address sooner than they would like: Should a medical team try to resuscitate an Ebola patient whose heart stops beating?

The ethicist, Dr. Joseph J. Fins, says that the answer should be no — that the risks of cardiopulmonary resuscitation[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/injury/cpr-adult/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] efforts are too great for health care workers and even for some Ebola patients whose heartbeat is restored.

And he is urging a national debate on the question now — before doctors and nurses have to make a hasty decision when an emergency code for CPR is sounded.

“Every clinician in the United States would like this issue to be discussed, and we need guidance on it,” Dr. Fins, an internal-medicine specialist who is director of medical ethics at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan, said in an interview.

He urged hospitals and government officials to develop firm guidance on the care of Ebola patients in accordance with state laws. He has posted an extensive analysis of the subject[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=7135&blogid=140] on the website of the Hastings Center, the nonprofit bioethics organization in Hastings, N.Y.

Health professionals are expected to try to revive patients in cardiac arrest when possible, unless a “do not resuscitate” order — arrived at after discussion with patients and families — is in their medical records. Dr. Fins said society must consider whether a blanket D.N.R. is justified for all Ebola patients, and, if so, at what stages of their illness.

The issue is a new one for American hospitals and has yet to be formally debated in medical journals, scientific meetings and medical school classes.

Although the magnitude of the crisis is far greater in West Africa, the ethics question has the potential to come up in the United States, where two nurses who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan before his death at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas have become infected.

(The hospital said Mr. Duncan told his doctor that the medical team “should not perform chest compressions, defibrillation[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/defibrillators/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or cardioversion to prolong his life.” As for West Africa, Dr. Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/georgetown_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org] who has cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and Liberia, said he was not aware that CPR had been performed on patients there.)

Other ethicists say Dr. Fins’s concerns are well taken. Laurence McCullough, a clinical ethicist at Baylor College of Medicine, called the statement “very well reasoned” and said it “reminds us that there are justified limits on the risk to health and life that health care professionals are expected to take in the care of patients.”

“Self-sacrifice by health care professionals that results in no offsetting clinical benefits for the patient,” he continued, “is not required by the professional virtue of self-sacrifice.”

Arthur Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at New York University, said he agreed with Dr. Fins’s views when it came to Ebola patients “in extremis.” But he said he was concerned that health workers might apply the argument even to people who show no signs of Ebola but might have come in contact with an Ebola patient. Nevertheless, he said, responders should still wear protective gear in dealing with these contacts.

“Even those with incipient symptoms but not yet ravaged by Ebola have a claim” to be resuscitated, Dr. Caplan said.

Dr. Fins said health professionals should assure all Ebola patients and their families that they will offer all available intensive-care and comfort measures. But he drew the line at resuscitation, for a variety of reasons: safety, staffing, logistics and futility.

CPR can cause rib fractures and internal bleeding. Such complications could be more serious among those Ebola patients who experience uncontrolled bleeding. Compressing the chest during CPR could produce even more internal bleeding and cause damage to vital organs. Some Ebola patients might even bleed to death.

Members of a resuscitation team would have to arrive at the bedside and consume precious minutes to carefully put on protective gear before starting CPR. Rushing the process could lead to breaches in protection measures and create a safety risk to the team members — and ultimately to all their contacts in a hospital or outside. If society expected that health workers would rush in for Ebola patients as they do for standard cardiac arrest codes, “no one would volunteer to provide care,” Dr. Fins wrote.

Also, time delays from donning equipment could lead to oxygen deprivation in patients who do not already have breathing tubes in place; that can cause brain damage.

To provide timely resuscitation, hospitals would need staff workers suited in protective gear around the clock. Further, hospitals would have to rotate at least two teams because of the limited amount of time an individual can safely wear protective gear.

Resuscitation efforts can be chaotic even under everyday conditions, because the nearest responders must form a team on the spot. For an Ebola patient, the situation could be all the more chaotic if members of the team stopped to debate performing CPR at the bedside.

Hospitals should develop policies that reflect their views on resuscitation before an Ebola patient arrives, Dr. Fins said, adding that “confronting this problem in the heat of a cardiac arrest is not the right time to be thinking about it.”

From a patient’s viewpoint, Dr. Fins said, resuscitation may be futile because of the lack of specific anti-Ebola therapies — and “all the more so for patients in extremis.”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] said on Monday that the federal government should contemplate banning some flights in response to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa.

“I think it’s something they should seriously consider, but I leave it to the experts who know this field better than I do,” he told reporters.

He said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/port_authority_of_new_york_and_new_jersey/index.html?inline=nyt-org] did not have the power to put such a ban in place.

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for re-election, had said this month that he did not believe a flight ban would be workable.

His Republican opponent in the Nov. 4 election, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, has repeatedly called for a ban on passenger travel from Ebola-stricken nations to airports in the New York area.

“Governor Cuomo has a responsibility to act if President Obama will not,” Mr. Astorino said in a statement on Monday. “It’s not enough to say, ‘My hands are tied,’ where public health is concerned. That’s not leadership.”

Federal officials announced new guidelines on Monday evening for the protection of hospital workers caring for patients infected with Ebola — guidelines that might have prevented the infection of two nurses had they been in place a month ago.

The new guidelines, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, follow broad revisions announced just last week. The new recommendations provide considerably more detail, however, and have been reviewed by specialists at American hospitals that have successfully cared for Ebola patients.

The procedures are based on the very strict protocols used for years by Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C.'s executive director, said during an unusual late-evening telephone news conference. That organization also reviewed the new guidelines, he said.

They are voluntary, not required by law.

Among other changes, the guidelines say that no skin should be left uncovered; that street clothes and shoes should be replaced with waterproof fabric and boots; and that every step of putting on and taking off equipment must be done under the eyes of a supervisor whose job is to prevent mistakes.

The revamped guidelines[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/media/releases/2014/fs1020-ebola-personal-protective-equipment.html], posted on the C.D.C. website, represent the agency’s recognition that Ebola victims require precautions quite different from those for patients with airborne diseases like SARS, MERS, avian flu or tuberculosis.

Ebola patients have never been proven to infect others by coughing or sneezing, but they emit copious amounts of highly infectious vomit, blood and diarrhea, so it is crucial that not even a speck of it get into a medical worker’s eyes, mouth, nose or cuts.

The most difficult and dangerous part of the process, experts agree, is removing safety gear when its surfaces are covered with infectious particles.

There are some differences between the new guidelines, intended for American hospitals, and those of Doctors Without Borders, which tends Ebola patients in makeshift field hospitals in Africa, some of which are tents built on open ground.

For example, Dr. Frieden said, in Africa it is possible to disinfect workers with a sprayed chlorine solution as they stand in a gravel pit. But that would create slippery puddles in hospital corridors, so the guidelines now recommend bleach wipes.

Since the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were infected after treating a man who died of Ebola, there has been a great deal of finger-pointing.

Dr. Frieden had said some hospital staff members had not followed protocols. The nurses’ union replied that the hospital had no protocols, had given no training, and had forced staff to work in gear that left skin exposed.

Hospital officials said they had followed C.D.C. protocols, but those turned out to be inadequate and outdated, designed to prevent routine infections and airborne diseases. For example, under them, workers could wear only one set of gloves, leave their heads and necks uncovered, and wear street clothes and shoes that could become soaked with lethal fluids.

Last week, the C.D.C. issued a preliminary one-page summary of changes it recommended; they included waterproof head-to-toe garments and supervised removal of gear. Agency officials said they would announce the details soon — which they did Monday evening.

Over this past weekend, as hospitals waited, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared on several TV news shows to discuss the administration’s Ebola response, which included the appointment of an “Ebola czar.”

Dr. Fauci has been on television hundreds of times since the 1980s, when he became the face of the government’s response to the AIDS epidemic, and it appeared that the administration was tentatively using him as its top medical spokesman in Dr. Frieden’s place.

Dr. Frieden has been heavily criticized in public and in Congress for saying that virtually any American hospital could handle an Ebola patient.

In fact, his answers to this question had been more nuanced, explaining that any hospital with a properly trained staff could treat patients without needing isolation rooms with negative pressure airlocks and other gear that make them resemble a space station more than a field hospital.

In answer to questions over the weekend from news anchors, Dr. Fauci said the C.D.C.′s old guidelines had been based on those issued by the World Health Organization and were meant for use “in the field, in the bush” rather than in a modern hospital.

In fact, W.H.O. guidelines[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/remove_ppequipment.pdf?ua=1] are far more strict, although not quite as rigorous as those of Doctors Without Borders. The W.H.O. guidelines do mandate supervised gear removal, rubber aprons and boots, extra gloves and other steps.

In an interview on Monday, Dr. Fauci said that personal protective gear was not his specialty, and that he had been told by C.D.C. officials that their old guidelines were based on the W.H.O.′s.

Some critics claimed that his remark that W.H.O. guidelines were suitable “in the bush” implied that he felt African nurses needed less protection than American ones, because they were somehow expendable.

That was not remotely his intent, Dr. Fauci said. He said he meant that the desperate measures that advanced hospitals have tried on Ebola patients — such as dialysis, intubation, arterial puncture and rectal drainage tubes — can produce gushes of dangerous fluids while nurses are close and vulnerable.

Doctors Without Borders protocols do call for doing as few risky procedures as possible, including even drawing blood as seldom as is medically necessary.

She is Ghoncheh Ghavami, not Ghavani. And an article on Sept. 26[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/middleeast/hassan-rouhani-iran-united-nations.html] about a speech by Mr. Rouhani at the United Nations repeated the misspelled surname for her brother, Iman, a British national, who went to the Iranian mission to the United Nations shortly after Mr. Rouhani’s speech and protested her incarceration.

Question:

Do mosquitoes spread Ebola in Africa?

Answer:

No. Africa has plenty of mosquitoes, and plenty of diseases spread by mosquitoes, but Ebola is not one of them.

To understand why mosquitoes are not carriers of Ebola, it is important to understand how mosquitoes bite. Only female mosquitoes bite, and they do not fly from person to person, biting one after another. They only hunt for blood when they plan to lay eggs. (At other times, female mosquitoes, like male mosquitoes, live on sugary plant nectar).

When a mosquito sucks blood, the insect's abdomen swells up, and the mosquito immediately finds rest on a wall or tree for hours or days to digest the blood and let it nourish her eggs. Then the mosquito flies around seeking water in which to lay the eggs. Only after laying the eggs does the mosquito look for another meal.

All mosquito-borne diseases -- malaria, yellow fever, West Nile virus, dengue fever, chikungunya and elephantiasis, for example -- have slowly merged into this feeding cycle through evolution. Mosquitoes are not born with these diseases. A mosquito must pick up a disease from a human, and then the disease has to survive the digestive process and get into position to infect the next human. In the case of malaria, which kills more than 600,000 people every year, the parasites in the blood stored in the mosquito's gut spend up to two weeks changing into five different forms. Two of those forms ''mate,'' creating a final form that migrates through the mosquito to end up in her salivary glands.

When mosquitoes bites, they inject saliva, which contains anticoagulants so they don't get clots in the thin proboscis -- the straw they have in place of a mouth -- that they insert into you. Ebola can't get into mosquito saliva, so mosquitoes don't transmit it.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Op-Talk
Has Ebola Exposed a Strain of Racism?

Some say that when the deadly Ebola virus traveled from West Africa to the United States, it brought out worrying signs of underlying racism in the American health care system, media coverage, politics and even on United States streets.

Last week, Josephus Weeks, the nephew of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who contracted Ebola in his country and died of the disease on a trip to the United States, wrote an op-ed[http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20141014-exclusive-ebola-didnt-have-to-kill-thomas-eric-duncan-nephew-says.ece] for The Dallas Morning News, in which he blames his uncle’s death on the health care system and prejudice.

Mr. Weeks writes that his uncle came to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with a high fever and stomach pain, admitting that he had recently been to Liberia. “But he was a man of color with no health insurance and no means to pay for treatment, so within hours he was released with some antibiotics and Tylenol,” Mr. Weeks says.

Why was he sent back home? That, Mr. Weeks says, is the “biggest unanswered question” about Mr. Duncan’s death. “Thomas Eric Duncan was a victim of a broken system,” Mr. Weeks writes.

Charles D. Ellison at The Root [http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/10/where_ebola_meets_concerns_over_race_class_and_the_uninsured.html]also asks whether Mr. Duncan was initially turned away because he was black and uninsured. “Few want to touch the pointy eggshells of race and class in the frantic discussion over Ebola as it enters the United States,” Mr. Ellison says.

He writes that when white American aid doctors, as well as an NBC cameraman, showed signs of the virus, they were “rushed” back to the United States. “But it’s been rough going for black Ebola sufferers — even when one manages to sneak into the U.S. and access one of the most advanced health care systems in the world.”

Experts told Mr. Ellison that if Mr. Duncan was turned away because of his nationality and lack of insurance, it wouldn’t be inconsistent with what they’ve been observing in the United States health care system.

Citing research about disparities in standards of health care based on race, Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution and managing director of clinical transformation at the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform told Mr. Ellison that this is a known, and documented, phenomenon: “We know that African Americans get different care — but no one wants to admit that. We know that gaps and disparities do exist.”

The problem, some say, is also present in Western media coverage of the crisis.

A viral illustration[http://mic.com/articles/100618/one-powerful-illustration-shows-exactly-what-s-wrong-with-media-coverage-of-ebola] by artist André Carilho shows rows of hospital beds where all the patients, contorted with disease, are black, except for a lone white one, who is being interviewed by journalists in face masks.

“People in the African continent are more regarded as an abstract statistic than a patient in the U.S. or Europe,” Mr. Carilho told Mic[http://mic.com/articles/100618/one-powerful-illustration-shows-exactly-what-s-wrong-with-media-coverage-of-ebola]. “How many individual stories do we know about any African patients? None. They are treated as an indistinguishable crowd.”

Echoing this view, Robin Wright, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and the United States Institute of Peace, writes for CNN[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/09/opinion/wright-ebola-racism/] that the disease is “is increasing racial profiling and reviving imagery of the ‘Dark Continent’” in both Europe and the United States. “The disease is persistently portrayed as West African, or African, or from countries in a part of the world that is racially black, even though nothing medically differentiates the vulnerability of any race to Ebola.”

Ms. Wright adds that as the panic over Ebola deepens, “the danger is that racism — on planes and public transportation, in lines, on streets, in glances — deepens further, too.”

Media reports suggest that there are cases where this have been proven to be true.

The Daily Beast reported [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/texas-college-s-ebola-racism-reaches-a-new-low.html]that Navarro College, a community college in Texas, announced in a letter to an applicant from Nigeria that it would not be admitting any students from countries with known Ebola cases.

The Washington Postwrites[http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/west-africans-in-washington-say-they-are-being-stigmatized-because-of-ebola-fear/2014/10/16/39442d18-54c6-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html] about how immigrants from West Africa are being ostracized in the nation’s capital, with people moving away from them on public transportation and refusing to shake their hands as well as employers asking them to leave work.

In Dallas, Reuters reports[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/05/us-health-ebola-usa-immigrants-idUSKCN0HU00120141005], African immigrants from other parts of the continent are facing discrimination: “People are looking at us in a bad way. We didn’t have anything to do with this. Somalia does not have Ebola. It is on the other side of Africa,” Shadiya Abdi, an immigrant from Somalia, told Reuters.

There are some, however, who dismiss the charges of racism entirely, or call them overblown. One debate loudly played out on network airwaves[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/oreilly-rips-pathetic-ideological-loons-at-msnbc-for-ebola-racism-attacks/], with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News lashing out against MSNBC commentators who called Republican comments about President Obama’s administration’s response to Ebola racist.

But criticism came also from a prominent African-American author, Earl Ofari Hutchinson. Writing for The Huffington Post[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/racism-charge-in-ebola-fi_b_5973578.html], he called the accusation of a double standard in treatment for blacks and whites “understandable,” but said it does not hold up in reference to Mr. Duncan.

He says that experts agree that Mr. Duncan was given “the best care and treatment available.” There is no evidence, Mr. Hutchinson says, that Mr. Duncan did not receive the experimental medication with which some of the white victims of the disease were treated because of his race. ZMapp, the treatment, Mr. Hutchinson writes, is still an experimental drug with a very limited supply.

However, because of the disparities in treatment of black patients in the United States health care system, “there’s cause for suspicion that when a dreaded disease such as Ebola strikes and the visible face of the victims are black then the racial double standard instantly kicks in.”

Mr. Hutchinson says that it is “precisely” because the disease can affect anyone, regardless of race or class, that Western health authorities will have to act with all resources available to them.

“It’s in part self-interest and self-protection, and in greater part the rude awakening that this is not 1940, or 1950 when the world was a much smaller place,” he writes. “The ease and accessibility of global travel, the non-stop mobility of travelers and immigrants, and the quantum leap in interpersonal contacts between peoples across all ethnic lines in America have radically changed the social, cultural and health picture for Americans and indeed the world.”

Our readers are often short of time, surrounded by distractions, and peering at small screens in supermarket checkout lines. No, they don’t want fourth-grade vocabulary or Dick-and-Jane syntax. But they need clear, digestible writing that doesn’t require three readings to understand.

Here are a few recent sentences that tested their patience. For the most part, the grammar is correct. But the sentences are overstuffed, with too many details, too many twists and turns, and too many prepositions.

•••

HONG KONG — Rows of police officers took pro-democracy protesters by surprise on Monday morning and began removing barricades on major avenues here, as the student leaders appealed directly to President Xi Jinping of China to reconsider the government’s position and Hong Kong’s top official again rejected their demands. …

Some protesters voiced resentment of the police action, which came after the government abruptly canceled talks with them last week and ignored an offer by the students over the weekend to withdraw from some streets in exchange for control of a space known as Civic Square in front of the local Legislature.

The lead sentence combines three separate news developments into one sentence. Why not split it up? The other sentence also has at least three main elements — all in different time frames, which makes the information even harder to grasp quickly.

•••

DALLAS — A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected, despite wearing protective gear, and to monitor additional people possibly at risk. …

The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas — four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who arrived in this country in September — opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.

Including infinitives and participles, the 54-word lead sentence has nine verbs. The next example, at 50 words, includes nine prepositional phrases. That’s just too much stuff to absorb without the pause that a well-placed period or two would provide.

•••

Yuri Lyubimov, a Russian stage director whose adventurous productions won a devoted following, frequently landed him in trouble with Soviet authorities and eventually led to his exile — but who later returned in triumph and remained a mainstay of Russian theater for more than 20 years — died on Sunday in Moscow. He was 97.

As I’ve noted before, our traditional formula can make for overstuffed obit leads. Here, if we wanted to cover the whole arc of his career in one sentence, we should have pared away some details.

•••

It was not the start of a war but, a month after loud explosions, a cloud of smoke and the din of sirens set nerves jangling in this sleepy corner of southeastern Estonia, officials in the capital, Tallinn, and far beyond are still trying to figure out what had started and why.

On the answer hinges whether Estonia and also the NATO alliance to which it belongs face the danger of a push by Russia to reprise in the Baltics some of the tactics it used to dismember Ukraine or just another nerve-racking episode in the revived Cold War saga of spy-versus-spy between East and West.

So far, the only solid fact, at least according to Estonia’s version of what happened in a thicket of pine trees and scrub on the border here with Russia, is that a well-trained and well-armed squad of Russian security operatives crossed into Estonia on Sept. 5 and grabbed Eston Kohver, a veteran officer in the Estonian Internal Security Service, known as KAPO.

Under any circumstances, it’s a challenge to narrate an opaque and confusing series of events that occurred in a place unfamiliar to many readers. But we seemed intent on making things difficult with these three consecutive sentence of 52, 54 and 62 words. In the first sentence, the time frame and location both shift midstream. The inverted and convoluted syntax of the second sentence poses more hurdles. And the final sentence tries to pack in far too much information. Streamline, simplify and straighten out these sentences.

•••

With trade schools out of fashion, for-profit colleges often dismissed as expensive dropout factories, and community college students failing to graduate a majority of their students, the rise of boot camps over the past two years is challenging assumptions about higher education, at least for some smart, highly motivated people.

The introductory “with” construction is so long and packed with information, a reader is likely to be overloaded before even reaching the main clause. It also creates a false trail — after reading “With trade schools out of fashion,” most readers will assume that “for-profit colleges” is going to be the subject of the main clause. Not so. In fact, the editors lost their way as well; the phrase “community college students” should be just “community colleges.”

 In a Word

This week’s grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.

•••

Mr. Haskin, however, has made it his mission to preserve his ancestors’ legacy by operating a campsite in the former town’s park, writing historical fiction novels about the settlement and excavating the dugout home.

“Historical fiction novels” is redundant. Make it “historical fiction” or “historical novels.”

•••

The transcripts were frequently referenced, as Mr. Geithner was peppered with questions about his role in the A.I.G. bailout in 2008.

We should avoid this jargony use of “reference” as a verb. “Cited” or “mentioned” would work here.

•••

Two of the seven men, who said they had no link to the crime, had their sentences reduced to 20 years imprisonment.

Make it “20 years’ imprisonment.” The Times’s stylebook uses this very example:

The apostrophe is used in expressions like 60 days’ notice and 20 years’ imprisonment. But: 60-day notice; a 20-year sentence; a sentence of 20 years.

•••

He talked to students like they were peers.

Make it “as if” or “as though.”

•••

The book, and the media blitz that accompanies it, becomes the latest headache for a White House that, like other second-term administrations, finds itself fending off friendly fire from veterans of the first.

Despite the commas, this is a compound subject and should take a plural verb.

•••

Responding to such pressures, Google has said it planned to hire more than 200 security guards as its own employees, instead of getting them through a contractor — a move expected to lead to better wages and benefits for the guards.

In determining proper sequence of tenses, the present-perfect tense (like “has said”) is equivalent to the present. So make it “Google has said it plans …”

•••

Parents who used conventional books were more likely to engage in what education researchers call “dialogic reading,” the sort of back-and-forth discussion of the story and its relation to the child’s life that research has shown are key to a child’s linguistic development.

An intervening prepositional phrase tripped us up here. The verb should be singular to agree with the pronoun “that,” which is singular because its antecedent is “discussion.”

•••

[Web summary] The documentary “The Overnighters” looks at the itinerate workers who have come to Williston, N.D., in the middle of an oil boom.

It was right in the article: “itinerant” workers.

•••

Black swans — those rare, disastrous events that can derail bull markets — were thought to be lurking everywhere during the third quarter, from China to Ukraine to the Middle East — even Scotland.

Using more than two dashes in a sentence leads to confusion.

•••

[Lead paragraph] For the first time, and to the astonishment of many of their colleagues, researchers created what they call Alzheimer’s in a Dish — a petri dish with human brain cells that develop the telltale structures of Alzheimer’s disease.

If a lead uses the simple past tense, we need a time element. Here, since the time element isn’t crucial, we should have used the perfect tense: “have created.”

•••

President Obama will designate Friday a sweeping preserve in the San Gabriel Mountains, creating a recreational space for millions in the Los Angeles area.

Speaking of time elements — don’t put one between the verb and the direct object. Ideally the time element should follow the object, but if the object is too long or cumbersome, put the time element before the verb.

•••

In the first hundred days since he formally assumed the title of president, Mr. Sisi has already tread where previous leaders hardly dared …

A surprisingly frequent error. “Tread” is the present tense. Here we wanted “has trodden” (“has trod” is an accepted variant).

•••

More than one in five Republicans last year told a pollster they believed that President Obama was the anti-Christ.

Amazing what you’ll find in the stylebook — including “Antichrist.”

One of those filmmakers whose technical prowess can make the mediocrity of his material seem irrelevant (almost), Mr. Fincher is always the star of his work.

We needed “their,” not “his,” for agreement with the plural antecedent.

But they remained opposed to more draconian travel restrictions that they say would cause more problems than they would solve.

“Draconian” means extremely harsh, even cruel, not merely strict.

•••

The change, which is being advanced both by the City Council and the de Blasio administration, would allow alterations to birth certificates with the blessing of any of a broad range of health care professionals, including doctors and psychotherapists but also physicians’ assistants, nurse practitioners and midwives.

The simplest way to make the first phrase parallel would be to reverse “both” and “by”: “which is being advanced by both the City Council and the de Blasio administration …” And from the stylebook:

physician assistant, not physician’s assistant, for a person licensed to practice medicine under the supervision of a physician.

•••

An accidental Internet disclosure last month showed that the stealthy form of political corruption known as “dark money” now fully permeates governor’s offices around the country, allowing corporations to push past legal barriers and gather enormous influence.

Make it a plural possessive: “governors’ offices.”

•••

They said they undertook the investigation because of recent complaints from constituents, pharmacists and in the media.

Not parallel; rephrase.

The drawback of Advantage plans are their limited networks of providers.

Agreement problem. Make it “drawback … is.”

What Would Edmund Burke Say?
By DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
David Brooks: Gail, as you know I have a policy of teaching at colleges I couldn’t have gotten into, and as a result I find myself teaching at Yale.

Gail Collins: I didn’t go to Yale either. But I spent the ’70s living in New Haven. Does that count for anything?

David: I just got out of a class in which we discussed Edmund Burke’s “Reflections on the Revolution in France.” As you may know, this book changed my life. I began reading it as a big lefty and I loathed Burke. But over the years, I came to see wisdom in it. Have there been big books like that for you, which had a pivotal effect on your thinking?

Gail: When I was in high school, I decided I needed to read the work of a great mind on the subject of politics. I picked Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “Mandate for Change” because at the time I believed that all presidents were deep thinkers.

Carried that sucker around for six months. Read every page. There wasn’t much philosophy, but I did learn that if we lost Vietnam we would forgo an important source of tin.

I believe this had a crippling effect on my ability to appreciate genuine political philosophy when it was thrust upon me in later life. And I want to say how impressed I am that after reading “Reflections on the Revolution in France” and not liking it, your response was to read it again.

David: Burke is famous for his belief in gradual change. He didn’t believe in revolutionary change because he thought that society was too complicated to be planned through reason and remade according to that plan. My students were divided on this. Some saw wisdom in this modesty, pointing to failed efforts to remake societies, ranging from the war in Iraq to the Russian revolution. Others pointed out that most systems are constructed by those in power for those in power. If you don’t have radical change, you just allow entrenched privilege to stay in power forever.

Did you ever go through a revolutionary phase? Are you still in one?

Gail: When I was in college and graduate school I hung around with a lot of people who believed that revolution was both necessary and inevitable. That was less because I agreed than because I felt they were much nicer than the folks who believed things were just peachy the way they were.

David: Burke is known as the founder of conservatism, but his thought sits oddly these days with the Republican Party and those who call themselves conservative. The party has become much more populist, supporting term limits and political outsiders over those who have been educated by experience. Most call for pretty radical change to the welfare state. It’s the Democrats who fight to preserve the current structures of Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. It’s the Democrats who have been running ads through this election campaign accusing their opponents of being a bunch of wild-eyed radicals. Are Democrats now the conservators of tradition?

Gail: The difference between the two parties is about empty places versus crowded places. You have heard me say this before – it’s my long-standing theory, which takes the place of a political philosophy.

People who perceive the world as a crowded place believe that government has a very important role to play. They see it in action every day – enforcing the law, directing traffic, removing garbage and providing clean water. They’re also likely to witness the inequality of the world and they want government to at least make the divisions less painful.

The current crop of Republicans, especially the Tea Party types, see the world as an empty place, where people can take care of themselves and government exists only to levy taxes and get in their way. Given the fact that the country is becoming increasingly crowded, I don’t think you can define that as a message of change.

David: I do think Republicans are seen as the party of change this election. My sense is that in state after state, polls are swinging their way. The peculiarities of each candidate matter a bit less and the national tide is mattering a bit more. I’d now guess that the G.O.P. will pick up seven or eight Senate seats. It’s just hard to be a Democrat in a red state or a Republican in a blue state. Do you have a different read on the trends?

Gail: I suspect you may be right about the outcome. The Democrats are in trouble in states where a large number of people either live in empty places or tell themselves they do. There’s a lot of delusion in this game – we’ve all seen the guy who lives on Social Security and depends on Medicare for his visits to the doctor, yelling that he wants government off his back.

David: I’m not sure either party has an agenda.

Gail: You don’t think announcing that terrorists are infecting themselves with Ebola and crossing the Mexican border is an agenda?

David: As you know I’ve been depressed by the vacuousness of the campaign.

Gail: Me too. Another one of my theories is that politics is at its worst when the country is almost evenly divided and each party thinks it can win if it just avoids saying anything.

David: But people do believe that things are pretty seriously off track, and so of course they are going to register some protest. Peter Wehner had a piece[mailto:http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/10/20/americas-anxious-mood-and-what-it-means-for-republicans/] on the Commentary website that nicely sketched out how much the fundamentals favor the party out of power. It was called “America’s Anxious Mood and What It Means for Republicans.”

Wehner pointed to the drop in median household income, the fact that income inequality is nearing its highest levels in 100 years, the fact that the poverty rate has stood at 15 percent for three consecutive years (the first time that has happened since the mid-1960s), the fact that a record number of people are now on food stamps and the fact that only a quarter of people think the country is on the right track.

I sort of agree that Republican proposals on what to do about all this are less than, er, fully developed, and have not been fully explained. But isn’t it an indictment of the Obama administration that it has made so little progress even on, say, reducing the poverty rate?

Gail: Well, Obama did run on the argument that our biggest problem was too much partisanship in Washington, and that he’d cure that by being less partisan. So I guess you could blame him for the fact that that definitely did not work.

I give Obama credit for the fact that we’ve gotten out of the recession, which never would have happened if the Republicans had their way. I guess I blame him for not actually being the kind of great communicator we needed to explain that the keys to reducing inequality lie in more government spending and higher taxes on the wealthy.

David: Wehner also points out that two-thirds of Americans think it is harder to reach the American dream, and three-quarters think it will be harder for their children and grandchildren to succeed. Of course they’re going to favor the party out of power in such conditions.

Gail: Yes, and we may just keep switching parties without ever resolving anything.

David: All of this may be reason for some sort of radical change — maybe a Rand Paul type change or an Elizabeth Warren type change.

Gail: Ah, Rand Paul. What this country needs is a libertarian who believes the government has no right to control anything except women’s reproductive systems.

David: If I was 25 I wonder if I’d be a radical libertarian or even a Marxist on the ground that a country that has been on the wrong track for so long needs a sharp kick in the pants.

Gail: This is possible. I’d say a 25-year-old who reads a lot of political philosophy is capable of anything.

David: But I’m sticking to my Burkean roots. Change should be steady, constant and slow. Society has structural problems, but they have to be reformed by working with existing materials, not sweeping them away in a vain hope for instant transformation. My only fear is that if I keep thinking this way I’ll end up voting for Hillary Clinton, who will be the most conservative candidate from the party of the status quo.

Gail: Tee-hee.

David: That can’t be right.

Gail: No, but I’m sure Hillary will be happy to accept your vote anyway.

Market Volatility Merely a Symptom of Larger Issues
By ROB COX

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
It has been impossible to escape the V-word for the past week. Turn on the television, and it is easy to conclude that central bankers, corporate chiefs, investors and politicians think volatility is the biggest problem vexing global markets. The roller coaster ride recently experienced by financial assets is nettlesome. But it’s merely a symptom of a bigger malady: the fragility of widely accepted assumptions about where the world is headed.

The seesawing of markets is succinctly illustrated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX. It uses the prices of Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index options to give an indication of investors’ expectations of near-term swings in the stock market. Conventional wisdom suggests that the higher the index goes, the greater the fear among investors that markets will forge an unstable path in the weeks ahead.

Market volatility makes it hard for people in the real economy to plan ahead. So a fund manager fearing zigzagging prices may be better off keeping funds invested in cash. Company executives may hold back on hiring new staff or buying new equipment until things calm down. And central bankers pondering what to do about interest rates may have a change of heart.

Last Thursday, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, suggested that the American central bank might need to rethink its plan to finish phasing out its bond-buying effort later this month. He was responding specifically to diminished expectations of inflation, but his comments came after the VIX surged to almost 31, its highest level in nearly two years.

Yet obsessing about volatility, rather than examining its underlying causes, would be a mistake. Seen as emblematic of larger problems, volatility is a helpful motivator. The doubling in the VIX from Oct. 8 to last week’s high presents an opportunity to address causes for concern in the global economy, including monetary policy, geopolitics, growth and, at least for the moment thanks to media excitement, health. All have seen events that exposed the fragility of their generally accepted trajectories.

Though it arguably doesn’t belong on the standard dashboard for financial investors, the unfolding Ebola crisis nicely illustrates this. Just weeks ago, the virus was considered a matter of West African regional concern. Even when a carrier was discovered in Texas, United States health officials delivered soothing reassurances that the disease would easily be contained. In a matter of days, it became clear this confidence was at least somewhat misplaced.

Of course, the United States has ample resources to nip an Ebola outbreak in the bud. Nigeria, Senegal and Spain have each achieved as much. But the American public must now grapple with the notion that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is fallible. That’s a shock for the many Americans who thought the agency led the world in fending off anything smacking remotely of apocalypse, even the cinematic zombie variety.

If the C.D.C. can make a mistake — failing to advise a potential Ebola carrier against boarding a commercial flight with some 130 passengers, for example — then so can other institutions respected for their preparedness like the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Chinese Communist Party or the Kremlin, not to mention less-esteemed bodies like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

At the Fed, Mr. Bullard may be in a minority and he won’t be a voting member of the central bank’s rate-setting committee for another two years. His Texas counterpart, Richard W. Fisher, who is a voting member this year, told CNBC on Monday that he saw no reason to delay the end of the central bank’s bond purchases. Even so, it’s potentially unsettling to investors if some members of the leading monetary policy institution start questioning their faith.

The debate is a reminder that monetary policy doesn’t follow a prescribed and consistent line. Rather, as the Fed likes to say, it’s data dependent. Put another way, it can be knocked off course. The same thinking can be extended to geopolitics. Many people assume, for instance, that economic considerations will keep President Vladimir Putin of Russia from tipping the Ukrainian crisis into war with the West or China’s president, Xi Jinping, from turning territorial disputes in the South China Sea into overt hostilities with Japan.

But other factors, including in both these examples eruptions of domestic dissent, could change the two leaders’ calculus quickly. That would surely result in more market volatility. With the odd exception, though, that would be a symptom of bigger trouble, not a cause.

New York Today: Fixing the Airports

Good morning on this cloudy Tuesday.

On Monday, in an airport hangar in Queens, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomoannounced design competitions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/nyregion/gov-cuomo-joined-by-biden-announces-design-contest-to-improve-new-york-citys-airports.html?ref=nyregion&_r=0] for Kennedy and La Guardia Airports.

Each of the winning teams will receive $500,000.

One particularly vocal airport critic, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was there.

In February, he compared La Guardia[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/nyregion/biden-compares-la-guardia-airport-to-third-world.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] to an airport in a third world country.

We checked in with Patrick McGeehan, The Times’s reporter who covered Monday’s meeting at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Flushing.

Our first question: Did anyone refer to the vice president’s joke?

Mr. McGeehan said the governor quoted the quip, then asked, in the form of a multiple-choice question: “Who said it? Texas governor Rick Perry? Jay Leno? Donald Trump? Or none of the above?”

“And then he went on to say he agreed.”

Mr. Cuomo said the design competitions, which open in 30 days, would not interfere with the Port Authority’s plan to rebuild La Guardia’s main terminal.

Mr. Biden did not retract his criticism, Mr. McGeehan said.

Indeed, the vice president took another shot at the airport.

“It’s unacceptable that La Guardia has the worst passenger service in the world,” he said.

Mr. Cuomo gave a 15-minute presentation. Mr. Biden responded with a 25-minute “ramble” on the importance of infrastructure.

“It was kind of like performance art,” Mr. McGeehan said.

Three other people were on the panel. Not that they made a memorable impression.

“They never said a word,” he added.

Share your ideas on how La Guardia and J.F.K. could be redesigned in the comments or on Twitter with #nytoday.

Here’s what else you need to know for Tuesday.

AND FINALLY …

The New York Public Library has long collected maps documenting the changing city.

These street atlases, originally commissioned by insurance companies, contain hundreds of stories: buildings that have been destroyed, streets that have been renamed, neighborhoods that have vanished.

Now the library has undertaken to “make these lost places findable”[http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/general/about] using contemporary digital maps like Google’s.

And it needs your help.

At a workshop today, you can learn to use the library’s tools to add valuable geographic context to the old maps.

“There are literally thousands of maps to process — far too big a job for N.Y.P.L. to do on its own. So we’re enlisting you, our Citizen Cartographer corps, to help,” the library says.

The free workshop[http://www.nypl.org/events/programs/2014/11/18/citizen-cartography-nypl-building-virtual-atlas-new-york] starts at 6 p.m. in the main library.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Turkey bows over Kurds.

Turkey shifted its position and will allow Iraqi Kurdish forces to cross its border with Syria to help fight militants [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/world/middleeast/kobani-turkey-kurdish-fighters-syria.html] besieging the city of Kobani.

The change reflects escalating international pressure to push back Islamic State fighters.

• Oscar Pistorius gets five years.

The family of Reeva Steenkamp, slain by the South African track star on Valentine’s Day 2013, said “justice is served” by the sentence handed down today [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/world/africa/oscar-pistorius-sentenced.html].

BACK STORY

If the playoffs leading to the start of tonight’s World Series seemed longer than usual, it’s not your imagination.

When Bud Selig effectively became the baseball commissioner in 1992, there were only four playoff teams: the champions of the four divisions.

This year, the winners of six divisions were joined by four wild-card teams.

The postseason expansion, resulting in more than half the teams still in contention in August, is one of Mr. Selig’s legacies as he retires [http://m.mlb.com/news/article/61825598/] after 22 years at the helm (he was acting commissioner until 1998).

Mr. Selig also spread the league’s wealth to small-market teams by dividing the revenue from colossal local TV contracts for teams like the Yankees and Dodgers, and the billions of dollars from national broadcasts and Internet streaming.

That has helped teams like Kansas City keep great players they drafted and developed — and one reason the Royals are playing in the Series for the first time in 29 years.

ON a Monday evening last month in Liberia, at Grand Gedeh County's main hospital, two nurses knocked on a patient's door. The patient was being treated for malaria and typhoid, but had also recently tested positive for Ebola -- though he didn't know it yet. I was doing training on Ebola at the hospital, and had seen him from a distance just that morning. He smiled and gave me a thumbs up.

Dressed in their full Ebola combat gear -- body suit, apron, head cover, face mask, goggles, face shield, boots and rubber gloves -- the nurses tried to avoid alarming him by saying that they needed to take him to Monrovia, 300 miles to the northwest, for further testing. Then they walked him to an ambulance and began driving to their actual destination, the newly constructed Ebola treatment unit in the neighboring county of Bong.

On a road anywhere in the West, it would take less than four hours to cover the 190-mile trip. But the Liberian roads, especially in the rainy season, are deadly traps of red mud, riddled with craters sometimes as deep as a car. Add to this drivers' testosterone and you soon have trucks and cars stuck in all directions.

This was the situation the nurses and their patient found themselves in after two hours of driving. It was midnight, pouring rain, and their only option was to wait until morning. Despite being drenched with sweat, the nurses could not risk removing their protective suits. The patient seemed to be getting a little sicker now, his eyes bloodshot and his temperature rising. During the night, they helped him out of the car several times to urinate, carefully spraying with chlorine everywhere he had stepped.

The ambulance finally reached the Ebola treatment unit the next day at 2 p.m. That's when the patient realized why he had been brought there and refused to get out of the ambulance. ''You kill me or I kill you,'' he said. Two hours of laborious negotiations ensued, and it was only after witnessing a family cheering their loved one being discharged from the place that he relented and stepped out. After all, there might be hope in there.

After disinfecting the inside and outside of the ambulance, the nurses were at last able to get out of their suffocating suits. Wednesday morning they were once again on the road back to Grand Gedeh County.

I heard the whole story two days later, on Friday. I was trying to reach the capital, along with an Ebola response team from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. It had been a 10-hour trip and counting. I was taking shelter from the sun by a truck on the side of the road while our driver battled the mud, when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder. It was one of the nurses, still on their way back to their hospital, where the blood sample of yet another patient suspected of having died from Ebola was waiting for them to drive it to Monrovia for testing.

There have been over 4,000 cases of Ebola in Liberia, and the World Health Organization warns that there could be up to 10,000 new cases every week in West Africa if more isn't done now.

Liberia's dysfunctional transportation system is standing in the way. Patients have died on grueling journeys to treatment units. Blood samples have sat waiting for days, eventually becoming invalid.

Perhaps small bush planes could help transport Ebola patients in remote parts of the country, but it would be hard to get pilots to volunteer.

The best solution is removing the need to travel altogether by building more easily accessible treatment centers all over the country, where patients with confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola can be housed and treated. The United States military is building these structures, but it is taking time. Nimbler nongovernmental organizations must also step in. Save the Children has already done so and is also building smaller community care centers -- sort of homes away from home, where families can continue to care for their sick loved ones safely removed from the community. A makeshift center with tents instead of permanent structures could be set up within a week.

We must also decentralize laboratory testing of Ebola blood samples and make more portable laboratories available in all counties in Liberia. It is unacceptable that a test that should take four to six hours to process becomes a terrifying four-to-six day wait. Quarantined patients who will test positive are mixed with those who won't, inevitably increasing infections. Until then, we have to find a way to fly blood samples to Monrovia.

Monrovia remains the epicenter of the epidemic in Liberia, but the virus is inexorably spreading across the country. With just six Ebola treatment units operational of the 28 that are planned, and equipment not reaching all of Liberia's clinics and hospitals, transportation issues only exacerbate the enormous difficulties of combating this disease.

For now, health care workers and ambulance drivers put their fears aside and work nonstop to ensure that, no matter the cost, blood samples can be analyzed, and patients can reach a place where better treatment options await.

Karin Huster is a nurse with the nonprofit organization Last Mile Health.

The nonstop cable news coverage, the “We’re All Gonna Die” tabloid headlines, the political grandstanding — Ebola has dominated the news this month.

But it’s still not the No. 1. concern among Americans, according to a Gallup survey released Tuesday[http://www.gallup.com/poll/178742/ebola-debuts-americans-list-top-problems.aspx], although viral fears have cracked the top 10. About 5 percent of respondents said Ebola was their top concern (tied with education and the Islamic State).

The findings raise questions of how effective Ebola and the threat from the Islamic State will be as campaign issues when voters head to the polls in two weeks.

Ebola ranks sixth on the list of concerns, with the old standbys — the economy (17 percent), government dissatisfaction (16 percent) and unemployment (10 percent) — as the top three, according to Gallup.

The poll, conducted Oct. 12-15, also found that immigration was dropping as a concern among Americans. The issue peaked in July, but the latest survey found it was the top concern of only 7 percent of respondents.

(The poll involved a random sample of 1,017 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.)

Donations for Ebola Relief Are Slow to Gain Speed

When Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million last week to support the treatment of Ebola victims and their families, they gave the gift to the foundation that funnels private donations to the Centers for Disease Control, not one of the nonprofit groups that Americans typically shower with money during a humanitarian crisis.

Compared to the rush to donate after major disasters of the last decade or so, charitable giving to address the Ebola tragedy is almost nonexistent, and the relief agencies that typically seek donations after a catastrophe are mostly silent. ''Have you had any email solicitations?'' asked Patrick M. Rooney, associate dean at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. ''If there had been an earthquake or tsunami, my question would be who had solicited you and how many times? Americans aren't giving because they haven't really been asked.''

Ever since terrorists took down the World Trade Center in 2001, Americans have generously supported the organizations that swing into action after earthquakes, floods, cyclones, mudslides and other disasters. Propelled by the Internet and cellphones, which make giving as easy as clicking a button, Americans donated billions of dollars to help victims of the 2004 tsunami that devastated countries around the Indian Ocean, the 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan, and the 2010 Haitian earthquake, among other calamities.

But the Ebola crisis is different, charity officials and experts say, though it is hard to say exactly why. Perhaps it lacks the visual drama of a natural disaster. Or it is harder for people to understand what their money can do to fight a disease with such a high mortality rate and no sure treatment. It is not even clear that providing food, housing and protective equipment will have any impact -- or how those things will get where they are most needed.

''It's just been more difficult to raise money around this,'' said David Whalen, chief development officer at Partners in Health, founded by the physician Paul Farmer to help bolster health care in poor regions.

For one thing, Mr. Whalen and others said, news media coverage of Ebola did not begin to ramp up until an American missionary and a doctor working for Samaritan's Purse contracted the virus and were taken to Atlanta for treatment in early August. The Centers for Disease Control's first notice about the current outbreak, noting 86 suspected cases in Guinea, drew little attention four months earlier.

In addition, charities initially had small operations -- or none at all -- in the stricken region for which to raise money, and there was hope that the outbreak would be contained.

Médecins Sans Frontières, known in the United States as Doctors Without Borders, was on the ground at that time, working to fight the disease. But the organization saw no uptick in fund-raising until late July, said Thomas Kurmann, director of development for the United States branch.

''The real spike came in September,'' Mr. Kurmann said, when representatives of the organization addressed the United Nations. ''There was a lot of media coverage and that translates into additional donations.''

Doctors Without Borders asks donors not to earmark their contributions for a specific emergency because it wants to be able to deploy its money where it is most needed. But it does not reject earmarked gifts. So far, it has received about $31.5 million in private donations designated for the Ebola crisis, about $7.3 million from United States donors, Mr. Kurmann said.

Including money given to the organization by governments, Doctors Without Borders has collected about $56.7 million restricted for use in fighting Ebola, Mr. Kurmann said. In comparison, the group received $138 million in restricted donations after the Haiti earthquake.

Partners in Health only recently started soliciting private contributions, after having first filed requests for support with the United States Agency for International Development and the Department for International Development in Britain, which are leading the medical efforts to address the crisis.

Mr. Whalen said the charitable gifts helped offset the costs of two trips to the affected region to find a place where the organization could establish a treatment center in Liberia with 50 to 100 beds and smaller, community-based treatment centers with 8 to 15 beds in Sierra Leone.

The International Medical Corps already has some 200 medical employees working in a 70-bed Ebola treatment center in Bong County, about 120 miles outside Monrovia, Liberia, and is working to construct and open a 50-bed center in Sierra Leone.

The Medical Corps started quietly fund-raising -- there are no photos of its Ebola-related activities on its home page -- in late July. ''It was slow going at first,'' said Rebecca Milner, chief fund-raiser for the organization. ''I think the pivotal moment was when the missionaries were brought back to the U.S. We've seen the interest and concern increasing since then.''

She said the slow pace of fund-raising reminded her of efforts to raise money for famines. ''You really have to beat the drums and hope the media gets there to shine a spotlight on the issues,'' Ms. Milner said.

The group has raised about $2.5 million in cash and in-kind contributions so far -- and it would rather have the cash than donations of equipment. It needs only very specific types of ''personal protective equipment'' -- the gloves, hoods, jumpsuits and other gear health care workers need to protect themselves.

Getting a variety of different types of suits and gloves and goggles greatly complicates the training process, Ms. Milner said. ''Your life literally depends on knowing the exact right way to put the gear on and the exact right way to take it off, and we can't train for a variety of different equipment,'' she said.

Direct Relief, which collects and distributes medicines and supplies to health care workers on the front lines, like those at Last Mile Health in Liberia, got ''masses of gloves,'' according to Thomas Tighe, its chief executive.

When it went to charter a 747 airplane to ferry supplies to Monrovia, Direct Relief had raised just $100,000 that was earmarked for Ebola relief. ''I kept wondering if we would get an overdraft charge from the bank,'' Mr. Tighe said.

Since then, Direct Relief has received roughly $1 million in cash for Ebola-related activities. At a similar point in past fund-raising efforts, it had received $5.1 million for Typhoon Haiyan, $6.4 million for the Haiti earthquake and $6 million for the Japanese tsunami.

Mr. Tighe said the group had received about 20 gifts from companies and foundations of between $25,000 and $65,000. Martin Gore of the band Depeche Mode raised $50,000 through a social media campaign and matched it for a total of $100,000.

The largest gift so far, $200,000, came from a Wall Street executive whom he had met during Hurricane Sandy. ''He just called up and said he wanted to do something to help with Ebola,'' Mr. Tighe said.

In fact, large gifts from individuals may end up being what differentiates the philanthropic response to this disaster from others, Mr. Rooney of the School of Philanthropy said. In addition to the Zuckerberg-Chan donation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $50 million to fight Ebola, distributing the first portion of it to the World Health Organization, Unicef and the C.D.C.; and Paul Allen, who helped found Microsoft with Mr. Gates, has promised $12.9 million to the C.D.C. on top of a $2.8 million gift to the American Red Cross that accounts for most of the money that organization has raised to address the outbreak. His total giving toward Ebola efforts is more than $26 million.

''It's really intriguing that the bulk of the private giving so far has come from a who's who of the Silicon Valley types of donors,'' Mr. Rooney said, ''but it really hasn't gone very much further than that yet.''

Obama hits campaign trail

President Obama jumped back on the campaign trail after a week of grim Ebola news, with a rally at a high school aimed at lifting the fortunes of Anthony G. Brown, Maryland’s lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for governor.

In a jam-packed gymnasium on Sunday, Mr. Obama urged the mostly African-American crowd of 8,000 to shake off any midterm malaise and show up on Nov. 4 to put Mr. Brown in the governor’s mansion.

‘‘There are no excuses. The future is up to us,’’ the president said, his voice rising above the roar of the enthusiastic crowd. ‘‘If you want better policies out of Washington, you’ve got to vote for them. If you want better policies in Maryland, you have to go vote for them.’’

Mr. Obama accused Republicans of betting that Democrats will not show up in November. But, he insisted, ‘‘I’m banking that strategy is not going to work.’’

The latest Washington Post poll in Maryland showed Mr. Brown with a nine-point lead over Larry Hogan, his Republican challenger. But the survey also showed Mr. Brown, who is black, drawing only 77 percent of African-American voters. In 2012, Mr. Obama won 97 percent of the black vote in the state, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research.

At the rally, Mr. Obama urged the audience to reject a Republican philosophy that he said had been thoroughly discredited in recent years.

‘‘They keep on offering the same tired, worn-out theories,’’ Mr. Obama said of the Republicans, citing tax breaks, looser regulations and a reduced safety net. ‘‘We have tried all those things. We tried ’em before I came into office. We know they did not work.’’

Before Mr. Obama’s speech ended, a steady trickle of people had departed, leaving some empty seats.

U.S. tightens protocols for at-risk health staff; Ebola guidelines mirror those used in Africa by Doctors Without Borders

United States officials have announced new guidelines for the protection of hospital workers caring for patients infected with Ebola — guidelines that might have prevented the infection of two nurses had they been in place a month ago.

The new guidelines, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are based on the very strict protocols used for years by Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C.’s executive director, said during an unusual late-evening telephone news conference.

Among other changes, the guidelines announced Monday say, no skin should be uncovered, street clothes and shoes should be replaced with waterproof fabric and boots, and every step of putting on and taking off equipment must be done under the watch of a supervisor whose job is to prevent mistakes.

The procedures were reviewed by Doctors Without Borders, a medical aid group based in Brussels, and by specialists at the three American hospitals that have successfully cared for Ebola patients — those at Emory University, the University of Nebraska and the National Institutes of Health.

The guidelines represent a recognition by the C.D.C. that Ebola victims require precautions quite different from those taken for airborne diseases like SARS, MERS, avian flu or tuberculosis.

It has never been proved that victims infected anyone by coughing or sneezing, but they emit copious amounts of highly infectious vomit, blood and diarrhea, so it is crucial that not even a speck gets into a medical worker’s eyes, mouth, nose or cuts.

The most difficult and dangerous part of the process, experts agree, is removing safety gear when infectious particles cover its surfaces.

There are some differences between the C.D.C. guidelines intended for American hospitals and those of Doctors Without Borders, which treats Ebola patients in makeshift field hospitals in Africa, some of which are tents built on open ground.

For example, Dr. Frieden said, in Africa it is possible to spray nurses and doctors down with a chlorine solution as they stand in a gravel pit. That would create slippery puddles in a hospital corridor, so the guidelines recommend bleach wipes.

Since the infection of two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where the only death from Ebola in the United States occurred, there has been a lot of finger-pointing. Dr. Frieden initially implied that some staff members at Presbyterian had not followed protocols.

A nurses’ union responded that the hospital had no protocols, had given the nurses no training and had forced them to work in gear that left skin exposed.

The hospital said it had followed C.D.C. protocols — which were voluntary, not required by law. But those turned out to be inadequate and outdated, designed to prevent routine infections and airborne diseases.

Spanish Nurse Infected With Ebola Is Declared Free of Disease

MADRID — The Spanish auxiliary nurse who was the first person known to have contracted the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus outside of Africa was declared to be cleared of the disease on Tuesday, after a second test in recent days came back negative, according to officials at the hospital where she has been treated since Oct. 7.

The nurse, María Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, was found to be infected after she treated a Spanish missionary at the Carlos III hospital in Madrid who had returned from West Africa with the disease; he died Sept. 25. Ms. Romero and officials at the hospital have suggested that she may have become infected by touching her face with a glove while removing protective gear.

José Ramón Arribas, a hospital official, told reporters in Madrid on Tuesday that it was too early to say when Ms. Romero would be discharged. “Although this fact is extraordinarily positive,” he said of the test results, “the recovery could drag on for a few days.”

Ms. Romero’s recovery will come as a significant relief for the Spanish authorities, who have been under pressure over their handling of Ebola. While Ms. Romero was being treated, health care workers held protests outside the hospital and elsewhere, demanding the resignation of the country’s health minister, Ana Mato.

At the Carlos III hospital, Ms. Romero was treated with blood plasma taken from people who had survived Ebola infections, and with an experimental drug as well, officials said, but specific details about her treatment have not been released.

On Sunday, after Ms. Romero first tested negative, her husband, Javier Límon, said in a video that the couple would go to court to demonstrate that his wife’s case had been mishandled. Officials ordered about 15 people in Spain[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/spain/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], including Mr. Límon, to be quarantined after Ms. Romero was found to be infected, but none has yet tested positive for the disease.

U.S. to Route Passengers From Ebola-Hit Nations to 5 Airports

WASHINGTON — Anyone flying to the United States from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa must enter the country through one of five airports screening for the disease, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said Tuesday as the Obama administration stepped up precautions to stop the spread of the virus.

Last week, the government instituted temperature checks for West Africans arriving at Kennedy International in New York, Newark Liberty International, Washington Dulles International, O’Hare International in Chicago, and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. The five airports already account for 94 percent of all arrivals from the affected countries — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. A fever is one symptom of the disease and an indication that the person could be infectious.

“We currently have in place measures to identify and screen anyone at all land, sea and air ports of entry into the United States who we have reason to believe has been present in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea in the preceding 21 days,” Mr. Johnson said in a written statement.

Mr. Johnson said airlines were working to reroute passengers who had been scheduled to arrive at other airports.

Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the administration must do more to protect Americans. “President Obama has a real solution at his disposal under current law and can use it at any time to temporarily ban foreign nationals from entering the United States from Ebola-ravaged countries,” Mr. Goodlatte said.

The temperature checks began more than a week ago at the five airports. But experts cautioned that a temperature check on arrival would almost certainly not have detected that Thomas Eric Duncan had Ebola before he entered the country from Liberia. The disease typically incubates for eight to 10 days before symptoms, including fever, develop.

American health officials believe Mr. Duncan did not have a fever when he arrived in the United States, a view seconded by his family. Mr. Duncan died of the disease on Oct. 8 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan — Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson — are now being treated for Ebola.

Officials in Dallas announced Monday that 43 of the people who had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan were declared Ebola-free and could return to work and school. Another group is still being monitored, including dozens of nurses and other hospital workers as well as passengers on airline flights that Ms Vinson took between Cleveland and Dallas before she was found to have Ebola.

On Tuesday in Dallas, Gov. Rick Perry said two treatment centers had been designated for any future patients who test positive for Ebola. One will be the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston; the other will be in a now-empty intensive care unit on a satellite campus of Methodist Health System in Dallas.

The center on the Methodist campus will be staffed by doctors and nurses from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, with additional support from Parkland Health and Hospital System. The 10-bed unit will be ready to receive patients by Wednesday, Mr. Perry said, and will need six hours notice to prepare for a patient with Ebola.

“Reality requires that all the resources of our health care system, in order for us to respond quickly and efficiently, have to be working very closely together,” Mr. Perry said.

The units in Galveston and Dallas will be modeled on special biocontainment units used to successfully treat Ebola patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

Submarine Search Near Stockholm Reminiscent of a Cold War Thriller

A mysterious vessel suspected of being a Russian submarine is spotted off the Stockholm archipelago. The Kremlin issues vehement denials and points fingers at another country. Unsubstantiated reports soon proliferate, including one that an enigmatic man in black[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-och-must-jagar-vadande-man/] has been spotted wading near the craft, a would-be spy on a secret mission.

The events leading to a five-day search for an underwater vessel off the coast of Sweden[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sweden/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] that may not exist has the makings of a Cold War thriller.

On Tuesday, the Swedish Defense Ministry said that a military search team of 200 personnel aboard ships, helicopters and minesweepers, was continuing to scour the Baltic Sea not far from Stockholm in search of an unidentified foreign vessel, in what Ingela Nilsson, a Swedish Defense Ministry spokeswoman, called the biggest such mobilization since the end of the Cold War.

“The Hunt for Reds in October,” as the search has been dubbed[https://twitter.com/JonathanRL/status/523724205209038848] on social media, has captured the global imagination at a time when Russia’s incursion into Ukraine — and reports of other perceived provocations[http://news.yahoo.com/swedish-cold-war-thriller-exposes-baltic-sea-nerves-161355472--finance.html] — has raised East-West tensions to a level not seen in decades. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization said in a statement Tuesday that it had scrambled fighter jets for the second day in a row[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/21/world/europe/ap-eu-baltics-nato-russia-.html?ref=world] to intercept Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea.

But the search has also spawned enough conspiracy theories, claims and counterclaims to fill a Tom Clancy novel. There has been speculation online and on social networks that Moscow has been trying out the prototype for a minisubmarine with the pep of a speedboat. The Swedish news media has also reported[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-och-must-jagar-vadande-man/] the sighting of a mysterious man in black wading into the water near a military base on Korso, suggesting a Russian-style James Bond sent to infiltrate from abroad.

The Swedish Defense Ministry said that the hunt for the vessel began at lunchtime Friday after several citizens reported spotting underwater movements near the Stockholm archipelago. The Swedish news media reported that the military had detected a distress call from a suspected Russian submarine possibly stranded underwater. Adding to the intrigue, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported that Sweden had intercepted encrypted messages relayed between the Stockholm archipelago and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, the headquarters of Russia’s Baltic fleet.

Ms. Nilsson stressed on Tuesday that it was not clear if the vessel was a submarine and what country it came from. But she said that the military was being vigilant at a time of assertiveness by the Russian military[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/20/the_hunt_for_black_october_sweden_submarine_russia]. For Sweden, a neutral country that is a member of the European Union but is not in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the hunt for the vessel, she said, has gripped the popular consciousness.

While the intrigue dominated newspaper headlines and dinner table banter, she added, everyday Swedes were not fearful. “I don’t think the normal person is afraid that Russia is going to invade us,” she said by phone from Stockholm. “People are more concerned about Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].”

In Sweden, where memories of the Cold War run deep, the episode recalled the “Whisky on the Rocks” episode in 1981,[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/02/world/soviet-sub-spends-sixth-day-grounded-on-swedish-coast.html] when a Soviet submarine hit an underwater rock off Karlskrona, leading to standoff that lasted more than a week. The Swedes suspected there were nuclear weapons aboard.[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/06/world/sweden-releases-soviet-sub-finds-signs-of-nuclear-arms.html] While the Soviet captain — whom Swedish officials at the time identified as Lt. Cmdr. Pyotr Gushin — was being questioned aboard a Swedish torpedo boat[http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/03/world/soviet-captain-is-interrogated-in-sub-incident.html] in the company of two Soviet diplomats, the submarine was pulled off the rock by the Swedes.

In this latest sighting of a suspicious vessel, Russian officials emphatically denied that the vessel was theirs, and instead suggested that it could be a Dutch submarine. But Dutch defense officials denied that suggestion Tuesday. Marloes Visser, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Ministry of Defense in The Hague, said by phone that the Netherlands had participated in an exercise in Sweden that ended on Friday, but at the time the mystery submarine was spotted on Friday, the Dutch vessel, Bruinvis, was safely anchored in Tallinn, Estonia. It is now on its way back to Netherlands, she said.

“All our submarines are accounted for,” she said.

As to why the Russians pointed to the Dutch, she said, “I don’t know what to think. It wasn’t one of our ships. Everyone was looking at us. But you have to ask the Russians.”

The Russians have said repeatedly that they have not lost a submarine and the Defense Ministry has denied sending underwater vessels into Swedish waters. Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a Russian government newspaper, said Monday that the Swedes might be seeing ghosts or creating Russian boogeymen to create a perceived threat to justify its forward posture.

“In fact this version fits well the spy hysteria that has recently gripped many western countries,” the newspaper reported. “Just like during the time of the Cold War, they see Russian provocations everywhere.”

Banner Day for S.&P. as Market Takes Heart

The stock market marched higher on Tuesday, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index its best day of the year.

Investors rallied behind an encouraging report on the Chinese economy as well as strong quarterly results from Apple and other big companies.

The market continues to recover from its swoon last week and has now erased much of its losses over the last two weeks.

“I think it’s too early to call to call this a new rally, but I think there are definite signs that investors are gaining confidence again after last week’s volatility,” said Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors.

The S.&P. 500 jumped 37.27 points, or 2 percent, to 1,941.28. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 215.14 points, or 1.3 percent, to 16,614.81. The Nasdaq composite index gained 103.40 points, or 2.4 percent, to 4,419.48.

This week has contrasted with last week’s turbulence in many ways. Volatility is down, the S.&P. 500 index is on pace to have its best week of the year and the price of crude oil has stopped sliding. The bond market has also stabilized, with the 10-year Treasury note remaining around 2.20 percent for several days.

“Last week the main thing driving the market was the decline in oil, the Ebola scare and the rally in the 10-year Treasury note,” said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. “All of those items have stabilized.”

That said, there is still a chance for bumps ahead, given that the Federal Reserve’s policy makers are to meet next week. The central bank is expected to end its bond-buying economic stimulus program. Growth worries in Europe and China are still top of mind, and corporate earnings reports could change the market’s direction quickly, experts said.

“Investors are likely to see more volatility, not less,” Ms. Hooper said.

A notable part of the market attracting investors is smaller, riskier companies. While the S.&P. 500 is down 1.6 for October, and the Dow down 2.5 percent, the Russell 2000 is up 1 percent.

“That’s an important sign that investors are regaining their confidence,” Ms. Hooper said.

Apple lifted the overall market. It rose $2.71, or 2.7 percent, to $102.47 after its quarterly results easily beat analyst expectations.

Investors also had an encouraging report out of Asia. China’s economy expanded by 7.3 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Although growth slowed slightly from the previous quarter’s 7.5 percent, analysts had expected a more marked slowdown, to 6.9 percent.

There was also bright news on the housing front. Existing-home sales rose in September at their fastest clip this year, a sign that the housing market is shaking off a slump that began in mid-2013. The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that sales rose 2.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million, reversing a decline in August.

In the bond market, interest rates edged higher on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.23 percent, from 2.19 percent late Monday, while its price dropped 9/32, to 101 10/32.

Caution and Calm Urged At Ebola Training Session

As thousands of health care workers watched raptly, a federal government doctor clad in a green impermeable gown, bootees and a face shield that looked like a welder’s mask demonstrated the latest protocols for fighting Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] at a huge training session in New York on Tuesday.

It was the highlight of a conference at the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan that brought together janitors, security guards, doctors, nurses and other workers from hospitals across the city who have been anticipating the possible arrival of the virus in New York and wondering whether they are sufficiently trained and equipped to deal with it.

The session, more than three hours, turned out to be part pep rally and part training conference, as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html] and Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html] kicked off events with speeches that took pains to pay tribute to 1199 S.E.I.U., the powerful health care workers union that was one of the organizers.

“What’s going to kill this disease is knowledge, is training, is preparation,” Mr. Cuomo said.

The governor said he remembered anthrax in 2001, the advent of H.I.V. in the 1980s and even the discovery of Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/science/a-witness-to-ebolas-discovery.html] in 1976, the year he turned 19, adding, in a Wikipedia-like note, that “it was named for a river in the Congo.”

He vowed New York would be different from Dallas, where two nurses have contracted the virus after caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died on Oct. 8[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html], because New York had more time to prepare.

“Keep the anxiety down, keep the fear down, because it’s unnecessary,” Mr. Cuomo told the workers who filled the hangar-style convention center. “It’s not right, and it only makes the situation more complex for all of us to deal with.”

But the demonstration of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., was what most workers in the audience had been waiting for. Protective techniques had been evolving rapidly and had been updated only the night before[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/cdc-issues-new-guidelines-for-ebola-care.html] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

Bryan Christensen, a doctor on the C.D.C.’s Domestic Infection Control Team for the Ebola Response, stood onstage, his image broadcast on two giant screens, to convey the latest details. Demonstrating the kind of buddy system that the C.D.C. recommends, he posed as the “trained observer” who made sure the nurse onstage with him correctly put on and took off her equipment.

“Margins of safety” was his buzz phrase, repeated again and again. Even gloved hands should be disinfected with alcohol rub, a new requirement to add a margin of safety, he said.

Officials advised that while some layers of protection were good, too many layers were bad, because they made it more difficult to work and to take off the layers, increasing the risk of contamination.

In answer to questions from the audience about what kind of cleaning solutions would work against Ebola, officials said while the virus was technically an “enveloped” virus, the best approach was to observe a margin of safety by using a solution approved for “non-enveloped” viruses. A solution marked as effective against norovirus would work, they said.

“Practice, practice, practice,” was the other mantra, as officials said that watching a demonstration was not enough.

The telephone is “one of the most powerful weapons” was yet another aphorism, delivered several times in so many words by Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, the C.D.C.’s associate director for preventing health-care-related infections. By that, Dr. Srinivasan explained, he meant that patients should be questioned before they got to the hospital, the urgent care center or the pharmacy about whether they had traveled during the previous month to Ebola-ridden countries like Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. (The incubation period for the disease is three weeks.)

With that precaution in mind, dispatchers in the city’s 911 system are now asking callers with Ebola-like symptoms about their travel histories.

New York State has designated eight hospitals as primary treatment centers for Ebola, though all hospitals are expected to have at least one isolation room that could handle a case.

Five of the hospitals are in New York City: Bellevue Hospital Center, the city’s flagship public hospital; Montefiore Medical Center; Mount Sinai; NewYork-Presbyterian; and North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.

New York has not seen a citywide health care training session of such magnitude since the post-Sept. 11 anthrax scares, according to a spokesman for the Greater New York Hospital Association, which sponsored the event with 1199 and Kaiser Permanente’s Partnership for Quality Care.

Chartered buses brought workers from some hospitals. Several health care workers in the audience said they had received similar training at their jobs, but appreciated the extra instruction.

Gloria Gonzalez, 25, a patient care associate at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Manhattan, said she had quickly found a babysitter when she was invited to attend. “We don’t expect anything to be 100 percent bulletproof,” she said. “But at least we understand what to expect.”

The event was not without its moments of levity. Asked whether large gloves would be available for people with big hands, Dr. Mary Bassett, the New York City health commissioner, stopped midsentence to say she felt as if she was talking about “some other latex materials.”

And as dozens of news photographers clustered around the P.P.E. demonstration, Dr. Christensen said, with a mix of bravado and plaintiveness, “When you do this in your hospital, hopefully there won’t be this many cameras and people watching.”

Demand Jumps for Protective Equipment as Ebola Cases Spur Hospitals Into Action

At manufacturing plants in North Carolina, Mexico and Honduras, the machines are standing ready.

The plants, which make gowns and other protective equipment that medical staff need to treat Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] patients, have hired extra workers to make sure the machines can run all night.

Some already are.

“We are not at our maximum capacity yet,” said Judson Boothe, the senior director of products supply for Halyard Health, a unit of Kimberly-Clark that operates the plants (it is soon to be spun off from its parent). “But we’re getting closer every day,” he said, adding that Halyard did hit its cap during the SARS outbreak.

Major manufacturers of personal protective equipment say they have already experienced a significant spike in demand for their products, as hospitals across the country brace for potential new cases of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which has already killed more than 4,500 people.

The Cleveland Clinic, part of a health system that is monitoring five nurses who were on the same flight as a nurse who contracted Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died in a Dallas hospital, says it has seen slight delays in shipments of new supplies.

“We don’t have everything we need yet, but I have not heard from our leadership or anyone that there’s a panic that we’re not getting what we need,” said Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the clinic.

Mr. Boothe says that orders for personal protective products have risen more than 30 percent above normal levels for this time of year, when medical workers typically prepare for flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] season. Halyard also packages kits of fluid-resistant products, including a gown, gloves, a shoe covering and a face mask, that sell for about $10 to $12 each.

DuPont, which makes body suits from Tychem or Tyvek, two types of fluid-resistant material, says it has tripled production for products that can be used to protect from Ebola. And Medline, a manufacturer and distributor of health care supplies, has recently begun selling specialized kits of equipment, at the request of its clients, that are designed with Ebola in mind.

Demand for specialized kits is up tenfold in the past month, according to a Medline spokeswoman, Kathryn Cummings, while demand for gowns and other protective gear has grown 25 percent in the last few weeks.

“We receive 30 to 40 calls a day inquiring about our kits,” said Dante Tisci, the president of one of Medline’s manufacturing divisions.

After the death of Mr. Duncan this month, Mr. Tisci said, many of those calls have come from Texas, although Medline has received more inquiries from the East Coast recently.

“I would definitely say that the demand during this specific pandemic has been much larger than in the past,” he said.

Manufacturers like Halyard and Medline typically sell their products to hospitals, or third-party distributors, and not directly to consumers.

“We are definitely open to that market if that market presents itself,” Mr. Tisci said, adding that almost all of the increase in demand had so far come from institutional clients.

While consumers are not rushing to pick up industrial-grade protective equipment from companies like Halyard, they may be looking for smaller ways to stay safe. Rite Aid, which sells masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and similar products, has seen a slight increase in demand.

“Store shelves have ample inventory, and we have access to additional inventory if necessary,” said Ashley Flower, a company spokeswoman. “We continue to closely monitor the situation and are prepared to respond as needed.”

Walmart and the Walgreen Company declined to comment on whether they were seeing any increase in sales. CVS/Caremark did not respond to requests for comment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for what medical workers should wear to treat Ebola patients, like fluid-resistant gowns that shield them from splashes of blood, feces and other fluids that transmit the virus.

But removing the equipment presents its own challenges. Officials said that a nurse who treated Mr. Duncan and tested positive for Ebola may have been infected in the process of removing her protective gear.

Mr. Tisci said that Medline would include use instructions only at the request of its customers, who provide the detailed directions themselves.

“We’re not telling our customers the proper way to gown and degown,” Mr. Tisci said. “A lot of our customers are really just following the C.D.C. guidelines.”

The C.D.C. says that medical personnel should wear fluid-resistant gowns and other protection that gives them 360-degree coverage. Hospitals around the country have had to quickly figure out which suits work best for them, and train their employees accordingly.

“The features of the actual personal protective equipment are the fluid resistance, but there’s also the ease of getting into it and more importantly out of it correctly,” said Dr. Lisa Maragakis, the director of hospital epidemiology and infection control at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. “I don’t know if saying that it’s difficult is right, except to say that you have to be trained and practiced.”

Dr. Maragakis said that the staff at Johns Hopkins had been practicing getting into and out of gowns using red paint to show whether or not they were contaminating themselves when taking the gowns off. (The Cleveland Clinic uses chocolate syrup, Ms. Sheil said.) Dr. Maragakis said that the hospital decided to use fluid-resistant gowns instead of Tyvek suits after finding that the suits were more difficult to remove without contamination.

“How a jumpsuit fits depends a lot on size much more than a gown does,” she said. “If you’re a taller person and the shoulders are on tightly, it’s harder to get your arm out of that sleeve.”

Suits typically have a zipper and often provide head-to-toe coverage, or at least shoulder-to-feet. Gowns typically cover shoulders to knees, and could provide the kind of coverage Ebola requires through overlapping layers and a tie. Gowns, like the fluid-resistant versions sold by Halyard and others, are often used in the operating room or in the trauma department when dealing with open wounds, Mr. Boothe said.

For now, manufacturers of personal protective equipment say they can handle any increase in demand. Medline said that it could produce up to one million fluid-resistant “coveralls” now, as the World Health Organization predicts that Ebola could reach 10,000 new cases a week by December.

“We just don’t know at this point how far it will progress, and how fast,” Mr. Boothe said.

Ebola Outbreak Erodes Recent Advances in West Africa

UNITED NATIONS — Nineteen thousand doctors and nurses will soon be needed to make a dent in West Africa’s Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak, but the world has yet to send more than a small fraction of them, the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] says. Of the 1,000 vehicles needed to help the effort, only 69 have arrived. Of the 500 burial teams needed to ensure that infected corpses do not spread the disease, only 50 are now on the ground — and there is no clarity on who will pay them.

In the breach, Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is fast washing away the small gains made over the last decade in war-scarred parts of West Africa, as schools shut down, immunization[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immunizations-general-overview/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] campaigns are suspended and a food crisis looms as farmers abandon their fields.

Donors had spent millions of dollars in an effort to strengthen the public health systems of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone long before the three countries became the center of the Ebola outbreak. Aid agencies of the United Nations have been active there for decades, with projects to train health workers, improve child mortality rates and get more children into school. United Nations peacekeepers helped shore up Sierra Leone for 20 years, since the end of its crippling war; Liberia had some 5,000 peacekeepers when the outbreak began this year.

Now a virus that doctors have controlled elsewhere has ballooned in West Africa, unraveling many of the gains made in these countries in recent years and potentially threatening the hard-won stability of this tinderbox part of the world.

Some clashes and strikes have broken out. Tensions are simmering between neighbors in the region, who have long fueled wars in one another’s countries. The International Fund for Agricultural Development, another United Nations agency, warned last week that the Ebola epidemic could “lead to a hunger crisis of epic proportions.”

Yet, only two months ago, the Security Council was considering scaling back its peacekeeping mission in the region more quickly, because United Nations troops were required in other countries. That proposal has since been suspended, and the United Nations is now clearly trying to make sure it can hold on to the blue-helmeted soldiers that it has on the ground, which may not be easy. The Philippines has announced that it will pull its troops from Liberia, citing Ebola risks.

“It seems obvious now that the health crisis could have knock-on effects on the economy and so on, but that wasn’t apparent” earlier on, said a United Nations diplomat who did not want to be identified in keeping with diplomatic protocol.

The United Nations has taken pains to assure diplomats that the peacekeeping mission has done all that it could to fight Ebola, including by spreading public health messages on its radio network, donating cars and body bags to the Liberian government, and helping to level the ground for the construction of treatment centers, according to a confidential memo to the Council. The United Nations has spent upward of $8 billion on the peacekeeping mission in Liberia since 2003.

Now, the United States is sending 4,000 soldiers to build Ebola treatment centers in Liberia. Britain and France are separately sending their own forces to build centers in their former colonies, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The biggest gap now is staffing. The United Nations emergency Ebola mission says the 19,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics are needed by Dec 1. By then, 10,000 Ebola patients could be pouring in each week. To turn around the transmission rate, the United Nations has set an ambitious goal: to isolate at least 70 percent of the sick and conduct safe burials for at least 70 percent of the dead.

The scramble follows a Security Council resolution, passed in mid-September, declaring Ebola to be a potential threat to peace and stability in the region. The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon has appealed for nearly $1 billion in aid; on Tuesday his trust fund[http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/EBO00] had a cash deposit of just under $9 million. Donors have separately given money and noncash contributions to specific programs, adding up to about $386 million[http://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-emergencyDetails&appealID=1060], or just under 40 percent of what Mr. Ban has asked for.

“There’s nowhere close to the money we require, nowhere close to the personnel we require, nowhere close to the assets we require,” Anthony Banbury, the head of the United Nations mission to contain Ebola said by phone from Accra, Ghana, after reviewing the needs on the ground. “It’s unconscionable.”

Jan Egeland, a former United Nations official and now head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said his group could not send health experts to West Africa until they were assured of proper care if they get Ebola and of being treated in an Ebola-free hospital if they were in an accident.

The United States military is now building a treatment center for foreign aid workers in Monrovia, the Liberian capital; it is projected to be ready by early next month. The European Union recently announced a medical evacuation system for international health workers.

“All of this should have been fixed early on” by the United Nations, in cooperation with the United States and European Union, Mr. Egeland said.

Aid has picked up since the Security Council’s appeals. The United States plans to build 18 treatment centers across Liberia. Germany is building a treatment center in Sierra Leone and another in Liberia, and using its military aircraft to transport supplies for the United Nations. China announced that it would send motorcycles to help track the disease, along with $6 million for food to those who are quarantined. A consortium of East African countries have promised to send 600 health workers.

But hospitals are needed for non-Ebola patients, too, and even before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia had a severe shortage of medical staff.

“The focus, rightly so, has been to set up treatment centers, but if you have people coming to them with malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], labor complications or other health needs, there are currently no hospitals or clinics to safely refer them,” said Kris Torgeson, a liaison officer for Doctors Without Borders in Liberia.

Mr. Banbury, who was in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, working to muster international response, called the Ebola epidemic the toughest and most complex humanitarian crisis he had ever seen.

Haiti is a critical object lesson for the United Nations. The earthquake was followed by a deadly cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak, and the United Nations has never addressed whether its peacekeepers were to blame. It faces a class-action lawsuit over cholera. Nor has it come close to rallying donors to help Haiti curb the disease once and for all.

Putin and the Pope

Reading the papers these days I find that the two world leaders who stir the most passion in me are Pope Francis and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. One is everything you’d want in a leader, the other everything you wouldn’t want. One holds sway over 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, the other over nine time zones. One keeps surprising me with his capacity for empathy, the other by how much he has become a first-class jerk and thug. But neither can be ignored and both have an outsized influence on the world today.

First, the pope. At a time when so many leaders around the world are looking to promote their political fortunes by exploiting grievances and fault lines, we have a pope asking his flock to do something hard, something outside their comfort zone, pushing them to be more inclusive of gays and divorced people.

Yes, Francis was rebuffed by conservative bishops at a recent Vatican synod when he asked them to embrace the notion that “homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,” adding, “are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities?”

But, as an editorial[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/opinion/vatican-signals-on-gays-and-remarriage-are-a-hopeful-beginning.html] in this paper noted: “The very fact that Francis ordered church leaders to address these challenges seems a landmark in Vatican history.” The pope asked that rejected language be published for all to see, while also cautioning against “hostile inflexibility — that is, wanting to close oneself within the written word, and not allowing oneself to be surprised by God.”

“Hostile inflexibility?” Whose leadership does that describe? Look at Putin’s recent behavior: His military was indirectly involved in downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine and his K.G.B. has not only been trying to take a bite out of Ukraine but are nibbling on Estonia, Georgia and Moldova, all under the guise of protecting “Russian speakers.”

I opposed NATO expansion because I believed that there are few global problems that we can solve without the help of Russia. By expanding NATO at the end of the Cold War, when Russia was weak, we helped to cultivate a politics there that would one day be very receptive to Putin’s message that the West is ganging up on Russia. But, that said, the message is a lie. The West has no intention of bringing Ukraine into NATO. And please raise your hand if you think the European Union plans to invade Russia.

Yet Putin just exploits these fears for two reasons. First, he has a huge chip on his shoulder — no, excuse me; he has a whole lumberyard there — of resentment that Russia is no longer the global power it once was. But rather than make Russia great again by tapping its creative people — empowering them with education, the rule of law and consensual politics to realize their full potential — he has opted for the shortcut of tapping his oil and gas wells and seizing power from his people.

And instead of creating a Russia that is an example to its neighbors, he relies on the brute force that his oil and gas can still buy him. While he rails against NATO, he is really afraid of European Union expansion — that Ukrainians would rather embrace the E.U. market and democracy rules than their historical ties to Russia because they know that through the E.U. they can realize potentials that would never be possible with Russia.

By seizing Crimea and stoking up nationalism, Putin was not protecting Russia from NATO. He was protecting himself from the viruses of E.U. accountability and transparency, which, if they took hold in Ukraine, could spread to Moscow, undermining his kleptocracy.

Normally, I wouldn’t care, but when the world is dividing between zones of order and disorder, and the world of order needs to be collaborating to stem and reverse disorder, the fact that Putin is stoking disorder on Russia’s borders, and not collaborating to promote order in the Middle East, is a real problem. What’s more worrying is that the country he threatens most is Russia. If things go bad there — and its economy is already sagging under Western sanctions — the world of disorder will get a lot bigger.

That is why Putin’s leadership matters, and so does the pope’s. I’m focused on Putin because I think he is making the world a worse place for bad reasons, when he could make a difference in Europe and the Middle East with just an ounce more decency and collaboration. America, too, has plenty to learn from the pope’s humility, but say what you will, we’re still focused on trying to strengthen the global commons, whether by protecting people from jihadists in Iraq or fighting Ebola in Africa. We could do more. Putin needs to do a lot more. 

“The best leaders don’t set timid and selfish goals that are easy to meet but instead set bold and inclusive goals that are hard to achieve,” remarked Timothy Shriver, the chairman of Special Olympics, who has just written a book on leadership, “Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most.” “We’re all looking for ways to make sense of a world without a center, but we’ll only find that in people who lead with authentic humility and reckless generosity.”

Americans who are worried about the risk of an Ebola outbreak in this country can take heart from two recent successes. In Texas, 43 people who were being monitored because they had had direct or indirect contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died of Ebola in a Dallas hospital, were found clear of the Ebola virus on Monday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/us/texas-officials-clear-43-people-after-ebola-monitoring.html].

Also that day, the World Health Organization declared[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/20-october-2014/en/] Nigeria free of Ebola. The Nigerian health authorities were able to snuff out a small outbreak that could have spread through the crowded slums of Lagos, a city with 21 million people, and beyond.

The Nigerian success can be attributed primarily to an extraordinarily vigorous effort to track down everyone who had contact with a possibly infected person and isolating and treating anyone found to have the disease so that they would not infect anyone else. This strategy is what American health officials mean when they say Ebola can be contained through standard public health measures of tracking and isolation.

Nigeria’s outbreak started on July 20 when a Liberian who was a naturalized American citizen defied medical advice, left a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, where he was being held for observation, and flew to Lagos. He died five days later but not before infecting nine doctors and nurses who thought he had malaria.

An all-out effort to find and isolate hundreds of potential contacts in Lagos and other parts of the country held the outbreak to only 19 patients who came down with Ebola, of whom seven died. That was deemed a “spectacular success story” by the W.H.O. Another West African country, Senegal, which had a single imported case and a smaller number of contacts to trace and isolate, was declared free of Ebola on Friday.

Both countries will need to keep their guards up. As long as the epidemic rages out of control in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, there will always be a risk that infected people will leave their home countries and seek better conditions elsewhere.

In Dallas, the 43 people being monitored emerged from the 21-day incubation period for the virus without a single one becoming sick. That includes Mr. Duncan’s fiancée, who cared for him when he was sick, and three other family members in the same apartment; all four stayed in the apartment for several days with contaminated towels and bedding that had not been sanitized.

It remains possible that additional health care workers — beyond the two nurses who are already infected — will come down with Ebola. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital made mistakes in dealing with the Ebola patient and the nurses who cared for him. They have now taken steps to prevent further mishaps. The danger of an outbreak affecting the public in this country is very, very slight, and the experience in Nigeria and Senegal shows that diligent responses can work.

The Democratic Panic

After a few days of trying to ignore the question, Michelle Nunn, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in Georgia, acknowledged on Friday[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/221133-michelle-nunn-i-voted-for-obama] that she had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. By this year’s standards, that’s pretty forthright, especially compared with Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat running for the Senate in Kentucky, who refuses to discuss her presidential vote.

Only one Democratic Senate candidate this cycle has been willing to appear with the president on the stump: Gary Peters[http://time.com/3510112/obama-midterm-election-democrat/] in Michigan. The others have spent months keeping their distance from Mr. Obama and some of his best policies. Even Ms. Nunn just started running a television ad[http://youtu.be/SB11dMrnY-U] complaining that an attack ad by her Republican opponent, David Perdue, featured a misleading photo of her and Mr. Obama. The photo was actually taken at an event honoring President George H.W. Bush, she said.

The panicky Democratic flight away from President Obama — and from some of the party’s most important positions — is not a surprise. Mr. Obama remains highly unpopular among white voters, particularly in Southern states where candidates like Ms. Nunn, Ms. Grimes and several others are struggling to establish leads. But one of the reasons for his unpopularity is that nervous members of his own party have done a poor job of defending his policies over the nearly six years of his presidency, allowing a Republican narrative of failure to take hold.

Few voters know that the 2009 stimulus bill contributed heavily[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/dont-tell-anyone-but-the-stimulus-worked.html] to the nation’s economic recovery, saving and creating 2.5 million jobs. Not a word of it is spoken on the campaign trail, where little credit is also given to the White House for months of promising economic news.

Similarly, the Affordable Care Act, one of the most far-reaching and beneficial laws to have been passed by Congress in years, gets little respect even among the Democratic candidates who voted for it. Though none support the Republican position of repeal, most talk about the need to “fix” the health law, as if it were a wreck alongside the road rather than a vehicle providing millions of people with health coverage.

“When I think about the health care law, frustrated, disappointed, you can put a lot of words toward it, but every day I work to try to fix it,” said Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, in a radio ad[http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-09/democrats-favorite-fword-for-obamacare]. (Mr. Begich voted for the law.) In a recent debate, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat of North Carolina, talked mostly about the “common-sense fixes” she wants to make to the law.

Several Democratic candidates, including Ms. Hagan, Ms. Nunn, and Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, quickly adopted the right-wing talking point that President Obama needs to impose a travel ban[http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/mark-pryor-kay-hagan-travel-ban-ebola] on all residents of African countries with Ebola cases, even though most public-health experts say such a ban would be ineffective and could make the situation worse.

Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who has fought loudly against the president’s energy policies, has scurried so far to the right that she even opposes legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, though her leading Republican opponent supports it.

Many of these candidates are running in difficult political environments and are being careful about what they say or don’t say in hopes of preserving Democratic control of the Senate. They run the risk, though, of alienating important constituencies who prefer a party with a spine, especially black voters, who remain very supportive of Mr. Obama. By not standing firmly for their own policies, Democrats send a message to voters that the unending Republican criticism of the president is legitimate. There is much that is going right in this country, and there is still time for Democrats to say so.

U.S.
Ebola Prompts Universities to Tighten Travel Rules
By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

Many universities have begun to tighten restrictions on travel to the countries hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic, even for professors doing humanitarian work. But settling on a policy represents a delicate balance for administrators, especially at universities with graduate schools of public health and medicine.

Outbreaks such as those in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the most affected countries, offer a rare chance for faculty members and graduate students to serve and learn. But universities face pressure to show they are guarding against spreading the disease in the United States.

“The university has a service mission, and we have experts and researchers who can contribute actively to solving the problem and containing it,” said John H. Coatsworth, provost of Columbia University[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbia_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Four people from the university are working on the Ebola response in Liberia and Sierra Leone, he said, and two more are en route.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] issued a warning[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices] last week against nonessential travel to the three countries. In response, many universities imposed travel restrictions or toughened those already in place.

The State University of New York[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/state_university_of_new_york/index.html?inline=nyt-org] system, among others, has prohibited university-supported travel to the three countries. Cornell[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/cornell_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has released a new policy prohibiting students and staff members from going to the countries, though it raised the possibility of exceptions.

Many other universities have banned most travel to the three countries, while leaving open the possibility of trips for Ebola-related research or relief work. That often means low-risk work that would not include contact with patients, like training health care workers or building computer systems for disease monitoring — the kind of work done by two Yale University graduate students who are in voluntary quarantine after a trip to West Africa.

New York University’s new policy, issued Monday, prohibits travel to the three countries but mentions possible exceptions for “faculty who are to be involved in providing care or otherwise providing assistance related to the crisis.” Similar new bans by Harvard[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/harvard_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and Columbia allow humanitarian exceptions, which administrators must approve.

“They must apply through their school, receive the approval of their dean, and then they must be approved by me,” Dr. Coatsworth said. “And we will give that approval only in cases when we are certain that the travel will indeed help in containing the disease and that the traveler is well-prepared.”

Officials at several universities noted that professors could travel on their own or under the auspices of hospitals, charities or United Nations agencies, without the universities’ approving or even knowing. They said their policies might become more restrictive if conditions in the affected countries worsened, threatening the ability of universities to help staff members who might need assistance there.

Johns Hopkins University[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/j/johns_hopkins_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has not prohibited travel to the three countries, but it has discouraged such trips. Officials have told students and faculty members to notify the university of their movements abroad and to take precautions when they return. About 15 people from Johns Hopkins have done Ebola-related work in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea this year, said Jonathan M. Links, the university’s chief risk officer and a professor in several fields, including public health.

William Brieger, a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins, is in Liberia working with the Ministry of Health and Unicef on programs to fight Ebola. “Without all the different skills people can bring from various organizations, including universities, it’s going to be difficult to control this,” Professor Brieger said by telephone. As for his safety, he added, “I’m not going into clinical settings, so there is no logical reason why I would come into contact with it.”

The University of Texas[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_texas/index.html?inline=nyt-org] School of Public Health has no Ebola-related travel policy, but university-sanctioned work abroad requires approval from a committee, said Joseph McCormick, a regional dean who sits on such a committee and has done extensive work on Ebola.

“We would look very closely at how you’re going to protect yourself, who you’d be going with and the importance of the work,” he said. “But the answer wouldn’t just be ‘Oh, no, you can’t go.’ ”

Testing for Ebola Vaccines to Start Soon, W.H.O. Says

Health authorities and pharmaceutical companies are planning to test several new vaccines to prevent Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] infection over the next few months, including one that is taken as a tablet, making it easier to deploy in West Africa.

The plans signify that a response to the Ebola outbreak is finally gathering steam. It is still unclear if any of these vaccines will work, however, and even if they do, they may not be ready in time to help stem the current epidemic.

Starting in January, two vaccines will be tested in large studies in the West African countries most affected by the outbreak, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said on Tuesday. At least three other vaccines will begin safety testing in healthy volunteers outside the outbreak zone in the first quarter of 2015.

One of those three is actually a combination of two inoculations being developed by Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, a Danish company.

Johnson & Johnson announced early Wednesday that it was committing $200 million to the program, including making an equity investment of about $43 million in Bavarian Nordic to help pay for that company’s part in the project. It says it plans to begin safety trials in January and hopes to produce one million doses in 2015, with 250,000 available for broad application in clinical trials by May.

“Typically, you don’t make hundreds of thousands of vaccines before you know what the safety and immunogenicity is,” said Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson. “This time, we will do that.”

The two most advanced vaccines in terms of development is each undergoing testing in about 250 healthy adult volunteers in the United States and other countries outside the outbreak region.

One of the vaccines was developed by the National Institutes of Health[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and GlaxoSmithKline[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/glaxosmithkline_plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. The other was initially developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a company in Iowa.

The studies, known as Phase 1 clinical trials, are determining if the vaccines are safe and generate an immune response[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immune-response/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Preliminary results are expected by the end of the year, Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organization’s assistant director general for health systems and innovation, said in a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.

But she said her organization was not waiting for those results. It is already planning the next stage of testing, to be ready to start in January if the vaccines pass the initial tests. Those new trials will take place in the affected countries in West Africa and would involve tens of thousands of doses, she said.

There are various scientific and ethical issues to be worked out, including who should receive the vaccine and whether it would be ethical to give some participants a placebo instead. Initial studies are likely to involve health care workers but might also involve others at high risk of infection.

“We are doing everything we can to produce as many doses as we can as quickly as we can,” said Dr. Ripley Ballou, who leads the vaccine effort for GlaxoSmithKline.

Dr. Ballou said that while Glaxo would not have enough doses to vaccinate millions of Africans against Ebola, there should be enough by sometime next year to help slow the outbreak by protecting health care workers or those close to infected people.

Dr. Kieny said that three other vaccines would be ready early next year to enter Phase 1 testing, starting with the combination from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic.

A second is being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a small company in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The third is from Protein Sciences of Meriden, Conn., which already sells a flu vaccine[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/influenza-vaccine/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Dr. Kieny also said her organization was trying to find out more about vaccines being developed in Russia.

She did not mention the tablet vaccine, which Vaxart, a privately held company in South San Francisco, Calif., is developing.

Wouter Latour, the chief executive, said in an interview that, after recent discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company hoped to start a Phase 1 safety trial toward the end of the first quarter of 2015.

“This is ideal to bring to bear on the Ebola crisis,” Dr. Latour said. Not only is it not injected but it is stable at room temperature. Some of the other vaccines must be stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius, which might be difficult in parts of West Africa.

Dr. Latour said Vaxart’s vaccine protected mice against Ebola but is only now being tested in monkeys. But an experimental flu vaccine developed using the same approach has already been tested in a small number of people. It generated immune responses comparable to or even better than approved flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] vaccines, the company’s chief scientist said in a presentation last week at the World Vaccine Congress in Brussels.

Another company, Profectus BioSciences of Baltimore, received federal funding last week to move its Ebola vaccine toward clinical trials.

WASHINGTON -- Anyone flying to the United States from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa must enter through one of five airports screening for the disease, Jeh C. Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said Tuesday as the Obama administration stepped up precautions to stop the spread of the virus.

The government had already instituted temperature checks for West Africans arriving at Kennedy International in New York, Newark Liberty International, Washington Dulles International, O'Hare International in Chicago, and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. The five airports already account for 94 percent of all arrivals from the affected countries -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. A fever is one symptom of the disease and an indication that the person could be contagious.

Mr. Johnson said airlines were working to reroute passengers who had been scheduled to arrive at other airports. Some members of Congress have been pressing for a travel ban from those countries.

Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called the move a ''good and effective step'' toward protecting Americans.

But Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the administration must do more to protect Americans. ''President Obama has a real solution at his disposal under current law and can use it at any time to temporarily ban foreign nationals from entering the United States from Ebola-ravaged countries,'' Mr. Goodlatte said.

The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that 562 travelers had undergone screening at the five airports; none had tested positive for Ebola.

Experts cautioned that the temperature checks would almost certainly not have detected that Thomas Eric Duncan had Ebola before he entered the country from Liberia. The disease typically incubates for eight to 10 days before symptoms, including fever, develop.

American health officials believe Mr. Duncan did not have a fever when he arrived in the United States, a view seconded by his family. Mr. Duncan died of the disease on Oct. 8 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Two nurses who treated Mr. Duncan -- Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson -- are now being treated for Ebola. Ms. Pham's status was upgraded on Tuesday to good from fair by the National Institutes of Health.

Officials in Dallas announced Monday that 43 of the people who had direct or indirect contact with Mr. Duncan were declared Ebola-free and could return to work and school. Another group is still being monitored, including nurses and other hospital workers as well as passengers on airline flights that Ms. Vinson took between Cleveland and Dallas before she was found to have Ebola.

In Dallas, Timothy Wayne, 13, returned to class at Sam Tasby Middle School after a three-week absence. His mother is Louise Troh, Mr. Duncan's fiancée. Timothy, his mother and two others who lived with them had been under a state-ordered quarantine.

Timothy was one of eight Dallas pupils potentially exposed to Mr. Duncan. Four returned to their schools on Monday.

School staff members were watching for any signs of bullying. A number of parents at a school in a nearby district, Armstrong Elementary, kept their children home the day after Dallas County's top elected official, Clay Jenkins, whose daughter attends Armstrong, went to see Ms. Troh while she was in quarantine.

At the Tasby school, Christina Cobbin, 11, said teachers had spoken to pupils about Ebola. ''They just told us that it's not airborne, and that you have to eat fluids from them, and they said that when they come back, if they hear anything about the kids making fun of them, that that's an automatic suspension,'' she said.

Also on Tuesday in Dallas, Gov. Rick Perry said two treatment centers had been designated for any future Ebola patients. One will be at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston; the other will be in a now-empty intensive care unit on a satellite campus of Methodist Health System in Dallas.

The center on the Methodist campus will be staffed by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, with support from Parkland Health and Hospital System. The 10-bed unit will be ready to receive patients by Wednesday, Mr. Perry said.

''Reality requires that all the resources of our health care system, in order for us to respond quickly and efficiently, have to be working very closely together,'' Mr. Perry said.

The units in Galveston and Dallas will be modeled on special biocontainment units used to successfully treat Ebola patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

Doctors at the Nebraska unit said on Tuesday that Ashoka Mukpo, an American who has been in isolation there for the past two weeks getting treatment for Ebola, no longer has the virus in his bloodstream. Mr. Mukpo, 33, will be released on Wednesday. A freelance cameraman for NBC, he was found to have Ebola early this month in Liberia.

Americans think America is a scary place — and getting scarier. In a new survey, 54.8 percent of respondents said child abduction had gotten more common over the last 20 years. Sixty-two percent said the same of gang violence.

In fact, rates of abduction[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-missing-children/2013/05/10/efee398c-b8b4-11e2-aa9e-a02b765ff0ea_story.html] and violent crime[http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/08/us/study-gun-homicide/] have dropped — and while looking at what Americans are worried about may not reveal the actual dangers they face, it could tell us something about what fear can and can’t do.

The survey[http://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/research-centers/babbie-center/survey-american-fears.aspx], developed by researchers at Chapman University, found that some of Americans’ worst fears were walking alone at night (20.3 percent of respondents felt “not at all safe” doing this), having their identities stolen (19.6 percent were “very afraid” of this), becoming the victim of a mass shooting (8.9 percent were “very afraid”) and having to speak in public (8.8 percent were “very afraid”). The Internet was also a source of great concern: 11.3 percent of respondents felt “not at all safe” there, and 21.5 percent were “very concerned” about corporations tracking their personal data online.

Christopher Bader, the Chapman sociology professor who led the research, told Op-Talk that respondents’ fears about their online activity initially surprised him. But on reflection, he said, the finding made sense: “People are more afraid of things that have more immediacy to them, and people are constantly using their debit cards all day long, constantly giving away their personal information all day long, and we’re constantly on the Internet.”

Some of his team’s other findings were more disturbing. Many respondents reported being afraid of natural disasters, yet relatively few said they had an emergency kit at home to help them weather such disasters. “Despite a lot of fear,” Dr. Bader said, “there is very little preparation.”

This finding may have implications for public health. Fear-based messages about Ebola, for instance, are unlikely to help Americans prepare for an epidemic, said Dr. Bader. “What we’re seeing with natural disasters tells us that those fear campaigns might not work.”

“Fear seems to lead to paralysis,” he explained. “When people are afraid, that fear might lead them to support initiatives such as ‘let’s stop all flights to Africa,’ but it doesn’t seem to lead people to make day-to-day changes.”

The survey may also cast doubt on health education programs that try to scare kids about drugs or sex. Dr. Bader cited other research showing that the “whole ‘this is your brain on drugs’ type of message doesn’t work as well as just teaching people basic decision-making skills. The fear campaigns don’t tend to work as well as we would hope they would in terms of motivating action and preparedness.”

Dr. Bader and his team plan to conduct a fear survey once a year, and they hope to find out not just what people are afraid of, but how their fears affect them and American society. Dr. Bader’s concerned that in some cases, fear could become a “self-fulfilling prophecy.”

“Sometimes when we’re afraid of something,” said Dr. Bader, “even if our fears are irrational, that can lead us to make choices that will actually cause the thing that we are avoiding.” He cited research showing that when public spaces are empty, criminals tend to move into them: “Parks get more dangerous when people are afraid of going to parks because they think they’re dangerous.”

When he asks students if they’d stop to help someone by the side of the road, he added, they frequently tell him they’d be afraid that person was a serial killer. “Serial killings are extraordinarily rare,” he said, “but this fear of them leads us not to help people” — and “when we don’t help people, it damages the bonds in our society.”

For now, Dr. Bader wants readers of his research to “realize America is not as dangerous a place as it used to be.” And he hopes the survey helps Americans understand “that many of our fears are driven by things other than reality.”

Good morning on this wet Wednesday.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, despite a general aversion to debates[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/nyregion/cuomo-is-running-but-isnt-one-to-talk-about-it.html] in this race, has agreed to a single televised bout.

Tonight at 8 o’clock, the governor will face his Republican challenger Rob Astorino[http://www.robastorino.com/], the Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins[http://www.howiehawkins.org] and the Libertarian Michael McDermott[http://www.mcdermottforcongress2014.com/].

The debate in Buffalo, which will by televised in New York on WNET Channel 13[http://www.thirteen.org/] and in Buffalo on WNED[http://wned.org/component/k2/item/879-new-york-gubernatorial-debate-to-take-place-oct-22-at-wned-wbfo], may leave little time for questions.

So a few pundits offered us questions that they believed would probably not be asked, but should be.

• Bruce N. Gyory[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/nyregion/14polls.html], political consultant: “How do you help New York City prepare for population explosion? And at the same time, how are you going to try to turn around the upstate decline?”

• Donna Lieberman[http://www.nyclu.org/node/1022], executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union: “Public schools in New York State, according to a recent U.C.L.A. study, are the most racially segregated in the nation. Were you were aware of this? What would you do to address this?”

• Gerald Benjamin[http://www.newpaltz.edu/ocm/experts/display.cfm?id=53], political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz: “Who are the greatest governors in New York history? What made them great? Are you confident you could live up to that standard?”

• Lee M. Miringoff[http://maristpoll.marist.edu/tag/lee-miringoff/], director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion: “What is the biggest mistake you’ve made as an executive? What went wrong in your thinking that wouldn’t happen again?”

It goes up for auction today at 1 p.m. at Bonhams[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22247/], along with dozens of items related to the history of science.

They include globes, telescopes, engravings, a vintage Apple computer and a letter that Charles Darwin wrote in 1857 on the sex life of barnacles.

David Kohn, director and general editor of the Darwin Manuscripts Project at the American Museum of Natural History, told The Associated Press[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/0b69596232744ba7ba881f07965139f6/charles-darwin-letter-early-apple-nyc-auction] the letter was “definitely amusing.”

Darwin spent nearly a decade[http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c5] studying barnacles and discovered that far from being hermaphroditic, the little things possessed the largest penises of any creature, relative to their body size.

For about $30,000, the letter is yours.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

Developing: • Shots fired in Canada’s Parliament.

Police were looking for more than one gunman after three shootings in Ottawa[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/world/americas/canada-parliament-gunfire.html].

A soldier guarding the National War Memorial was shot, multiple rounds were fired inside the adjacent Parliament building and a shooting was reported at a nearby shopping mall.

• Ebola, at home and abroad.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today that it will screen all travelers to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and monitor them for 21 days.

In Washington, Ron Klain, who brings government experience[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/17/?entry=2750] but no health background, starts as the Ebola response coordinator today, but White House officials say he will not testify Friday at a scheduled congressional hearing.

Several new vaccines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/business/testing-for-ebola-vaccines-to-start-soon-who-says.html] that may prevent the Ebola infection are being fast-tracked for testing, but the process will still take months, officials say.

• Guilty verdicts in Blackwater trial.

After 28 days of deliberation, jurors found one Blackwater security guard guilty of murder[http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-22/blackwater-guard-found-guilty-of-murder-in-2007-iraq-shooting] and three others guilty of voluntary manslaughter.

They were accused in the deaths of 17 Iraqis in 2007 in Baghdad. The jury is expected to continue deliberating on other counts.

• Illustrious editor dies.

Ben Bradlee, who oversaw the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting at The Washington Post that led to the fall of President Richard M. Nixon, died on Tuesday. He was 93.

Called by a colleague the “last of the lion-king newspaper editors[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/business/media/ben-bradlee-editor-who-directed-watergate-coverage-dies-at-93.html],” Mr. Bradlee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country’s highest civilian honor, in 2013.

• Midterm election countdown.

The vice president (in Illinois) and his wife (in Texas) stump for Democratic candidates today.

On the Republican side, several potential 2016 presidential candidates (Rick Santorum, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz) rally for candidates in South Dakota, Iowa, South Carolina and Illinois.

• Tourist held by North Korea comes home.

Jeffrey Fowle, an American tourist detained after leaving a Bible at a sailor’s club, arrived in Ohio[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/politics/north-korea-american-release/] today after his unexpected release Tuesday.

• The “hunt for Reds in October” resumes.

The Swedish Defense Ministry said that military teams on ships, helicopters and minesweepers continued their search today of the Baltic Sea near Stockholm for an unidentified foreign vessel[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/world/europe/submarine-search-near-stockholm-reminiscent-of-a-cold-war-thriller.html] that may be a Russian submarine.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are flat after sharp gains Tuesday. Europe eked out some gains, and Asia ended sharply higher.

• Social Security[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] raise.

Social Security payments will increase 1.7 percent in January, the amount that the consumer price index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/consumer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rose over the last 12 months, the government said today.

September’s C.P.I. edged up 0.1 percent.

• Target, still recovering from a credit card data theft a year ago, said today that it is offering free shipping[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/target-offers-free-shipping-holiday-items-26359768] on all online orders for the holiday season.

• The French oil giant Total named Patrick Pouyanne[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/22/us-total-future-idUSKCN0IB18B20141022], a longtime company manager, as chief executive. Total’s previous C.E.O. died in a plane accident in Moscow on Monday.

• AT&T reports quarterly earnings today. Profits out earlier today from Boeing and GlaxoSmithKline outpaced expectations.

NOTEWORTHY

• San Francisco takes Game 1.

The Royals have a chance to even the score tonight in the second game of the World Series (8 o’clock, Fox).

The Giants seized the lead[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-sf-giants-kansas-city-royals-game-1.html] Tuesday night with a three-run first inning and never looked back, winning, 7-1. The Royals’ only score was a home run in the seventh.

• Pump it up.

A new study suggests that listening to music[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/how-music-can-boost-a-high-intensity-workout/] makes strenuous workouts feel easier and may help people to push themselves harder.

• The earliest Apple.

An Apple-1 motherboard[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-21/a-1976-apple-1-is-expected-to-sell-for-up-to-400-000-at-auction] from 1976, most likely made in Steve Jobs’s garage and one of the few still working, is expected to fetch $300,000 at auction in New York today.

That’s many times the original $666 retail price.

A 1905 Helmholtz Sound Synthesizer, the first electric keyboard, and a letter from Charles Darwin are also among the items at Bonhams’ History of Science[http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22247/] auction.

• Black roots.

“Music of black origin” takes center stage at the 19th MOBO Awards[http://www.mobo.com/about-us] ceremony today in London, with honors[http://www.mobo.com/voting] for hip-hop, reggae, gospel, African and jazz performers, among others.

• Risky business.

The National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center tweaks its terms[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/dy1-3example/] to be more precise about levels of danger from severe storms.

There will now be five risk categories instead of three: marginal (new), slight, enhanced (new), moderate and high.

BACK STORY

The outline of India will be perceptibly brighter on satellite images for the next couple of days.

It is the festival of lights[http://www.theweek.co.uk/world-news/55857/diwali-2014-the-meaning-of-the-hindu-festival-of-lights], Diwali, also known as Deepavali.

Hindus celebrate with clay lamps, fireworks and bonfires. Scientists say the air pollution in New Delhi[http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/10/21/india-pollution-diwali-delhi-idINKCN0IA1MD20141021] will eclipse even Beijing’s this week because of Diwali fires.

Gifts and bonuses are a central part of the celebration, and sales of gold[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-people-throng-jewellery-shops-on-dhanteras-as-prices-rise-2028168] and silver jewelry surge.

The Indian minister of human resource development is giving out 15,000 saris[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Smriti-Irani-sends-12000-saris-to-Amethi-as-Diwali-gift/articleshow/44892793.cms] in one region’s villages. (India’s prime minister[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/pm-narendra-modi-to-spend-diwali-in-flood-hit-srinagar-610011] will spend Diwali in the flood-hit Kashmir region.)

But one company owner just set a standard for largess that may not be soon repeated.

The owner of a diamond export company gave 491 cars, 525 pieces of diamond jewelry and 200 apartments[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-29686366] to more than 1,200 of his employees for Diwali.

Remembering a Legend: “He Was So Dashing” Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where Republicans have a 66 percent chance[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/] of claiming control of the Senate with midterm elections 13 days away. President Obama is meeting with his new Ebola “czar,” while big-name Republicans such as Representative Paul D. Ryan and Senator Rand Paul are barnstorming battleground states. But many in Washington will be looking back on the life of a journalism legend.

We were still at work in the Washington bureau on Tuesday night when word arrived that the Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/business/media/ben-bradlee-editor-who-directed-watergate-coverage-dies-at-93.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LargeMediaHeadlineSumCentered&module=photo-spot-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news], who led the newspaper during Watergate and Vietnam, had died.

The news set off a flood of memories among those of us who knew him.

Elisabeth Bumiller, the Times deputy bureau chief, recalled her job interview with Mr. Bradlee in 1979. She was 23 and applying for a position covering parties for the Style section.

And Mr. Bradlee was already a legend.

“I was terrified,” Ms. Bumiller said. “I came down from Columbia Journalism School just before graduation. I was ushered into Ben’s office. He said: ‘Listen, kid, I’m just concerned that you are really young. This is a whole new city. Do you even know the names of the people in the cabinet?’ I said, ‘Oh, yes, I do.’ It was a total lie. Ben said to me, ‘I don’t believe you, kid, but you’re hired.’ “

Ms. Bumiller worked at The Post for five years and said it was “a thrilling place when he was around.”

It was Ms. Bumiller’s job to cover the Washington social scene, and she would occasionally run into Mr. Bradlee and his wife, Sally Quinn, who were among the city’s most sought-after party guests.

“I covered a party at Katharine Graham’s house once,” Ms. Bumiller said, referring to The Post’s publisher. “She had a party for President Reagan, when he was still president-elect. It was a tradition. All the reporters were outside her house on R Street. It was really cold out. Ben and Sally were inside. So he came out and said: ‘Kid, I feel really bad for you, it’s freezing out there.’ And he gave me the keys to his car. So I sat in his car with the heat on because I had to cover people coming and going to the party.”

Ms. Bumiller added: “He was like a character out of a movie. Not just women, men loved him, too. He was so dashing.”​

States Are on Rebound, but Governors Get No Credit From the tone of this year’s campaigns, you’d be forgiven if you thought the states with the closest elections were bleak landscapes unchanged since the Great Recession.

Yet on Tuesday, the monthly state jobs report[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/21/?entry=3047] from the Bureau of Labor Statistics — the last one before Nov. 4 – showed that not to be true.

In Colorado, where the Democratic governor, John W. Hickenlooper, is in a dead heat for re-election and Senator Mark Udall, also a Democrat, is trailing, the unemployment rate dropped to a healthy 4.7 percent. (The national rate is 5.9 percent.)

The news from Florida wasn’t as good. Still, unemployment is at 6.1 percent, down from 6.9 percent a year ago, but Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, doesn’t seem to be benefiting.

Illinois? Its unemployment rate went to 6.6 percent from 9.1 percent in a year — the largest drop in the country — but the Democratic governor, Pat Quinn, is struggling.

In Michigan, unemployment is down to 7.2 percent from 8.8 percent a year ago. Yet the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, is clinging to a razor-thin lead in the polls.

Pennsylvania’s rate is 5.7 percent, and Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, is almost sure to lose.

– Jonathan Weisman

Among Democrats, the Finger-Pointing Has Already Begun Barreling toward Election Day, Democrats are sharpening their final attacks — on one another.

With control of the Senate on the verge of slipping away, the behind-the-scenes sniping has begun, and it is likely to spill into public view any day.

Congressional strategists argue that President Obama, who is unpopular in several battleground states, shouldn’t have reminded voters there that it is his policies that are on the ballot. They say that the White House’s handling of Ebola and terrorism has been a drag on Democratic campaigns. The president’s allies say candidates’ appeals to swing voters have come at the expense of energizing the Obama coalition[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/21/?entry=mb-2] of younger voters and minorities.

Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that he expected the president would “get his fair share of credit” if Democrats held the majority.

“I’m also confident,” he said, “that if things don’t turn out the way that we hope and expect, that the president will get at least his share of the blame.”

– Julie Hirschfeld Davis

What We’re Watching Today President Obama meets with Ron Klain, his new Ebola “czar,”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/us/ron-klain-chief-of-staff-to-2-vice-presidents-is-named-ebola-czar.html] at 3 p.m. in the White House.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. heads to Chicago for a campaign rally with Representative Brad Schneider, Senator Richard J. Durbin and Paul Vallas, a candidate for lieutenant governor. He’ll also attend a private event there with Senator Mark Udall of Colorado.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is in Iowa campaigning for Joni Ernst [http://www.randpac.com/2014/10/20/senator-rand-paul-campaign-iowa/] , the Republican Senate hopeful.

Representative Paul D. Ryan joins Thom Tillis, the Republican Senate nominee in North Carolina, for a rally at Wingate University.[http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/10/22/4254241_ryan-tillis-to-rally-nc-republicans.html?rh=1]

The Department of Labor releases its latest reading on inflation at 8:30 a.m.

Seeing Dollar Signs in Political Signatures A fiery ​Gov. Chris Christie seemed to be appealing to his party’s conservative base on Tuesday when he spoke at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. He told the crowd that he was “tired of hearing about the minimum wage,”[http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/21/back-to-blunt-christies-tired-of-hearing-about-minimum-wage/] that he would “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act and that the country had become “saps for the teachers’ union​.”

Equally colorful, however, was the scene outside the speech, where two middle-aged men were waiting for the New Jersey governor, not to talk politics, but to seek his autograph. They were armed with baseballs, soccer balls, portraits and Sharpies.

​One offered to sell this reporter a baseball with “Chris Christie” scrawled between the stitching.
