There are reasons for both hope and continued worry about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Monday.

Just back from a weeklong trip to the affected countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- Dr. Frieden said at a news conference, ''I'm hopeful about stopping the epidemic, but I remain realistic that this is going to be a long, hard fight.''

The World Health Organization on Monday reported 19,340 Ebola cases, including 7,518 deaths in West Africa. Sierra Leone had the most cases, 8,939; Liberia had 7,830 and Guinea 2,571.

On the hopeful side, Dr. Frieden said he had visited a remote part of Guinea, where just a few months ago there was no treatment center and where resistance to visiting health workers had been intense. Now there is a center, established by the French Red Cross, with acceptance by the community, good care and patients surviving, Dr. Frieden said.

On the other hand, he said, he was alarmed to hear that on a recent day in Conakry, Guinea's capital, there were not enough beds for all the patients who needed them. Leaving infected people in the community can lead to exponential spread of the disease, Dr. Frieden said, adding, ''That's what Conakry is at risk of.''

He said he had met with Guinea's president, Alpha Condé, who told him that the country was working hard to open more treatment units in Conakry.

Dr. Frieden said he was also dismayed to hear about a nurse at Donka Hospital in Conakry, Guinea's largest hospital, who contracted Ebola after starting an intravenous line on a patient who turned out to be infected. Even though it was six months into the epidemic, the nurse had failed to put on gloves.

Sierra Leone has also been struggling, Dr. Frieden said, noting that many health workers at Connaught Hospital in the capital, Freetown, have died of Ebola and that the hospital is still ''largely closed.'' At least 10 people a day have been dying in the surrounding community, sometimes at the hospital entrance.

But he said efforts to fight the disease in Freetown were being scaled up, and cases should decrease significantly in the next few weeks.

Of the three countries, Liberia is in the best shape, Dr. Frieden said, adding that cases had decreased quickly there.

''As of today, Liberia has the upper hand against the virus,'' he said. One important step, he said, was the opening of a new cemetery for people who died of Ebola. Earlier insistence on cremation had backfired because the culture frowned on it; families resorted to secret burials, which led to infections in relatives who handled the bodies. Corpses are highly infectious.

But problems remain. For instance, Dr. Frieden said, some people in Monrovia, the capital, think treatment centers outside the city provide better care and take long taxi rides to those clinics, potentially infecting the drivers and making it harder to trace their contacts.

The epidemic will not end, he said, until every contact is traced and every chain of transmission broken.

A veces, hacer clic para publicar un texto genera la sensación de un juego de ruleta rusa. Pero, en el caso de Carlos Alberto Pérez, un bloguero en La Habana, su situación está lejos de ser la de un disidente. Trabaja para el Ministerio de Comunicaciones, lo cual le permite tener acceso a Internet en la oficina y su hogar. Su habitación está cubierta de fotos en blanco y negro del Ché Guevara, el legendario líder guerrillero argentino que ayudó a llevar a Fidel Castro al poder en 1959. Y aún así, leer su blog, La Chiringa de Cuba, es sumergirse en un sinnúmero de ejemplos de todo aquello que marcha mal en esta nación de 11 millones de habitantes, aún gobernada, después de 50 años, bajo el mantra “Socialismo o muerte”.

“Aquí todo funciona mal”, dijo Pérez, quien frecuentemente teme que su próximo texto crítico pudiera ser el último. “Lo único que funciona bien son las fuerzas armadas”.

En diciembre de 2010, Raúl Castro, casi tres años después de que tomó las riendas del poder de su convaleciente hermano, Fidel Castro, hizo un llamado a que los cubanos fueran más críticos del sistema, admitiendo que el Partido Comunista había fallado a sus ciudadanos de varias maneras. La diversa y creciente comunidad de blogueros ha hecho precisamente eso, al convertirse en una poderosa alternativa a la prensa oficial, que durante décadas ha transmitido contenido hiperbólico y aburrido, pero poco periodismo sustancial.

Pocos segmentos de la sociedad cubana parecen estar en posición de sacar más provecho del acercamiento entre Washington y La Habana que este grupo. A medida que el acceso a Internet se amplíe y el gobierno cubano no pueda argumentar, de manera creíble, que Estados Unidos representa una amenaza existencial, los escritores independientes seguirán siendo importantes agentes de cambio.

Durante décadas, los medios estatales de prensa y televisión en Cuba han sido portavoces de los Castro, atacando a Estados Unidos como la maldición “imperialista”, responsable de todos los problemas en la isla. La respuesta de Washington ha sido una inversión de cientos de millones de dólares en medios de propaganda con sede en Miami que se han dedicado a desprestigiar a los líderes cubanos e intentar desestabilizar al gobierno.

Un interesante campo intermedio surgió en 2007, cuando Yoani Sánchez, una escritora evocadora y perceptiva, comenzó a publicar en Internet textos que narraban la cruda realidad del día a día en La Habana. Su blog, Generación Y, se convirtió en una sensación internacional, y en un medio irritante para el Gobierno cubano. El estado la ha atacado constantemente, alegando, injustamente, que es una agente de gobiernos occidentales. Algunos de sus escritos, publicados usando conexiones de Internet en negocios para turistas, han incluido ásperas críticas de los líderes del país.

A medida que hubo más acceso a Internet en centros laborales y universidades, la blogosfera comenzó a proliferar sin reglas de juego claras. Sin embargo, quienes accedían a la red a través de conexiones del Estado, entienden implícitamente que hay dos temas vetados: cuestionar la legitimidad de los líderes del país o la viabilidad del sistema comunista en Cuba. No tomó mucho tiempo para que algunos blogueros se acercaran a los límites.

En 2012, La Joven Cuba, un blog administrado por maestros en la Universidad de Matanzas, tenía un seguimiento respetable, con casi 3,000 visitas diarias. Los escritores publicaron algunos textos que incluían críticas al sistema y permitieron que los lectores dejaran comentarios sin que fueran moderados. Unos escritos hacían reflexiones sobre la caída de regímenes autoritarios durante el siglo XX, mientras otros criticaban a la prensa oficial por ser tan subyugada al Partido Comunista. Meses después de que la universidad fue sede de un encuentro de jóvenes blogueros en abril de 2012, los administradores bloquearon acceso a La Joven Cuba.

La controversia llegó a oídos de los líderes más importantes del país cuando otros blogueros en Cuba comenzaron a defender la causa de los chicos de Matanzas. En marzo de 2013, el Vicepresidente Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, quien parecería estar en línea para ser el próximo líder del país, visitó la universidad y se reunió con los jóvenes blogueros. La primera pregunta que les hizo los dejó atónitos. ¿Qué necesitan para que La Joven Cuba vuelva a estar en línea? La pregunta se formuló para manifestar que contaban con su apoyo. Para hacer énfasis, se tomó una foto con los escritores. El acceso al blog se restableció casi de inmediato.

“Después de eso prácticamente no ha vuelto a ocurrir otro caso así”, dijo Harold Cárdenas Lema, uno de los fundadores de La Joven Cuba. “Los límites de la crítica son amplios porque se comienza a ver esta como legítima y saludable para la sociedad”.

Pérez causó una inusual controversia este año al publicar un post sobre un caso de fraude masivo en las pruebas de ingreso para la universidad. Cuando alertó al Ministerio de Educación que las respuestas a las preguntas para un examen estaban siendo vendidas, los funcionarios no hicieron caso a su denuncia. Luego de que publicó evidencia, desencadenó una investigación que llevó al arresto de varias personas.

Mientras las autoridades, hasta el momento, han tolerado críticas de blogueros como Cárdenas y Pérez, han censurado, sin motivo justo, voces que han pedido reformas democráticas. Sánchez y un grupo de colegas lanzaron en mayo un portal digital de noticias, 14yMedio.com[http://14yMedio.com], pero el gobierno lo bloqueó inmediatamente para los lectores en la isla.

“En Cuba, las imprentas están más custodiadas que los cuarteles militares”, dijo Sánchez durante una entrevista en su apartamento en La Habana. Además de ser censurada, Sánchez es calumniada a diario por blogs y cuentas de redes sociales anónimas que, según las sospechas de diplomáticos en Cuba, son manejadas por agentes de seguridad cubanos.

Hace unos días, el Gobierno cubano anunció que estaba dispuesto a tomar pasos para ampliar el acceso a Internet, mediante un editorial publicado en Granma, el principal diario estatal. Por supuesto, el editorial expuso que las sanciones que impone Estados Unidos a la isla, y su política severa, son las causas de su precaria infraestructura de Internet. El dramático giro de política que anunció el Presidente Obama la semana pasada causará que esas excusas se vuelvan obsoletas pronto. Los pasos que Washington está tomando para que empresas de tecnología estadounidenses puedan hacer negocios en Cuba podrían expandir dramáticamente el acceso y la velocidad del Internet en el futuro cercano. Pérez, por su parte, no es optimista.

“Yo no creo que el gobierno está preparado para un Internet masivo”, dijo. “Si 200 blogueros les damos dolores de cabeza todos los días, no sé qué pasaría el día que un zapatero tuviera WhatsApp”.

Sería extraordinario si los líderes cubanos fueran lo suficientemente valientes para invalidar esa predicción, expandiendo el acceso a Internet y dejando de censurar voces que están aportando críticas constructivas necesarias. De lo contrario, los blogueros en Cuba tendrán más herramientas que nunca para confrontarlos.

At times, hitting the publish button feels like playing Russian roulette. Carlos Alberto Pérez, a blogger in Havana, is far from being a dissident. He works for the Ministry of Communication and has government-provided access to the Internet at work and at home. Mr. Pérez’s bedroom walls are covered with black-and-white photos of Che Guevara, the legendary Argentine guerrilla leader who helped catapult Fidel Castro to power in 1959. And yet, to read his blog, La Chiringa de Cuba[http://www.chiringadecuba.com/], is to get a gritty view of how much has gone awry in this nation of 11 million, still governed, after five decades, under the mantra “Socialism or death.”

“Here, everything works poorly,” said Mr. Pérez, who often wonders whether his next critical post could be his last. “The only thing that works well are the armed forces.”

In December 2010, nearly three years after he took power from his ailing brother Fidel, Raúl Castro called on Cubans to be critical of the system[http://www.cuba.cu/gobierno/rauldiscursos/2010/ing/r181210i.html], acknowledging that the Communist Party had failed its citizens in myriad ways. Cuba’s diverse and growing community of bloggers and independent journalists have done just that, becoming a powerful alternative to the official press, which for decades has delivered hyperbolic and dull content, but little substantive journalism.

Few segments of Cuban society will stand to benefit more from improved relations between Washington and Havana than this group. As Internet access on the island expands and the Cuban government can no longer credibly argue that the United States represents an existential threat, the independent writers could well become an ever more important agent of change.

For decades, Cuba’s state-run print and broadcast media outlets have been mouthpieces for the Castros in assailing the United States as the “imperialist” scourge responsible for all problems on the island. Washington responded by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Miami-based radio and television propaganda outlets that have sought to undermine Cuba’s leaders and destabilize their government.

An interesting middle ground emerged in 2007, when Yoani Sánchez[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/interview-with-cuban-blogger-yoani-snchez/], a piercing, evocative writer, began publishing blog posts online, describing the grim realities of everyday life in Havana. Her blog, Generación Y[http://www.14ymedio.com/blogs/generacion_y/], became an international sensation, and an irritant for the Cuban government, which has relentlessly and unfairly attacked Ms. Sánchez as an agent of the West. Some of her dispatches, which were uploaded from Internet cafes for tourists, have been unflinching in their criticism of her country’s leaders.

As Internet access became more common in state-run workplaces like universities, blogging began to flourish, with no clear ground rules. For those who had Internet access, two subjects were widely understood to be off limits: questioning the legitimacy of the top leaders or the viability of a Cuba’s Communist system. It didn’t take long for some bloggers to start pushing boundaries.

By 2012, La Joven Cuba[http://jovencuba.com/], or The Young Cuba, a blog run by young professors at the University of Matanzas, had developed a healthy audience, getting nearly 3,000 visitors a day. Writers took veiled shots at the state and allowed uncensored reader comments. They dissected the downfall of authoritarian socialist systems in the 20th century and criticized the official press for being subservient to the Communist Party. A few months after the school hosted a blogger conference in April 2012, administrators blocked access to La Joven Cuba.

As other bloggers began taking on the cause of the Matanzas bloggers, the controversy reached the top echelons of the Cuban government. In March 2013, the first vice president, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, who has been widely considered Raúl Castro’s successor, visited the university to meet with the blog’s administrators. His opening question startled them: What do you need to get La Joven Cuba back online? The question signaled that they had his blessing, a point he underscored by posing for a photo with the bloggers. Access to the blog was promptly restored.

“After that, there haven’t been many similar cases, and the tolerance for criticism has widened because it starts being seen as legitimate and healthy for society,” said Harold Cárdenas Lema, one of the blog’s founders.

Mr. Pérez caused an unusual stir this year by publishing a post[http://www.chiringadecuba.com/2014/05/15/hubo-fraude-en-las-&] about widespread cheating on university exams. When he alerted the Education Ministry that answer sheets for a coming exam were being sold, officials dismissed his allegation, assuring him they had proper safeguards. After he published proof, officials arrested several people.

While authorities have tolerated criticism from bloggers like Mr. Cárdenas Lema and Mr. Pérez, they have unreasonably censored other voices who have pressed for meaningful democratic reforms. Ms. Sánchez and a group of journalists started a digital news site, 14YMedio.com[http://www.14ymedio.com/], in May, but the government promptly blocked it for users on the island.

“In Cuba, printing presses are more guarded than military bases,” Ms. Sánchez said in an interview in her Havana apartment. Besides being censored, she is vilified daily by anonymous blogs and social media accounts, which Western diplomats suspect are run by Cuba’s security agency.

The Cuban government earlier this month pledged to take steps to broaden Internet access in an editorial published in Granma[http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2014/12/12/editorial-de-granma-cuba-esta-decidida-a-conectarse-con-el-mundo/], the main state-run newspaper. Not surprisingly, the editorial blamed the country’s backward infrastructure, and limited access, on American sanctions and Washington’s punitive policy toward Havana. President Obama’s dramatic policy shift last week will soon render those excuses obsolete. Steps being taken by Washington to make it easier for American technology companies to do business in Cuba could greatly increase Internet speed and access in the near future. Mr. Pérez, however, is skeptical.

“I don’t think the government is ready for widespread Internet,” he said. “If 200 bloggers give them headaches every day, what’s going to happen when a shoemaker has WhatsApp?”

If would be wonderful if Cuban leaders were courageous enough to prove him wrong by expanding Internet access and ceasing to censor voices that provide much-needed constructive criticism. If they aren’t, Cuba’s bloggers will be ever more equipped to take them on.

C.D.C. Ebola Error in Lab May Have Exposed Technician to Virus

A laboratory mistake at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] in Atlanta may have exposed a technician to the deadly Ebola virus, federal officials said on Wednesday. The technician will be monitored for signs of infection for 21 days, the incubation period of the disease.

Other employees who entered the lab — fewer than a dozen — where the mistake occurred are being examined for possible exposure. So far, it appears that none of them were exposed, said Thomas Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman.

The samples were properly contained and never left the disease centers, so there is no risk to the public, officials said.

The error occurred on Monday, when a high-security lab at the C.D.C., working with Ebola virus from the epidemic in West Africa, sent samples that should have been killed to another C.D.C. laboratory, down the hall.

But the first lab sent the wrong samples — ones that may have contained the live virus. The second lab was not equipped to handle live Ebola. The technician who worked with the samples wore gloves and a gown, but no face shield, and may have been exposed.

The mixup of the samples was discovered on Tuesday, Dr. Stuart Nichol, chief of the C.D.C.'s Viral Special Pathogens Branch, said in an interview. He ascribed it to human error.

The accident is especially troubling because dangerous samples of anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]were similarly mishandled at the C.D.C.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/health/up-to-75-cdc-scientists-may-have-been-exposed-to-anthrax.html] just months ago, eroding confidence in an agency that has long been one of the most highly respected scientific research centers in the world.

The C.D.C. promised last summer to improve its safety procedures and chose a panel of outside experts to advise it on how to do so.

“I’m working on it until the issue is resolved,” the agency’s director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said in an interview in July.

Under harsh questioning from members of Congress[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/us/cdc-director-admits-to-pattern-of-unsafe-practices.html] that month, Dr. Frieden admitted that the errors at C.D.C. labs were not isolated mishaps, but rather part of a broad pattern of unsafe practices. He called one of the episodes a “tipping point” that had forced agency officials to realize they needed to take action.

Reacting to the latest accident, safety experts expressed outrage. Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and an expert on biological weapons, said: “They did not learn. They do not learn. They seem incapable of learning.”

He said the errors were inexcusable. Labs that produce samples of killed virus should test to make sure they are dead, he said, and labs receiving those samples should test them before working with them.

“C.D.C. labs that receive putatively inactivated samples still are working with them with no safety and security precautions beyond those at a dentist’s office,” Dr. Ebright said.

Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the University of Southern California and an expert on human error, said: “I am speechless. This is yet another indication that this organization needs to do a serious soul searching to improve its safety culture.”

The previous incidents occurred last spring and summer. In June, C.D.C. scientists sent anthrax samples, supposedly killed, to laboratories that were not equipped to handle dangerous pathogens. But the bacteria turned out to be live, because a deactivating technique too weak to wipe out anthrax spores had been used. Dozens of employees were offered antibiotics[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and anthrax vaccine; none became infected.

The head of the laboratory that shipped the bacteria resigned a few weeks after the mistakes came to light. Although C.D.C. officials gave no reason for his resignation and said it was voluntary, they had previously indicated that they feared workers in that laboratory had grown careless because of lax supervision.

In another blunder, a C.D.C. lab accidentally contaminated[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/science/cdc-closes-anthrax-and-flu-labs-after-accidents.html] a relatively benign flu sample with a dangerous H5N1 bird flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] strain that can be fatal in humans, and then shipped it to a laboratory at the Department of Agriculture. Scientists at the receiving lab detected the error, and no one was harmed.

Although the incident occurred in May, senior C.D.C. officials were not told about it until July 7, and Dr. Frieden did not hear about it until two days after that. He said in an interview in July[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/us/after-lapses-cdc-admits-a-lax-culture-at-labs.html] that he was “stunned and appalled” by the incident.

The mistakes led the C.D.C. to appoint a panel of outside safety experts in July [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/health/cdc-says-tuberculosis-lab-shut-amid-exposure-scare-can-continue-its-work.html] to advise Dr. Frieden on how to correct sloppy procedures at government laboratories. The C.D.C. temporarily closed its flu and bioterrorism laboratories, and halted shipments of all infectious agents from its high-security labs until those labs could pass muster with a newly formed safety panel within the agency.

In August, the special pathogens branch — where the Ebola accident occurred on Monday — received permission to start sending out infectious agents again.

Dr. Nichol said that the high-security lab where the mistake occurred had prepared two sets of fluid samples from guinea pigs infected with Ebola. The fluid was handled as if it contained live virus, though it is not certain that the virus was present.

One set of samples was to remain in the high-security lab so that researchers could try to isolate the virus from it. The other was to be treated with a solution that would kill the virus and then be sent to a lower-level laboratory where a technician would try to extract genetic material from it.

Somehow, the samples were switched: The ones with killed virus stayed in the high-security lab, and the ones that may have contained live virus were sent to the lower-level lab and processed there.

The accident is being investigated, said Barbara Reynolds, a C.D.C. spokeswoman.

“We’ll learn from this mistake as we’ve learned from the others,” she said.

Pope Francis, in Christmas Address, Focuses on Children’s Plight

Pope Francis[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/francis_i/index.html?inline=nyt-per] on Thursday used a traditional Christmas address to emphasize the plight of children in areas of conflict, pointing out their “impotent silence” that “cries out under the spade of many Herods,” a reference to the ancient king who slaughtered all the male newborns of Bethlehem, according to the New Testament.

Vast numbers of children today are victims of violence, objects of trade and trafficking, or forced to become soldiers, and they need to be saved, he said.

The pope spoke of “children displaced due to war and persecution, abused and taken advantage of before our very eyes and our complicit silence.” He singled out “infants massacred in bomb attacks,” including in the Middle East and in Pakistan, where 132 children were killed in a Taliban attack[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/world/asia/taliban-attack-pakistani-school.html] on a school this month.

“So many abused children,” Francis said, in one of several off-the-cuff asides during the address, known as the “Urbi et Orbi” message — Latin for “to the city and the world” — that popes traditionally deliver to the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics on special occasions like Christmas.

In calling for global peace and for an end to violence and conflict in the Middle East, Ukraine and parts of Africa, Francis went off script to denounce “the globalization of indifference” that permits suffering and injustice to persist.

“So many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference” are affected by hardness of the heart, he said, calling for reflection and change. And he chided the Vatican[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/roman_catholic_church/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s bureaucratic machine in another address this week for losing touch with its spiritual side in the pursuit of power.

As Christians exchanged gifts and shared family meals, the pope’s thoughts were with the world’s dispossessed; refugees and exiles; those suffering “brutal” ethnic or religious persecution; and those held as hostages or killed because of their religious beliefs.

“Truly there are so many tears this Christmas,” Francis said from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica before thousands of faithful in the square below. The address was also broadcast live on the Internet.

To underscore his closeness to those suffering religious persecution, a theme of his nearly two years[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/cardinals-elect-new-pope.html?pagewanted=all] as pope, on Christmas Eve, Francis spoke with displaced Christians who are in a tent camp in northern Iraq and told them that they were like Jesus. Many in the camps have been forced to leave their homes by militants of the Islamic State.

“You are like Jesus on the night of his birth when he had been forced to flee,” the pope told them in a telephone call broadcast live by an Italian Catholic television station. “You are like Jesus in this situation, and that means we are praying even harder for you.”

The pope also denounced abortion, and his thoughts turned to “infants killed in the womb, deprived of that generous love of their parents and then buried in the egoism of a culture that does not love life.”

In his message on Thursday, the pope said he hoped that the world would respond to the plight of the needy by increasing humanitarian aid, and he asked “that the necessary assistance and treatment be provided” for the victims of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Closing the address, he called on Jesus’ strength to turn “arms into plowshares, destruction into creativity, hatred into love and tenderness.”

In Britain, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Church of England, pulled out of the traditional Christmas Day ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral because of what his office described as a “severe cold.”

A draft of the sermon he had planned to deliver, and which was released on his website[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5469/archbishop-of-canterburys-christmas-sermon], reflected on the temporary truce on Christmas Day in 1914, early in the First World War, between British and German soldiers.

“The problem is that the way it is told now it seems to end with a ‘happy ever after,'” the draft said.

It added: “The following day the war continued with the same severity. Nothing had changed; it was a one-day wonder. That is not the world in which we live — truces are rare.”

Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London.

Correction: December 25, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the day of the pope’s address. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it was on Thursday, not on Sunday.

Maybe I’m just projecting, but Christmas seemed unusually subdued this year. The malls seemed less crowded than usual, the people glummer. There was even less Muzak in the air. And, in a way, that’s not surprising: All year Americans have been bombarded with dire news reports portraying a world out of control and a clueless government with no idea what to do.

Yet if you look back at what actually happened over the past year, you see something completely different. Amid all the derision, a number of major government policies worked just fine — and the biggest successes involved the most derided policies. You’ll never hear this on Fox News, but 2014 was a year in which the federal government, in particular, showed that it can do some important things very well if it wants to.

Start with Ebola, a subject that has vanished from the headlines so fast it’s hard to remember how pervasive the panic was just a few weeks ago. Judging from news media coverage, especially but not only on cable TV, America was on the verge of turning into a real-life version of “The Walking Dead.” And many politicians dismissed the efforts of public health officials to deal with the disease using conventional methods. Instead, they insisted, we needed to ban all travel to and from West Africa, imprison anyone who arrived from the wrong place, and close the border with Mexico[http://www.nationaljournal.com.proxy.bc.edu/congress/these-politicians-want-to-close-the-u-s-mexico-border-because-of-ebola-20141009]. No, I have no idea why anyone thought that last item made sense.

As it turned out, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite some early missteps, knew what they were doing, which shouldn’t be surprising: The Centers have a lot of experience in, well, controlling disease, epidemics in particular. And while the Ebola virus continues to kill many people in parts of Africa, there was no outbreak here.

Consider next the state of the economy. There’s no question that recovery from the 2008 crisis has been painfully slow and should have been much faster. In particular, the economy has been held back by unprecedented cuts[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/business/archive/2013/12/our-historic-austerity-in-1-crazy-chart/282552/] in public spending and employment.

But the story you hear all the time portrays economic policy as an unmitigated disaster, with President Obama’s alleged hostility to business holding back investment and job creation. So it comes as something of a shock when you look at the actual record[http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/comparing-postmodern-recoveries/] and discover that growth and job creation have been substantially faster during the Obama recovery than they were during the Bush recovery last decade (even ignoring the crisis at the end), and that while housing is still depressed, business investment has been quite strong[http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/what-5-percent-means/].

What’s more, recent data suggest that the economy is gathering strength — 5 percent growth in the last quarter[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/us-q3-gdp-revised-up-to-5-percent.html]! Oh, and not that it matters very much, but there are some people who like to claim that economic success should be judged by the performance of the stock market. And stock prices, which hit a low point in March 2009, accompanied by declarations from prominent Republican economists[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/23/now-that-the-dow-has-hit-18000-let-us-remember-the-worst-op-ed-in-history/] that Mr. Obama was killing the market economy, have tripled since then[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500]. Maybe economic management hasn’t been that bad, after all.

Finally, there’s the hidden-in-plain-sight triumph of Obamacare, which is just finishing up its first year of full implementation. It’s a tribute to the effectiveness of the propaganda campaign against health reform — which has played up every glitch, without ever mentioning that the problem has been solved, and invented failures that never happened — that I fairly often encounter people, some of them liberals, who ask me whether the administration will ever be able to get the program to work. Apparently nobody told them that it is working, and very well.

In fact, Year 1 surpassed expectations on every front. Remember claims that more people would lose insurance than gained it? Well, the number of Americans without insurance fell by around 10 million[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/18/2014-has-seen-largest-coverage-gains-four-decades-putting-uninsured-rate-or-near-his]; members of the elite who have never been uninsured have no idea just how much positive difference that makes to people’s lives. Remember claims that reform would break the budget? In reality, premiums were far less than predicted[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/14/lower-premiums-yes-really-drive-down-obamacares-expected-costs-cbo-says/], overall health spending is moderating, and specific cost-control measures[http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-mlr-health-spending-slow] are doing very well. And all indications suggest that year two will be marked by further success.

And there’s more. For example, at the end of 2014, the Obama administration’s foreign policy, which tries to contain threats like Vladimir Putin’s Russia or the Islamic State rather than rushing into military confrontation, is looking pretty good.

The common theme here is that, over the past year, a U.S. government subjected to constant bad-mouthing, constantly accused of being ineffectual or worse, has, in fact, managed to accomplish a lot. On multiple fronts, government wasn’t the problem; it was the solution. Nobody knows it, but 2014 was the year of “Yes, we can.”

U.N. Set to Cut Force in Darfur as Fighting Rises

UNITED NATIONS — Under intense pressure from the government of Sudan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sudan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is planning to shrink its floundering peacekeeping force in Darfur[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sudan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], even though renewed fighting there has chased more people from their homes this year than during any other in the past decade.

The withdrawal plans come right after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_criminal_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org], Fatou Bensouda, announced that she had decided to suspend the genocide case[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/world/africa/sudan-prosecutor-halts-darfur-inquiry.html] against Sudan’s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, because world powers have done nothing to secure his arrest.

The twin retrenchments are emblematic of the limits of international attention at a time when Darfur has been overshadowed by newer crises and conflicts around the world, from the civil wars in Syria and South Sudan to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic.

Once the world’s largest peacekeeping operation, with 20,000 blue-helmeted soldiers on the ground, the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] force in Sudan’s Darfur region has already been trimmed by 4,000 troops, and plans are underway to cut more in the coming months despite the surge in violence.

Even at full strength, the mission has been criticized for failing to protect civilians in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Since 2003, when an armed rebellion in Darfur was met with a brutal government crackdown, the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, if not hundreds of thousands, and displaced more than two million people.

Now, as rebel groups splinter and the notorious pro-government janjaweed militias re-emerge[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/africa/sudan-darfur-janjaweed-militia-khartoum.html], renewed fighting has chased 457,000 people from their homes this year alone, according to the United Nations.

But United Nations officials say that their forces are routinely attacked by Sudanese forces and their proxies; that it is virtually impossible for their peacekeepers to remain in the country without Sudan’s blessing; and that some of their units have performed poorly and could be eliminated.

“The heart of matter for us remains the protection of civilians affected by the conflict and ensuring that any drawdown does not have a negative impact on this critical task,” said the United Nations’ undersecretary general for peacekeeping, Hervé Ladsous. “My sense is that while we have by no means been perfect in this regard, without us many, many more would have been killed, displaced, put in harm’s way.”

One plan being considered is to limit peacekeeping activities to guarding the camps that shelter displaced civilians. A final decision will be made by the Security Council and the African Union, which jointly run the mission, sometime next year.

United Nations officials say Sudanese obstructionism is mostly to blame for the setbacks, while critics accuse the United Nations of ineptitude and cover-ups. The mission remains one of the world’s most expensive, with an annual budget of $1.4 billion.

“Darfur was always a gamble,” said a United Nations diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. “The political coalition that was putting pressure on Sudan evaporated, and once that happened, and the Sudanese continued to demonstrate extreme ruthlessness, we found ourselves unable to do our job.”

The growing sense of international resignation toward Darfur stands in jarring contrast to the passionate activism that it stirred only recently, when “Save Darfur”[http://savedarfur.org/] was a household term, with thousands of people around the world chanting “Not on my watch!” and Hollywood celebrities like George Clooney using their fame and fortune to draw attention to Darfur’s misery.

Activists say they are stunned that Darfur has become a largely forgotten crisis given that some of their old allies have risen to positions of power.

Eight years ago, in a sunlit hut on the border of Chad and Darfur, a freshman American senator stood surrounded by refugees, thoughtfully absorbing their stories of massacres.

“I’m going to be working hard when I get back to the United States,” he reassured the survivors. “The people of Darfur who are here in Chad are not going to be forgotten.”

That freshman senator was Barack Obama, and activists complain that he has done little with his presidency to help Darfur. They say that his ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, an outspoken advocate for the need to prevent mass atrocities, has likewise let Darfur down.

“I’m afraid the time has come for her to put up or shut up,” said Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College and one of the leading American voices on Darfur. If Mr. Obama does not toughen his policies toward Sudan, Mr. Reeves argued that Ms. Power should resign in protest.

An American official countered that Ms. Power has used her position on the Security Council to improve the weak peacekeeping mission, pushing for greater accountability and a clearer focus on the protection of civilians — all despite Russian resistance on the Council; the Kremlin staunchly backs the Bashir government. Ms. Power’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Another senior American official said that despite “many competing conflicts,” the Obama administration continued to work behind the scenes on diplomatic efforts for Darfur, adding that the American government had provided $1 billion in humanitarian assistance over the past six years to the region.

Critics, including inside the United Nations, point out that the peacekeeping mission has capitulated too often to government pressure. In the most recent example, after Sudanese soldiers were accused of raping more than 200 women and girls in a remote village in North Darfur in October, United Nations peacekeepers botched the investigation, human rights groups say.

A recent internal United Nations review found that in a sample of 16 instances of violence against civilians and peacekeepers, the mission had failed to properly investigate about a third of them. Mostly, the mission omitted details of “possible wrongdoing by government or pro-government forces,” the review said.

“Keeping silent or underreporting on incidents involving human rights violations and threats or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers cannot be condoned under any circumstances,” said a statement from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, describing him as “deeply troubled” by the findings.

In a measure of how divided the Council remains, one American diplomat said Russia sought to block a briefing by the chief of the review committee.

Mr. Bashir, Sudan’s president, who is running for re-election in 2015, has publicly called for all blue helmets to leave Sudan. In November, he put that demand in writing, urging the United Nations to “prepare and implement an exit strategy.”

Some analysts said that Mr. Bashir may just be posturing and that his government benefits enormously from the money and veneer of peace that the mission generates. Still, a spokesman for the secretary general said in a statement on Thursday that Sudanese authorities had asked two top United Nations officials to leave the country.

It seems unlikely that the Security Council will take new punitive measures against Sudan, with relations between Russia and the West at their lowest point since the Cold War. A case in point: The International Criminal Court[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_criminal_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org] wrote to the Council eight times in recent years, urging the world body to help secure Mr. Bashir’s arrest. The Council did not even write back. A former Council diplomat said that Russia and China said no response was necessary.

Years ago, when its relations with the West were less antagonistic, Russia did go along with an effort to refer Mr. Bashir to the international court. But things are different now, said Al Tayeb Zain El Abdin, a political scientist at the University of Khartoum. The Sudanese government used to ask Russia to use its veto on the council, he said, “especially when referring Darfur to the I.C.C., but Russia refused.” Now, he said, “Russia is in a new mood.”

This month, Ms. Bensouda, the court’s chief prosecutor, said without concrete help from the world’s most powerful body, there was nothing more she could do to advance the case.

“If there was full political will of all the members on the Security Council, then something would have happened,” she said in an interview in New York.

She took pains to say that she had no intention of dropping the charges against Mr. Bashir. A warrant for his arrest remains in effect, she warned, and countries that belong to the court have a legal obligation to arrest the Sudanese president when he visits their territory.

But Mr. Bashir has traveled freely to countries like Kenya, Djibouti and Chad, all members of the treaty that created the court. At no point did the Council even scold those countries, let alone sanction them.

The United States has refused to join the court, undercutting its ability to agitate on the Bashir case. But activists argue there is a long list of other things the Obama administration could do to put pressure on Sudan, including tightening economic sanctions, pushing for more humanitarian access in areas under siege, pressing allies to arrest Mr. Bashir and trying to label Sudanese gold — a crucial revenue source for the government — as a conflict mineral.

John Prendergast, a longtime Darfur activist, said key administration officials, including Ms. Power, who is a close friend, remained concerned about Darfur, though “right now the foreign policy is overwhelmed by a tidal wave of crises.”

“Popular mobilization can’t be sustained for that long for something so far away,” he said. “Once that happens, the political will weakens.”

In Darfur, fear is growing. Even though few are satisfied with the United Nations peacekeepers, they are terrified about what will happen if they leave.

“It would get worse,” said El Tahir Ismail, an elder in a displaced persons camp in North Darfur. “We are in a big prison; we can’t leave the camps, there is no police, no security — there is no law.

Choosing the 2014 Pictures of the Year

The 2014 Year in Pictures[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/28/sunday-review/2014-year-in-pictures.html] provides an opportunity to revisit and reflect on the dizzying events of the last 12 months — which included the Ebola crisis[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/portraits-of-those-braving-ebola/] in West Africa, upheaval in Ukraine[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/photographing-both-sides-in-ukraine/], a new mayor in New York, a police shooting in Ferguson, Mo[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/photographing-on-fergusons-streets/]., and conflict in Gaza, Syria and Iraq. Picking just 100 photos for 2014 was a daunting challenge.

Meaghan Looram, a deputy editor of photography at The Times, and Jeffrey Scales, the picture editor of the Sunday Review, together looked at perhaps 100,000 images from Times staff photographers and freelancers as well as the wire services The Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, Getty, European Pressphoto Agency and other organizations large and small. They scoured the Times digital archive, which receives over two million images a year, and studied the front pages of The Times and the Pictures of the Day slide shows[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/category/pictures-of-the-day/] on Lens.

Making sense of so many images and picking the few exceptional ones that capture the year’s events was not easy.

“Images that are published in the Year in Pictures are singular,” Ms. Looram, who has coedited the last eight Year in Pictures, wrote this week. “They must be powerful enough to stand alone, and in that sense, they must be iconic. This collection of images will not appear in the context of a reported story or as part of a photo essay on a single topic, so each frame must be instantly communicative, and cannot depend on lengthy textual explanation or transitional images to provide context.”

“Of course, we look for images that are aesthetically and technically superior and emotionally evocative,” she added. “And we look for images that tell stories specifically relevant to this year’s events. The collection does, to some extent, serve as a roundup of the year’s news, but that said, no image is included merely as a documentation of a newsworthy event — the primary requirement for inclusion is exceptional and enduring photographic power. But within that, you will see quite a lot of variety.”

For Mr. Scales, who has coedited the Year in Pictures for the last six years, the purpose is to show viewers “a pure look at the great photojournalism that was created over the year.”

“I personally like to have some sense of the photographer’s eye — his or her personal viewpoint, or attitude in the image — balanced with a photojournalist’s objectivity,” he wrote this week. “This is not an easy balance to achieve.”

There were more photos taken by Times photographers and freelancers this year than in recent years, he added.

The 2014 Year in Pictures interactive was produced by Whitney Dangerfield, Snigdha Koirala and Jacqueline Myint. Aviva Michaelov designed the paper section and the web display. Roberta Zeff copy-edited.

In an accompanying essay, Dana Jennings writes that the photographs of 2014 pose the question, “How close are you willing to get?”

The photographers who took these 100 images have answered that question: As close as is necessary. And then closer still.

There were hundreds of billions of photographs taken this year — few of them by professionals. But these 100 images were.

The photographers include Anja Niedringhaus[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/parting-glance-anja-niedringhaus/] (Slide 25 in the interactive), who lost her life in an attack in Afghanistan this year.

“The purpose of Year in Pictures is to create a lasting celebration of the work of so many incredibly talented, deeply committed and impressively hard-working photographers,” Ms. Looram wrote. “These men and women spend their lives, and often risk their lives, in the pursuit of showing us the world around us in all of its stunning diversity, and the collection is a testament to that.”

Shifting Dynamics for Cuba’s Dissidents

The words were scrawled in graffiti on a street near the house of the Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payá a few years before his suspicious death in 2012. “In a plaza under siege, dissidence is treasonous.”

Over the decades, Cuba’s authoritarian government has relied on that convenient argument to exert pervasive control over the lives of its citizens and keep opposition movements from gaining enough traction to threaten the state. The message was unmistakable: As long as the United States was intent on toppling the island’s leaders and meddling in the country’s affairs, Cubans, as a matter of national sovereignty, had to close ranks. The era that began this month when President Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba announced an end to more than 50 years of enmity between their governments is a watershed moment for Cuba’s diverse and courageous opposition movement.

Under Community Party rule, Cubans endure the austerity of living under a stagnant, centrally planned economy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/world/cubas-zeal-for-tight-control-clashes-with-need-for-growth.html]. Their access to the Internet[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/opinion/cubas-promising-new-online-voices.html] is severely limited and censored. The island’s official press is wholly subservient to the state. Outside the rigid mechanisms of the party, Cubans have few substantive vehicles to challenge their leaders.

In 1998, at the end of a decade of hunger and deprivation triggered by the collapse of Havana’s longtime patron, the Soviet Union, Mr. Payá undertook an audacious mission. Relying on a Cuban law that ostensibly allowed groups of 10,000 or more eligible voters to propose new laws, Mr. Payá gathered, by some estimates, more than 25,000 signatures from Cubans who endorsed sweeping democratic reforms, including free elections, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and a less-regulated economy.

In 2002, Cuba’s National Assembly responded to Mr. Paya’s initiative, known as the Varela Project[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/14/international/americas/14CUBA.html], by amending the Constitution to make the island’s socialist, one-party system “irrevocable.”[http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/CNews/y02/jun02/28e2.htm] The following year, Cuban authorities jailed scores of dissidents and independent journalists during a period of intense repression known as the Black Spring. The crackdown, which took aim at many leaders of Mr. Payá's movement, largely escaped global attention.

In 2010, the Cuban government agreed to release many political prisoners in a deal brokered by the Catholic Church, on the condition that they move to Spain. Mr. Payá died in a car crash in 2012 in Cuba that many human rights activists suspect was staged by the authorities.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/oswaldo-payas-death-in-cuba-two-years-ago-still-awaits-a-proper-investigation/2014/07/21/b0ac9612-0bb8-11e4-8c9a-923ecc0c7d23_story.html]

A few of the released prisoners, including José Daniel Ferrer, a fiery lieutenant in Mr. Payá's movement, refused to leave the island. Mr. Ferrer now leads the Patriotic Union for Cuba[http://www.unpacu.org/], the most visible and outspoken opposition group on the island. In a recent interview in Havana, Mr. Ferrer said his eight years in prison gave him time to reflect on why Cuba’s democratic movements had failed in the past and how they might one day prevail. Historically, he said, Cuban activists have often been seen by their compatriots as hapless victims of an oppressive state. “These people inspire pity, not a desire to follow them,” said Mr. Ferrer, who is based in Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second-largest city. “We’re trying to avoid reaching people with speeches of losers.”

Mr. Ferrer says his goal is not the type of sudden, dramatic overthrow of the Castro government that many Cuban exiles have historically favored. Rather, he said, Cuba’s opposition movement must become sufficiently empowered to get a seat at the table.

“We need to become large enough to force the regime to negotiate,” Mr. Ferrer said, acknowledging that it will take time to get enough Cubans to believe that siding with the opposition is worth the risks. “No one wants to bet on the horse that’s losing the race.”

Despite decades of economic deprivation and government oppression, the vast majority of Cubans have been unwilling to join, or openly support, opposition movements. It is easy to understand why. Cuba’s shrewd intelligence service has managed to penetrate those movements over the years and make it hard for opposition leaders to join forces. And it has effectively cast dissidents as greedy agents of Western plots in a deeply nationalistic nation that for many years was, in fact, the target of covert American plots.

While the tactics used against dissidents are not nearly as brutal as they were a decade ago, they remain insidious. Prominent opposition leaders are attacked by the official media. Activists are often detained temporarily to keep them from attending meetings and to remind them — and their neighbors — that they are being watched. State surveillance is widely assumed to be so pervasive that diplomats blast music whenever they want to have a conversation about sensitive issues. Wary Cubans pop out the batteries of their cellphones if they want to speak privately, fearing that the state’s extensive army of domestic spies can listen in on virtually anyone at any time.

On a very basic level, said Elizardo Sánchez, who is known as the dean of Cuba’s human rights activists, political activism requires a level of zeal that many Cubans lack. “Life is so hard that people don’t have time to think in political terms,” he said. “Everything from finding food, transportation and medicine takes so much time.”

After the announcement of the rapprochement between Washington and Havana this month, a handful of prominent activists and civil society leaders issued a joint statement outlining four sensible requests.[http://www.14ymedio.com/nacional/Cuatro-puntos-consenso-actualizadosV2_CYMFIL20141223_0002.pdf] They call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. Under the deal Mr. Castro and Mr. Obama announced, the Cuban government pledged to free 53 of them. The activists also demand that Havana abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the Cuban government has ratified. The statement — signed by Mr. Ferrer and the popular dissident blogger Yoani Sánchez[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/opinion/yoani-sanchez-a-new-era-for-cuba-and-the-united-states.html], among others — asks that the Cuban government formally recognize civil society leaders who are at odds with the state. Finally, they argue that the state must be open to constitutional reforms that will eventually lead to free, democratic elections.

Whether Cuba’s opposition movement will be empowered by the thaw in relations with the United States or suffer intensified repression will depend largely on the support activists receive from the international community. As Cuba becomes more accessible to Americans, including Cubans who are dual citizens, the government in Havana, feeling vulnerable in the face of a flood of investment, increased travel and a less-regulated flow of information, may well seek to redouble its efforts to stifle dissent.

For decades, Latin American governments have coddled, or appeased, the Castro regime because confronting it would be interpreted as an endorsement of Washington’s harshly punitive policy toward the island. By changing that policy, Mr. Obama has removed that concern, which should allow leaders from democratic nations to support the principles Cuban activists have put forward. The leaders of Latin America’s largest economies, in particular, can be strong champions of Cuba’s opposition leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Panama in April.[http://www.summit-americas.org/default_en.htm]

Despite a traditional reluctance to meddle in other countries’ internal affairs, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil should speak up unequivocally for democratic values that are embraced by most nations in the Americas. As a former political prisoner,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/world/americas/torture-report-on-brazilian-dictatorship-is-released.html] a leftist and the leader of one of Cuba’s main trading allies, Ms. Rousseff would arguably carry the most weight.

If Cuban dissidents and civil society leaders are allowed to participate in the summit meeting, as Washington has advocated, Ms. Rousseff may well be speaking to the future leaders of a democratic Cuba.

Las palabras fueron escritas en grafiti en la calle donde vivía el disidente cubano Oswaldo Payá, unos pocos años antes de su misteriosa muerte en 2012. “En una plaza sitiada, la disidencia es traición”.

A lo largo de décadas, el autoritario Gobierno cubano ha usado ese conveniente argumento para ejercer un fuerte control sobre la vida de sus ciudadanos e impedir que los movimientos de oposición lleguen a representar una amenaza para el Estado. El mensaje era perfectamente claro: mientras Estados Unidos insistiera en derrocar a los líderes de la isla y entrometerse en los asuntos internos del país, los cubanos, por cuestión de soberanía nacional, tendrían que permanecer unidos. La era que comenzó este mes cuando el Presidente Obama y el Presidente de Cuba, Raúl Castro, anunciaron el fin de más de medio siglo de enemistad entre sus gobiernos, es un momento clave para quienes forman parte del diverso y valiente movimiento de oposición en Cuba.

Bajo el mando del Partido Comunista, los cubanos han sido sometidos a la austeridad, producto de una anímica economía centralmente planificada. Su acceso al Internet es severamente limitado y censurado. La prensa oficial de la isla está completamente subyugada a los intereses del Estado. Fuera de los rígidos mecanismos del Partido Comunista, los cubanos tienen pocas vías para enfrentar a sus líderes.

En 1998, durante el fin de una década de hambre y privación, propiciada por el colapso de la Unión Soviética, la cual sirvió como patrón de Cuba por muchos años, Payá dio inicio a una misión corajuda. Bajo una ley cubana que en teoría permitía que grupos de 10,000 o más votantes sugirieran nuevas leyes, Payá obtuvo, según algunos cálculos, más de 25,000 firmas de cubanos partidarios de reformar la Constitución de manera drástica para autorizar elecciones libres, derecho de asamblea, prensa libre y una economía menos regulada.

En 2002, la Asamblea Nacional de Cuba respondió a la iniciativa de Payá, conocida como el Proyecto Varela, enmendando la Constitución para establecer que el sistema unipartidista socialista de la isla era “irrevocable”. El siguiente año, las autoridades en Cuba encarcelaron a decenas de disidentes y periodistas independientes durante un período de intensa represión conocido como la primavera negra. Muchas de las personas detenidas durante ese periodo, el cual pasó relativamente desapercibido en el ámbito internacional por coincidir con el principio de la guerra en Irak, pertenecían al movimiento de Payá.

En 2010, el Gobierno cubano accedió a poner en libertad a varios de los presos políticos, mediante un acuerdo negociado con la Iglesia Católica, con la condición de que debían emigrar a España. En 2012, Payá falleció en un accidente vehicular en Cuba que, según sospechan muchos activistas, fue orquestado por agentes de seguridad.

Algunos de los presos que fueron puestos en libertad, entre ellos José Daniel Ferrer, un aliado de Payá conocido por ser de carácter fuerte, rehusaron abandonar la isla. Ferrer es el líder de la Unión Patriótica de Cuba[http://www.unpacu.org/], el grupo de oposición más visible y activo. En una reciente entrevista en La Habana, Ferrer dijo que los ocho años que pasó en prisión representaron una oportunidad para considerar por qué no triunfaron los movimientos de disidencia en el pasado y cuál podría ser la fórmula exitosa en el futuro. Históricamente, dijo, los activistas han sido percibidos por sus compatriotas como víctimas indefensas de un Estado opresivo. “Esa gente lo que inspira es lástima, no deseo de seguirle”, dijo. “Tratamos de evitar que a la gente le lleguen discursos de perdedores”.

Ferrer dijo que su objetivo no es propiciar el tipo de cambio de régimen repentino y dramático por el cual han luchado varios exiliados. Lo que busca es que el movimiento de oposición llegue a ser lo suficientemente empoderado para tener voz y voto en el ámbito político. “Hay que ser suficientemente grande para obligar al régimen a negociar”, dijo. “Nadie quiere apostarle al caballo que va a perder la carrera”.

A pesar de décadas de privación económica y represión estatal, la gran mayoría de cubanos no han estado dispuestos a unirse a movimientos de oposición o apoyarlos abiertamente. Es fácil comprender por qué. El audaz servicio de inteligencia de la isla ha logrado penetrar los movimientos de oposición a través de los años, lo cual ha dificultado que formen alianzas. También ha logrado tildar a los disidentes como codiciosos agentes de iniciativas de gobiernos occidentales, una estrategia efectiva en un país nacionalista que históricamente ha sido objeto de complots estadounidenses.

Aunque las tácticas empleadas en contra de los disidentes en la actualidad no son tan extremas como lo fueron hace una década, siguen siendo insidiosas. Los líderes de la oposición son atacados constantemente por los medios nacionales. Con frecuencia, las autoridades detienen temporalmente a los activistas para impedir que asistan a reuniones, y para que ellos —y sus vecinos— recuerden que están siendo vigilados. Quienes viven en Cuba asumen que el espionaje interno es tan amplio que los diplomáticos suben el volumen de la música cuando quieren hablar sobre temas delicados. Los cubanos frecuentemente retiran la batería de su teléfono celular cuando quieren tener una conversación privada, por temor a que el enorme equipo de seguridad de la isla tenga la capacidad de escuchar las conversaciones de prácticamente todos los ciudadanos, a cualquier hora.

En un nivel básico, dijo Elizardo Sánchez, quien es conocido como el decano de los defensores de los derechos humanos en Cuba, muchos cubanos no tienen la energía que requiere el activismo político.

“La vida es tan dura que la gente no tiene tiempo de pensar en términos políticos”, dijo. “Conseguir alimentos, transporte, medicina, toma mucho tiempo”.

Después del anuncio de un acercamiento entre Washington y La Habana este mes, un grupo de prominentes activistas y miembros de la sociedad civil emitieron un comunicado con cuatro demandas razonables. Piden la liberación incondicional de presos políticos. Cuba se comprometió a liberar a 53 presos políticos como parte del acuerdo que negoció con Washington. Los activistas también exigen que Cuba acate los principios de la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos, un acuerdo que La Habana ratificó. El comunicado, firmado por Ferrer y la popular bloguera Yoani Sánchez, entre otras personas, también pide que el gobierno reconozca a líderes de la sociedad civil que no están vinculados al Estado. Por último, exigen que el gobierno esté dispuesto a contemplar reformas constitucionales que pudieran llevar finalmente a elecciones libres y democráticas.

Si el movimiento de oposición en Cuba se fortalece a raíz de la mejora de relaciones con Washington, o si el acercamiento hace que la represión se intensifique, dependerá en buena medida del apoyo que obtengan los activistas de la comunidad internacional. A medida que Cuba sea más accesible para los estadounidenses, particularmente quienes además tienen ciudadanía cubana, es posible que el gobierno en La Habana, sintiéndose vulnerable frente a una oleada de inversión, turismo y mayor flujo de información, aumente sus esfuerzos por reprimir la disidencia.

Durante décadas, los gobiernos latinoamericanos han protegido, o por lo menos tolerado, al régimen de los Castro porque confrontarlo hubiera sido interpretado como un respaldo de la política severa de Washington. Ahora que Obama puso fin a ese dilema, los líderes de países democráticos tienen la posibilidad de defender los principios por los que abogan activistas cubanos. Los líderes de las más grandes economías de América Latina, en particular, podrían convertirse en los principales protectores de los líderes de la oposición cubana durante la Cumbre de las Américas en Panamá, en abril.

Aunque históricamente, los países de América Latina han rehusado intervenir en asuntos internos de sus vecinos, el Presidente Enrique Peña Nieto de México y la Presidenta Dilma Rousseff de Brasil, deberían hablar enfáticamente en defensa de los principios democráticos acatados por la mayoría de naciones en las Américas. Rousseff, quien fue presa política antes de convertirse en una de las más destacadas líderes de izquierda, y cuyo país es uno de los principales aliados comerciales de Cuba, podría tener una influencia singular.

Si los líderes de movimientos de oposición y de la sociedad civil cubana son invitados a la cumbre, como lo ha pedido Washington, Rousseff podría estar hablando en presencia de los líderes de una Cuba democrática.

Seeking Refuge in a Year Marked by Chaos

HOW close are you willing to get?

That's the question posed by the most potent photographs of 2104: How close?

We founder in the shallows amid the constant nano-buzz of a modern culture. But with just one powerful still photograph -- emphasis on still -- you need to stop... stare... then drown in the image, tumble into its pure moment.

And so many of those moments in 2014 where the ink seemed to bleed, where the pixels seemed to pulse with extra force, focused on the millions of people seeking some kind of refuge -- in places like Myanmar, Syria and Sudan, in Ukraine, Istanbul and Caracas. There were those displaced by violence, and others who sought shelter by embracing the very violence itself. Then there were the people who sought relief from abusive husbands, disease and natural disasters, and the lucky few who could choose to lose themselves in the electronic dance music of Skrillex and his D.J. brothers and sisters.

But for most of the displaced, for those on the run, those who had to bear too many funerals, there was little choice. Not for the three women pinned down by a possible sniper in Kiev. As I look at them huddled behind a barricade of tires and trash all I can think about are the lies that form the bedrock of most wars -- even those that are undeclared.

And the Nike-wearing young man in Caracas hurling a Molotov cocktail appears to have little choice, either, consumed as he is by flames and his rage.

In a year in which, again and again, it was made painfully clear that too many men still treat women as prey, as mere flesh-and-blood accessories, one of the most fierce and moving photos here is the portrait of a 16-year-old Syrian, Yasmeen, with her child. She fled her husband, who beat and bloodied her, and returned to her family. Her head covering almost seems to be a kind of asylum and, maybe, even a mask of shame.

Sometimes, there is simply no sanctuary.

Certainly not in Ferguson, Mo., which became the epicenter of United States racial politics and protest after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black 18-year-old, Michael Brown. In a photo from a demonstration in Ferguson, the black man shown surrendering to three white, heavily armed members of the law surely understands that there is no safe haven for him.

No refuge, either, in West Africa, where the Ebola epidemic overwhelmed the population. In one image here, 4-year-old Sweetie Sweetie sits in a bedroom she shares with another Ebola orphan -- a bleak phrase that entered the lexicon this year -- in Sierra Leone. It's a photograph of endless depth as Sweetie Sweetie, perhaps, finds a small place of solace in her grief.

Then there are the health workers swaddled in protective clothing right before they enter a high-risk Ebola ward in Liberia. They stare at the viewer and seem to be asking:

How close are you willing to get?

As Christie Roams the Country, His Popularity Takes a Hit in New Jersey

CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen the Chris Christie-for-president chatter first started, in 2011, voters in his home state of New Jersey took pride in having a celebrity governor. As Nancy Reagan escorted Mr. Christie to his speech at her husband's presidential library, and hedge fund billionaires, The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal's editorial pages urged him to run, his approval ratings jumped. Voters told pollsters the national attention made him more effective, and improved their state's long-maligned image.

Four years later, with Governor Christie again considering a run for president, his constituents appear to be tiring of the whole routine.

Polls taken over the last three months reveal a list of home-state complaints: Mr. Christie's favorability is at its lowest point, with more voters disapproving than approving of his job performance. New Jersey residents think he is making decisions with an eye on his national standing rather than on what is good for their state. They do not think he should run for president -- they are, as the slogan goes, ready for Hillary -- but most expect he will, and want him to resign if he does. Political talk in New Jersey centers less on Mr. Christie running for president and more on which one of three Democrats quietly seeking to succeed him will win -- even though that election is three years away.

For his part, Mr. Christie has begun living a life that is strikingly apart from the state he governs. As chairman of the Republican Governors Association over the last year, he spent 152 days, or 42 percent of his time, outside New Jersey. He has been out of the state for 137 days, or 40 percent of the time, since his second inauguration in January. If he starts a campaign for the presidency early in 2015, it would ensure a tenure spent more on national pursuits than on, say, Pinelands preservation or taking on public employees over pension reform -- the issue that brought him all the national attention in the first place.

This month, Mr. Christie was in Canada, where he gave a speech endorsing the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which is backed by big Republican donors, but of little interest to New Jersey voters. The governor has remained silent on a pipeline that would run through his state and is opposed by state Republican leaders. Last month, he vetoed a bill banning gestation crates for pigs, legislation popular in New Jersey but unpopular in Iowa, the first caucus state, where Mr. Christie is headed next month for a conference of conservative voters.

He did assert a position on at least one New Jersey issue: In September, he suggested doing away with the requirement that he transfer his powers to the lieutenant governor when he leaves the state. (When a Republican assemblyman followed up two weeks later with a proposal to amend the state Constitution to accomplish this, he was campaigning in Wisconsin and Ohio.)

Mr. Christie is not the only politician who is perceived differently in his home state than he is on the national stage. But he has never sought to be just any politician; he had planned to argue that his broad support in blue-state New Jersey made him a different kind of Republican, and his party's best hope for winning the White House. He made the state and all its stereotypes part of his persona and his appeal: the brash, Bruce Springsteen-loving, ''you may not like what I say but I tell it like it is'' Jersey guy.

''The kind of support that he's had among nontraditional households is what made him interesting,'' said Krista Jenkins, the director of the Public Mind Poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University. ''That has really shifted.''

Just how much is indicated in the polls Ms. Jenkins has conducted over the last two years. As Mr. Christie opened his re-election campaign and basked in the approval of his handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in January 2013, 48 percent of New Jersey voters in a Public Mind Poll said they ''liked everything about'' him, while just 17 percent said they ''disliked everything.'' (In between, 18 percent said they liked him but disliked his policies, and 12 percent disliked him but liked his policies.)

By October 2014, however, 32 percent said they liked everything about Mr. Christie, and 35 percent said they disliked everything, suggesting that he had become as polarizing as the Washington politicians he disdains.

Mr. Christie has said he will discuss a presidential run with his family over the holidays and make his intentions known early in the new year. But his intentions have been fairly obvious almost since he said no to the entreaties in 2011. He suggested to the audience at the Reagan Library then that it was a matter of gaining experience, and he encouraged his name to be mentioned in discussions about vice-presidential nominees in 2012.

While Mr. Christie joked in 2011 that he would have to commit suicide to convince people he was not running, he has spent the last two years declaring himself enormously flattered, and tells people he is ''thinking about it.'' He has begun leaving himself room to say no, indicating that his youngest children are not thrilled about the possibility of moving to Washington. But he also sent Christmas cards to Republican voters in Iowa for the second year in a row, and tells interviewers that he will need a job when this one is over. (Among those interviewers were middle school students; Mr. Christie told them he could not believe it took them until the fourth question to ask whether he was running.)

Asked about Mr. Christie's relationship with New Jersey, his press secretary responded with a list of what he said were the governor's bipartisan accomplishments over the past year: extending a cap on arbitration awards in local police and fire contracts; permitting judges more discretion to allow or deny bail; working with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, to set up a quarantine policy for health workers exposed to Ebola patients in Africa; and convening two conferences to address the future of Atlantic City.

Mr. Christie's aides argue that the strongest indication of his popularity is the 22-point margin by which he won re-election in November 2013. And, his defenders argue, it is hardly surprising that his poll numbers would suffer this year, given that it opened with coverage of leaked emails that revealed the role of administration officials in shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, apparently to punish a mayor who had declined to endorse his re-election bid.

But pollsters say the scandal does not fully explain the decline. While most New Jersey residents continue to say Mr. Christie has not been honest about what he knew of the lane closings, they also do not seem to care. His approval rating dropped after the initial revelations, but stabilized within a couple of months.

Instead, analysts point to other news: Ratings agencies have downgraded New Jersey's credit rating eight times under Mr. Christie, more than under any other governor. The state has recovered barely half the jobs it lost during the recession, even as the nation has made up for its losses and more. A third of Atlantic City casinos closed this year, four years into the governor's five-year plan to save the town. And he broke the pension agreement that had been his signature issue, saying the state could not afford to make payments required by legislation he signed early in his tenure. Polls began to show a new decline shortly after.

''There's no obvious wind for him in the state,'' said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Institute poll. ''There's nothing to make people say, 'Hey, he's really doing something.' Voters in New Jersey know that the guy's got other things on his mind.''

In the month since he finished leading the Republicans governors' group, Mr. Christie has kept a limited public schedule in New Jersey. He greeted President Obama at Fort Dix (and dined at least twice with Henry Kissinger in New York). He attended the swearing-in of a high school friend whom he had named a judge, and a ceremony held to congratulate an award-winning middle school in his town. But the job of attending most events has fallen to his lieutenant governor.

Pollsters say that distance -- metaphoric or physical -- may end up hurting him more than the bridge scandal. The Monmouth University poll, for instance, found his approval dropping in late September, after holding steady for six months after the scandal. The only shift that seemed to explain it was an increase in the percentage of people who believed he was running for president. ''There was a group of people who went from, 'I kind of approve' to 'I'm not sure. All this time out of state makes me wonder if his mind is in the game,' '' said Patrick Murray, the director of the poll.

Most voters did not believe Mr. Christie's explanation that a trip to Mexico that month was meant to build New Jersey's trade relations; even Republicans were more likely to believe it was to help him run for president.

Mr. Christie has said he has no intention of resigning from the governorship if he runs for president. His friends say he likes the job too much.

Correction: January 4, 2015, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about a drop in Gov. Chris Christie's popularity in New Jersey as he considers a run for president misidentified, in some copies, the type of fuel that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which Mr. Christie endorsed, is intended to carry. It is oil, not natural gas.

Wars, pestilence, political upheaval and mass street protests in America were some of the top stories of 2014. Here's how The Times's editorial board reacted to the year's biggest news events as they unfolded.

Enemies No More

In one sweeping announcement, President Obama restores full diplomatic relations with Cuba and ends more than 50 years of hostility and sanctions that probably helped the Castro regime stay in power. The move -- which included a prisoner swap -- could become Mr. Obama's most significant foreign policy legacy.

Die-Ins and Protests of Police Abuses

Police brutality became a national issue this summer with the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson, Mo., which set off riots in November when a grand jury did not indict the officer involved. The issue spawned a national movement after a New York City police officer was captured on video applying the chokehold that killed Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. After a grand jury refused to indict the officer, demonstrators of all races took to the streets from coast to coast chanting or carrying signs with Mr. Garner's last words: ''I can't breathe.''

Bombing Syria and Iraq

The terrorist group the Islamic State seized northern parts of Iraq, including the city of Mosul, and large swaths of Syria, beheaded journalists and brutalized and murdered countless civilians in areas under its control. President Obama responded to this new threat by authorizing bombing campaigns against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. Though he had promised to extract America from wars in the Middle East, he led the nation into this military conflict without Congressional approval, which was just fine with a Congress that has happily avoided debating the war. Mr. Obama has already warned that the fight against the Islamic State will take years.

The Senate Goes Republican

Republicans won control of the Senate for the first time since 2006, and expanded their hold on the House. They campaigned mostly by attacking President Obama on every policy matter, but offered few ideas of their own. No one promised bipartisan compromise, though President Obama suggested there were areas of common interest. The best that Senator Mitch McConnell, the next Senate majority leader, could muster was a vow that maybe the two parties didn't ''have to be in perpetual conflict.''

Putin Invades Ukraine

President Vladimir Putin of Russia shattered notions of cooperation with the West by invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea and then, with arms and military forces, working to destabilize Eastern Ukraine. In response, the West largely cut off Russian banks from credit markets, blocked some technology transfers and imposed other sanctions. By mid-December, Russia's economy, battered by the sanctions and falling oil prices, was reeling from the collapse of the ruble, rising inflation and capital flight.

An Epidemic Out of Control

The deadly Ebola virus surged out of control in three West African nations -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- before international organizations and advanced nations woke up to mount a belated response. The United States spearheaded efforts to aid West Africa but dropped the ball domestically when a case brought in by a traveler from Liberia was mishandled by a Dallas hospital. By year's end, steps had been taken to detect infected travelers entering the United States and international aid to West Africa had been ramped up. The virus, however, was still outpacing efforts to contain it.

Executive Action on Immigration

President Obama's decision to bypass Congress was the most significant development on immigration policy in decades. In allowing perhaps five million unauthorized immigrants to stay in this country without fear of deportation, Mr. Obama drew the outlines of a sensible immigration policy. Many Republicans in Congress are furious, because they don't want to go there.

The Details of Torture Revealed

After years of delay, the Senate Intelligence Committee released an executive summary of its report on the Central Intelligence Agency's torture of terrorism suspects, detailing sadistic, illegal interrogation methods, which included waterboarding, beating, sleep deprivation, confining detainees in coffins and ''rectal feeding.'' It's time to investigate the perpetrators, starting with former Vice President Dick Cheney and former C.I.A. director George Tenet.

More States Legalize Pot

Several states this year defied the misguided federal ban on marijuana. The country's first government-licensed, recreational marijuana shops opened in Colorado and Washington State. In November's midterm elections, Alaska and Oregon voters turned legalization into a trend, approving ballot measures to tax and regulate the drug. Voters in Washington, D.C., also repealed all criminal and civil penalties for personal possession of marijuana. Congress, however, effectively blocked D.C.'s initiative with a rider in the omnibus spending bill, though another rider blocked federal interference with states that allow medical marijuana.

A Minimum Wage Workers Can Live On

Not long ago, the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would have seemed unrealistic. No longer. Low-wage workers captured the public's attention -- and changed the terms of the debate -- by calling for a minimum wage that is more than twice the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. In June, Seattle approved a law to raise the minimum to $15 an hour, phasing it in for small and large employers.

Vehicles of Mass Destruction

Deadly safety problems in cars made by General Motors, Honda and others exposed a deeply flawed auto safety system that Congress needs to reform. Lawmakers have expressed outrage about failures by the car companies and safety regulators but so far have passed no laws to make prevent more such negligence or worse.

Same-Sex Marriage Expands Across the Nation

The ripple effects of the Supreme Court's ruling in 2013 striking down the heart of the Defense of Marriage Act spread with astonishing speed in 2014. Courts struck down bans on same-sex marriage in states like Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia. The number of states where same-sex couples may legally marry more than doubled to 35 from 16 at the start of the year. There's hope that the Supreme Court could soon extend marriage equality to all states.

A Tipping Point for Justice Reform

After decades of costly and pointless overincarceration, politicians in red and blue states are finally getting smarter about handling crime. And while Congress continued to dawdle, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. continued to take big steps toward reform, from expanding clemency to calling for an end to felon disenfranchisement.

China's Shift on Global Warming

For the first time, President Xi Jinping agreed to ''peak'' China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, by 2030. The United States, in exchange, pledged to reduce emissions to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. This greatly increases the chances of a new global climate agreement at a summit meeting of all nations in Paris next year.

Reproductive Rights Take a Beating

A Supreme Court decision in June upended principles of corporate law and religious freedom to exempt owners of closely held, for-profit corporations from having to provide employees with contraceptive coverage in company health plans under the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, a wave of aggressive new laws enacted in Republican-led states have further limited abortion services. In Texas, a 2013 law has left the state with about 20 abortion providers compared with 41 before the new law. Had the Supreme Court not acted in October to prevent Texas from enforcing two unnecessary rules while the legal battle staggers on, there would be as few as eight providers.

In Haiti, Battling Disease With Open-Air Clinics

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — The pictures of medical dysfunction were devastating — broken hospitals in Africa struggling, and largely failing, to contain the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic. As deaths mounted, the problems seemed intractable: no money, no infrastructure, no hope.

But across the ocean, Haiti[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] — a broken country if there ever was one — now has two new clinics, open-air, modest in size and cost, designed to tackle diseases that can be as insidious and deadly as Ebola, but are also more common: cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and tuberculosis.

The clinics here are simple, even handsome. Instead of constructing hermetic shields in the form of airtight, inflexible hospital buildings, the architects took advantage of Haiti’s Caribbean environment, exploiting island cross breezes to heal patients and aid caregivers.

It’s not clear yet how well the clinics will work. They open soon. If they turn out right, they could serve as relatively light-footed models for other struggling countries that lack resources for high-end Western-style hospitals. They might even do a little to nudge hospitals in the United States away from the midcentury model of sealed buildings that rely on imperfect mechanical systems costing a king’s ransom and gobbling up energy. Architectural innovation these days can travel south to north, after all, not just north to south.

The two clinics are by MASS Design Group[http://www.massdesigngroup.org/], a young firm from Boston that won kudos recently for a hospital in Rwanda. Like that project, these capitalize on local materials, labor and crafts. One clinic here replaces a tuberculosis treatment center[http://www.massdesigngroup.org/portfolio/gheskio-tb/], run by Gheskio, a Haitian health service and research organization. The center collapsed during the earthquake in 2010. The new two-story structure is roughly a pentagon, with one extra-long end. There are rooms for 35 patients surrounding a landscaped courtyard — “an oasis,” is how Alan Ricks, a partner at MASS, imagines it, and that’s close to how it already feels — with a fountain and bougainvillea climbing up bamboo screens.

It’s a plain but elegant structure whose latticed, sculptured steel roof (a giant woven basket comes to mind) gives it some character and helps hot air circulate up and out of the building. Because tuberculosis thrives in closed spaces, windows are placed on walls directly opposite one another to promote cross ventilation.

The other building, for cholera patients[http://www.massdesigngroup.org/portfolio/ctc/], is a single-story pavilion on a separate Gheskio campus, across a busy, rutted road from one of the largest slums in this city, whose residents it mostly serves. It’s not inside the slum, but nearly. The zigzag roof vaguely conjures up 1950s roadside diners. The vibe is surprisingly playful, welcoming. Sky-blue, hand-punched metal screens, made by local artisans, clad the outside and allude to tap-taps: the gaily colored, extravagantly decorated share-taxis that Haitians ride to get around the city.

Cholera arrived here by way of Nepalese peackeeping troops after the earthquake and ran amok through contaminated water. Companies hired to dispose of wastewater safely dumped it illegally instead. At the new clinic, MASS constructed a dedicated wastewater treatment system under the pavilion, safeguarded from floods, the architects say. Many hospitals in developing countries burn waste on site. This takes the approach a step further.

To some doctors, a permanent cholera clinic can simply sound wrongheaded. Emergency medical experts told me that outbreaks like cholera, or Ebola, tend to be addressed best by portable, pop-up “camps” erected inside stricken areas, to quash the problem at its source. The real solution to cholera would be fixing the sanitation system in the slums. As one doctor put it: You don’t build a trauma center to address a deadly traffic intersection; you redesign the streets.

But a doctor at Gheskio stressed that the clinic here, conceived around the architectural challenges particular to cholera, can be repurposed after the disease is no longer the problem.

And neither clinic cost an arm and a leg. The tuberculosis clinic was $2 million, or $140 a square foot, according to Adam Saltzman, the project manager for MASS on both sites. The cholera clinic totaled $700,000, or $80 a square foot.

Architecture and engineering helped eradicate these diseases ages ago in cities like London, Paris and New York, which constructed sewers and hospitals, while clearing slums. As postearthquake Haiti proves, absent adequate architecture and infrastructure, the diseases can return with a vengeance. The cholera epidemic has affected an estimated 800,000 Haitians, according to Jean William Pape, the Haitian doctor and Cornell professor who founded Gheskio. (Its full name is the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections.)

Dr. Pape was among the first to identify H.I.V.[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]/AIDS in the developing world. Since the earthquake in 2010, he and Gheskio have employed short-term measures to cut the death rate from cholera by 80 percent, introducing a temporary vaccine and distributing chlorine that Gheskio manufactures on its campus. “Architecture and health are inseparable,” Dr. Pape explained when I dropped into his office one recent morning. “A building that is ugly, with no fresh air, no dignity or common sense, is a place people will avoid, and this encourages epidemics.”

I peered into Gheskio’s provisional tuberculosis treatment site, which the new building will replace: It’s a bare-bones, gated tent village. A tent not far from Dr. Pape’s office now serves cholera patients; a stack of cots teetered in a corner. MASS has enlisted furniture-makers at Gheskio to help design better, more comfortable furniture for cholera patients.

“We have 10,000 people on this campus,” Dr. Pape said, “making bricks, metal working, making furniture, manufacturing chlorine.” There is a preschool, too, and a shelter for abused women, who are provided with on-site infant care and job training. It’s a virtual city within the city.

“Too often, after an emergency, when the aid agencies are done, there’s no more funding, and disease simmers,” Michael Murphy, another partner at MASS, told me. “There’s a real chance to end cholera and tuberculosis, but that can only happen with permanent infrastructure. We are building against the hospital trend of the midcentury in the U.S.” He was talking about buildings that “can cause infections and all sorts of other problems.”

The idea harks back to colonial hospitals in the developing world, which were open-air buildings constructed around courtyards. In the tuberculosis clinic, MASS’s architects have carved vestibules outside patient rooms, along the balcony and around the edge of the courtyard so nurses and doctors can conduct examinations in fresh air, not in the rooms, where they’re most likely to become infected. For that same reason, cleaning crews can also avoid the rooms and enter patient bathrooms through a separate door, a strategy European infectious-disease hospitals have pioneered.

“We believe in context,” Mr. Ricks said. “In Rwanda, we asked, ‘Why not have fresh air?’ It wasn’t a radical question.”

Dr. Pape elaborated: “Doctors treating Ebola in most parts of Africa don’t have facilities anything like the ones in the United States, but they rarely get infected. So clearly the clinical environment doesn’t need to be like Mars.”

I spoke with two local contractors who built the tuberculosis clinic. They told me they had never overseen anything as customized or demanding. Robertho Jean Noel, a young Haitian civil engineer, was enlisted by MASS to ride herd on the contractors, one of whom, Pierrot Coupaud, complained to me about how certain tricky parts of the latticed roof had to be ripped up and redone three or four times.

But then Mr. Coupaud pointed to a plain, windowless new stucco clinic next door. “That box is a joke,” he said. “What we’ve done is something else.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Critic’s Notebook article on Monday about the design of two new open-air clinics in Haiti, including one for cholera patients, referred imprecisely to the Nepalis with whom the outbreak of a cholera epidemic in 2010 was associated. While they were associated with the United Nations, it was as peacekeeping troops, not as aid workers.

On the flight back to Atlanta, Dr. Pierre Rollin snoozed in Seat 26C in his usual imperturbable way, arms folded, head bobbing, oblivious to loudspeaker announcements and the periodic passing of the galley cart.

This routine had become part of his lore. During each viral outbreak, Dr. Rollin, the top Ebola expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], would outlast his younger colleagues in the hotel lobby, staying awake until 3 or 4 a.m. to plug new cases into a database. He managed to do this at 61 because he possessed an uncanny ability to sleep anywhere anytime, whether on the hardwood floor of a staff house in Zaire (Ebola, 1995) or in a back seat lurching down a cratered road in Madagascar (Rift Valley fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/coccidioidomycosis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], 2008).

On this trip home from Guinea on May 7, Dr. Rollin (pronounced Ro-LAHN in his native French) found himself at particular peace. His five-and-a-half-week stay as the C.D.C.'s team leader in the opening days of Guinea’s effort to control Ebola had gone about as well as one could have hoped.

The number of Ebola cases reported each week had been declining steadily for a month. It had been more than 10 days since doctors had seen a new patient in Conakry, the capital, where Dr. Rollin worked alongside other early responders from the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

New patients had slowed to a trickle in the Forest Region of southeastern Guinea, the center of the outbreak, and there had not been a report across the border in Liberia for four weeks. Sierra Leone, although surrounded by Guinea and Liberia, had not discovered a single confirmed case.

Like the 10 Ebola crises he had handled before, in Uganda and Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, this first substantial outbreak in West Africa seemed to be burning itself out after a few months and a few hundred infections.

“This is close to over,” Dr. Rollin told himself, a view common among the virus hunters. “That’s it for this outbreak.”

Or so he thought. In fact, Dr. Rollin and other well-intentioned veterans of past Ebola campaigns had tragically underestimated this outbreak, overlooking clues that now seem apparent. Viewing the West Africa epidemic through the prism of nearly two dozen previous outbreaks across the continent[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/30/science/history-of-ebola-in-24-outbreaks.html], they failed to appreciate that the 2014 version would be unique in catastrophic ways.

After more than 20,000 cases and 7,800 deaths, it can be hard to recall that there was a moment in the spring when the longest and deadliest Ebola outbreak in history might have been stopped. But without a robust and coordinated response, an invisible epidemic was allowed to thrive alongside the one assumed to be contained.

Although conditions were ideal for the virus to go underground, some of the world’s most experienced Ebola fighters convinced themselves that the sharp decline in newly reported cases in April and May was real.

Tracing those exposed to Ebola and checking them for symptoms, the key to containing any outbreak, had been lacking in many areas. Health workers had been chased out of fearful neighborhoods.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html] Ebola treatment centers had gained such reputations as deathtraps that even desperately ill patients devoted their waning strength to avoiding them.

With the affected countries often lacking the most basic medical infrastructure, the health care challenges proved staggering. But the most tragically missed opportunities stemmed from the poor flow of information about who was infected and whom they might have exposed.

A two-month investigation by The New York Times into this largely unexamined period discovered that the W.H.O. and the Guinean health ministry documented in March that a handful of people had recently died or been sick with Ebola-like symptoms across the border in Sierra Leone. But information about two of those possible infections never reached senior health officials and the team investigating suspected cases in Sierra Leone.

As a result, it was not until late May, after more than two months of unchecked contagion, that Sierra Leone recorded its first confirmed cases. The chain of illnesses and deaths links those cases directly to the two cases that were never followed up in March. Sierra Leone has since tallied about 9,400 reported Ebola infections, more than any other country. The same missed cases are linked to Liberia’s vast second-wave outbreak, identified in late May, with almost 8,000 reported infections to date.

The leaders of the initial response agree that they did not deploy nearly enough people to the region, and that they withdrew too soon. There was managerial confusion in the W.H.O., which was already stretched by budget cuts and competing demands. Some in the W.H.O. along with Guinean officials played down the threat, leading to overconfidence and inattention. Other international and nongovernment groups devised public-education campaigns that in some instances did more harm than good.

Dr. Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola in 1976, and Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious disease specialist, called the West Africa outbreak “an avoidable crisis” in an editorial[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe1411471] published online in September in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the same issue, W.H.O. officials said[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100] of the March to July period that “modest further intervention efforts at that point could have achieved control.”

Like all who followed them, the early responders demonstrated remarkable courage and dedication. But those qualities did not guarantee an understanding of how geography and culture would make this outbreak so distinctive.

Most previous outbreaks had started in remote villages in Central and East Africa, where the virus could be surrounded and isolated. All told, they had killed 1,590 people over four decades, only a fifth of the toll of the epidemic still unfolding across West Africa.

In some of the worst luck in epidemiological history, this outbreak occurred at the bustling intersection of three of the world’s poorest and least developed countries. Doctors in the region were rarer than paved roads — Liberia, for instance, had fewer than 250 physicians for four million people — and clinics and hospitals, where they existed, often lacked essentials like running water, hand soap and gloves.

International health groups had largely pulled out of West Africa during the civil wars that devastated Liberia and Sierra Leone during the 1990s. When the Ebola outbreak began, the C.D.C.'s staff in the region consisted of one malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] researcher in Guinea.

Complicating matters, the same ethnic group — the Kissi — inhabited the forested region across all three nations, and extended families moved easily on foot and by dugout canoe across a pinwheel of disregarded national borders. Although roads were unpaved and bumpy, they were passable enough for villagers to ride motorcycles into dense capital cities, carrying the virus on board.

Distrust of government ran so high after decades of civil war and corruption that many West Africans had to be convinced Ebola was real and not a plot to attract foreign aid. They reacted with indignation to outsiders who demanded they stop providing hands-on care[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html] to the sick, considered a sacred obligation by many West Africans, whether Muslim, Christian or traditionalist.

Governments attempted to broadcast the message that Ebola was spread through contact with vomit, feces and blood, and that bodies remained highly contagious after death. But communities often continued to wash the bodies of the dead, a step considered essential to a dignified burial and a contented afterlife. The arrival of moon-suited health workers in convoys of white trucks, armed with chlorine sprayers and thermometers, bred resistance and secrecy.

“Old disease in new context will bring you surprises,” Dr. Margaret Chan, the director-general of the W.H.O., said in an interview in December in her office in Geneva.

On conference calls before leaving Guinea last May, Dr. Rollin advised his supervisors in Atlanta that the situation seemed stable enough that the C.D.C. could probably pull out after another month. Having stayed beyond the standard four-week tour, he looked toward reuniting with his wife, Dominique, a C.D.C. microbiologist he met in high school, and to seeing what their three young grandchildren had learned in his absence.

But not long after his return, Dr. Rollin noticed disturbing trends in the reports landing in his inbox. First, an uptick in cases in southeastern Guinea. Then the first confirmed infections in neighboring Sierra Leone. Then a death at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, and the first case in Conakry in a month.

After a deceptive lull, the virus was back, with ruthless force.

“Damn,” the old Ebola hand thought, “we missed it.″

Guinea: A Lagging, Mixed Reaction

When Dr. Rollin arrived in Guinea on March 31, the outbreak was already three months old. In Meliandou, a leafy village in the hills of southern Guinea, a year-old boy named Emile had taken ill in late December with fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and bloody stool. He died Dec. 28, and a W.H.O. investigation would later conclude he was probably the first Ebola casualty. Members of his family, a nurse, doctor and other health workers soon died also.

“We thought it was a mysterious disease,” said Dr. Kalissa N’fansoumane, the director of the nearby Guéckédou Hospital.

Local health officials accompanied by a Doctors Without Borders logistician had investigated the cluster of deaths in January. They concluded that a cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-like diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] had been the cause. Unaware of signs like persistent hiccups, health workers made faulty assumptions, and some paid with their lives.

Remarkably, it would take 12 weeks to diagnose the ravaging virus. Ebola was all but unknown in West Africa — there had been a single nonfatal case in Ivory Coast in 1994 — and its symptoms were similar to those of endemic diseases like malaria, cholera and Lassa fever.

At W.H.O. headquarters in Geneva on the morning of March 21, Dr. Robert Fowler sensed the buzz as soon as he walked into the Strategic Health Operations Center, where epidemiologists seated around a blond, horseshoe-shaped table were monitoring new reports. There had been suspicions for several days about hemorrhagic fever in West Africa.

At 2:13 a.m. that morning, an email from Sylvain Baize, an infectious disease specialist at the Pasteur Institute, had announced that initial testing on blood samples flown from Guinea by Doctors Without Borders revealed a filovirus, which can cause hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Marburg.

There were already 49 suspected cases and 29 deaths.

The researchers hovered intensely over their laptops as others talked in clusters beneath the digital world clocks. At 7:06 p.m., Dr. Baize sent another email: “Les résultats confirment la présence du virus Ebola.”

“Oh, God,” thought Dr. Fowler, a critical care physician from Canada who was spending a year helping the W.H.O. respond to crises around the world.

The timing could not have been worse. Created by the United Nations in 1948 to coordinate international health efforts, the W.H.O. had been hobbled by recessionary cutbacks and was strained to its limits by concurrent emergencies and outbreaks: the MERS virus in Saudi Arabia, a new avian influenza A[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] strain in China, polio[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/poliomyelitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in war-torn Syria, conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Now add Ebola.

“It’s like if a plane crashes in the Hudson in the morning, and there’s a snowstorm in the afternoon and floods in the subways in the evening,” Dr. Fowler said. “And then you have two planes hit the World Trade Center in the middle of the night.”

But a lack of resources was not the W.H.O.'s only problem. Its clunky governance structure and overlapping power bases invited political meddling and sowed confusion on the ground.

In addition to its headquarters staff in Geneva, the W.H.O. has largely autonomous offices in each of six regions. The powerful African regional director — Dr. Luis G. Sambo, an Angolan, who finishes his 10 years in the post next month — is nominated not by Geneva, but by the health ministers of the region’s 47 countries. His office, in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, then proposes representatives in each country, with approval from headquarters.

Dr. Chan and her staff in Europe sent aid and experts, but largely delegated leadership of the early response to W.H.O. regional representatives on the ground.

The paucity of health care in West Africa meant that the W.H.O.'s central coordinating role would be critical. But its capacity had shrunk. In recent years, its epidemic response department, including a network of anthropologists to help overcome cultural differences, had dissolved, with duties parceled out to other branches.

The African region’s budget for epidemic preparedness and response had been more than halved over five years to $11 million for 2014-15, from $26 million in 2010-11, according to Dr. Sambo. Nine of 12 emergency response specialists had been laid off, said Dr. Francis C. Kasolo, the region’s director of disease prevention and control.

The W.H.O. country representatives were, in the view of many who worked with them, earnest but overmatched. Recent W.H.O. audits had found alarming accounting deficiencies in the offices in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as in the regional office.

Dr. Nils Daulaire, who until February sat on the W.H.O. executive board as the assistant secretary for global affairs at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, said the Africa office had long been seen as “a place where politics often trumps substance” and where key appointees “often are not the cream of the crop.”

Dr. Sambo wrote in response to emailed questions that such criticism “is not fair at all,” adding that “W.H.O. is not a political organization.”

The disconnect between the W.H.O.'s offices in Geneva and in Brazzaville revealed itself almost immediately in the agency’s dealings with the C.D.C., which was accustomed to being brought into outbreaks quickly and given a primary role. It perturbed the C.D.C.'s director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, to hear in late March that the team headed by Dr. Rollin, which was being dispatched at the W.H.O.'s request, had been held up by bureaucratic demands.

He got in touch with Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O. assistant director-general for health security in Geneva. “They are asking to see résumés of our staff, they are asking if they are qualified to go,” Dr. Frieden said he complained. He had been told by a high-level W.H.O. official that the regional staff in Africa wanted to prove they could handle this one without help, he said.

“People shouldn’t die because someone’s embarrassed that they can’t do it themselves,” Dr. Frieden said. Dr. Fukuda fixed the problem.

Similarly, Dr. Pierre Formenty, the W.H.O.'s top Ebola authority, said that when he arrived in April, he was passed over as team coordinator in favor of a W.H.O. official in the Guinea office who had never been involved in an Ebola outbreak.

“Obviously,” said Dr. Formenty, 54, who had worked on 17 outbreaks, it was “only because I was coming from Geneva.”

Which part of the W.H.O. was in charge? “It was not clear to us,” Dr. Frieden said in an interview.

The virus quickly jumped Guinea’s Forest Region, and by the end of March, cases had been confirmed in densely populated Conakry, and across the border in northwest Liberia.

Along with Dr. Rollin, the seen-it-all veterans parachuted into Conakry, joining forces with in-country staff from Unicef, the Red Cross and other aid groups. The virus hunters revived the camaraderie of past campaigns with bear hugs in the lobby of the Palm Camayenne Hotel, while casting wary eyes at potential competitors for groundbreaking research.

The affable Dr. Rollin, born in colonial Morocco to French parents (he is white but refers to himself impishly as an African-American), was well-suited for deployment to French-speaking Guinea. He developed an instant rapport with the country’s president, Alpha Condé, and convinced him it would be counterproductive to close borders and schools, a decision later reversed.

He stood repeatedly before gatherings of government officials and health workers, his hair wispy white, a slight paunch overhanging his belt, and explained the science of Ebola. He was known for his ability to demystify the disease for any audience, and his recorded remarks were converted into public-service announcements.

As the team leader, he set his four colleagues about the tasks of debugging new software to track the virus and establishing a process to trace anyone who had been exposed. After long and wearying days, they typically continued over dinners in the hotel restaurant with their laptops open next to their meals.

As the coordinating agency, the W.H.O. took a decidedly anti-alarmist approach. In March, the organization’s offices placed 38 people in Guinea: epidemiologists, logisticians, data managers and others, most from the Africa region. By comparison, there are 338 W.H.O. personnel in West Africa now.

On March 23, the day the outbreak was announced, the W.H.O. spokesman Gregory Härtl took to Twitter from Geneva to stress that “there has never been an #Ebola outbreak larger than a couple of hundred cases.” He doubled down two days later when the agency classified the outbreak a Level 2 emergency out of three. “Ebola has always remained a very localised event,” he posted.

Not everyone saw it that way. Doctors Without Borders, which received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999 for its humanitarian work, had a longstanding malaria project in Guéckédou in the Forest Region. Within 10 days of the initial diagnosis, it had opened an Ebola isolation ward there, as well as in the nearby town of Macenta and in a hospital in Conakry. The private charity dispatched 60 health care workers and flew in 40 tons of equipment.

“We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,” Mariano Lugli, the coordinator of the group’s Conakry clinic, said in a March 31 news release.

A three-day Twitter war ensued.

“No need to overblow something which is already bad enough,” Mr. Härtl wrote.

#Ebola[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash] in Guinea: "This is the most deadly strain of Ebola virus. It kills 9 out of 10 patients." http://t.co/a9DUuuBsQi[http://t.co/a9DUuuBsQi] — MSF International (@MSF) March 31, 2014[https://twitter.com/MSF/status/450636841977651200]

“It kills 9 out of 10 patients,” Doctors Without Borders responded.

.@MSF[https://twitter.com/MSF] Don't exaggerate. #Ebola[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash] can kill up to 90% of those infected and in this particular outbreak fatality rate is less than 67%. #Ebola[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash] — Gregory Härtl (@HaertlG) April 1, 2014[https://twitter.com/HaertlG/status/451023126185672704]

“Don’t exaggerate,” Mr. Härtl countered.

Guinea: Failure to Track

Closer to the action, some early responders suspected that subduing the outbreak would be complicated. There were so few beds and so little staff to treat or isolate Ebola patients that doctors found themselves stepping over the dying and the dead in hospital corridors.

What alarmed Dr. Kamalini Kalahe-Lokuge, a Doctors Without Borders epidemiologist working in Conakry, was that the patients were coming from all across the city, many from unrelated chains of viral transmission. That meant they had probably infected others who had not been found. In April in the staff tent at Donka Hospital, she unfolded a giant city map she had dotted with red, blue and green ink to track cases.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she told her colleagues. “This is going to blow up.”

Guinea’s government worked to paint a rosier picture. In morning meetings in April, Dr. Aboubacar Sidiki Diakité, the health official in charge of the early response, spoke about the need for “positive communication” so as not to scare away airlines and mining companies, according to several people present.

Dr. Diakité insisted that only test-confirmed cases — a third to half of all known potential cases at that point — be reported to the local news media, said Dr. Formenty of the W.H.O. and Dr. Rollin of the C.D.C.

Underreporting of all kinds hampered the crucial process of locating those with possible exposure, isolating them if needed and monitoring them daily. When the C.D.C. team began working in Conakry on April 2, they found a single pair of W.H.O. trackers ping-ponging across town, managing to see fewer than half of the 71 registered contacts, said Andrea McCollum, an epidemiologist on Dr. Rollin’s crew. When she arrived in the Forest Region two weeks later, only 67 of 390 contacts were being seen, she said.

There had been little effort to recruit volunteers, and there were problems making even nominal payments of $4.25 a day to contact tracers. “It’s really not clear to me why more wasn’t being done,” Dr. McCollum said.

Cross-border cooperation was sporadic. In the early weeks, the W.H.O. hosted daily teleconferences involving officials from West Africa. But it did not set up a regional coordinating center in Guinea until July, and two earlier meetings in border towns were devoted to generic updates rather than an exchange of data on chains of transmission, according to several people present. Many officials met their counterparts from neighboring countries for the first time and exchanged phone numbers.

“In French, we call it ‘un grand mess,'” said Michel Van Herp, an Ebola expert with Doctors Without Borders who was in Guinea.

Denial and stigma had always posed obstacles to containing Ebola outbreaks. But the early responders in West Africa arrived with little understanding of the long-exploited region’s deeply rooted suspicions of outsiders and government.

From the 16th century to the 19th, its inhabitants were captured by slave raiders and shipped to Europe and the Americas. During the era when Guinea was a French colony, the people of the Forest Region were forced to build roads and tap rubber, up to the 1940s. After independence, Guinea’s authoritarian ruler sought to suppress their indigenous culture and ancestral beliefs, while conscripting much of their harvests of rice, coffee and palm oil.

It did not take long for resistance in the villages to grow aggressive. Relief workers confronted accusations that they had brought Ebola to Guinea themselves. They heard assertions that the disease was a curse, or a scheme to sell body parts.

On April 4 in Macenta, a seething crowd chased a surveillance team from a neighborhood and sacked the Doctors Without Borders treatment center, forcing it to close for a week.

Around the same time, Dr. Fowler of the W.H.O. and an Argentine colleague from Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Fernanda Méndez Baggi, set out to find a woman in an impoverished neighborhood in Conakry. The woman’s husband and another wife of his had died of Ebola at Donka Hospital, and health workers had been tipped that she was symptomatic. They hoped to bring her in for treatment.

It was midafternoon when the doctors left in a Toyota Pathfinder. By the time they crawled through Conakry’s traffic, found the unmarked house and negotiated their way in with family members, the light was vanishing. They were conscious of the time because they did not want to risk a precarious return trip in the dark with a sick patient. They found the woman near sundown on a mat on the floor, too weak to move or to consent to hospitalization.

As Dr. Méndez Baggi assessed her by flashlight, dozens of family members and neighbors began agitating outside. Word had spread that patients who went to Ebola treatment centers rarely came back. “I won’t let her go,” someone yelled. The shouts grew louder and more menacing.

“Fernanda, time to go,” Dr. Fowler said.

She looked at him, shocked that he would consider leaving the patient and exposing even more people.

“Fernanda, listen.”

She stopped for a second, then nodded. After counseling the woman’s family, they returned empty-handed to the hospital, where another W.H.O. clinician, Dr. Tom Fletcher, chided Dr. Fowler. “Your job is to go out and get this patient,” he said, “and we failed.”

But the next day, Dr. Fletcher also tried and was rebuffed by an agitated crowd. Finally, days later, the family dropped the woman at the treatment center, near death. Remarkably, with intensive treatment, she recovered. But dozens of additional people had been exposed by the delay.

“She had an enormous amount of contacts, made worse by the number of days that she remained very symptomatic,” Dr. Fowler said. “It took weeks and weeks to sort through.”

The challenges of caring for such patients could be hard to anticipate for doctors like Tim Jagatic, a 33-year-old family practitioner from Canada who had enlisted with Doctors Without Borders. He arrived at Donka on March 29 with some training in infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but no experience with Ebola.

He found it difficult to wear an impermeable protective suit in tropical heat for even the 45- to 60-minute maximum stretches recommended by Doctors Without Borders. Some of the sick were dying in narrow toilet stalls, making it a challenge to remove the bodies safely. He learned from his own exposure to a nurse who tested positive with only a low-grade fever that prevailing guidelines for symptoms were not absolute.

As health workers fell sick, it became frighteningly clear that rigorous adherence to precautions might not be enough.

“No place is safe,” he realized. “I was like, ‘Wait a minute, these were not the rules we agreed to.'”

Once, while moving a patient in a bed, Dr. Jagatic felt his mask filling with condensation, could not catch his breath and collapsed to his knees. He knew he needed to get out, and fast, but he first had to be sprayed down with chlorine and then had to meticulously remove his gear. “Don’t cut corners,” he coached himself, before finally lifting the mask and taking three gulping breaths.

By mid-April, the C.D.C. and other groups had enlisted hundreds of community volunteers for contact tracing. While falling well short of 100 percent, the coverage began to improve. Resistance in some communities [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/world/africa/fear-of-ebola-opens-wary-villages-to-outsiders-in-guinea.html]gradually softened as the death toll rose.

Based on the patterns of previous outbreaks, it seemed to make sense that the number of newly reported cases was falling. While 29 new confirmed and suspected infections had been recorded in a three-day stretch in mid-April, there were only five from May 3 to May 7.

President Condé traveled to Geneva on April 30 for consultations with the W.H.O., and sounded more confident than cautious. “For the moment,” he told reporters, “the situation is well in hand. And we touch wood that there won’t be any more cases.”

Liberia: Struggle to Educate the Public

Even before Ebola was officially identified, the virus traveled to Liberia by motorbike along a rough dirt road where children at play rolled bicycle wheels with sticks. It arrived in mid-March when Tewa Joseph picked up her ailing sister, Finda Tamba, in Guinea and took her to Liberia’s Foya-Borma Hospital.

The physician who examined her, Dr. Raphael Shamavu, was from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and thought he recognized her symptoms as those of a virus that had ravaged remote pockets of his country, hospital workers said. Others on staff did not know what Ebola was until somebody looked it up online.

Ms. Tamba died at the hospital, a modest complex of open pavilions under corrugated roofs, on March 20, according to the assistant medical director, Philip Azumah. Soon others, including her sister Ms. Joseph, became sick.

When Ms. Joseph showed up at the hospital on March 26 after Ebola had been identified in neighboring Guinea, Mr. Azumah said he could not admit her because he had no protective clothing for his frightened staff. He sent her home with medications for fever, and checked on her daily. Several days later, he learned that she had taken a taxi some 12 hours into Monrovia, a capital city of nearly one million people, and scrambled to find her.

It fell to the Liberian health ministry, Unicef and nongovernmental organizations to devise public-education campaigns that would warn a diverse population about Ebola. Fewer than half of adults were literate, according to the World Bank.

Ill-conceived early efforts might have helped drive the outbreak into the shadows. Many fliers, posters and radio advertisements inadvertently reinforced a hopeless message that Ebola had no cure, deepening people’s fears that they would be cut off from dying relatives if they took them to health centers.

“It spreads quickly and kills!” read a handout with a message from the United Nations Mission in Liberia and the Ministry of Health. It was distributed by blue-shirted workers from Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid organization, whose leaders said they tried for weeks to persuade health ministry officials to revise their messages.

One poster warned that “most of the people who catch it will die.” Many early posters used English that was more technical than the colloquial words used in the affected areas.

A flier focused disproportionately on avoiding the wild animals that are thought to be original carriers of Ebola, diluting messages about preventing human-to-human transmission. “Do not play with Monkeys and Baboons,” it said. “Do not eat bush meat. Do not eat plums eaten by bats.”

Radio advertisements and jingles produced for the national response urged family members to speed the sick to hospitals “quick-quick,” contrary to a safer protocol of calling trained ambulance teams.

Even well-crafted messages often found an unreceptive audience. “People were accustomed to a certain way of life,” Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per], said in an interview in a palava hut on the grounds of the presidential mansion. “The messages about don’t touch the dead, wash your hands, if somebody is sick, leave them — these were all strange things, completely contrary to our tradition and culture.”

After rounds of meetings, the ad campaigns were eventually altered, removing references to bush meat and advising those with symptoms to stay put and call a health worker. “You can survive Ebola!” one of the new posters declared.

The country dug in for a long fight. But unlike in Guinea, where patients still trickled in to treatment centers, reports of new infections dried up quickly in Liberia. The last of 12 cases had been isolated by April 9, only 10 days after discovery of the first. By the end of the month, Liberia had made it through 21 days, the virus’s maximum incubation period. If another 21 passed, the outbreak would officially be considered defeated.

Watching enviously from Guinea, Dr. Rollin figured the response in Liberia, where the C.D.C. had placed only two people, had been “either good or very lucky.”

On May 6, Samaritan’s Purse ended the operation of its disaster response team in Liberia. It had moved six beds for Ebola patients into the chapel of the Monrovia hospital it supported, but they had never been filled.

“We felt that things were contained,” said Kendell Kauffeldt, the group’s Liberia director.

By mid-May, Doctors Without Borders had withdrawn its staff and redeployed to Guinea. Things looked so upbeat two weeks later that its workers decontaminated the treatment center in Conakry and the group made plans, literally, to fold up tents. “We can only congratulate ourselves collectively,” Marc Poncin, the group’s emergency director in Guinea, wrote to Dr. Diakité, in the health ministry.

After a meeting in mid-May, the C.D.C.'s David Blaney mentioned to Dr. Bernice Dahn, the Liberian health ministry’s response coordinator, that he and a colleague were about to cycle out. She told him she hoped they would be replaced.

The agency “couldn’t justify it,” he reported back, “because it really isn’t an active outbreak anymore.” He said the team in neighboring Guinea would be available in case of emergency, but by May 28 the C.D.C. had pulled out of there as well.

The W.H.O., which sent 59 people to Liberia and Guinea in April, posted only 29 in May. One of its periodic reports, on May 18, anticipated that just a few days later, on May 22, the 42-day mark would pass and the outbreak in Liberia “could be declared over.”

The group’s leaders turned their attention to the annual World Health Assembly, which opened on May 19 in Geneva, where Dr. Chan gave a speech and mentioned Ebola just once in passing.

When the 22nd arrived, Dr. Dahn marked the milestone at the morning meeting at the health ministry, unfurling her words slowly and methodically. No one dared declare “mission accomplished,” not with active cases in Guinea, but victory was in the air.

“We were all happy,” Dr. Dahn said. “We thought it was something we could manage. We were not actually expecting Ebola to come back and overwhelm us.”

Sierra Leone: Missed Chances

While Liberia battled Ebola, the government of Sierra Leone did not even realize it had an outbreak.

On March 14, a team of six scientists and two drivers had set out from Guinea’s capital with orders to document the mysterious fever that had killed eight people along the border. The team, which included epidemiologists and a lab specialist, had been drafted by the W.H.O.'s Guinea office and Guinea’s Ministry of Health to take blood samples and collect case histories.

They traveled across the Forest Region, interviewing health officials and following leads to the families of the dead. People told recurring stories of relatives dying months earlier with similar symptoms, including little Emile, according to the 17-page report they produced.

On the fifth day of the mission, the team spoke with villagers near Guéckédou and learned of a woman named Sia Wanda Koniono, 37, who had died March 3 after suffering from fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. Ms. Koniono, the investigators noted in their report, lived not in Guinea but in a nearby village in Sierra Leone. Now another young woman in Sierra Leone was fighting similar symptoms, the villagers said. It was Ms. Koniono’s daughter.

While the investigators dutifully recorded these suspected cases along with dozens of others in Guinea, the information never reached the government team doing surveillance across the border in Sierra Leone, three team members and other health officials said in interviews. Instead, the virus spread silently, fueling Sierra Leone’s outbreak and later rekindling Liberia’s.

Dr. Emmanuel Heleze, an epidemiologist on the Guinea team who helped write its report, said he gave a presentation that alerted the W.H.O. and the health ministry in Guinea to the possibility of crossover to Sierra Leone, but he could not say why the cases were not pursued. Guinea’s director of disease control, Dr. Sakoba Keita, said he received the report but did not read it, and relied on the W.H.O. for information sharing. “They were the liaison between us, Sierra Leone and Liberia because of the language barriers,” he said.

The W.H.O.'s Guinea representative at the time, Dr. René Zitsamelé-Coddy, declined to comment. His Sierra Leone counterpart, Dr. Jacob Mufunda, and Sierra Leone’s director of disease prevention and control, Dr. Amara Jambai, said they did not recall receiving information about Ms. Koniono and her daughter. “We would have followed up,” Dr. Jambai said.

Until late May, the W.H.O. continued to report that there were no confirmed infections in Sierra Leone and acknowledged that it did not station anyone on the Sierra Leone side of the border until June 15, after more than 50 cases had appeared in a few days’ time.

In the interim, the health officers of Sierra Leone’s Kailahun district, with its $10,500 budget for epidemic response, were left to prepare for Ebola’s arrival along with scientists at a single laboratory hours away. They staged awareness campaigns with support from aid groups and received occasional visits from W.H.O. trainers, but they could do little to prepare hospitals and clinics, where protective gear was sparse.

Although health officials would never piece together the links, Ms. Koniono’s contacts in her village and others nearby began to fall ill and die, relatives and survivors said in interviews. One of her in-laws, Kumba Yaya, died in a hospital in Sierra Leone on March 19, according to her husband, Fayia Yaya Thomas.

Ms. Yaya was visited throughout her illness by a close friend, Finda Nyuma. It seemed everyone in the area knew Ms. Nyuma, a tall, slender grandmother who was a traditional healer of some repute. She plucked herbs from the forest, drying and pulverizing them into curative powders or mashing them into juices to soothe the stomach.

The people in the village of Kpondu believed she could speak for the dead, and came to her with messages for lost loved ones. They often found her beneath a bamboo palm, reading the future by throwing “jagay,” small white cowrie shells.

Ms. Nyuma became ill at the end of March — vomiting, headache[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/headache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], diarrhea — and retreated to the bedroom of her mud brick house, where her sisters, grandchildren and neighbors gathered around her bed. She died around April 8, according to her half sister, Finda Focko, and James Keppeh, a community health worker.

Now it would be up to Ms. Nyuma’s descendants and friends to ensure that her path to the afterlife was a peaceful one, that she would become an ancestor who, in exchange for tribute and respect, might intervene with the spirits on their behalf.

The mourners came to her room the night she died. It was typical to pull back the covers and touch the body to say farewell, according to friends, relatives and neighbors who were present. A woman removed the many rings from Ms. Nyuma’s fingers that were thought to impart powers. The next morning, four friends washed her body using soap and a towel.

Later, she would be washed again by four women from her family, according to local Muslim tradition. They removed her clothing. A cousin tied her hair tightly. Cupping tepid water in their hands, they doused her mouth, and nose and ears, then her feet, and bound her in a white cotton shroud. With hundreds of mourners watching, a group of men carried her body 100 yards into the bush to a freshly dug grave. Relatives then stayed several days in Ms. Nyuma’s contaminated room.

Ms. Nyuma’s husband died soon after, as did a grandson, several women who had prepared her body and others exposed to them. The W.H.O. estimates that at least 20 percent of the Ebola deaths in West Africa have stemmed from unsafe burial practices. The percentage was probably much higher in the spring.

Among the villagers, the cause of Ms. Nyuma’s illness was assumed to be supernatural, more payback than pandemic. When Mohamed Lamin, a health surveillance officer, arrived in late May after the unexplained deaths, they told him that she and her husband died because he had disregarded her warning to never open a blue painted trunk that contained her belongings. When he did, they said, he was confronted by a large snake.

Mr. Lamin said he listened to the story and tried to set the villagers straight. “The snake you are talking about is Ebola,” he told them.

Denial bred transmission. A relative who washed Ms. Nyuma’s body fell ill and died, passing the sickness to her mother, who then infected her daughter-in-law, Mamie Lebbie, a mother of two young children, according to Ms. Lebbie and other relatives.

Sulaiman Kanneh Saidu, who oversaw the small health center in the town of Koindu where Ms. Lebbie sought care, initially suspected cholera, but he sent an alert to a district surveillance team. On May 24, Ms. Lebbie’s blood was drawn and a surveillance officer accompanied the sample over bad roads in the rain to the country’s only laboratory equipped for Ebola testing, in Kenema. She was positive and became Sierra Leone’s first confirmed Ebola case, lab professionals involved in the testing said.

Using genomic sequencing, scientists later found connections[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/345/6202/1369.full] among a dozen Ebola patients, all women, who were thought to have been at the funeral, according to their study, published in August in the journal Science.

However the scientists were baffled to discover two slightly different versions of the virus circulating among the women. “It never made sense to us,” said Dr. Pardis Sabeti, one of the study’s authors.

The researchers did not know that villagers in Sierra Leone had already been falling sick and dying for more than two months before the women were tested. It has been widely reported that Ms. Nyuma’s death had set off the country’s outbreak, though hers was probably only one link in multiple chains. “That is fascinating, and it helps explain missing pieces from our sequence analysis,” Dr. Sabeti said.

Eventually, the hidden outbreak in Sierra Leone revived the epidemic in Liberia. In late May, Harrison Sakilla, the principal of a mission school in a Liberia village near the border, walked two hours on a dirt path into Sierra Leone to visit his ailing mother in Kpondu, the same village where the healer died. He did not have to show a passport, he said. It was what people called a “common border.”

Finding his mother depleted by diarrhea and vomiting, he set off for a medicine store. He walked for a mile along a path bordered by tall elephant grass, crossed a stream on a log and hopped a canoe across the Makona River into Guinea. He had touched foot in three countries in a matter of hours. After treating his mother for three days, and seeing that she was close to death, he walked to Liberia to buy the woven mats she would be wrapped in for burial, then returned.

After the funeral, he spent three more days visiting with family and other mourners. On the fourth day, as he walked back to Liberia, his body felt hot and his joints weak. He stopped and had diarrhea in the bushes. A walk that normally took two hours lasted four.

Mr. Sakilla survived Ebola to share his account. But his mother’s sickness led to the deaths of family members in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Simultaneously, another line of transmission in the Gbembo family, which was also linked to Ms. Koniono, the suspected case in Sierra Leone that was missed months earlier, crept across Liberia’s borders and reached a Monrovia slum, according to family members and documentation from Doctors Without Borders. After an absence of two months, and the departure of experts from the W.H.O., the C.D.C., and Doctors Without Borders, Ebola was back.

An Emergency ‘of International Concern’

The bad news then came like a fusillade. By June 21, Doctors Without Borders had pronounced the epidemic “out of control.”

Yet the W.H.O. waited until Aug. 8 to declare the epidemic “a public health emergency of international concern,” its top threat level. That was two weeks after two American aid workers were infected in Liberia and a man sick with Ebola flew from Liberia to Nigeria. Soon after, President Sirleaf of Liberia took temporary charge of her country’s response; President Condé of Guinea found a replacement for Dr. Diakité.

By September, the W.H.O.'s Geneva leadership and the United Nations had asserted control over the response. At Dr. Chan’s instigation, the country representatives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were reassigned in favor of experienced crisis specialists.

Today, even as infection rates are starting to decline in some areas, there can be more reports of new cases in just two days than were recorded in the first two months of the outbreak.

The governments and organizations that led the response now appear chastened. Many readily acknowledge that they did not devote enough people or resources to the early fight, and that they prematurely lowered their guard.

“Sure, in hindsight, I wish we’d had more staff on the ground,” said Dr. Frieden of the C.D.C., which has since devoted more resources to this outbreak than to any other outbreak of any kind in its history. “I don’t think any of our organizations would look back and say we did everything right.”

Even as they continue to battle Ebola across West Africa, the virus hunters find themselves soul-searching about how many lives might have been saved had there been a bigger, more effective initial response. If the epidemic in West Africa has demonstrated anything, it is that a foe as remorseless as Ebola must be met with a killer instinct that is just as unrelenting.

“There is no room for optimism as long as you are dealing with an Ebola virus,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who now leads the W.H.O. response. “It’s not about low numbers. It’s about zero. We have got to get to zero.”

Dr. Rollin of the C.D.C. accepts a share of responsibility. He and other leaders should have recognized how distinct West African culture was, he said. He should have better appreciated how lax the tracing had been, and that the virus’s disappearance from view did not mean that it was gone.

But he also argues that scientists can act only on the facts as they know them, and that much of what happened in West Africa could not have been foreseen, at least not in the fog of an emerging crisis.

“It was an unprecedented outbreak; it never happened before,” he said. “There were a lot of things we didn’t know at that time. No one could have imagined that it would be what we have now.”

As the death counts rose, the C.D.C. sent Dr. Rollin back to Guinea in mid-June. The beds that sat empty in May were now filling. The hopeful mood of a month before had given way to defeat. As he looked at the rampaging caseloads across the border in Liberia and Sierra Leone, he could tell those countries were too overwhelmed to track the chain of transmission.

“They were just counting the dead,” he said.

Before year’s end, Dr. Rollin would be dispatched to Liberia, by then flooded with Ebola cases; to Dallas, where a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, was deathly ill with the virus; to New York, where an American, Dr. Craig Spencer, developed symptoms after returning from Guinea; and to Mali, which reported its first cases this fall.

It would be awhile before he would get a full night’s sleep.

A woman who had been working in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] was being treated Monday for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in a Glasgow hospital. The woman, identified only as a health care worker for Britain’s National Health Service, arrived in Glasgow on Sunday night via Casablanca, Morocco, and Heathrow Airport in London, the Scottish government said. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the woman was believed to have had contact with only one person in Glasgow. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the woman would be transferred soon to a specialist unit in London. Britain’s only previous case in the current outbreak was William Pooley, a nurse who also contracted the disease in Sierra Leone. He survived.

The development came as 49 new cases emerged in Liberia, the country’s assistant health minister, Tolbert Nyenswah, said. The cases, in western Grand Cape Mount County, represented a setback after recent improvements.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Bodies and debris found.

The authorities in Indonesia[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/asia/airasia-8501-jet-missing-indonesia.html] say they have found bodies and debris in the colors of the missing AirAsia jet and objects resembling luggage and life vests about six miles off the southeast coast of Borneo.

• Russian opposition leader convicted.

Aleksei A. Navalny, one of the opposition leaders the Kremlin fears the most, was found guilty of fraud charges today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-convicted.html]. He is calling for protests.

He received a three-and-half year suspended sentence, which suggested that the authorities were moving to sideline him but not turn him into a political martyr.

• Ebola’s reach.

A female health care worker who was found to have Ebola after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone arrived today at a treatment center[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/europe/ebola-virus-britain.html] in London. It is Britain’s second confirmed case; two others are being tested.

And a new study says that economic policies favoring debt repayment over social spending contributed to the health crisis in West Africa[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/30/world/africa/ap-af-ebola-imf.html]. The death toll from Ebola is now over 7,800.

• Another side of politics.

Michael G. Grimm, the Republican Party’s lone congressional representative[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/nyregion/michael-grimm-in-a-reversal-will-resign-from-congress.html] in New York City, is resigning, two weeks after he pleaded guilty to tax evasion.

At the same time, the federal authorities are investigating[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/nyregion/us-said-to-investigate-new-york-assembly-speaker-over-pay-from-law-firm.html] payments made by a law firm to New York’s Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.

And Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/us/politics/louisiana-congressman-steve-scalise-acknowledges-addressing-racist-group-in-2002.html] in the House, is dealing today with the revelation that he addressed a group of white supremacists and neo-Nazis in 2002.

• A thaw between mayor and N.Y.P.D.?

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York is to meet police union representatives today, days after scores of police officers turned their backs[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/de-blasio-delivers-quiet-eulogy-to-crowd-of-unfriendly-faces-and-many-backs.html] on him while he spoke at a patrolman’s funeral.

• Deadly weather.

Malaysia’s worst flooding in a decade[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/12/30/world/asia/30reuters-malaysia-floods.html] has caused 250,000 residents to evacuate, officials said today, and the death toll there rose to 21. Fifteen people died in neighboring southern Thailand.

Flash floods and landslides set off by a tropical storm left at least 29 people dead and 10 missing in the Philippines[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/30/world/asia/ap-as-philippines-storm.html].

In the U.S., a rare snowstorm is forecast to hit Las Vegas and the Mojave Desert[http://www.accuweather.com.proxy.bc.edu/en/weather-news/cold-snow-to-invade-the-desert/39714926#ixzz3NNK6LYtq] starting tonight and to leave up to three inches of snow.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stock futures show slight declines. European indexes are lower, and Asia ended down sharply.

• The Nikkei 225 index ended its last trading day of 2014 off 1.6 percent, leaving the Japanese market’s gain for the year at 7.1 percent, the most in seven years.

• The latest figures on U.S. home prices are due from Standard & Poor’s today. The Case-Shiller index of 20 cities last showed a 4.9 percent annual increase.

• Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in Manhattan and now runs 63 restaurants worldwide, plans to sell shares to the public[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/shake-shack-files-to-go-public/] under the ticker symbol SHAK.

• Vermont’s only nuclear plant shut down for good[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/business/vermonts-only-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-42-years.html] after 42 years, for economic reasons. The plant will sit for decades while its radioactive components cool; dismantling most likely won’t occur until the 2040s.

BACK STORY

If the world of 2014 seems more war-torn, that’s because it is.

Yet there is hope for a happier new year.

The Uppsala Conflict Data Program[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/], which tracks armed conflict, counts four new wars (those claiming more than 1,000 lives) this year: Gaza, Nigeria, South Sudan and Ukraine.

They join continuing wars in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, for a total of 11.

Even so, some of the 22 smaller armed conflicts on Uppsala’s list[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/database/] have dropped off, the program’s director, Peter Wallensteen, said.

International Crisis Group, a Brussels group that follows 70 hot spots[http://crisisgroup.be/maps/crisiswatch/index.html], sees a similar pattern: more bad news than good this year.

But peace on earth looks much more achievable when you take the long view. Historically, we are less violent and getting ever more peaceful.

Steven Pinker, an author and Harvard professor, conceded that war deaths most likely increased this year because of Syria.

Yet the overall level “is still far below[http://stevenpinker.com/has-decline-violence-reversed-better-angels-our-nature-was-written] those of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, when the world was a far more dangerous place.”

“The world,” he wrote in Slate this month[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.single.html], “is not falling apart.”

Chris Chivers documented that there were indeed chemical weapons in Iraq — but they were old and made largely with the help of Saddam Hussein’s former Western backers. And that the United States military not only chose to hide it but also failed to adequately treat or acknowledge soldiers injured by the munitions.

The piece in The Times in 2014 that had the biggest effect on me was Alissa Rubin’s recollection of the helicopter crash over Iraq that severely injured her and killed the pilot.

Ebola epidemic in Africa, which has caused 7,800 deaths since it began, appeared to be drawing to close in spring of 2014 and may have been brought to halt then, were it not for series of response missteps and complicating factors; doctors and experts failed to adequately track disease and to appreciate that 2014 outbreak would differ from previous strains in catastrophic ways; in addition, lack of infrastructure and resources, local distrust of government and movement of tribal people across borders contributed to disease's spread.

N.Y. / Region
Allies of Christie and Cuomo Defend Veto of Port Authority Overhaul

When the governors of New York and New Jersey rejected legislation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/nyregion/cuomo-and-christie-announce-they-will-veto-bill-to-overhaul-port-authority.html] over the weekend intended to overhaul operations at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/port_authority_of_new_york_and_new_jersey/index.html?inline=nyt-org], their opponents lamented what they characterized as the survival of the status quo.

For decades, the authority has been a repository of patronage and political interference, exploited by leaders on both sides of the Hudson River. The Cuomo and Christie administrations, critics argued, saw little incentive in effecting sweeping change.

Yet to both allies and opponents of the two state leaders, the public rationale for the veto struck a separate, if familiar, chord: Our ideas, the men suggested to legislators in both states, are better than yours.

In defying the unanimous votes of both of their Legislatures, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New York, a Democrat, and Gov. Chris Christie[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of New Jersey, a Republican, instead embraced the findings of a special panel they had formed in May.

“The governance structure and other accountability measures recommended by the special panel will do a better job of improving accountability,” Mr. Cuomo wrote in an undated letter to the New York State Assembly.

“The changes proposed in the bill necessarily lack the insights and extensive analysis contained in the special panel’s report,” Mr. Christie added, in a Dec. 26 letter to the New Jersey State Senate, “resulting in ideas that are too narrow, and lacking in the changes needed for reform.”

The maneuver was another entry in the bipartisan allegiance between two powerful, pugnacious governors. In recent months, the governors have teamed up to outline regional security concerns wrought by the rise of the Islamic State and, to the consternation of local and federal officials, announce a mandatory quarantine policy after an Ebola case was identified in New York City in October.

The prospect of Port Authority reform, though, has presented a more delicate challenge. The George Washington Bridge lane-closing affair last year, widely considered a nadir for the authority, threatened the political fortunes of Mr. Christie and prompted more urgent calls for change. Prosecutors continue to investigate the politically motivated lane closings.

On Monday, with legislators and government watchdog groups still smarting over the veto[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/nyregion/despite-veto-sponsors-of-port-authority-bill-continue-push-for-reform.html], people close to the governors suggested their own recommendations were more consequential than opponents had allowed. Officials also said that the lawmakers’ remedies were limited in scope and, in some cases, mere repetitions of existing practice at the authority.

The governors’ proposals include the adoption of a single chief executive, to replace the current leadership team of executive director (chosen by the New York governor) and deputy executive director (chosen by the New Jersey governor); a restructuring of the board; and the creation of a “chief ethics and compliance officer.”

The Port Authority’s chairman, John J. Degnan, who was selected by Mr. Christie this year and who served on the panel, said it was “worthy of some note” that the governors had “surrendered some of their political involvement.”

Critics have long questioned the current leadership structure, arguing that it fostered rivalries between the states and contributed to dubious spending on regional projects that strayed from the agency’s core transportation functions.

Mr. Degnan noted that the panel recommended redirecting $600 million in unallocated “regional development” funds to address transportation needs.

While Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie did express support for a bill that would apply freedom of information laws to the authority, pending some minor changes, legislators said that the rejected proposals were far more expansive than the governors’.

“The panel’s recommendations don’t deal with whistle-blower protections; they do not deal with extending oversight to the Legislature,” said State Senator Robert M. Gordon, a Bergen County Democrat who sponsored the bill.

“A cynical person,” he added, “would call the approach simply decorative.”

Transportation advocates have been particularly bemused by two sections of the special panel’s report: a recommendation to eliminate overnight service on PATH trains and the suggestion that the region focus on rail capacity across the Hudson River.

In a controversial decision in 2010, Mr. Christie canceled a new Hudson River rail tunnel[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/nyregion/08tunnel.html], diverting money to pay for extensive bridge and road repair projects in New Jersey and, critics charged, enabling him to avoid raising the state’s gasoline tax[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/nyregion/report-disputes-christies-reason-for-halting-tunnel-project-in-2010.html].

“Without irony,” read a headline on Capital New York[http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/12/8559242/without-irony-christie-embraces-cross-hudson-capacity] on Monday, “Christie embraces cross-Hudson capacity.”

Ebola Patient Is Moved to London, and 2 Others Are Tested in Britain

LONDON — A health worker who returned from West Africa and was found to have Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] when she arrived home in Scotland was transferred on Tuesday to Britain’s designated treatment center for the disease in London.

The authorities also reported that two more people were being tested for the virus.

The sudden flurry of episodes involving travelers from countries at the epicenter of the Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] raised questions about screening procedures at British airports, where passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are supposed to be scrutinized for symptoms of Ebola, such as high temperatures.

The patient in the confirmed case in Scotland was identified in British news reports as Pauline Cafferkey. She had returned to Glasgow on Sunday after working since November with the charity Save the Children in Sierra Leone.

The British authorities are trying to contact people who were on the same flights as Ms. Cafferkey via Casablanca, Morocco, and Heathrow Airport near London.

Ms. Cafferkey was flown back to London on Tuesday aboard a plane equipped with a quarantine tent. The health authorities said she would be treated at the Royal Free Hospital in North London, where William Pooley[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/world/africa/liberian-doctor-treated-with-an-experimental-drug-dies-from-ebola.html], Britain’s first known Ebola patient, was treated and recovered after contracting the disease in Sierra Leone.

Ms. Cafferke, is the first person known to have learned she had Ebola while in Britain. The health authorities described her condition on Tuesday as stable. She had been isolated in an infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] unit at Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow after she reported feeling unwell on Monday.

Ms. Cafferkey had been a member of a team of 30 health professionals who traveled as volunteers to Sierra Leone last month. “For me it was kind of a natural thing, I couldn’t think of any reason why not to go, " she said in a BBC Radio interview[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30632629?ocid=socialflow_twitter] before she left.

Dr. Martin Deahl, a member of the group that returned with her over the weekend, told Sky News that he had been sitting next to Ms. Cafferkey for part of the journey home. He found the arrangements to examine the health workers at Heathrow Airport to be “disorganized.”

Dr. Deahl said precautionary measures should have been taken before Ms. Cafferkey continued to Glasgow from London.

“If there had been alternative arrangements for poor Pauline, an awful lot of people on that flight to Glasgow wouldn’t be going through the anxiety and the stress that I am sure they are going through at the moment,” he said.

“Although I should say that the risk to them is incredibly small, nevertheless they were exposed to a risk that some of us felt shouldn’t have happened.”

Britain’s health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the government was doing “absolutely everything it needs to” in order to protect public safety. But he said there would be a re-examination of the “procedures and protocols” for volunteers and British government personnel working in Sierra Leone.

Separately on Tuesday, the authorities said that two more people who were recently in West Africa were being tested for Ebola hundreds of miles apart, in Scotland and in southwest England.

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said the second patient in Scotland was a health worker who had recently returned from Africa and who had been staying at a youth hostel in the Scottish Highlands. She told the BBC that there was a “low probability” that the health worker had the disease, which has killed thousands in West Africa.

“Although this is another returning health care worker from West Africa, the patient here has had no, as far as we’re aware, direct contact with people infected with Ebola,” Ms. Sturgeon said.

“But we are operating, given the seriousness of Ebola, on a highly precautionary basis, and that’s why this patient over the course of today will be transferred for tests,” she said.

In southwest England, a patient was isolated at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro “and is currently undergoing a series of tests, one of which is for Ebola,” the health authorities said in a statement.

“We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours,” the statement said.

Business Day
Political Uncertainty in Greece Nudges Market Lower

Lingering concern about the political future of Greece pushed stock markets modestly lower on Tuesday.

Trading was slow as most investors have closed their books for 2014. It was the eighth-slowest day of the year on the New York Stock Exchange.

As been the case several times this year, investors turned their eyes to Europe.

Greek stocks stabilized after a volatile day Monday, when the country’s government was forced to call elections that could create more economic turmoil. Investors worry that the elections might be won by the left-wing opposition Syriza party, which opposes the austerity measures associated with Greece’s international financial rescue deal. The Athens stock market plunged as much as 11 percent on Monday before recovering some of those losses to close down 4 percent that day.

“An election puts all sorts of doubt on the future of the bailout agreement,” said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Markets. “Potentially markets had already priced this in, but I would still remain cautious around Greece.”

U.S. stocks opened lower and stayed down throughout the day. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 55.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,983.07. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 10.22 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.35 and the Nasdaq fell 29.47 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,777.44.

European markets also fell. France’s CAC 40 lost 1.7 percent, Germany’s DAX declined 1.2 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.3 percent. Greece’s stock market fell 0.4 percent.

At this point, most investors are done trading for the year. The market is also expected to be quiet Wednesday ahead of New Year’s Day holiday, however often the last trading day of the year does see a modest burst of trading as some investors shift their portfolios around for tax purposes.

The S.&P. 500 is up 12.6 percent for the year, or 15.4 percent including dividends. That gain is almost double what stock market strategists expected at the beginning of the year.

“There were some negative surprises along the way, including the Ebola scare and increasing social tensions around the globe,” Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, wrote in a note to investors. “However, U.S. markets were able to weather these problems.”

In other markets, the dollar fell against the euro and yen. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.20 percent Monday.

Benchmark U.S. crude rose 51 cents to settle at $54.12 a barrel in New York. On Monday, the contract plunged $1.12 to settle at $53.61. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, edged up two cents to close at $57.90 a barrel in London.

In other energy commodities, wholesale gasoline[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] was little changed at $1.454 a gallon, heating oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/heating_oil/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rose two cents to $1.869 a gallon and natural gas fell 10.5 cents to close at $3.094 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Gold rose $18.50 to $1,200.40 an ounce, silver rose 50 cents to $16.28 an ounce and copper rose three cents to $2.85 a pound.

Source of Ebola Outbreak Might Be Bats, Study Says

The toddler in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] who is thought to have been the first case in the current outbreak of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in West Africa may have caught the virus from bats in a hollow tree near his village, scientists said Tuesday.

A study[http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792], led by scientists from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin and published online by the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine, could not prove the link because the tree in Meliandou, a village of 31 houses in the Guéckédou district, burned in late March and the bats inside were immolated or flew off.

The fire took place shortly after Guineans were warned that the virus might come from bats. By then, at least 10 local people were dead[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html].

However, the scientists found enough residual DNA in the charred trunk and fecal DNA in nearby soil to identify the animals as Mops condylurus, long-tailed insect-eating bats that were previously suspected in an outbreak of the Sudan strain of Ebola virus, which is related to the Zaire strain that has infected over 20,000 West Africans.

The study is important because scientists have wondered how a boy named Emile Ouamouno, who died in December 2013 and whom various reports describe as 1 or 2 years old, could have been the index patient.

Most human outbreaks have started in adults: hunters or charcoal-burners finding sick apes or forest antelopes and butchering them for food, for example, or miners working in bat-filled caves. In one case, an outbreak is thought to have come from bats roosting in a cotton mill.

But there was no large number of deaths among chimpanzees or other animals in the Meliandou area, the scientists said.

Large fruit bats have been suspected because they are hunted for meat in Guinea, where a peppery bat soup[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/africa/guinea-government-bans-bat-soup-to-halt-ebola-outbreak.html] was popular before the outbreak.

Some scientists think that humans can contract Ebola by picking up fruit that fruit bats have contaminated with saliva or feces.

But there are no fruit bat colonies near Meliandou, the study said. Local men who hunted them during the migratory season had to walk long distances. Also, none of the initial cases in the village involved bat hunters.

The scientists captured several bat species near the village, but none had the virus or the antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to it.

Villagers said that children, including Emile, often caught and played with bats in the tree, which was about 50 yards from Emile’s house and near a path women used to fetch water.

The work was done by a team that included an anthropologist to investigate human interaction with animals, 10 ecologists to survey local wildlife and four veterinarians who netted bats, taking blood and tissue samples.

Normally, the bats are released unharmed, but Fabian Leendertz, the lead author, told the magazine Scientific American that his team had killed them. Otherwise, he said, local people would have said, “Look at those white people releasing bad bats.”

Rumors that whites and people from the capital cities had started the epidemic led to confrontations and the murders of several health care workers.

Ebola Ravages Economies in West Africa

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — On a recent sultry night, as the breeze stirred the palms and the waves gently crumbled against the shore, three women — Susan, Zenab and Tina — sat together at a beachside bar nursing bottles of warm beer.

The bar was empty. The streets outside were deserted, faint yellow light spilling out from the sheet metal shanties. No male clientele was in sight.

“It’s been slow and rough,” said Tina, who, like the others, declined to disclose her full name because of her line of work.

“Yeah,” said Susan. “It’s dead.”

Zenab stood up for a second to adjust her dress, which fit like a wet suit.

“Since Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier],” she explained, “no guys come around. What are we supposed to do now?”

The personal hospitality business may be the most obvious sector of Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s economy that has been decimated by Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. After all, the main slogan in Freetown, the capital, these days is A.B.C. — avoid body contact.

But all across the most affected nations — Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] — Ebola continues to lay waste not just to immune systems but also to balance sheets. Tourism, agriculture, road construction, arts and crafts, diesel sales, tax collections, and just about every other slice of the economy, legal or not, are significantly down, costing billions of dollars in lost business and spelling years of increased hardship for an already impoverished region.

Freetown does not have a single working traffic signal, and now legions of the unemployed and youths out of school thicken the streets while foreign tourists stay far away.

Ebola’s nasty reputation as a contagious disease that can slither across borders and make people bleed from their eyeballs has become so oversized and onerous that it has managed to dent tourism across the entire continent.

“When it comes to planning trips, many people think of Africa as one country,” said Jan Beekwilder who co-founded SafariBookings.com[http://SafariBookings.com], an online marketplace for hundreds of safari operators.

Mr. Beekwilder said safari inquiries on his site were down 25 percent since the outbreak began this year. And that includes trips to Nairobi and Cape Town, which are actually farther from the Ebola zone than London.

But the greatest, and most lasting damage, is being done right here in the Ebola zone. The latest figures from the World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/] show that more than 20,000 people have fallen sick with Ebola and 8,000 have died. Sierra Leone continues to be the hardest hit, with 30 to 60 new cases a day.

More than any loss of life or manpower, it is the extreme efforts to check the disease that are proving far more costly to the economies. Shutting schools, quarantining whole districts, sealing borders, canceling flights and banning public gatherings may have helped reduce transmission of the disease, but such measures have crippled trade. The shame of it is that Sierra Leone was growing at an impressive clip — before Ebola hit.

“A shock like this just brings a whole bunch of households back below the poverty line[http://csis.org/event/economic-impact-ebola],” said David Evans, a World Bank economist[http://blogs.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/team/david-evans]. “It’s a huge setback.”

It is not clear how quickly Liberia[https://www-cia-gov.proxy.bc.edu/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/li.html], Guinea[https://www-cia-gov.proxy.bc.edu/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gv.html] or Sierra Leone[https://www-cia-gov.proxy.bc.edu/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sl.html] would bounce back even if the virus were stopped in its tracks right now. The World Bank predicts that Sierra Leone’s economy will contract in 2015 and that West Africa will lose at least $3.8 billion in economic activity. Farming is one of the biggest concerns. In some areas of Sierra Leone, agricultural production has dropped by nearly half because so many cassava and rice farmers were ordered to stay home for mandatory quarantines.

Already 500,000 people in the region have gone hungry because of Ebola, and that number could double by March. In the last two months, the United Nations World Food Program[http://www.wfp.org/] has distributed 22 million pounds of emergency food.

“It could be potentially devastating if it continues like this,” said Peter Smerdon, a spokesman for the World Food Program.

Of course, in every war or disaster there are profiteers. Ebola is no exception. The authorities in Freetown recently announced the arrests[http://www.anticorruption.gov.sl/show_news.php?id=432] of “chlorine fraudsters,” men who were selling fake chlorine powder that looked like the stuff used to disinfect boots and hands. At the same time, security has become one of the few growth industries.

“This place is lawless,” said Mahmoud Kadi, a furniture maker, who like many others reported that crime was soaring because of the inordinate number of teenagers loitering on the streets, with the police distracted by Ebola.

“More people are building walls and hiring guards to protect their property,” he said. “These days, you just never know.”

Sara D’ Great, a comedic actor known as Sierra Leone’s Eddie Murphy, has tried to make art — and a few dollars — from this crisis. He has written, directed and starred in three low-budget Ebola “comedies,”[http://mysierraleoneonline.com/sl_portal/site/news/detail/2535] as he calls them. The first one, “Ebola Don Kam” (“Ebola’s Arrived”), sold out at local video stores in a week, at $2 a DVD. Before filming, Sara went to a hardware store and spent $300 on personal protective equipment — the head-to-toe plastic suits known as P.P.E.s.

“For some of my movies, I need reality,” Sara explained.

But he never makes much money from his films[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR1JXUjC0Ak], he said, especially now.

“Everything’s done,” he said.

At first glance, life seems unchanged in Freetown, with most shops open and the streets flowing with a steady current of commerce. From the tops of their heads, hordes of young people march by selling everything imaginable: melons, popcorn, fly swatters, Cokes, pipes, socks, T-shirts, cement mix.

But a closer look reveals the scars. On the outskirts of town stands a deserted bridge project, halted after the Chinese workers who were building it fled because of Ebola. All around are half-finished hotels and houses, rusty rebar poking out. On Lumley Beach Road, which used to be jumping, some of the bars appear like something out of Robinson Crusoe — they are abandoned, with torn-up canvas roofs and bugs scuttling across the empty, salt-stained floors.

Tina, Susan and Zenab, the three prostitutes, said they used to get plenty of business from the bar scene on the beach.

“But it’s hard to have sex if you don’t touch,” Tina said. “And even if I got a customer now, I better be careful.”

Her friends just stared at their drinks. Faint reggae rap played in the distance. The soft crush of waves could be heard just beyond that.

Tina looked pained.

“I have a son to feed,” she said. “Do you think even when it’s over, it’ll go back to normal?”

On the flight back to Atlanta, Dr. Pierre Rollin snoozed in Seat 26C in his usual imperturbable way, arms folded, head bobbing, oblivious to loudspeaker announcements and the periodic passing of the galley cart.

This routine had become part of his lore. During each viral outbreak, Dr. Rollin, the top Ebola expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, would outlast his younger colleagues in the hotel lobby, staying awake until 3 or 4 a.m. to plug new cases into a database. He managed to do this at 61 because he possessed an uncanny ability to sleep anywhere anytime, whether on the hardwood floor of a staff house in Zaire (Ebola, 1995) or in a back seat lurching down a cratered road in Madagascar (Rift Valley fever, 2008).

On this trip home from Guinea on May 7, Dr. Rollin found himself at particular peace. His five-and-a-half-week stay as the C.D.C.’s team leader in the opening days of Guinea’s effort to control Ebola had gone about as well as one could have hoped.

The number of Ebola cases reported each week had been declining steadily for a month. It had been more than 10 days since doctors had seen a new patient in Conakry, the capital, where Dr. Rollin worked alongside other early responders from the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders.

New patients had slowed to a trickle in the Forest Region of southeastern Guinea, the center of the outbreak, and there had not been a report across the border in Liberia for four weeks. Sierra Leone, although surrounded by Guinea and Liberia, had not discovered a single confirmed case.

Like the 10 Ebola crises he had handled before, in Uganda and Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, this first substantial outbreak in West Africa seemed to be burning itself out after a few months and a few hundred infections.

‘‘This is close to over,’’ Dr. Rollin told himself, a view common among the virus hunters. ‘‘That’s it for this outbreak.’’

Or so he thought. In fact, Dr. Rollin and other well-intentioned veterans of past Ebola campaigns had tragically underestimated this outbreak, overlooking clues that now seem apparent. Viewing the West Africa epidemic through the prism of nearly two dozen previous outbreaks across the continent, they failed to appreciate that the 2014 version would be unique in catastrophic ways.

After more than 20,000 cases and 7,800 deaths, it can be hard to recall that there was a moment in the spring when the longest and deadliest Ebola outbreak in history might have been stopped. But without a robust and coordinated response, an invisible epidemic was allowed to thrive alongside the one assumed to be contained.

Although conditions were ideal for the virus to go underground, some of the world’s most experienced Ebola fighters convinced themselves that the sharp decline in newly reported cases in April and May was real.

Tracing those exposed to Ebola and checking them for symptoms, the key to containing any outbreak, had been lacking in many areas. Health workers had been chased out of fearful neighborhoods. Ebola treatment centers had gained such reputations as deathtraps that even desperately ill patients devoted their waning strength to avoiding them.

With the affected countries often lacking the most basic medical infrastructure, the health care challenges proved staggering. But the most tragically missed opportunities stemmed from the poor flow of information about who was infected and whom they might have exposed.

A two-month investigation by The New York Times into this largely unexamined period discovered that the W.H.O. and the Guinean Health Ministry documented in March that some people had recently died or been sick with Ebola-like symptoms across the border in Sierra Leone. But information about two of those possible infections never reached senior health officials and the team investigating suspected cases in Sierra Leone.

As a result, it was not until late May, after more than two months of unchecked contagion, that Sierra Leone recorded its first confirmed cases. The chain of illnesses and deaths links those cases directly to the two cases that were never followed up in March. Sierra Leone has since tallied about 9,400 reported Ebola infections, more than any other country. The same missed cases are linked to Liberia’s vast second-wave outbreak, identified in late May, with almost 8,000 reported infections to date.

The leaders of the initial response agree that they did not deploy nearly enough people to the region, and that they withdrew too soon. There was managerial confusion in the W.H.O., which was already stretched by budget cuts and competing demands. Some in the W.H.O., along with Guinean officials, played down the threat, leading to overconfidence and inattention. Other international and nongovernment groups devised public education campaigns that in some instances did more harm than good.

Dr. Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola in 1976, and Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious disease specialist, called the West Africa outbreak ‘‘an avoidable crisis’’ in an editorial published online in September in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the same issue, W.H.O. officials said of the March to July period that ‘‘modest further intervention efforts at that point could have achieved control.’’

In some of the worst luck in epidemiological history, this outbreak occurred at the bustling intersection of three of the world’s poorest and least developed countries. Doctors in the region were rarer than paved roads and clinics and hospitals, where they existed, often lacked essentials like running water, hand soap and gloves.

International health groups had largely pulled out of West Africa during the civil wars that devastated Liberia and Sierra Leone in the 1990s. When the Ebola outbreak began, the C.D.C’s staff in the region consisted of one malaria researcher in Guinea.

Complicating matters, the same ethnic group — the Kissi — inhabited the forested region across all three nations, and extended families moved easily on foot and by dugout canoe across a pinwheel of disregarded national borders.

Governments attempted to broadcast the message that Ebola was spread through contact with vomit, feces and blood, and that bodies remained highly contagious after death. But communities often continued to wash the bodies of the dead, a step considered essential to a dignified burial and a contented afterlife. The arrival of moon-suited health workers in convoys of white trucks, armed with chlorine sprayers and thermometers, bred resistance and secrecy.

‘‘Old disease in new context will bring you surprises,’’ Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the W.H.O., said in an interview in December in her office in Geneva.

On calls before leaving Guinea last May, Dr. Rollin advised his supervisors in Atlanta that the situation seemed stable enough that the C.D.C. could probably pull out after another month.

But not long after his return, Dr. Rollin noticed disturbing trends in the reports landing in his inbox. First, an uptick in cases in southeastern Guinea. Then the first confirmed infections in neighboring Sierra Leone. Then a death at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, and the first case in Conakry in a month.

After a deceptive lull, the virus was back, with ruthless force.

‘‘Damn,’’ the old Ebola hand thought. ‘‘We missed it.’’

The bad news then came like a fusillade. By June 21, Doctors Without Borders had pronounced the epidemic ‘‘out of control.’’

Yet the W.H.O. waited until Aug. 8 to declare the epidemic ‘‘a public health emergency of international concern,’’ its top threat level. That was two weeks after two American aid workers were infected in Liberia and a man sick with Ebola flew from Liberia to Nigeria.

By September, the W.H.O.’s Geneva leadership and the United Nations had asserted control over the response.

Today, even as infection rates are starting to decline in some areas, there can be more reports of new cases in just two days than were recorded in the first two months of the outbreak.

Even as they continue to battle Ebola across West Africa, the virus hunters find themselves soul-searching about how many lives might have been saved had there been a bigger, more effective initial response. If the epidemic in West Africa has demonstrated anything, it is that a foe as remorseless as Ebola must be met with a killer instinct that is just as unrelenting.

‘‘There is no room for optimism as long as you are dealing with an Ebola virus,’’ said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who now leads the W.H.O. response. ‘‘It’s not about low numbers. It’s about zero. We have got to get to zero.’’

Dr. Rollin accepts a share of responsibility. He and other leaders should have recognized how distinct West African culture was, he said. He should have better appreciated how lax the tracing had been, and that the virus’s disappearance from view did not mean that it was gone.

But he also argues that scientists can act only on the facts as they know them, and that much of what happened in West Africa could not have been foreseen, at least not in the fog of an emerging crisis.

‘‘It was an unprecedented outbreak; it never happened before,’’ he said. ‘‘There were a lot of things we didn’t know at that time. No one could have imagined that it would be what we have now.’’

As the death counts rose, the C.D.C. sent Dr. Rollin back to Guinea in mid-June. The beds that sat empty in May were now filling. The hopeful mood of a month before had given way to defeat. As he looked at the rampaging caseloads across the border in Liberia and Sierra Leone, he could tell those countries were too overwhelmed to track the chain of transmission.

‘‘They were just counting the dead,’’ he said.

Before year’s end, Dr. Rollin would be dispatched to Liberia, by then flooded with Ebola cases; to Dallas, where a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, was deathly ill with the virus; to New York, where an American, Dr. Craig Spencer, developed symptoms after returning from Guinea; and to Mali, which reported its first cases this fall.

It would be awhile before he would get a full night’s sleep.

Merkel targets anti-Muslim rallies; New Year’s speech urges Germans to boycott new immigration protests

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany planned to use her New Year’s speech to issue her most direct plea yet to Germans to boycott recent protests against an alleged ‘‘Islamization’’ of Europe, warning that the organizers intent was to whip up sentiment against members of religious or racial minority groups.

Protests every Monday in Dresden by a group calling itself Pegida, a German acronym that can be translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, have swelled in the past two months, drawing about 17,500 people on the Monday before Christmas.

Borrowing the slogan of East Germans who protested Communist rule before the Berlin Wall fell 25 years ago, ‘‘Wir sind das Volk!’’ (We are the people!), the demonstrators are challenging Germany’s policy of welcoming and sheltering immigrants. About 200,000 refugees have arrived this year alone, many of them from war zones in Syria and Iraq.

In a debate that has consumed political circles in Berlin since the emergence of the Dresden marches, several commentators have suggested that the government needs to explain its policy of giving shelter to refugees, and of encouraging foreigners to come and work here. It was not clear if Ms. Merkel would now embark on a more active effort in that vein.

The chancellor said this month that there was no place for prejudice and lies in Germany, and she warned the protesters in Dresden against being manipulated by the rallies’ organizers.

But her New Year’s appeal — a text of which was released by the government — is much clearer, and has the added force of coming from someone who grew up in East Germany and remembered the Monday marches there that played a central role in toppling the wall and Communist rule in the fall of 1989.

‘‘Today, some people are again shouting on Mondays, ‘Wir sind das Volk!’’’ Ms. Merkel will say, according to the text. ‘‘But what they really mean is: You don’t belong — because of the color of your skin, or your religion. That’s why I say to all who go to such demonstrations: Don’t follow those who call for this! Too often, there is prejudice, coldness or even hatred in their hearts!’’

Her appeal is to be broadcast as 2014 melts into 2015 at midnight on Wednesday.

Ms. Merkel is to open her remarks by noting that 2014 will be remembered as a year that no one would have expected last New Year’s, particularly with Russia’s challenge to the European order in Ukraine.

She will emphasize that ‘‘there is no question that we want security in Europe together with Russia, not against Russia. But there is also no question that Europe cannot and will not accept a supposed right of the mightier, which does not respect international law.’’

Europeans, she will say, have proved that they can resist attempts to divide the continent, and have acted together with their ‘‘trans-Atlantic partners.’’

‘‘This unity of Europe is not an end in itself, but it is the key to overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and applying the might of the law,’’ the text says.

Noting that Ebola and the emergence of the Islamic State had also shaken the world in 2014, Ms. Merkel says that war and crisis have created the largest number of refugees since World War II, many who literally ran for their lives.

‘‘It goes without saying that we help them, and take in people who seek shelter with us,’’ the speech continues.

She defends immigration — ‘‘a win for us all’’ — as key to maintaining the workforce for Europe’s top economy.

Cuba Turns Off Critics’ Open Mic

The Cuban artist Tania Bruguera,[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/nyregion/as-art-tania-bruguera-lives-like-a-poor-immigrant.html?pagewanted=all] who splits her time between Chicago and Havana, traveled to Cuba in recent days seeking to pull off a bold experiment. She called on Cubans from all walks of life to meet at Havana’s iconic Revolution Square on Tuesday at 3 p.m., where they would take turns at a microphone to outline their vision for the new era in the country. Word of the event, which was billed as both a performance and a street protest, was shared on social media[https://www.facebook.com/YoTambienExijo] using the hashtag #YoTambiénExijo[https://twitter.com/YOTAMBIENEXIJO], which means “I also demand.”

Ms. Bruguera’s plan was the first test of whether the Obama administration’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba earlier this month would prod the Castro regime to be more tolerant of critical voices[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/opinion/sunday/shifting-dynamics-for-cubas-dissidents.html]. Disappointingly, but not surprisingly, the government barred prominent critics, including Ms. Bruguera, from reaching the square. Some were detained and others were reportedly prevented from leaving their homes. In the end, the performance wasn’t held.

Authorities in Cuba appear to have wrestled with how to prevent Ms. Bruguera’s project from turning into a mass gathering of critics. They allowed her to travel to the island, though she had publicized her project well in advance. In recent days, officials from the state-run arts council summoned her for a meeting. In a statement, the council said it had made clear to her that her plan was “unacceptable,” because of the location and the “ample media coverage” in outlets that are critical of the government. Officials proposed that the event be held instead at a cultural site, according to the statement[http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2014/12/30/consejo-nacional-de-las-artes-plasticas-inaceptable-performance-en-la-plaza-de-la-revolucion/#.VKM-AmTF8wQ], and said that the government would “reserve the right” to bar people whose “sole interest is to be provocative.”

It became clear early on Tuesday which people authorities had in mind. State security personnel detained journalist Reinaldo Escobar, the husband of popular dissident blogger Yoani Sánchez,[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/interview-with-cuban-blogger-yoani-snchez/] outside their home and prevented her from leaving, according to the digital news site[http://www.14ymedio.com/nacional/Detenidos-Eliecer-Reinaldo-Escobar-Seguridad_0_1697830207.html] the couple runs, 14yMedio. Eliécer Ávila[https://twitter.com/eliecer_cuba], a young government critic who leads the political movement ‘Somos +[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Somos-/276849069115809]’ — which means, “there are more of us,” was taken into custody alongside Mr. Escobar.

By stifling critical voices, the Cuban government is showing its unwillingness to tolerate basic freedoms most citizens in the hemisphere enjoy. This move, unfortunately, will amplify the criticisms of those who opposed Mr. Obama’s historic shift on Cuba policy.

Heavy-handed tactics by the Castro government will give them ammunition next year, when Republicans will control both chambers of Congress, to stymie the Obama administration’s steps to ease the embargo through executive authority and dim the prospects of legislative change to pare back the web of sanctions Washington imposes on Cuba. That result would be a shame and, in the long run, self-defeating for Havana.

Merkel to Attack Anti-Immigrant Movement

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of Germany[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/germany/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] will use her New Year’s speech to make her most direct plea yet to Germans to stay away from the recent protests against a supposed “Islamization” of Europe. Ms. Merkel warned that the organizers of such protests often intended them to whip up hatred against nonwhites or non-Christians.

A group calling itself Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West has mounted weekly protests in Dresden that have swelled in size in the past two months, drawing some 17,500 people Dec. 22. The protests borrow the slogan of East Germans who protested Communist rule before the Berlin Wall[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fell 25 years ago, “Wir sind das Volk!” (We are the people!), and reflect disaffection with Germany’s policy of encouraging immigration and sheltering refugees. About 200,000 refugees have arrived this year, many of them from war zones in Syria and Iraq.

Ms. Merkel has spoken on the issue before, saying that there is no place in Germany for prejudice and lies and warning citizens not to let themselves be used by the protest organizers.

But her New Year’s appeal is much clearer, and comes from someone who grew up in East Germany and can remember the Monday marches that helped topple the Berlin Wall[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/berlin_wall/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in 1989.

“Today, some people are again shouting on Mondays, ‘Wir sind das Volk!’ ” Ms. Merkel says, according to the text of her remarks released by the government. “But what they really mean is, ‘You don’t belong, because of the color of your skin, or your religion.’ That’s why I say to all who go to such demonstrations: Don’t follow those who call for this! Too often, there is prejudice, coldness or even hatred in their hearts.”

The chancellor, 60, opens her remarks, recorded in advance for broadcast as 2014 melts into 2015 at midnight Wednesday, by noting that the year just passed would be remembered as one filled with events that one would not have predicted last New Year’s, particularly Russia’s challenge to the European order in Ukraine.

“There is no question that we want security in Europe together with Russia, not against Russia,” she says. “But there is also no question that Europe cannot and will not accept a supposed right of the mightier, which does not respect international law.”

Europe, she adds, has proved that it can resist attempts to divide the Continent and can act together with “its trans-Atlantic partners.”

“This unity of Europe is not an end in itself, but it is the key to overcoming the crisis in Ukraine and applying the might of the law,” Ms. Merkel says, according to the released text.

Noting that the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic and the emergence of the Islamic State militant group had also shaken the world in 2014, Ms. Merkel stresses in her remarks that wars and crises had produced more refugees around the world than at any time since World War II. “It goes without saying that we help them, and take in people who seek shelter with us,” she adds.

She also defends immigration as “a win for us all,” bringing in workers whom the German economy, the largest in Europe, needs to thrive.

Political circles in Berlin have been consumed by the debate over immigration and refugees since the Dresden protests began, and several prominent commentators have suggested that the government needs to do a better job of explaining its policies.

Good morning and Happy New Year’s Eve.

Your Wednesday is as chilled as Champagne.

As we review the news in 2014, we see protests, tragic deaths, a virulent disease.

And Chris Christie.

An article suggesting the governor of New Jersey knew about lane closings[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/nyregion/christie-bridge.html] on the George Washington Bridge topped the list of the most-read stories in our coverage of the region this year.

It drew even more readers than the one on Craig Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/nyregion/craig-spencer-is-tested-for-ebola-virus-at-bellevue-hospital-in-new-york-city.html], the doctor who had Ebola. (That was No. 2).

Here are the biggest stories of 2014, according to what people read each month.

• January: The lane-closure story[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/nyregion/christie-aide-tied-to-bridge-lane-closings.html] broke, and embroiled Governor Christie in scandal.

Our glittering Times Square ball[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/metropolis/2014/12/31/photos-testing-the-times-square-new-years-eve-ball/?mod=WSJBlog] has inspired other cities and towns to drop things at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.

Miami drops a neon orange, The Associated Press reports[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/30/us/ap-us-travel-new-years-ball-drops.html].

In Atlanta, they drop a peach.

In Flagstaff, Ariz., it’s a pine cone.

Las Cruces, N.M., will celebrate with its first chile pepper drop tonight.

Brasstown, N.C., meanwhile, has made a change.

After years of dropping an opossum, the organizers have heeded the call of animal rights groups and will drop “a roadkill opossum or perhaps a pot of opossum stew.”

Cuba deja a críticos sin micrófono

La artista cubana Tania Bruguera[http://www.taniabruguera.com/cms/], quien divide su tiempo entre Estados Unidos y La Habana, viajó a la isla hace unos días con la intención de llevar a cabo un novedoso experimento. Hizo un llamado a que los cubanos de diversos sectores de la sociedad se dieran cita en la icónica Plaza de la Revolución el martes a las 3 p.m., y expresaran a micrófono abierto su visión sobre la nueva era en el país. El evento, diseñado como una mezcla de obra artística y protesta, fue promovido en redes sociales [https://www.facebook.com/events/1515487705372907/]usando la etiqueta #YoTambiénExisto[https://twitter.com/YOTAMBIENEXIJO].

El plan de Bruguera representó la primera prueba de si la decisión del Presidente Obama de comenzar a normalizar la relación[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/opinion/obama-da-un-paso-histrico-con-cuba.html] entre los dos países incentivaría al régimen de los Castro a ser más tolerante de las voces críticas. Lastimosamente, aunque no es de sorprender, el gobierno impidió que prominentes críticos, entre ellos Bruguera, acudieran a la plaza. Algunos fueron detenidos y a otros no se les dejó salir de su casa. Finalmente, el evento no se realizó.

Las autoridades en Cuba parecen haber titubeado a la hora de decidir cómo prevenir que el proyecto de Bruguera se convirtiera en un encuentro masivo de críticos. No impidieron que ingresara al país, aunque ella anunció su plan de antemano. En días recientes, funcionarios del Consejo Nacional de las Artes Plásticas se reunieron con Bruguera. En un comunicado[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/opinion/obama-da-un-paso-histrico-con-cuba.html], el consejo informó que consideraba el proyecto de la artista “inaceptable”, debido al punto de encuentro escogido y la “amplia cobertura mediática”, en medios que son críticos del gobierno. Los funcionarios sugirieron que el evento se realizara en un centro cultural, según el comunicado, y señalaron que en ese caso, el gobierno tenía previsto reservarse el “derecho de admisión” a gente cuyo “único interés sea la provocación”.

Fue evidente el martes a qué tipo de personas hacía alusión el comunicado. Agentes de seguridad detuvieron al periodista Reinaldo Escobar, el marido de la popular bloguera Yoani Sánchez, cuando salía de su casa y previnieron que ella saliera, según información difundida por 14YMedio[http://www.14ymedio.com/], el medio de noticias digital que dirige la pareja. Eliécer Ávila[https://twitter.com/eliecer_cuba], un joven disidente que fundó el movimiento político “Somos +[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Somos-/276849069115809]”, fue detenido junto con Escobar.

Al silenciar voces críticas, el Gobierno cubano está dejando en claro que no está dispuesto a permitir libertades básicas que gozan la gran mayoría de ciudadanos en el hemisferio. Su conducta en este caso, desafortunadamente, dará más vigor a quienes se oponen al giro histórico que Obama le dio a la política estadounidense respecto a Cuba.

Las medidas de mano dura por parte del Gobierno cubano les proporcionará más herramientas el año entrante, cuando los Republicanos van a controlar ambas cámaras en el Congreso, para frenar las medidas que la administración Obama quiere tomar bajo la autoridad de la rama ejecutiva. Así mismo, será menos factible que la rama legislativa adopte medidas para retirar las sanciones que Washington impone a la isla. Eso sería lamentable, y a largo plazo, una dinámica contraproducente auto-infligida para La Habana.

1. Presidential campaign coverage that does not seem based on the idea that the presidency is dynastic, and must be handed down to a Clinton or a Bush.

2. More skepticism from the get-go. For example, when government officials say[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/asia/us-links-north-korea-to-sony-hacking.html] (anonymously, of course) that North Korea is behind the Sony hack, give more emphasis, early on, to knowledgeable dissenters. That is very likely to serve readers better from the start, and might require less walking-back later when the story line changes[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/new-study-adds-to-skepticism-among-security-experts-that-north-korea-was-behind-sony-hack/].

3. A brilliant new revenue scheme to capitalize on the popularity of mobile devices.

4. More women’s voices on the Op-Ed pages and more women’s bylines on the front page[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/new-york-times-front-page-women-journalists-war-reporters_n_5599880.html?utm_hp_ref=tw].

5. Speaking of the front page, less focus on it, and more focus on, say, whether a story made the top of the mobile app at 6 a.m.

6. The addition of some black critics to the culture staff; and a more diverse staff[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/shonda-rhimes-alessandra-stanley-margaret-sullivan-column/] in general.

7. Less “he said/she said” – also known as false balance[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/public-editor/so-we-beat-on-another-year-in-the-hot-seat.html?_r=0] – in the news report. Fewer[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/introducing-anonywatch-tracking-nameless-quotations-in-the-times/]anonymous[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/anonywatch-when-unnamed-sources-are-flat-wrong/]sources[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/anonywatch-department-of-ridiculous-reasons/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body].

8. Continued clarity in the labeling of native advertising[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/pledging-clarity-the-times-plunges-into-native-advertising/]; no slipping down that tempting slope.

9. A Thanksgiving interactive graphic that includes a Minnesota specialty that is NOT grape salad[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/new-york-times-minnesota-grape-salad/]. (More broadly, coverage of “flyover country” that always strives to understand and reflect its audience without cliché or condescension.)

10. More of the refreshingly conversational – sometimes funny – tone of New York Today[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/category/new-york-today/], which is a hit on mobile.

11. More multimedia and interactive projects on serious, meaningful topics. “Snowfall[http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek]” was groundbreaking, but “How Ebola Roared Back[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html]” used digital tools to better purpose.

12. Deep, aggressive coverage of climate change[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/like-sea-level-times-environmental-coverage-on-the-rise/], government malfeasance[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html] and poverty[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/public-editor/those-in-poverty-go-wanting-even-in-the-times.html], and the other subjects that speak to journalism’s core mission to enlighten citizens, hold powerful people and institutions accountable and maybe even make the world a better place.

13. Writers assigned to cover labor, television and advertising (and many other subjects) who are as good as their recently departed predecessors, who were among more than 100 Times newsroom employees who took buyouts or were laid off this month.

14. And please, no 2015 newsroom buyouts or layoffs. (Enough cake was cut, enough toasts made, enough tears shed for at least a year.)

15. Three Pulitzer Prizes. (That would put Dean Baquet, the executive editor, right in the middle between the four the paper was awarded under his predecessor in 2013[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/2013] for work published in 2012 and the two it won in 2014[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/2014] for work published in 2013.) I can think of at least three worthy candidates, but I’ll restrain myself from naming them here.

16. More coverage (or just some coverage) of such press-rights matters as Freedom of Information Act[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/free-flow-of-government-information-yawn/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body] legislation. After all, while F.O.I. is a critical issue for journalists, it really involves the rights of the public.

17. More absurd[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/from-the-makers-of-anonywatch-introducing-the-monocle-meter/] Styles trend stories. Long may they run.

United States Embassy in Gambia Confirms Coup Attempt
By RUKMINI CALLIMACHI

DAKAR, Senegal — Gunfire erupted overnight in Banjul, the capital of the West African nation of Gambia [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/gambia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], and residents awoke Tuesday to find government buildings and the main bridge into town sealed off by fidgety soldiers.

The United States Embassy confirmed an attempted coup, even as the Gambian government issued a vague statement that “peace and calm continue to prevail in the Gambia.”

Residents said that shooting began at around 1 a.m. near the seat of government. After day broke, most establishments in the island capital remained closed despite regular broadcasts on state-run radio urging businesses to open.

Westerners living in Gambia, which juts like a stake into its larger neighbor, Senegal, awoke to emails from their embassies [https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/gambia] urging them to stay indoors.

“It seems a coup attempt occurred last night,” Dan Whitman, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Banjul, wrote in an email. “There has been no sign of transfer of political or military power.”

Gambia’s president, Yahya Jammeh [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/yahya_jammeh/index.html?inline=nyt-per], seized power in a putsch 20 years ago. Since 1994, he has weathered several other attempted coups as his government has grown increasingly autocratic. He is known for his erratic behavior and bizarre pronouncements, including claiming that he had found a cure for AIDS. In 2007, he invited reporters to the presidential palace to show off the treatment [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/gambias-president-claims-to-cure-aids/?_r=0], which involved rubbing an herbal mixture that smelled strongly of mint onto the skin of patients with H.I.V.

At the same time, Gambia has built a thriving tourism economy. International hotel chains have opened and now dot the country’s white-sand beaches, and European airlines were expected to increase direct flights to Banjul to cater to a growing number of package tours.

The government’s statement on Tuesday neither confirmed nor denied an attempted coup.

“Contrary to rumors being circulated, peace and calm continue to prevail in the Gambia, and the government would like to urge the general public and all businesses to carry on with their normal activities as usual,” a news release issued to the state-run broadcaster said.

Sheriff Bojang, the editor of The Standard, an independent newspaper, said that he could not enter Banjul on Tuesday morning “because the road was blocked by soldiers.”

Reports over the weekend quoted state radio as saying that Mr. Jammeh was on a visit to France, but his precise whereabouts remained unknown. French officials were quoted as saying that there was no record of his arrival in France.

Mr. Jammeh has faced increasing criticism from outside his country for running a repressive state. Amnesty International criticized the authorities this year for changing the Constitution to extend jail terms for some charges of homosexuality to life imprisonment.

The changes came “at a time when the space for free speech in Gambia is rapidly shrinking,” Amnesty International said in a report in November [http://www.amnesty.org.uk/gambia-anti-gay-bill#.VKKBEv8HEJA]. “Human rights defenders, journalists and political activists face harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and enforced disappearance,” the report added.

But for business owners here, the attempted coup came as a shock. Bianca Griffith, a Colorado native who runs a sustainable water treatment company, said she had always viewed the country as peaceful and welcoming to foreign investors.

“Everybody got notices from their embassies about the attempted coup,” Ms. Griffith, 24, who’ also runs a tourist lodge south of Banjul, said by telephone. “And everybody wakes up and goes, ‘Oh my god.'”

She added that the only tension she and others had noted was over the Ebola [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa, which has harmed tourism even though Gambia has had no reported cases.

“The biggest tension here has been Ebola — its economic ramifications — far more than anything political,” Ms. Griffith said.

Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

The Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus is still spreading in West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, and the worldwide toll from the outbreak stood at 7,905 deaths among 20,206 known cases at year’s end, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Wednesday. Sierra Leone reported 337 new cases in the past week, including 149 in Freetown, the highest incidence in the capital of the former British colony in four weeks, the W.H.O. said in its latest weekly update. However, the number of cases in Sierra Leone over a three-week period has fallen below 1,000 for the first time since Sept. 28, suggesting the spread of the disease is slowing.

In neighboring Guinea, the three-week total rose for a second week to 346, suggesting the epidemic is growing there.

Deal Makers Notched Nearly $3.5 Trillion Worth in ’14, Best in 7 Years
By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

By almost every measure, 2014 was a time for deal makers to pop the corks of their Champagne bottles.

The year was one of the best for mergers and acquisitions since the passing of the financial crisis. Some 40,298 transactions — worth nearly $3.5 trillion — were announced worldwide in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, fulfilling the hopes of an industry that has bet on such a resurgence for some time. It was the biggest year in deals since 2007.

Many of the factors responsible for the rebound in mergers activity since the tumult of 2008 have existed for years. Debt financing is cheap and plentiful, and stock prices have climbed steadily, giving corporate buyers a more valuable currency to offer potential targets.

Perhaps the biggest change, deal makers say, is that corporate boards and management teams have come to realize that their ability to expand their companies on their own has become more difficult. A substantial move, like acquiring a major competitor or complementary business, is now seen as necessary to move the needle.

And with some semblance of predictability having descended upon the markets — the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 11.4 percent last year, with only a few bouts of heart-stopping volatility — boards feel more comfortable taking the plunge.

Investors have also supported more aggressive growth measures. The stock prices of acquirers continued on average to rise, indicating that shareholders backed those transactions.

“The large equity institutions are giving companies the benefit of the doubt in this market,” said Peter A. Weinberg, a co-founder of the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners. “This opens up a range of possibilities beyond the default use of capital, which is repurchasing stock. If shareholders say ‘stay still,’ it’s very difficult to do anything bold.”

The busiest sectors for the year have been the oil and gas industry, with 11.7 percent of the merger market and $409 billion worth of transactions, and the pharmaceuticals industry, with 6 percent market share and $210 billion worth of deals.

Yet the biggest deals of the year, including the assumption of debt, have been game-changing takeovers in the telecommunications industry. Comcast has bid for a nationwide footprint with its $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable, while AT&T hopes to gain greater scale by buying DirecTV in a deal valued at $49 billion.

The question now is whether the confluence of factors that enabled the merger revival will carry over into 2015 . Corporate advisers contend that investors have shown a remarkable ability to cope with a surge of headline-grabbing news, like the flare-ups in Ukraine and the Middle East and the Ebola outbreak.

And the possibility of the Federal Reserve’s raising interest rates has been well telegraphed and factored into companies’ decision-making.

Not even the plummeting of oil prices has dented the enthusiasm of would-be buyers. Indeed, leveraged buyout executives — who have been left out of the deal feeding frenzy, outbid by strategic buyers — have been salivating at the prospect of new acquisition targets.

“There’s comfort with the new normal, postcrisis,” Mr. Weinberg said. “C.E.O.s and boards know there’s always going to be uncertainty.”

New C.D.C. Job Overseeing Laboratory Safety

Correction Appended

A new job title — chief of laboratory safety — will be created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the agency said Wednesday. The move follows a series of lab accidents, the most recent of which may have exposed a scientist to the Ebola virus. Applicants are being recruited, and a spokeswoman said that whoever filled the post would report directly to the C.D.C.'s director, currently Dr. Thomas R. Frieden. Each of the agency’s divisions had handled lab safety separately. In the past year, different high-security C.D.C. labs shipped out samples of anthrax[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anthrax/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], H5N1 bird flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and Ebola that had not been properly killed. Thus far, there have been no injuries and no spread of the pathogens, but the agency’s procedures have been heavily criticized as sloppy.

Correction: January 5, 2015, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report in the National Briefing column on Thursday about a search to hire a chief of laboratory safety at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described the agency’s previous assignment of safety responsibilities incorrectly. While each of the agency’s divisions handled safety separately in the past, there was no single lab safety specialist at each division.

Correction Appended

Minutes before midnight on New Year’s Eve at Madison Square Garden, the dance party paused for a video montage. As a look back on the year that was, it was a bit random, mixing hints of hellishness with small victories: Robin Williams’s death, Ebola and Ferguson, Mo., but also Derek Jeter’s farewell to Yankee Stadium, a goal by Clint Dempsey in the World Cup and footage from Burning Man of the night’s headlining D.J.s, Diplo and Skrillex.

Farewell, 2014.

The retrospective was a brief reprieve from the dance music that had started nearly four hours earlier, but there would be more to come. After the countdown clock hit zero and confetti fell, the bass dropped once again. Then again, and again.

As purveyors of a very American strain of electronic dance music, or E.D.M., Skrillex and Diplo trade in constant pleasure and adrenaline, forgoing any down moments in favor of a relentless build and piling sounds like a Jenga tower until the whole thing wobbles. To ring in the New Year, each played a hyperactive solo set before joining forces as a two-headed E.D.M. Hydra: Jack U. For the amped crowd, which, like the beats-per-minute in the music, rarely slowed, the show might as well have been a cardio class.

“I’ve only been to one other concert, and it was Billy Joel, so there were a lot of old people,” said one 22-year-old, who gave her name only as Haley. “It’s pretty different here.”

She had driven for hours from Binghamton, N.Y., with two friends, who were taking a break from the pulverizing bass to eat nachos. The three said they planned to make another musical pilgrimage to Ultra, the popular E.D.M. festival in Miami, in March.

“If you’re from out of town, make some noise right now!” Diplo commanded from the stage during his first set. Based on the crowd’s response, this was not a room full of locals.

Matthew Malandro, 20, said he had driven from Vermont to see Jack U, just days after a trip to Virginia for a concert known as BassLights, which pairs the E.D.M. musicians Bassnectar and Pretty Lights.

Such fan devotion, especially among young people, has turned E.D.M. into a multibillion-dollar industry[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/music/drugs-at-music-festivals-are-threat-to-investors-as-well-as-fans.html?pagewanted=all] — Skrillex alone made an estimated $16.5 million in 2014, according to Forbes[http://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeel45eljkm/no-9-skrillex-16-5-million-2/] — bringing with it concerns over the use of party drugs like MDMA, better known as ecstasy or molly.

“Everyone judges these shows based on the drugs, but it’s really about the community,” Emily Gandolfo, 20, said. Of the crowds, she said, “We’re a family.”

With her multicolored bikini and fuzzy leg warmers, Ms. Gandolfo fit right in. Shirts and pants were optional in the warmth of the pulsating arena, belying the frigid temperatures outside. With winter layers peeled off, sleeves were, apparently, frowned upon.

Headgear, on the other hand, was in: There were animal headdresses, Uncle Sam top hats, bright bucket hats and holiday elf hats. Full-body coverage was O.K. if it was creative, like the man in the smiley-face print kimono, or another in a glow-in-the-dark skeleton onesie, or the three in full furry bunny suits. Friendship bracelets — “Stay High,” read one — were the preferred accessories.

With its colorful crowd the arena felt a long way from the bottle service clubs of Las Vegas, where more mainstream E.D.M. stars like Zedd and Calvin Harris were performing on New Year’s Eve. Madison Square Garden, Diplo said, was more like a “house party.”

In addition to their guests, the D.J.s were playing for an online audience, courtesy of a feed[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/new-years-eve-with-skrillex-and-diplo-enjoy-the-show-even-if-you-dont-go/] sponsored by Yahoo and Live Nation. One reveler took the digital participation a step further by dancing for absent friends using FaceTime on his iPhone. Sitting quietly on a couch with a toddler, his friends looked content where they were.

Commanding the aisle nearby was a man in only silky boxing trunks doing calisthenics in between spits of chewing tobacco. He thrashed violently to the beat, pausing to hug passing strangers. In one show of solidarity, he held up his fingers to a woman, and she knowingly completed the secret handshake. Together they made a hand heart[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/fashion/hand-heart-gesture-grows-in-popularity-noticed.html].

Correction: January 1, 2015, Thursday

An earlier version of the capsule summary with this article misspelled the name of a D.J. who performed. He is Skrillex, not Srillex.

Health
Ebola Doctors Are Divided on IV Therapy in Africa

Medical experts seeking to stem the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic are sharply divided over whether most patients in West Africa should, or can, be given intravenous hydration, a therapy that is standard in developed countries. Some argue that more aggressive treatment with IV fluids is medically possible and a moral obligation. But others counsel caution, saying that pushing too hard would put overworked doctors and nurses in danger and that the treatment, if given carelessly, could even kill patients.

The debate comes at a crucial time in the outbreak. New infections are flattening out in most places, better-equipped field hospitals are opening, and more trained professionals are arriving, opening up the possibility of saving many lives in Africa, rather than a few patients flown to intensive care units thousands of miles away.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] sees intravenous rehydration, along with constant measuring of blood chemistry, as the main reason that almost all Ebola patients treated in American and European hospitals have survived, while about 70 percent of those treated in West Africa have died.

Every hospital there should have “early, liberal use of intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement,” said Dr. Robert A. Fowler, a Canadian critical care specialist who leads a W.H.O. Ebola team. Anything less, he said, is “not medically justified and will result in continued high case-fatality rates.”

Experts who favor aggressive rehydration point to several hospitals that claim unusually low death rates as evidence that it is effective. Skeptics say other factors may be at work.

Even two of the most admired medical charities have squared off over the issue. Partners in Health, which has worked in Haiti and Rwanda but is just beginning to treat Ebola patients in West Africa, supports the aggressive treatment. Its officials say the more measured approach taken by Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is overly cautious.

“M.S.F. is not doing enough,” said Dr. Paul Farmer, one of the founders of Partners in Health, using the French initials for Doctors Without Borders, whose staff members have worked on the front lines of Ebola outbreaks for years. “What if the fatality rate isn’t the virulence of disease but the mediocrity of the medical delivery?”

Doctors Without Borders representatives strongly disagreed, saying that Dr. Farmer’s assumptions about Ebola were incorrect, that intensive rehydration would probably not save as many patients as he believes, and that the W.H.O.’s position has not been proved.

The group’s overwhelmed doctors do what they can, officials said, but it is hard to insert needles while wearing three pairs of gloves and foggy goggles. IVs must be monitored, drawing virus-laden blood for tests is dangerous, and patients yank needles out — sometimes in delirium[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/delirium/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], sometimes just to go to the toilet when no nurse is around.

Ebola patients lose up to five quarts of fluid a day through diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. In that fluid are electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, sodium and calcium[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/serum-calcium/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and proteins like albumin[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/albumin-serum/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Electrolyte loss can stop the heart; protein loss can cause fatal internal swelling.

Rehydrating patients and replacing those elements “is the antidote to the idea that everybody’s going to die,” Dr. Farmer said.

Every Ebola hospital, he argued, should have a team that specializes in inserting IVs — or, better yet, peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines. These are thin plastic tubes, inserted in the arm or chest and threaded through a vein, that can be left in place for days and the needle discarded.

Along with doctors at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who published an article on rehydration[http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736&] in The Lancet on Dec. 4, Dr. Farmer has also called for the use of thick needles driven into bone marrow with surgical “guns.” This procedure, known as intraosseous infusion, is slow, but it reinflates veins too shrunken to admit an intravenous line, and the needles are much harder for agitated patients to pull out.

However, not all doctors know how to use PICC lines or bone needles, or how to inject fluids into empty abdominal spaces, another technique endorsed in the Lancet article. (The article was accompanied by a video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP1stoIJqE&feature=youtu.be] in which Dr. Ian Roberts, the chief author, had some of those techniques demonstrated on himself. He used minimal anesthesia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/anesthesiaandanesthetics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], he said, to imitate field conditions in West Africa.)

Doctors Without Borders normally puts IV lines in as many Ebola patients as it can manage, said Dr. Armand Sprecher, an Ebola expert with the organization. That practice was temporarily stopped in September, when the disease was spreading so fast that doctors had only one minute per patient during the one hour they could work in their sweltering protective suits.

The fatality rate across the group’s six Ebola treatment centers in West Africa was about 60 percent then, and is now 40 to 50 percent, Dr. Sprecher said. He disputed Dr. Farmer’s contention that rehydration could bring it down to 10 percent.

“It would probably push it down some, but I’d be surprised if it were dramatic,” Dr. Sprecher said.

Dr. Farmer cited the treatment given at a unit in Hastings, Sierra Leone, as an example of the kind of care he endorses.

In a Dec. 24 letter[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1413685] to The New England Journal of Medicine, the Sierra Leonean doctors running that center with Western advisers said they had had a 48 percent fatality rate when they opened in September and had since reduced it to 24 percent.

Each of the 581 patients the center has treated immediately received IV fluids with electrolytes, they wrote. Even without lab tests, each patient also received an antibiotic[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], an anti-parasitic drug, an antimalarial drug, an anti-vomiting drug, pain pills, vitamins[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/vitamins/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], zinc[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/poison/zinc/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and a nutrition supplement.

“That’s effective case management,” Dr. Farmer said. “We’re cheering them on.”

The fatality rate at the unit Partners in Health runs in Port Loko, Sierra Leone, is 35 to 40 percent, its director, Dr. Corrado Cancedda, estimated.

Up to 80 percent of patients there receive IV rehydration, Dr. Cancedda said, and some have had bone needles inserted; no PICC lines have been used. Battery-powered electrolyte monitoring machines are being introduced.

Dr. Sprecher said death rates at Doctors Without Borders’ six hospitals in the region varied, with the lowest being 36 percent in Bo, Sierra Leone.

But he could not explain why. Some of the hospitals see more young adults, who tend to survive. At rural centers, the sickest patients die on the way there.

Rehydration was only one lifesaving factor for the handful of patients transported to American or European hospitals, Dr. Sprecher argued, because all of them also received intensive nursing, and some received dialysis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/dialysis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], ventilation and experimental therapies.

He was reluctant to have his doctors seen using bone-needle guns on patients. “Not long ago, we were being accused of stealing organs,” he said. “You have to be sure people understand what the heck you’re doing.”

Dr. Sprecher also disputed Dr. Farmer’s comparison of Ebola to cholera[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cholera/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which both medical charities fight with aggressive rehydration. Ebola, he said, does more organ damage and makes blood vessels leak fluid.

“In cholera, you can get fatalities down from 50 percent to 1 percent,” he said. “We’ve been putting people on IVs for Ebola for 14 years. If just tanking them up worked, we’d be doing it.”

Lab testing is a crucial issue. For example, while low potassium can kill, so can overdoses. Potassium is used in executions by lethal injection.

West Africa has at least eight laboratories run by various American, Canadian and European government agencies, Dr. Sprecher said. Until recently, they tested only for Ebola and diseases that mimic it, like malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or Lassa fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Now, he said, about half can test for electrolytes.

Because heat and humidity knock out the machines that analyze blood chemistry, labs must be air-conditioned, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. The C.D.C. runs two large laboratories in the region, only one of which now tests for electrolytes.

Sometimes, conservative guesswork is called for, Dr. Frieden said. His father, a physician, gave potassium to patients who needed IV rehydration long before such tests were routine.

The best-equipped treatment center in West Africa is the 25-bed United States Public Health Service hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, which is reserved for doctors, nurses, burial teams and others fighting the epidemic. It is fully air-conditioned and has 32 medical personnel, who wear high-tech protective gear that sucks in fresh air. Its on-site lab tests blood for electrolytes and proteins. The pharmacy has drugs to raise blood pressure[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/blood-pressure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or increase coagulation, and patients can be fed through tubes.

Since it opened in November, it has had 14 Ebola patients. Seven recovered, five died, one was transferred and one is in treatment, a spokeswoman said. (Ten other people who were admitted did not have Ebola.) That is a 42 percent fatality rate, though based on a small sample, for the 12 patients whose fates are clear.

Other units tread a middle ground, relying on what measures they have at hand. The fatality rate at the International Medical Corps hospital in Bong County, Liberia, is about 55 percent, said Dr. Pranav Shetty, the agency’s international emergency health coordinator.

All patients who need IV lines get them, Dr. Shetty said. But when there are too few nurses around, usually at night, the IVs are unhooked, so patients may get only one quart of fluids a day. And only patients still urinating, indicating that their kidneys are working, receive electrolytes.

Spending money on air-conditioning “doesn’t even cross our minds,” Dr. Shetty said, because other needs are more urgent.

When IV lines are impractical, the W.H.O. urges doctors to make patients drink six quarts of rehydration solution a day.

Nigeria’s victory over its Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/ebola-outbreak-in-nigeria-appears-to-be-over.html?_r=0] in September was attributed in part to that. Dr. Adaora Igonoh, a 28-year-old Nigerian physician who survived the disease, became a symbol for the cause: The W.H.O. distributed pictures of her giving a thumbs-up[http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/10/23/358108367/ill-gag-drink-to-that-oral-rehydration-key-for-ebola-patients] while drinking the solution, and Bill Gates blogged about her story[http://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Surviving-Ebola-Dr-Ada-Igonoh], telling how she forced herself to drink despite the repulsive salty taste and her vomiting.

Still, even oral rehydration is hard, doctors say. Patients need anti-nausea drugs and must be pressured to drink. The solution tastes better when refrigerated. But, like air-conditioning, that requires electricity.

Following is a transcript of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s inaugural address[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/cuomo-inaugurated-for-second-term-as-governor.html] on Thursday, as recorded by The New York Times.

Thank you very much. First, to Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy, who said it all. Bob and I have had a heck of a four years together. A lot of late nights, a lot of stress. A lot of bad days, a lot of good days. And in going through the situation that we went through, you really learn a lot about the other person. And a finer public servant, a finer man I have never worked with in my life than Bob Duffy. He epitomizes everything the administration is about. He is hard work. He’s integrity. He’s performance. And he’s in the business for all the right reasons. We’re really going to miss him. We love him. Let’s give him a big round of applause, Lieutenant Governor Bob Duffy.

So we really did have big shoes to fill, literally and metaphorically, when we had to replace Bob Duffy. And we found a superstar, and you heard from her now. The more you see her, the more you’re going to love her. She is great. Former congresswoman from Buffalo, N.Y., and Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul. Let’s give her a round of applause.

I want to thank Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, who is very impressive. Court of Appeals judge. I wonder who appointed her. Oh, I did. That’s right. Let’s give her a round of applause, Sheila Abdus-Salaam.

My good friend for many years, Mayor Bill de Blasio. Thank you very much for being with us, Mayor.

We have our friends from the congressional delegation. Senator Chuck Schumer, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Congressman Pete King, Congressman Engel, I see. Congressman Gregory Meeks — that’s too good-looking to be Gregory Meeks. Is that Gregory? The congressional delegation is very important to the way we do business, for the state to do what it needs to do — Congresswoman Nita Lowey! — for the state to do what it needs to do as aggressively as we’ve been doing it. We really need the federal government to be part of it and to be working with us, and they have been there every step of the way. I call Senator Schumer sometimes; I ask him for some things and I can hear the shock on the other end of the phone. But he never says no, and he always goes to it, and they have delivered for us time and time again — whether it’s money for Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], $60 billion, money for the Tappan Zee Bridge that Congresswoman Lowey got us. Time and time again, they’ve been there. We couldn’t do what we do without them. Let’s give them a round of applause. We thank them very much.

And Speaker Silver and Senator Marty Golden who represent the Senate and the Assembly for us today, who are our partners every step of the way: Pleasure to be with you. Thank them.

Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins: Pleasure to be with you, Andrea. Thank you for your leadership.

County Executive Mangano, County Executive Bellone, and Linda Mangano, pleasure to be with you.

You heard from Reverend Karim Camara, who gave us the opening prayer. He’s also a fantastic, fantastic assemblyman. Pleasure to be with you, Reverend Karim Camara.

Rabbi Michael Miller, who did the opening. He also brought us to Israel right at the time of the intifada, when Israel was really going through a period of violence. We said that was the best time to go because we wanted to make a statement. Some people didn’t understand that logic immediately, but it was the best time to go in terms of a show of solidarity. And I knew Michael in New York and how great he was in New York. You see him in Israel, he’s even stronger. And I was so proud as the governor of New York to lead a delegation that went and visited Israel when Israel really needed friends, and New York was there for Israel, and we always will be. Thank you very much, Michael Miller.

You’re going to hear from Reverend A. R. Bernard who’s been a great friend and is a great inspirational leader for thousands and thousands of New Yorkers — he is going to be doing the closing benediction. Thank you very much, Reverend A. R. Bernard.

Bob Duffy used the word “team” when he talked about my family — he was right. You don’t become governor without a team. You can’t manage the state without a team. And my administration’s all about a quality team. I’m just the good looks of the operation, I want you to know, they really — yeah, then we’d be really in trouble. But it is about my team. Both my professional team and my family, that is a team. And you saw Sandy and Cara and Mariah who are here. I have brothers and sisters. Madeline’s here, Maria’s here, Margaret’s here, Aunt Nancy, Uncle Bob, Lisa, Larry Belinsky, Howard Maier, Uncle Brian and — uh, what’s your name? I see you on CNN every morning. You look just like me, just not as good looking — oh, Chris Cuomo is here! My little brother is here. So they are my family, and they’ve been great all through this.

We’re missing one family member. My father’s not here with us today. We hoped that he was going to be able to come. He’s at home, and he’s not well enough to come. We spent last night with him. We changed the tradition a little bit. We weren’t in Albany last night. We stayed at my father’s house to ring in the New Year with him. I went through the speech with him. He said it was good — especially for a second-termer. See? My father’s a third-termer. But, he sends his regards to all of you. He couldn’t be here physically today, my father. But my father is in this room. He’s in the heart and mind of every person who’s here. He’s here, and he’s here, and his inspiration and his legacy and his experience is what has brought this state to this point. So let’s give him a round of applause.

And I want to thank you all very much for taking the time to be here on a New Year. It’s fitting. When we begin a new year, it’s a natural point of reflection. We review the past, we plan for the future, we make great resolutions on how we’re going to do even better. I want you to know that my resolutions are still intact. It’s been 12 hours, which is a new record for me.

Four years ago, when I took office, as you heard from Kathy and you heard from Bob, New York was a much, much different place. And we were facing daunting challenges. More people unemployed than at any time since the Great Depression[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], when we took over. Upstate New York was hemorrhaging young people. You’d go to the airports, and you’d see young people getting on planes because they believed there was no future left in upstate New York. The state government, that was supposed to help, was supposed to be solving problems, was all about gridlock and all about dysfunction. And there was a pervasive, foreboding sense that the best days of New York were behind it, and that it was getting worse. And you felt that sense growing. I said at my first inauguration that we can’t underestimate the severity of the times, that this was not a moment for more speeches. It was about action. It was about results, and it was not about rhetoric. And that is what we did. We made the government work. We restored the economy. We created 500,000 private-sector jobs. This state today has 7.6 million jobs, more jobs than have ever existed in the history of the State of New York. That’s what we have today.

We turned a $10 billion deficit into a $5 billion surplus. We put cranes in the sky in places that thought they were extinct. We expanded affordable housing. We passed universal pre-K. We gave hard-working families a tax cut. We expanded health care to cover — 1.5 million more New Yorkers are covered now than there were before. We made New York fairer with marriage equality. We made New York safer by passing sensible gun control. We set a national standard and committed this state to be the first state in the nation to end the AIDS epidemic in the next decade, and we’re going to do it.

We did this. And the emphasis is on the “we.” We are the upstate business people who chose to stay and continue to hope. We are the public employees — the teachers, the police, the firefighters who serve and protect. We are the members of the New York State Assembly. We are the members of the New York State Senate. We are the colleagues in the federal delegation. We are Republicans and Democrats who put New York first and political parties second, even in this age of hyperpartisanship, because we remembered what we were there to do — which was to serve the public and not serve our political interests. We are the New Yorkers who put aside our differences to find commonality to move this state forward.

Now, even with all we have done, our task is far from complete. We have much more to do. We have to rebuild the upstate economy, all across upstate New York, by replicating the successful model that we’ve used in Buffalo. We must address chronic high poverty in this state in many of our urban areas, from the South Bronx to Rochester. We must demand that the value of an hour’s work — the minimum wage — is sufficient to mean that you don’t have to choose between paying the rent and putting food on the table. We still lock up too many young people in prisons, at too young an age, at too great a cost. And that has to stop.

Women are still too often victims of violence and are still trapped under a glass ceiling and still need a full Women’s Equality Act to give them full equality in this society.

We must maintain our fiscal discipline and continue to provide tax relief for struggling families and growing businesses.

We must do more for ethics reform to build trust, which is the lifeblood of any government.

Our education system, while better than it was, is far from what we need to lead the global economy. We have new and growing challenges we didn’t have before, such as climate change and extreme weather, which have brought New York tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms and floods. Seven feet of snow in Buffalo, more than ever before, that’s saying something. I wouldn’t be surprised to see locusts next, coming up Broadway. We have new challenges to our public health system, like the Ebola virus. We have new challenges to our public safety system, where 13 years after 9/11 terrorism has metastasized from Africa to Asia, from Hamas to ISIS.

These are challenges, to be sure. But the past four years have renewed our confidence and have shown us what we can accomplish when we work together. Remember how far we’ve come. It’s time to be bold, my friends, because there is no small solution to big problems. We can do all this that I’ve mentioned, and we can do more. And we must.

Because in many ways the most severe problems we face go beyond the borders of our state, and the challenges are profound. We’ve seen the national unrest and the national discord. The American promise itself is being questioned. The offer of fairness and opportunity that was the American compact is now in doubt.

Americans are disheartened, disappointed by the economic climate, and rightly so. We are told the recession is over. We read reports that say the economic numbers are going up, up and up — but we work harder, and we earn less.

Income inequality is at the highest point in over a century. While American capitalism never guaranteed success, it did guarantee opportunity. And too many Americans are questioning the long-held belief that their children’s future will be better than their own. For too many, the dream of economic mobility has been replaced with the nightmare of economic stagnation.

For previous generations our education system offered hope. It was the escalator out of poverty. The public education system could take an Italian immigrant’s son from the back of a grocery store in South Jamaica to become the governor of the State of New York. It could take an African-American boy from the Bronx and see him become the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It could take a child of Bedford-Stuyvesant and make that person the C.E.O. of a Fortune 500 bank.

But that was yesterday’s public education system. Today, we have two education systems, if we want to tell the truth: one for the rich, and one for the poor. And if you happen to be born in the wrong Zip code and go to a failing school, you will get left behind and never catch up. Public education that was the great equalizer in the society has become in some communities the great discriminator. Today’s high-tech advanced manufacturing economy, demanding lifelong learning, has squeezed the middle class, and people feel left out and left behind. And that’s not all.

If the American dream of economic opportunity was a basic component in the compact defining America, than the second component was our justice system. And our justice system ensured the promise of fairness and security for all. Our national symbol of justice, Lady Justice, carries a sword, a set of scales, and she also wears a blindfold. Why? To signify objectivity. Objectivity that one’s wealth, one’s class, one’s race are irrelevant to the pursuit of justice.

But today, sadly, too many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact, or does the justice system now see black and white, or black and blue, or rich and poor? The world saw an African-American man in Staten Island die. And people are confused, disappointed and angry. Law-enforcement officials have been wrongfully targeted, and even assassinated. The situation has devolved into one which everyone is talking but no one is listening.

It must stop, and it’s time for the truth.

The truth is: The justice system does need review. The truth is: There are troubling questions that have been raised that must be answered. The truth is: Police officers do need more safety and need more protection. The truth is: Law enforcement needs to respect the community as much as the community needs to respect law enforcement. The truth is: It is our obligation as leaders to provide the reforms necessary to ensure safety. This is a New York City issue, it is a Buffalo issue, it is a Ferguson issue, a Los Angeles issue, but it is also our responsibility to solve it here, in the State of New York. And that is a challenge that we are up to.

Yesterday a young gentleman congratulated me on my re-election, and he said, “You know, I wish you good luck, governor,” with a sort of sad face. And I said, “Why is that?” And he said, “Well, you’re going to govern in very troubled times.” He told the truth, and he was right. These are troubled times.

When Americans questioning our economic system. When they’re questioning whether or not they have economic mobility. When they’re questioning whether or not their children are going to do better. When they’re questioning whether or not the public education system is working for them. When they’re questioning our justice system and whether or not our justice system is fair. They are questioning the essence of everything we believed in. Those are the primary democratic institutions of this country. That was the essential compact we made, and that’s what they’re questioning.

And that is the challenge before us: to be fearless enough to admit the truth. To talk about these problems no matter how difficult, because you will never solve a problem you are unwilling to admit. And then we must act, and we must perform, and we must deliver results that answer these questions and right these wrongs and restore confidence in what America is all about and what New York is all about.

We can do this. We can create economic opportunity for all. We can raise the minimum wage. We can create good jobs. We can get minority youth the training. We can use job-training credits. We can create the best education system in the world. We can beat the bureaucracy. We can get results. We can make the changes that we need to make. We can get the resources that we need. And we can restore confidence and trust in the justice system, both in perception and in reality.

Now you can say: “Well, governor, those are big challenges. Those are big challenges, and I don’t know if we can do it.” Yes they are big challenges, and yes they will be hard to accomplish. But my friends, that is what New Yorkers do. And that is what we have always done. We have always taken on the big challenges — taken them on first, gotten them done, and then created an example for the rest of the nation.

We started with the Erie Canal in 1812. Here in New York City you think New York City made New York City. No, the Erie Canal made New York City. Governor DeWitt Clinton had a dream. The question was who was going to open up access to the West. How could you get goods by water to the West? And Thomas Jefferson and Washington and Virginia were trying to dig a series of canals that would get you to the Mississippi and that would open the West. And that would have made Virginia the main port. And DeWitt Clinton said: “No, I have a great idea. We’ll use New York. And you can come up the Hudson River and you get to Albany and then you make a left and you go through the state and you come out in Buffalo, and once you’re in Buffalo, you are in the Great Lakes. And then you could go wherever you want to go.” They said: “Governor, one question, when you make the left at Buffalo — at Albany — how do you get to Buffalo?” He said, “No problem, we’ll dig a canal.” Dig a canal? Five hundred and twenty-four miles. Eighteen-twelve. Built that canal. No hydraulics. Men, women and mules, they dug that Erie Canal. It made New York what it was. They came through New York City to go up the Hudson River to get to the Erie Canal. When DeWitt Clinton started that project, they wanted to impeach him because they thought he lost his mind. Literally. They said it can’t be done. It’s too ambitious. They did it. They did it on time. They did it on budget. It worked. It made New York State what New York State is, and it accelerated the whole development of the United States. That’s who we are. That’s the stock we come from.

When they were talking about a dream of women’s rights and women’s suffrage, where did they go? They went to New York. And Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, ‘Yes, we can do this,’ and it is the New York women who came together and organized and got women the right to vote. When they stood up and said in the ’60s, gays deserve equal rights, it was us, at Stonewall, who stood up and said, ‘That’s right, gay people deserve equal rights.’ New York was there first. When a big state had to pass marriage equality because we were discriminating against gay people, and not letting them marry was just another source of discrimination, and you needed a big state to stand up and pass it — and it was hard — it was New York that passed marriage equality. And it resonated all across the country.

After Sandy Hook, when we saw the massacre and we saw the children killed and we said, ‘Enough is enough with this lunacy of guns,’ and you needed a state to pass sensible gun control, who did it? The State of New York did it. We did it first. That is who we are, and that’s where we come from.

Frederick Douglass once said, “If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” We know that in New York. Nothing comes easy. None of the ones worth it come easy. If it comes easy, you didn’t need it in the first place. And this is a uniquely New York moment. Because when things are at their worst, New Yorkers are at their best. And to any of those who have a question about our capacity, just look at where we are today: the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. The high point of New York, on the same site as the low point of New York at 9/11. Why? Because that’s who we are. That’s what this site says, that’s what this building says: You knock us down, we get up twice as tall. You give us adversity, we turn it into opportunity. You try to divide us, and we come back more unified and tighter than ever before. And that’s what these challenges are asking us to do: to take that great diversity that is New York, and to find the commonality and to come together for the good of New York.

And once again, the emphasis is on “we.” We, as my father said so well, we are the family of New York, he called it, a collection of the most daring, bold, accepting people from every country on the globe. Every color, every creed is here in New York. Gay and straight, upstate and downstate, working together to make our diversity a source of strength and not of weakness, and to find our commonality, all for the same mutual goal of making New York a better state.

We will do this, and we will lead the nation by our example once again, because this is New York, and we are New Yorkers, and this is what we do.

E. B. White said, New York is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village. The visible symbol of aspiration and faith. The white plumes saying the way is up. That is New York. The symbol forward. The symbol that shows us the direction that is up.

Thank you, and God bless you.

Medical community is engaged in debate over use of intravenous hydration on patients infected by Ebola in West African countries, treatment that many attribute to the higher survival rate of patients treated in the West; debate comes at time when focus of aid efforts is shifting from stopping spread of disease, which seems to be under control, toward saving lives of those infected.

How Times Reporters Unraveled the Ebola Epidemic

Celia W. Dugger, deputy science editor for health, has helped to coordinate the Times’s coverage of Ebola. She edited a feature published Tuesday on the origin of this year’s Ebola outbreak [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html?_r=0], and shares how the story came together after months of reporting.

As the Ebola epidemic gained velocity this fall, spreading fear and death across one of the world’s poorest regions, I kept coming back to the same questions: How did this one get away? How did the experts — and the media, including editors like me, for that matter — miss the signs in the spring that this time would be catastrophically different from the nearly two dozen prior outbreaks? Why did the most seasoned Ebola hands — men and women who had repeatedly risked their lives battling this lethal foe — let their guard down and scale back in May just when the virus might have been throttled?

A team of New York Times reporters spent the past two months trying to answer those questions and to gather facts for a first draft of the early history of an epidemic that began in the forests of Guinea a year ago. The result of their labors, “How Ebola Roared Back,” was published Tuesday in a special section of Science Times.

The first step was assembling the reporters. Adam Nossiter, the Times correspondent based in Dakar, Senegal, was immersed in covering the news on Ebola in West Africa, but sent two early memos from the cradle of the outbreak in Guinea and Guinea’s capital, Conakry, that provided crucial leads and fodder for the story.

Sheri Fink, Pam Belluck and Kevin Sack then immersed themselves single-mindedly in the painstaking work of interviewing nearly 200 people and producing more than 350,000 words of notes for what would become a 7,604 word article.

Ms. Fink, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who joined The Times a year ago, spent weeks in the borderlands of Liberia and Sierra Leone, staying in guesthouses with no plumbing or running water and often no electricity. I asked her to report on an episode that scientists believed had seeded the explosive spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone: the burial of a respected traditional healer.

But Ms. Fink gradually pieced together a far more disturbing story. As she spoke to the healer’s relatives and an ever widening circle of inhabitants in Kpondu, where the woman was buried, and other nearby villages, Ms. Fink realized that the healer was likely not the first to be infected in the country — that, though the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone would not be confirmed until late May, the contagion had likely taken root there in late February or early March, killing those who cared for each other in a terrible chain of death. Ms. Fink ultimately traced the start of the contagion back to a 37-year-old woman named Sia Wanda Koniono who had traveled from Guinea.

But the true horror of this story awaited Ms. Fink upon her return to New York. It was then that she obtained the 17-page report of a team of investigators from Guinea’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. By March, that team had already documented two suspected cases of Ebola in women from Kpondu and a neighboring village in Sierra Leone — but no officials in Sierra Leone were ever told, and so the sick were never found to be treated and isolated. The contagion spread silently. Sierra Leone now has had more cases of Ebola than any other country. When Ms. Fink began to read the report on her laptop, she did a search for Ms. Koniono’s name. It immediately popped up as the first suspicious case in Sierra Leone.

“I actually cried,” Ms. Fink said. “I couldn’t believe she was known about from the very earliest moment. It just blew my mind. How could this information not have been shared?

In New York, Ms. Belluck, a reporter who has served on the metro, national and science desks of The Times in her 19 years at the paper, was working the phones, interviewing dozens of key players. She talked again and again to the men and women who worked for Doctors Without Borders, Samaritan’s Purse, and the World Health Organization and who were on the ground in West Africa in the early months of the fight to contain Ebola. Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician from Canada who was working with the W.H.O. for a year, told her about his harrowing effort to bring a deathly sick woman in for treatment in Conakry, but gave up as a menacing crowd gathered at nightfall outside the family’s home. Dr. Tim Jagatic, a 33-year-old family doctor from Canada who had volunteered to care for the sick with Doctors Without Borders, confided in Ms. Belluck about how terrifying it was to treat people infected with a virus that seemed to kill even some of the doctors and nurses who tried hardest to take all the recommended precautions. Ms. Belluck unearthed many of the nuggets that gave the story heart, substance and drama.

“I love being a bloodhound and following clues that lead to undiscovered information,” she said. “It was exciting to be part of a big story where you felt the time bomb of Ebola was still ticking and something you found out might make a difference.”

Mr. Sack, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and a member of The Times’s investigative staff, also plunged into reporting the story. He interviewed many of the early responders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based in Atlanta, as is Mr. Sack. Dr. Pierre Rollin, the C.D.C.’s top Ebola expert, became a central character in the story.

Mr. Sack first came to the Ebola story when the contagion arrived in Dallas, as a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, sickened and died there. “It was compelling to go back in time and see with great clarity and a lot of detail how we had gotten to the point where this became an American story as well an African one,” he said.

It fell to Mr. Sack to fashion a compelling, epic tale from the team’s voluminous reporting. The reporters shared 192,000 words of notes in a Google document. Mr. Sack read, and reread the shared notes, highlighting the most critical passages in green, and those just beneath that in importance in yellow. Gradually, he winnowed the material down. From the start, he also maintained a highly detailed timeline that would provide the spine of the story’s chronological telling. Ms. Fink drafted passages from her reporting in Liberia and a chapter on Sierra Leone. Those were drawn from another 174,000 words of notes in her own files.

Mr. Sack wove the team’s contributions into a seamless whole. And he came away with this thought.

“Even though things are starting to improve in some places, it’s vital that all the parties involved learn the lesson of the spring — that you can’t relent,” he said. “There’s no such thing as almost contained with this virus.”

Condition of British Ebola Patient Worsens

LONDON — A British health worker who is being treated for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in a London hospital is now in critical condition, her doctors said on Saturday.

The patient, Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse from Scotland who had volunteered with the charity Save the Children to care for Ebola victims in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], returned to Glasgow, Scotland[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/world/europe/britain-ebola-case-reported-in-glasgow.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22}], last Sunday. She was hospitalized with a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and given an Ebola diagnosis on Monday, then transferred to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Initial reports suggested that Ms. Cafferkey’s condition was stable, but the hospital said in a statement released Saturday that it was “sorry to announce that the condition of Pauline Cafferkey has gradually deteriorated over the past two days.”

The case of Ms. Cafferkey, who had flown via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport to Glasgow, has raised questions about the effectiveness of the Ebola screening at Heathrow, a global air hub. The nurse had told officials at the airport that she believed she was developing a fever, and her temperature was taken seven times over a short period, the BBC reported. But when it was normal, she was allowed to continue her travel.

All passengers and crew members who were on the British Airways flight from Heathrow to Glasgow with Ms. Cafferkey have been contacted and given health advice, said a spokeswoman for Health Protection Scotland, which oversees infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and environmental hazards. All British-based passengers and crew members on the Royal Air Maroc flight from Casablanca to London have also been contacted, the BBC reported. International passengers on that flight are being traced by international authorities, it said.

Ms. Cafferkey, whose infection is the second known case of Ebola in Britain, is being treated with an experimental antiviral drug and blood from Ebola survivors. The previous patient, William Pooley, also a nurse, recovered. He had been treated in the same hospital with another experimental drug, ZMapp, that has also shown promise in treating some patients. But there is a global shortage of ZMapp[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/us-to-increase-production-of-experimental-drug-but-may-not-meet-demand.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22}], and none was available for Ms. Cafferkey.

News of her deteriorating condition came as a South Korean health worker who had come into contact with an Ebola victim in Sierra Leone five days ago was reportedly being monitored at a Berlin hospital for symptoms. No details about the Korean’s identity have been released. Since an Ebola outbreak began in West Africa a year ago, there have been almost 20,000 cases and more than 7,800 deaths, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin.

IN the new year, it goes without saying that we should all eat more vegetables, exercise more often, tweet or text a little less and pray a little more. But for the professional pundit, there’s really only one resolution that matters: Be less wrong.

So in that spirit, here is my annual inventory of the places where I went astray in 2014, offered in the hope that beginning 2015 with a confession will lead to fewer mistakes in the year to come.

1. I thought Jeb Bush wasn’t really serious about 2016. In two columns on the Republican presidential field, in March[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/douthat-four-factions-no-favorite.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fross-douthat] and in November[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-the-fight-republicans-need-now.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fross-douthat], I didn’t exactly write off a Bush candidacy. But I spent far more time on Marco Rubio (whose chances I felt were being underestimated) and Rand Paul, and to a lesser extent Chris Christie and Ted Cruz, than I did on the former Florida governor.

That’s because I strongly suspected various forces would keep Bush on the sidelines: his wife’s likely opposition, a sense of Bush-dynasty fatigue among the party’s machers, and all the very human reasons a wealthy, comfortable, relaxed 60-something who last campaigned for office a dozen years ago might decide to pass on the presidential madhouse.

These suspicions could still be vindicated; Bush’s recently announced “exploration” could end before the first primary vote is cast. But he suddenly looks much more like a full-speed-ahead candidate than I expected, and — in what counts as clear bad news for Rubio and Christie, among others — many of the party’s donors and operatives seem not at all [http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/jeb-bush-already-winning-over-some-supporters-christie-rubio-n273151]deterred[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/us/politics/gop-donors-seek-to-narrow-field-of-presidential-candidates-to-one.html] by his fraternal connection to a deeply unpopular president.

Jeb the serious candidate isn’t Jeb the front-runner, or at least not yet. But his apparent plan to run is a big, important 2016 fact, and one my 2014 columns failed to sufficiently anticipate.

2. I was too optimistic about the prospects for demilitarizing the police. In an August column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-playing-soldier-in-the-suburbs.html] during the early days of protest in Ferguson, Mo., I argued that while many reforms to the criminal justice system might come with difficult trade-offs, the case for limiting the flow of heavy weapons — grenade launchers, armored cars, and so on — from the military to local police departments was “easy, uncomplicated, clear.” Crime rates keep falling, the threat of terrorism is more marginal than it seemed after 9/11, and there isn’t a justification for giving cops in places like Ferguson the armaments of an occupying force. 

To which I would have been wise to add: “And yet they’re likely to keep getting weapons anyway.” The flurry of congressional interest faded[http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-25/how-police-unions-stopped-congress-from-militarization-reform] once police unions flexed some muscle. The White House is notionally committed to tougher standards, but its proposals[http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/01/obama-doesnt-really-care-about-police-mi] seem likely to add paperwork without meaningfully reducing the flow of arms. 

Programs in motion tend to stay in motion, that much is always true. But I didn’t foresee that Ferguson itself, initially a story that produced bipartisan sympathy for the protesters, would turn into a weak and polarizing exhibit in the case for policing reform.

The persistent rioting made the argument that the cops needed all their gear seem more plausible (though I am not convinced), and the facts of the original tragedy, the shooting of Michael Brown, turned out to make a weaker case against the police than suggested by the initial coverage. 

The hard truth — which is also on display in New York right now — is that crime and punishment stir up (for good reason) the strongest of human emotions, which makes achieving consensus on reform slow, hard work. This process can be hastened by particular injustices, but when the facts are bad or complicated, it can just as easily be set back.

3. I gave America’s Ebola countermeasures too little credit. In an October column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-the-ebola-scare.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fross-douthat] on the public health fiascos that allowed the deadly virus to infect American health care workers, I wrote that if “we manage to contain Ebola domestically, then the president and his appointees will look more competent and levelheaded than their critics.” But I wasn’t particularly confident in that outcome, and so — worried about a wider outbreak — I also wrote that “travel restrictions increasingly seem like an appropriate hedge against ongoing domestic incompetence.”

Two months later, there has been no wider outbreak, most of the cases treated domestically have resulted in a cure, and the president and his appointees can reasonably claim vindication. (As can Dr. Paul Farmer, the famous physician-humanitarian, who argued in an October essay[http://www.lrb.co.uk.proxy.bc.edu/v36/n20/paul-farmer/diary] for the London Review of Books that with Western standards of medical treatment, Ebola victims could have a 90 percent survival rate.) So I was too alarmist, often a pundit’s besetting vice.

But while pessimism can be an analytic mistake, it’s the happiest way to be wrong. So if infallibility remains out of reach, my hope for 2015 is that my columns will only err in undue pessimism, and that reality will only surprise me — and you, and all of us — with good news.

I invite you to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/DouthatNYT[http://twitter.com/DouthatNYT].

Maureen Dowd and Nicholas Kristof are off. Starting today, Thomas L. Friedman’s column is temporarily being published only on Wednesdays.

Correction: January 3, 2015, Saturday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Jeb Bush’s relationship with George W. Bush. It is fraternal, of course, not filial.

Adviser Guides Obama Into the Google Age

WASHINGTON — President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s top technology adviser cringes when she hears highly educated adults say how bad they are at science and math, particularly when they do so in front of children.

“That has to change,” the adviser, Megan J. Smith, firmly told a group of teachers at the White House not long ago. “We would never say that about reading.”

Ms. Smith, 50, an M.I.T.-trained mechanical engineer and former Google executive, is working hard to bring her Silicon Valley sensibility to the Obama administration. But four months into her job as the chief technology officer of the United States, the woman whose division at Google dreamed up Google Glass and the driverless car is facing culture shock in a federal bureaucracy ruled by creaky technology and run in part on the floppy disk.

Not only does she now carry a BlackBerry, she uses a 2013 Dell laptop: new by government standards, but clunky enough compared with the cutting-edge devices of her former life that her young son asked what it was.

So far, she has adopted a cheery tone.

“We’re on it,” she said of trying to solve the administration’s technology problems a year after the disastrous rollout of the federal health insurance website, healthcare.gov[http://healthcare.gov/]. “This is the administration that’s working to upgrade that and fix it.”

Ms. Smith advised the president on the technological issues before his decision late last year to come out strongly in favor of a free and open Internet[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/technology/obama-net-neutrality-fcc.html], including making sure that Mr. Obama heard from Vinton G. Cerf, Google’s vice president and one of the chief architects of the Internet, and Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. “Having the engineering voice saying, ‘This is how the technology works,’ was very important,” she said.

She came up with the idea for a brainstorming-and-prototyping day at TechShop, a “maker space” in suburban Virginia, where teams of health experts, engineers and designers worked on improving protective suits for health workers fighting the Ebola virus.

She has also briefed the president on ways to recruit top technologists, particularly women, into the government to build state-of-the-art digital and mobile services.

Ms. Smith herself, the country’s third chief technology officer and the first woman to hold the job, is one of a small but growing number of female scientists at the White House. Four of the five divisions of the Office of Science and Technology Policy are headed by women. Last month, Ms. Smith created a page on the White House website devoted to “the untold history of women in science and technology,” including the stories of pioneers like Ada Lovelace, the world’s first programmer.

“It’s our country, so if we show up or not, that shapes what our government’s going to be,” Ms. Smith said one recent afternoon between meetings near her open-plan office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She sits at a small wooden computer desk surrounded by 11 colleagues, with numerous whiteboards covered with black and green scribbles lining the walls.

The problem, technology experts say, is that the mandate of the chief technology officer has been nebulous since Mr. Obama created the job five years ago, not least because it does not come with a substantial funding stream, a crucial source of power in the government.

And while Mr. Obama started the United States Digital Service[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/11/fact-sheet-improving-and-simplifying-digital-services] in August to upgrade the government’s technology systems and improve its websites after the healthcare.gov meltdown, that team is housed in the Office of Management and Budget and overseen by a chief information officer, a position that does not currently have a permanent occupant.

“The real struggle for Megan Smith is that while this role does have a direct line to the presidency, it does not have much of a budget or any authority over other agencies,” said Clay Johnson, the co-founder and chief executive of the Department of Better Technology[http://www.dobt.co/], who also co-founded Blue State Digital, the company that ran Mr. Obama’s online campaign in 2008. He worked in the Obama administration as a presidential innovation fellow.

Comparing the government’s infrastructure to a burning building, Mr. Johnson suggested that a high-profile technology visionary might be poorly suited to help. “I wish they had people in there for this last two years that could make the trains run on time, not somebody who has big ideas,” he said.

Ms. Smith has had ideas, and a curiosity about how things work, from a very young age. The daughter of a public housing consultant (her father) and a schoolteacher (her mother), she built at age 4 an elaborate scarecrow with sticks and tinfoil in her Buffalo backyard. At 14, she took apart her stepmother’s Schwinn bicycle just to figure out how it fit together, then left the parts in a bucket.

A formative experience came in eighth grade, during the energy crisis of the Carter administration, when she used a circular saw in her father’s basement workshop to build a solar-powered house for one of her public magnet school’s mandatory science fairs. “I learned that not only was this work interesting and impactful,” Ms. Smith said, “but also that I could do it.”

By the time she was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she was sneaking into the mechanical engineering shop with friends to build a solar-powered car, then racing it 2,000 miles across the Australian outback. (They came in ninth.)

She later joined Apple Computer in Tokyo and then General Magic, an early maker of wireless hand-held devices, before jumping to PlanetOut, a site for gays and lesbians, where she became chief executive in 2001. Two years later, she went to Google, where she led major acquisitions, including Google Earth and Google Maps.

She is separated from her wife, Kara Swisher, the technology journalist and co-executive editor of Re/code, with whom she has two sons.

Ms. Smith came to the White House after she caught the eye of Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama’s senior adviser and confidante, three years ago at a Silicon Valley event on attracting girls and women to science. “She is infectiously energetic,” Ms. Jarrett said. “She has been able to translate for those of us who are not as well versed in technology how we can use innovation to do good.”

How much Ms. Smith will be able to haul the Obama administration away from floppy disks is another question. But her supporters, at least, are optimistic.

Aneesh Chopra, Mr. Obama’s first chief technology officer, said Ms. Smith had “a tinkerer’s enthusiasm for finding problems and looking for ways to solve them,” and a “mind-set of execution and getting things done.”

Correction: January 7, 2015, Wednesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about Megan J. Smith, President Obama’s top technology adviser, misstated Clay Johnson’s part in Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign. Mr. Johnson co-founded the company that ran the online campaign; he did not run Mr. Obama’s online campaign himself.

An American health care worker who experienced a high risk of exposure to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus while in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] was being flown to a hospital in Nebraska for observation and possible treatment, hospital officials announced on Saturday.

The patient, who officials said was not showing symptoms of infection, was expected to arrive in Omaha aboard a private air ambulance on Sunday around 2 p.m. Central time, the University of Nebraska Medical Center[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_nebraska/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said in a news release.

The patient will be taken to the hospital’s Biocontainment Patient Care Unit for three weeks of observation, a hospital official said.

“This patient has been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,” said Dr. Philip Smith, the medical director of the biocontainment unit. “However, we will be taking all appropriate precautions.”

The hospital has treated three patients who contracted Ebola overseas. Dr. Rick Sacra, a missionary physician who contracted the virus[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/us/aid-worker-recovering-from-ebola.html] while working in Monrovia, Liberia, was treated for three weeks and released in September.

Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman for NBC News, who fell ill[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/us/ashoka-mukpo-nbc-cameraman-with-ebola-to-return-to-us.html] while also working in Monrovia, was treated and released in October.

The third patient, Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon and a United States permanent resident, contracted the disease in his native Sierra Leone. He was gravely ill when he arrived in November and died[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/us/martin-salia-omaha-ebola-dead.html] after two days of treatment, the hospital said.

The new patient will be monitored for Ebola in the same room used for treatment of the first three patients, Dr. Smith said.

The current outbreak of Ebola has killed nearly 8,000 people[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html] worldwide, mostly in the West African nations Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Boston braces for trial.

Jury selection started [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/us/boston-marathon-jury-selection.html]today in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, who is accused of planting bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/boston-marathon-bombings-trial-what-you-need-to-know.html].

He has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in the attack that killed three and wounded more than 260, and in the killing of an M.I.T. police officer.

Of the 1,200 people in the jury pool, only those willing to consider imposing the death penalty[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/us/boston-marathon-jury-selection.html] if he is convicted can be chosen.

• At the White House.

President Obama returned to the White House t after a two-week family vacation in Hawaii, but he won’t be there long.

Mr. Obama is taking a three-state trip this week[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/us/politics/in-a-switch-obama-will-offer-a-state-of-the-union-preview-during-a-3-day-tour-.html] to lay out executive actions and policy proposals for college education, homeownership and job creation.

• Syrian refugees face restrictions.

Lebanon, whose population of four million has swelled more than 25 percent with a tide of Syrians escaping the war next door, requires visas for new refugees starting today[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/world/as-refugee-tide-swells-lebanon-plans-a-visa-requirement-for-syrians.html].

The United Nations says there are more refugees worldwide than at any time since World War II.

• Search for AirAsia plane expands.

An Indonesian naval patrol vessel said today it may have found the tail of the jet, where the black box voice and flight data recorders are stored.

After strong currents last week, ships and aircraft seeking debris and bodies widened the search area today[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/01/05/world/asia/05reuters-indonesia-airplane.html].

• Prepare for the chill.

Frigid temperatures begin pushing their way across the U.S. today[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/04/us/ap-us-winter-weather-qa.html], and it’s going to get even colder later in the week.

• Release of grand jury records.

A New York State Supreme Court justice is scheduled to rule today on whether to release grand jury records in the case of Eric Garner[http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/01/post_1053.html].

The jury decided last month not to indict a white New York police officer whose chokehold led to the death of Mr. Garner, an unarmed black man.

BACK STORY

Still on your New Year’s fitness routine? Way to go.

Now the bad news: More than half of those who make resolutions will fail to keep them for more than six months[http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/], according to a University of Scranton study.

Gym owners rely on the fact that your resolve will weaken within the next few weeks. So-called resolutioners contribute to the January spike in gym memberships[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/new-years-resolutions-recycled-are-a-boon-for-business.html], and many of them will still pay monthly fees long after giving up.

Of course, those memberships are not required to get fit. An American College of Sports Medicine survey says that body weight training and high-intensity interval training[http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2014/11000/WORLDWIDE_SURVEY_OF_FITNESS_TRENDS_FOR_2015_.5.aspx] are the top two fitness trends this year, and they require neither special equipment nor a full hour each day.

In fact, you might not need much more than an app. The Times has one online[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/projects/workouts/], and there are many others.

Identifying an attainable fitness goal[http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/12/new_year_s_resolution_tips_how_to_start_exercising_and_lose_weight.html] — and not beating yourself up if you stumble — could increase the chances of succeeding, according to Dr. Jordan D. Metzl, a sports medicine specialist.

Debt Dispute Between Hedge Funds and Argentina at Impasse
By JONATHAN GILBERT

BUENOS AIRES — The hopes of easing a debt dispute between Argentina and a group of New York hedge funds seemed to be dashed on Monday after the country’s economy minister made an offer that appeared to fall well short of what the investors were seeking.

Argentina made the informal offer after a potentially onerous legal clause in its bonds ceased to apply on Dec. 31. The hedge funds, known as holdouts, had sued Argentina in the United States to get full payments on bonds that the country defaulted on in 2001.

The provision that expired on Dec. 31, known as the rights-upon-future-offers clause, had prohibited Argentina from paying out better terms to the holdouts than it had to investors who had accepted less money in debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010. Now, the country can, in theory, strike a deal with the holdouts without facing demands from the other creditors.

Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, said Argentina’s overtures to the holdouts would be on the same terms that it had offered other bondholders, with some sweeteners.

But Argentina is still asking the holdouts to accept a haircut of 65 percent on the bond principal, Mr. Kicillof told a local news website over the weekend. He said it would be “as if the exchange were taking place in 2005.” He did claim, however, that Argentina would offer some extra money, such as all the accrued interest on the discounted bonds since 2005.

The holdouts, led by Paul Singer’s hedge fund, Elliott Management, and other bondholders that did not file suit, are owed a total of $23 billion, Mr. Kicillof estimated. Under the most recent preliminary offer, he said, they would receive $6.5 billion.

The holdouts have already repeatedly refused offers of around 30 cents on the dollar, including in the hours leading up to the default.

The dispute with the bondholders stems from Argentina’s default in 2001. Most investors who held bonds that were in default exchanged them for new ones with so-called haircuts, accepting less than they were owed. But a group of hedge funds led by Mr. Singer did not exchange their bonds and instead took Argentina to court in an attempt to be paid full value for them, gaining the name holdouts.

In 2012, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Argentina could not service its restructured debt if it did not pay the litigating holdout creditors, in full, at the same time. Argentina has so far not done so, and in September, the same judge found the nation in contempt of court [http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/judge-finds-argentina-in-contempt-in-bond-case/].

The latest negotiations seem to be at an impasse.

There appears to have been no formal discussion of the latest offer. A source close to the holdouts said Mr. Kicillof’s remarks represented “simply the same take-it-or-leave-it offer from 2005 and demonstrate that he is not serious about negotiating a resolution.”

“The two sides are so far apart that it is not meaningful,” Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York, said of the offer. “The holdouts want their original par. Argentina is still only offering a fraction of what they are legally entitled to receive.”

The testy relationship between Argentina and the bondholders has been a battle of public relations. Mr. Kicillof has called the holdouts the “Ebola of the international financial system.” They, along with Judge Griesa, have also been called “vultures” in Argentina, seeking to scavenge [http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/argentina-is-in-default-and-also-maybe-in-denial/] on the remnants of the nation’s 2001 default.

Mr. Kicillof has previously said that Argentina would not move beyond its earlier offers. Some analysts expected Argentina to budge so that it could regain access to global debt markets to increase foreign currency reserves it needs for servicing debt and energy imports. But it has recently managed to stabilize its reserves by other means, including a currency swap with China.

Ms. Morden said only “extraordinary economic stress,” like a balance-of-payments crisis, which for now seems unlikely, would force Argentina to concede ground to the holdouts.

Peter Eavis contributed reporting from New York.

A turbulent[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/a-tumultuous-year-at-the-times/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body] year at The Times is over, and with that, the executive editor, Dean Baquet, has written a lengthy note to the newsroom staff, titled “Charting the Future.” After writing about this myself last week[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/17-hopes-and-dreams-for-the-times-in-the-new-year/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body], I thought that readers might like this inside look. Mr. Baquet did not object to the internal document being made public. Here it is:

Dear Colleagues,

By any measure, 2014 was a dramatic year — a sudden leadership change ending with the departure of treasured colleagues. But those headlines belie what you all accomplished for readers and the world.

We have enhanced our standing as the greatest investigative news organization, with tough, questioning coverage of Ebola, the shenanigans in Albany and Moscow, a world struggling with continuing turmoil in the Middle East, the kidnappings and murders of fellow journalists, the crisis of a broken jail system and lax auto regulation, a world of college sports gone awry, and a country divided by race and income. We continue to produce extraordinary visual journalism, from the courageous work of photographers around the world to the remarkable combination of text, video and graphics in our end-of-the-year Ebola presentation. The Upshot, in many ways, is one of the great news creations of the year, a digital-first synthesis of virtually every part of The Times that may serve as a model for the future of news departments.

Don’t allow the turmoil in the news business make you forget just how good we are, and that we are here to break big stories and ask hard questions of the powerful.

Our coverage remains fabulous — and our goals for the coming year are very clear. We will fix the things the buyouts broke. We will look internally to fill important jobs. We will carefully and judiciously make a few outside hires. I know it seems incongruous to hire after reducing the staff. But if we stop bringing in new talent we run the risk of missing a generation of future stars.

We will soon begin rebuilding our media team. The culture and sports reports will continue to get new faces and energy. And building a powerhouse political team also is among our main coverage goals for the year. The redesign of the Sunday magazine has already begun. And our next big investigative projects are in the works.

But as good as our journalism is, and will continue to be, we have to face profound questions: What will we do to make sure we remain great for generations to come? And what is the newsroom’s role in securing our future?

In the 1970s, The New York Times faced a crisis larger than anything we are grappling with now. New York itself was in fiscal collapse, and the paper was edging into the red. Readers were moving to the suburbs. Television was on the rise. Advertisers were retreating. Newspapers across the country were folding, and The Times’s existence seemed in doubt.

Some of the similarities between then and now are stunning. There were tentative meetings between business and news side leaders who barely knew each other. Committees and subcommittees of editors and executives were formed to brainstorm ideas, to find the new thing that would save the paper. There were scary projections about a dramatic decline in the business, and fears that The Times no longer understood its readers. The publisher did the unthinkable, an action that foreshadows our current debates over metrics — he commissioned a poll of readers to see what they wanted to read that The Times was not offering.

Amid the turmoil, the newsroom made a crucial decision — it would play a leading role in charting the future. Despite some jeering from those who believed The Times was abandoning its ideals, the newsroom created the feature sections that saved the paper, set it on the road to its most prosperous years ever and made our report richer for readers to this very day.

Once again, the newsroom is being called on to take a leading role in securing our future. In fact, our business side colleagues, as they did a generation ago, are counting on us to help lead. Our future will be built on a foundation of journalism, and on ideas that will emerge from us, and from our wonderful stories and coverage.

This is why we are creating an audience development department. Its purpose is not to chase clicks but to expose as many people as possible to our finest work, and to connect us to readers in new and deeper ways. If we are aggressive in making our journalism widely available, and resolute in doing unmatched coverage, we will have more impact on the world, and draw new subscribers and advertisers. We don’t know what audience number The Times should achieve. But if you want a glimpse of the possibilities, consider the fact that in the two months since we began a sustained effort we have seen a consistent 20 percent increase in the number of people who found our journalism — a far more dramatic increase than anyone imagined this early.

We are moving aggressively to better serve the increasing number of people who read us on their phones. You will notice major changes in our mobile products within a few months, allowing us a greater ability to mold what readers see.

We have made clear that NYT Now was not a financial breakthrough. But it has been a tremendous journalistic success, showing up on almost every ranking of best new apps. We learned many significant lessons from building NYT Now. We realized we could be more visual, and talk to readers in a different, less formal way, and still be The New York Times. We are exploring how we can make NYT Now a financial success. But in the meantime, we are taking the best features of NYT Now and blending them into the core app.

The Cooking app has been a huge success. It has had over eight million users on the web, and the app has been downloaded more than 300,000 times. With such a giant audience drawn to specialized coverage, it may even be a template for the digital future of our features report.

Just as The Times found an entirely new market when it became a truly national publication, we now believe there are compelling possibilities in growing our international audience. We are trying to decide which markets to jump into first, and how to go about doing it.

The quality of our videos has steadily improved, and I’m eager to make them more widely accessible. This will also be appealing to advertisers who want to be on our videos.

We are also committed to enhancing our print paper. Besides redesigning the magazine, we have already begun some initiatives that will unfold in the coming months.

Finally, I’m working with the business side to see if there are steps we can take to attract more ads without compromising the line between news and advertising. For instance, can an advertiser sponsor a regular feature? Yes, so long as it does not make readers question our objectivity. This is tricky territory, but some of the best news organizations in the world have already navigated it.

Do these changes assure that we will not have to go through painful cutting again? That’s my goal, but I can’t guarantee it. No modern editor can. There is no magic bullet to the issues that confront high-quality news organizations. But this is the reason I am willing to take bold steps to secure our future. And I can say that Arthur and Mark understand more than anyone how important it is to have a large and ambitious news report.

I understand that this is a moment filled with a certain amount of worry. But there is also enormous opportunity. Just remember we have nearly two million paying readers, a thriving print newspaper, and a rapidly growing digital business that brings in many times more revenue than most of our flashy new competitors. We remain a highly profitable institution.

Still, I want to create an environment where ideas for moving our news report forward and assuring its continued vitality and profitability can emerge from all corners of the newsroom.

I’d like to repeat what I said to The Times board several weeks ago when Arthur invited me to speak: The New York Times has been built and strengthened over generations by striving to be the best news operation in the world. That has been the consistent vision of both the newsroom and the business side. There is no future for The Times’s journalism or its business model if it becomes merely the second-best news operation in the world.

Just as our predecessors did 40 years ago, we will push on all fronts to build a better, even more ambitious and creative New York Times.

Best,Dean

GENEVA — Under a stormy sky, on a boat to a G-8 summit meeting, a media-savvy Hong Kong pediatrician named Margaret Chan first met her country’s president, Hu Jintao. In a preview of the political maneuvering to come, he told her privately that China was considering backing her for the top post at the World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/].

It was Beijing’s first bid to place one of its own at the head of an international agency, a signal of China’s global rise. And it worked. A few months after, in late 2006, Dr. Chan won enough votes among the organization’s 194 member states — by secret ballot, as always — to become its chief.

In what seemed a deft political move, she publicly promised to make Africa, which controls a fourth of those votes, one of her top priorities. President Hu, who was aggressively courting the continent for its resources, summed up the agency’s importance by invoking what she said was a Chinese saying.

“We’re all in the same boat,” he told her after she took office.

Now Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is battering three fragile countries in Africa and with it, the W.H.O.’s standing — in large part, Dr. Chan’s critics say, because she let governments around the world steer the agency to fit their own needs, instead of firmly taking the helm as the world’s doctor in chief.

Diplomacy is an inevitable, even necessary, part of running the world’s main health organization, vital to getting to factious countries to cooperate for the sake of global health, her critics acknowledge.

But Dr. Chan, they say, has been too willing to accommodate the wishes of governments, at times reluctant to call them to task and at other times too ready to bow to the demands of donors — even when it puts the world’s health at risk.

Not until August, after 1,000 Africans had died and Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] had spread to Nigeria, the continent’s most populous country, did Dr. Chan declare the outbreak a global emergency.

“The W.H.O. should have pulled out all the stops and said this is an emergency” much earlier, said Dr. Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus 40 years ago.

Dr. Chan’s performance during a major health crisis has been attacked before. She was a public health administrator in Hong Kong when SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], emerged from China and rapidly spread across the world in 2003. A year later, the Hong Kong legislature censured her for not pressing the Chinese government hard enough on the outbreak.

SARS was pivotal for the W.H.O. as well, but for the opposite reason. The agency’s director general at the time, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, took an unusually aggressive stance, hectoring Beijing to share more information about the disease. When it did not, Dr. Brundtland issued a global alert anyway, overriding the concerns of affected governments.

But after taking over the W.H.O., Dr. Chan took a far more cautious approach on Ebola, leaving it to her African regional office to work with local government officials who were nervous about ringing the alarm.

By the time Dr. Chan declared the Ebola outbreak an emergency, hundreds more people had died than during the entire SARS epidemic[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/]. Now, the death toll for Ebola has exceeded 8,000[http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en].

Dr. Chan defended her record on Ebola, saying that she followed protocol by leaving it to the Africa office to respond in the early months of the virus. She acknowledged that getting a grip on the W.H.O.’s regional offices, which are effectively controlled by local governments, was the most intractable political issue in the organization and that, in hindsight, she wished she had acted a little earlier to “mount a much stronger, more aggressive response.”

Sounding the alarm can come with a price, as Dr. Chan had learned. When swine flu[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/influenza/swine_influenza/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] broke out in 2009, she was criticized for overreacting and declaring it a pandemic. While an independent review later found that she was right to do so, some critics and supporters now wonder if the experience made her gun-shy in responding to Ebola. She says it did not.

“We are not forgiven if politicians perceive we might have gotten it wrong,” said a former W.H.O. official.

Under Dr. Chan’s leadership, the W.H.O. has also been accused of deferring to the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad when polio[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/poliomyelitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] made a comeback in that country in late 2013. Nor did the agency say anything publicly about Saudi Arabia’s failure to detail the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome last year.

At the end of May, as Ebola deaths neared 200, Dr. Chan barely touched on the outbreak in her speech[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/dg/speeches/2014/wha-19052014/en/] to the annual conclave of the W.H.O.’s 194 member states in Geneva. Instead, she addressed a host of issues dear to various governments, from cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to sugar consumption.

“She has very assiduously promoted the idea that it is member states of W.H.O. that are the owners and decision makers in a fundamental way,” said Nils Daulaire, the former American representative on the health organization’s board. “I’ve been at countless meetings at W.H.O. where Dr. Chan has turned to participants and said, ‘I am elected by you to lead the organization in the way you decide.’ ”

Chatham House[http://www.chathamhouse.org/], in a report published in May, described the organization as unduly “politicized.”

“The interests of the member states bubble up and they guide W.H.O.,” said Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. “On the other hand, the world’s expectation of the W.H.O. is that it’s leading from above. That’s a conflict.”

Dr. Chan had been warned about Ebola in late March, when the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Liberia sent increasingly dire cables about the virus, calling for help from Dr. Chan and others about what to do. Her office said it had no record of receiving them.

But she sharply disputed the suggestion that she should have declared Ebola a global health concern earlier in the year. “If it’s a matter of a few days, yes,” she said, “but definitely not months ahead.”

She said she felt no pressure to play down the severity of the outbreak early on, and pointed out that the W.H.O.’s job was limited to helping governments respond better, not sending an army of health workers to do it for them.

Trained as a pediatrician in Canada, Dr. Chan, 67, shot to prominence as a health administrator in Hong Kong in 1997 when she tried to reassure an anxious public about avian flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], famously boasting of eating chicken every day — only to quickly retract and order the culling of poultry on the island. Still, she won plaudits for her leadership at the time.

Then in 2003, SARS came from China to Hong Kong, striking the island with a vengeance and virtually shutting it down for weeks.

The Hong Kong legislature later singled out Dr. Chan for “errors in judgment,” including not pressing China for more information. Her defenders said that no amount of pressing could have made Beijing more transparent at the time.

The report forced several Hong Kong officials to resign, including Dr. Chan’s boss. But by then, Dr. Chan had moved out, plucked for a senior job at W.H.O. headquarters — and then in 2006, nominated to head the agency.

In March 2009, a fatal flu strain emerged in Mexico — H1N1, known then as swine flu[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/influenza/swine_influenza/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. By mid-June, when 73 countries had reported suspected cases, Dr. Chan convened a late-night news conference and told the world that a full-blown flu pandemic had arrived.

The fatalities turned out to be limited, but an independent review of the agency warned that the W.H.O.’s internal problems had left it unprepared for the next serious outbreak.

It cited Geneva’s inability to supervise its regional offices, its inability to put medical boots on the ground, and an ambiguous mandate that forced it to be “simultaneously the moral voice for health in the world and the servant of its member states,” as the head of the panel, Harvey V. Fineberg, put it.

These were precisely the shortcomings that Ebola would expose. But they were not addressed. Instead, because of the global financial crisis, the W.H.O.’s budget shrank severely under Dr. Chan. Donors cherry-picked what they wanted to pay for. Disease surveillance was radically pared back.

Only the most “anemic” structural reforms were considered, said David Fidler, an Indiana University law professor who specializes in global health. Dr. Chan, he said, “has no enthusiasm for challenging member states with respect to controversial issues.”

Crucially, the power of the W.H.O. regional offices was preserved. Each regional head was elected by countries in the region; they in turn had the power to dole out jobs and money to those countries. They were answerable to the head office in Geneva only in theory.

“I was told when I wanted to push that: ‘Don’t even go down that path,’ ” Dr. Chan said.

Then came Ebola.

The first of the Ebola cables from United Nations peacekeepers in Liberia was sent to headquarters on March 24, with a copy to Dr. Chan in Geneva: more than two dozen people dead in Liberia and neighboring Guinea.

A week later came a second cable, then a third, also from the peacekeeping mission in Liberia, each one more alarming. The virus was detected in the crowded capital, Monrovia. In a town near the border, visibly sick patients were not isolated, but living among the healthy, posing intense risks of transmission. The United Nations mission chief, Karin Landgren, appealed for “definitive advice.”

All the while, a local W.H.O. representative reassured his United Nations colleagues that the virus would soon subside, just as it had elsewhere in previous outbreaks.

On July 29, a cable from the Liberia peacekeeping mission chief to U.N. headquarters — also copied to the W.H.O. in Geneva — called the Ebola situation “unprecedented and rapidly deteriorating.”

By then, hundreds of health workers in the region had died. An infected Liberian man traveled to Nigeria by air, taking the virus with him. That was the trigger, Dr. Chan said, to assess the global risks.

“I said that, ‘Well, whether countries like it or not, I’m going to call an emergency committee to let the experts tell me whether or not the risk of international spread is there,’ ” she said.

By August, one senior United Nations official bluntly told the secretary general’s special envoy for Ebola that the W.H.O. “has consistently been behind the curve.”

That same month, the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, told Dr. Chan that he planned to appoint a new mission to coordinate the Ebola response, a clear signal that her agency’s response had been insufficient.

“The world needs a W.H.O.,” Dr. Piot said. “But it has to become a better one. My concern is once this epidemic is over, things go back to business as usual.”

Gates Foundation Uses Art to Encourage Vaccination

Correction Appended

Artists, it’s fair to say, usually don’t know much about bacteria. Vik Muniz is an exception. Mr. Muniz, the Brazilian-born photographer known[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/arts/design/24muniz.html] for his unorthodox materials, has been working with the M.I.T. bioengineer and designer Tal Danino[http://www.taldanino.com/] on a series of trompe l’oeil images of microscopic organisms: cancer cells, healthy cells and bacteria.

At first glance, they look like ornate and colorful patterns. In reality, they represent teeming, living things. Among his latest: a pink print that could pass for floral wallpaper. But it’s made up of liver cells infected with the Vaccinia virus, which is used to make the smallpox vaccine.

“Normally, patterns are soothing structures,” Mr. Muniz said, “and all of a sudden, there’s a lot of drama.”

The work now has another meaning. It will be used in a new online campaign, The Art of Saving a Life[http://www.artofsavingalife.com/], sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The intent is to promote vaccination just in time for an international effort to raise funds to inoculate millions, especially in poor nations.

The campaign, to be released online on Wednesday, is the first time that the foundation has commissioned artists in the service of a cause. The global roster includes photographers (Annie Leibovitz, Sebastião Salgado, Mary Ellen Mark); writers (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie); filmmakers (Luc Jacquet, director of the documentary “March of the Penguins”); and bands (Playing for Change).

The intent is that their work will spread virally — in the digital sense — and be shared on social media with the hashtag #VaccinesWork to inspire a dialogue and donations.

“We want to get the buzz and the conversation going, because it’s easy to take these important lifesaving tools for granted,” said Dr. Christopher Elias, president of the global development program at the Gates Foundation. Art, the foundation hopes, will serve as a reminder to people “who aren’t going to read the editorial in Science,” Dr. Elias said. If the program is successful, he said, it could serve as a model for other Gates Foundation projects.

The idea came from Christine McNab, a consultant to the foundation. In brainstorming new ways to promote vaccines, she considered “what makes me cry, what makes me think,” she said. “It’s films, it’s books, it’s galleries.”

Ms. McNab and her team invited the artists in and suggested which diseases or issues to address. But they had no control over what was created. Some artists were paid a small fee to cover expenses; some retained their copyright, and others donated their work.

Ms. Leibovitz snapped a black-and-white portrait of people involved in vaccine development. Fatoumata Diabaté[http://zarbophoto.free.fr/FatouSite/], a photographer from Mali, captured the last phase of trials for an Ebola vaccine. The German painter Thomas Ganter[http://thomasganter.com/] paid tribute to the little-sung medical aides who administer the shots, with his oil on canvas of “The Unknown Health Worker.”

The project is timed to lead up to a Jan. 27 meeting of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance[http://www.gavi.org/], an international public-private partnership in Berlin. Some images will be displayed at the conference, which aims to raise $ 7.5 billion from donors for Gavi’s next phase of development. Separately, the Gates Foundation has funded many immunization-related grants, at a cost of millions — far greater, a spokeswoman said, than the budget for the art initiative, which she would not disclose.

As the project developed in the last year, the anti-vaccination movement, in the United States and other Western countries, only gained steam[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/ 12/nyregion/fear-of-vaccines-goes-viral.html]. Though the programs that the Art of Saving a Life supports are targeted elsewhere, “in some ways what we’re hoping for is not just a broader debate about vaccination and immunization, but a more informed debate,” Dr. Elias said.

Countering the anti-vaccination rhetoric was part of the reason that Alexia Sinclair[https://alexiasinclair.com/], a photographer from Australia, participated, she said. “I have a young daughter, and it’s quite a hot topic here,” she said, adding that she thought that producing a work of art “allows the conversation to happen in a clearer way.”

After learning that the Chinese characters for smallpox mean “heavenly flowers[http://yellow-hermeneutics.org/2014/09/ 29/heavenly-flowers/]” — because the pustules bloom on the body, and the sufferers eventually die — Ms. Sinclair, who makes historically-inspired tableaus, created a scene of an 18th-century doctor administering a vaccination, surrounded by grass and blossoms. It brings a fashion-y aesthetic to an ugly disease. “I wanted to create something that looked at smallpox, but did it in a way that didn’t repulse people,” she said.

In an era when viewers are image-saturated, the campaign’s success, and how to measure it, are an open question. “We’ll look at the metrics,” Dr. Elias said. But, he added, the project has already proved valuable inside the Gates Foundation, as a new perspective on old problems.

“The phenomenal response” from artists, he said, “suggests that we have tapped a set of interests and voices that we perhaps should’ve been paying attention to sooner.”

Correction: January 8, 2015, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a new online campaign sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that has enlisted artists to help promote vaccination misspelled the surname of the consultant to the foundation who came up with the idea for the project. She is Christine McNab, not McNabb.

The News We Need to Hear

Happy 2015, our fifth year of Fixes.

When we began writing the column in late 2010 we hoped to show that serious reporting about responses to social problems could both provide useful insights for society and engage readers. We aimed to distinguish Fixes — an example of what we call solutions journalism — from uncritical “good news” reporting by examining approaches to social problems that show results and focusing on the specifics of how they work and what we can learn from them.

Just before the holidays, I took a look at the major stories of 2014 as compiled by various news organizations. Rather than writing a retrospective column, as I’ve done the past few years, I wanted to look ahead with the question: How could a solutions journalism angle complement news coverage in 2015?

Reviewing the news of the year is not a happy job. The top stories are typically about death and destruction. In 2014, they included the Ebola crisis, Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israeli bombardment of Gaza, beheadings by ISIS, the shooting down or disappearance of two Malaysian airlines flights, the grand jury decisions in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island and ensuing outrage, and the suicide of Robin Williams. There was, of course, much coverage about the Winter Olympics and the World Cup.

But it was in the day-to-day news — the stories that form the heartbeat of journalism, like coverage of politics and elections, the health system, immigration, education, the economy, the environment as well as social issues like race, inequity and poverty — that I could envision countless opportunities to highlight the ways people are tackling major problems.

The coverage about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner went deep into questions about racial profiling by the police and the pervasiveness of structural or even unconscious[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=1&abt=0002&abg=0] racism. But it struck me that while journalism has a robust framework for describing problems and their urgency, it needs to strengthen its muscles for exploring questions like: Who is doing better and how?

For example, how are police departments around the country grappling with the problems that surfaced in Ferguson and New York City? Who is making headway reducing racial bias and the use of excessive force in policing, and how are they doing it? (I came across only a few stories that touched on these questions — about police departments doing innovative work in Los Angeles[http://www.psmag.com/navigation/politics-and-law/the-end-of-gangs-los-angeles-southern-california-epidemic-crime-95498/] and Richmond[http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_26482775/use-deadly-force-by-police-disappears-richmond-streets], Calif. How many others are trying out similar tactics?)

Journalists need better tools to find these stories systematically. Because the problems scream, but the solutions whisper, we often overlook them. We’re not good at letting society know when we are winning against problems; we are hamstrung by our techniques and our very sense of purpose. If winning means there is never another police killing of an unarmed black man, then it may also mean that the story goes away at its finest moment.

But it doesn’t have to. In our experience writing this column, we have found that it is almost always worthwhile to ask the question, Who’s doing it better?

Consider the immigration crisis in the United States. The news coverage focuses on the battle in Washington and the politics around tougher policing of the border. But immigration is at heart a local story that will continue to unfold in countless ways in the year ahead. Which cities or communities are doing a better job building or improving relations[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/immigrants-welcome-here/] between new immigrants and their receiving communities? What are they doing and what can be learned from them?

Consider the way high schools handle dropouts, a national crisis[http://www.americaspromise.org/dropout-crisis-facts]. There is no single response, but a distribution of responses. At the bottom are schools that are simply ignoring the problem or making matters worse through substandard teaching or disciplinary practices that effectively push kids out of school. In the middle are schools that are trying to intervene, but without much thought or effort to track results. At the top are schools or programs that are responding effectively and can demonstrate evidence of success[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/1366-2/check-and-connect].

The classic journalistic instinct is to focus on the worst actors — and investigate and expose them. But to the extent that anybody knows how to solve the problem, the knowledge is going to be in the schools doing best: the positive deviants, the schools we rarely cover, except perhaps as seasonal fare during the holidays. The question is not just: What are these schools achieving? But also: How are they doing it? It’s an important distinction. Every cub reporter has been taught to ask the 5 W’s — who, what, when, where and why. But it’s the overlooked H — the how — that can unearth the information society needs to do better.

Most issues in justice, education, health care, employment and the environment have a wide distribution of responses. There are large variations in the results achieved by community colleges, after-school and job training programs, programs to reduce recidivism, hospitals and clinics, and of course government initiatives. Which community colleges are doing better getting first-generation students to graduate? Which job programs are doing better retraining men who are among the long-term unemployed? Which companies are managing to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining or increasing profitability?

The key is not to ask questions like: “Does Head Start work?” or “Does foreign aid work?” or “Is the Affordable Care Act succeeding?” but to focus on opportunities for learning. The answers are almost always “sometimes.” The real insights come from the differences: discovering when they work and when they don’t, and why.

There’s a bigger question that lies behind all these other questions: Why do we believe that when people cause or exacerbate problems it’s newsworthy, but when people respond thoughtfully to problems it’s not? There’s no rule book that I am aware of that says journalism should focus primarily on bad stuff.

And there are costs in doing so. For a recent column[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/opinion/nicholas-kristof-scrooges-of-the-world-begone.html] written just before Christmas, Nicholas Kristof traveled to Haiti, where he reported on signs of improvement five years after the massive earthquake. Haiti is rarely covered in the United States news when it is not experiencing a catastrophe. Kristof acknowledged how unusual it is for journalists to focus on where things are getting better. “Bad news is news, and good news isn’t,” he wrote. “But a relentless focus on bad news unfortunately leads people to conclude that places from Haiti to Congo are hopeless.” And this, he added, reduces prospects for improvement in very real ways: by deterring tourism, investment and philanthropy.

To be sure, journalism is not meant to be an obstacle to progress; it’s meant to describe the world accurately and circulate real-time information to help societies understand themselves and improve. But the news can influence human behavior in unintended ways. “The way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do,” wrote Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion, in 1922.

It turns out, this isn’t just an armchair observation. Research now supports that our behavior is strongly influenced by what we imagine other people are doing[http://socialnorms.org/category/literature/] — and it works in both directions, positive or negative. This is called “social norming[http://socialnorms.org/category/literature/].”

For example, binge drinking is a problem on many college campuses. It is influenced by the belief among students that their peers drink considerably more than they actually do. As Tina Rosenberg has reported[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/the-destructive-influence-of-imaginary-peers/], when colleges make the effort to simply inform students that their peers drink less than they believe, the students adjust their drinking downward to conform to the norm. Social norms have been shown to influence many forms of behavior — they can lead people to smoke less or vote more — or engage in widespread unethical business practices[http://research.smu.edu.sg/cet/news/smuresearch/2014/08/05/good-vs-greed-balancing-social-norms-and-financial-rewards], as was case in the demise of the accounting giant Arthur Andersen[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/business/book-value-a-culture-turned-against-itself-at-andersen.html].

Think about the implications of social norming for journalism. Much of the news spotlights and exaggerates behavior that we hope to curtail: violence, greed, incompetence, corruption, racism. Reporters continually run the risks of inadvertently legitimizing negative behaviors by making them appear more pervasive — and therefore more normal — than they actually are.

When we first started this column, we wondered how long we could sustain it. How many stories were there out there that were right for Fixes? As we discovered, there are far more than we imagined. It turns out that thoughtful problem solving is, well, pretty normal: people like to take up important challenges and try new and creative approaches. The world we see is full of people making headway, in small and large ways, against all sorts of problems.

It’s vital that people hear about their work. To fix society, we need to be aware of more than its suffering; we need to know its possibilities.

“Hope,” Maimonides wrote, “is a belief in the plausibility of the possible as opposed to the necessity of the probable.”

Reading The Times With Meghan Daum

Meghan Daum is an op-ed columnist for The Los Angeles Times and the author, most recently, of “The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion.”

Q.

Unspeakable. That describes the carnage in Paris on Wednesday. Particular thoughts on today’s main story[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html]?

A.

The attacks in Paris are unspeakable, though of course that’s a misnomer because we are and should be speaking of them a lot.

I can’t help but notice that there’s a “one of our own” feeling in the press that’s perhaps giving the coverage an extra layer of somberness. If Islamic radicals (or any radicals) stormed and shot up a brokerage firm, I wonder if the media response would feel quite so raw.

I wasn’t familiar with Charlie Hebdo but, based on what I’m reading about their sensibility and their place in European culture, I wonder if the closest analogy here might be “South Park.” Trey Parker and Matt Stone have sent up just about every world leader and religion imaginable. And although there’s a crudeness – deliberately so – to their aesthetic, their work is beloved and considered by many to be a highly sophisticated form of critique.

I was interested today to read the Public Editor’s note[http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/charlie-hebdo-cartoon-publication-debate/] about Dean Baquet’s decision, which he went back and forth on a few times, not to publish any cartoons from Charlie Hebdo.

There’s some thinking in the journalism community that newspapers and other media outlets have an obligation, as if out of reverence to free speech, to publish the images. But personally that makes no sense to me.

Baquet’s view is that the cartoons, while newsworthy, essentially amount to gratuitous insult rather than satire and so to print them would be to override the well-established standards of the paper.

In some quarters, the attitude seems to be that publications that aren’t showing the offending images are thumbing their nose at the First Amendment and not supporting fellow journalists. To me, that’s a shortsighted view. You have to grant every publication its domain. BuzzFeed posted the images because that’s what BuzzFeed does. Big newspapers (“family newspapers,” as we often call ourselves, though the idea of a family sitting around the kitchen table reading the paper is rather laughably quaint at this point) have a different set of standards. That in and of itself is a manifestation of free speech. If political or religious extremists shot up the offices of Penthouse or Playboy, would mainstream publications be obliged, out of solidarity, to run photos of naked women?

Anyway, moving on. …

Q.

Paris aside, what in today’s paper outraged you most?

A.

The Op-Ed[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/the-nypd-protests-an-officers-view.html?rref=opinion&module=Ribbon&version=context®ion=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Opinion&pgtype=Blogs] by former N.Y.P.D. Officer Steve Osborne that purported to explain (per the headline) “Why We’re So Mad at de Blasio.”

In describing the murder of Officers Liu and Ramos as “a coldblooded assassination” that was somehow either the cause or a symptom of de Blasio’s willingness to look head-on at racial dynamics between the police force and civilians, he seems hellbent on missing the point. I know he’s trying to hawk his book (hey, we all do this), but surely he can do better.

Q.

Anything in today’s paper that inspired you? Or surprised you?

A.

The answers might actually be one and the same. And, alas, they return me to the Hebdo story. In the piece[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/the-men-behind-the-cartoons-at-charlie-hebdo.html] profiling “the men behind the cartoons,” the cartoonist Georges Wolinski, who was 80, was described as a man who “loved life, alcohol, women.” Viva la France!

You’d never see that in an American publication. Here it would be more like, “despite a taste for drink and old-fashioned (some might say outdated) notions of the role of women in society, he somehow managed to stay productive even at 80.” But in France it’s like, “This is the way to live, mais bien sûr.” So that was simultaneously surprising and inspiring.

Q.

What long-running story do you follow with most interest?

A.

The Ebola story. Ever since reading “The Hot Zone” 20-some years ago, Ebola has had a mythic place in many imaginations, including mine. And having had my own brush with death after contracting a freakish, mysterious illness a few years ago, I’m far more interested in infectious disease and medicine than I used to be.

Q.

Joan Didion: model. What to you think about the story[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/fashion/joan-didion-on-the-celine-ad.html] about the new advertising trend that involves using models of a certain age?

A.

Joan Didion as model. I know everyone’s gaga over this but, to be honest, I’m not a fan.

First of all, there are way better photos out there of Joan. There are some truly beautiful portraits of her, taken in recent years as well as back in the 70s when everything she did seemed like a still from a Godard film.

I know the idea is to subvert certain conventions of fashion photography, but to me this looks like Terry Richardson skeeved his way into Joan’s apartment and snapped some poorly lit, poorly composed photos of her while she was sitting on her couch wondering how this guy got past the doorman. I know the photographer is Juergen Teller and that he’s highly regarded and that I, surely, am missing some major visual reference here, but this just doesn’t do it for me. That said, I think Joan would be lovely in an Eileen Fisher ad.

Q.

Styles. Home. Business. Which sections speak most directly to you?

A.

Obviously, given my well-documented obsession with real estate, the Home section appeals to me most. Though it also frightens and repels. As a shelter-porn addict, it can be dangerous for me to look too closely at someone’s amazing, unattainable, improbably clean and minimalist house or apartment. It sets off a chain of desire and envy that can take several hours to get under control.

Q.

Obits. Do you read these?

A.

I’m 44, so I’m in that weird window where I don’t really read the obituaries but I am no longer all that interested in the weddings, either.

The obits are the yang to the weddings’ yin – or something like that. In my teens and 20s, the wedding announcements were a major touchstone. As I wrote in an early essay called “My Misspent Youth,” I chose what colleges to apply to based on the colleges attended by people in the New York Times wedding announcements. If they had the kind of life – or seemed headed for the kind of life — I wanted, I would note what college they’d attended. I guess someday I’ll be applying a similar formula to the obits. If they lived the kind of life I want to live, I guess I should do what they did. Of course, most people dying now didn’t spend a great deal of their lives reading Internet comments or listicles on BuzzFeed. So it may be of limited relevance.

Q.

Are there Times columnists you read with special interest?

A.

My favorite New York Times columnist is Ross Douthat. No joke. I disagree with a lot of his politics, but I think he’s a great writer who’s willing to think counterintuitively and not hew to predictable party lines.

I also admire the way he puts a column together. It feels more essayist than polemical, which is something I try to do, too.

Q.

Did you read any good news in today’s paper?

A.

I guess the good news in the paper today is that marriage makes you happier[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/upshot/study-finds-more-reasons-to-get-and-stay-married.html]. I mean, it’s good news for me because I’m married. But if I weren’t married it would be the kind of story I found very irritating.

Generally, I think these studies are riddled with confusions between causation and correlation. They get more attention than they deserve. But they’re catnip for editors because they’re click bait for readers. And I guess catnip is the mother of click bait. And the spawn of click bait is brain death.

Q.

Best headline?

A.

The best headline today (online) also made me laugh: “Youngest U.S. Grandmaster, 14, Weighs His Next Move[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/sports/program-prepares-the-chess-prodigy-sam-sevian-for-his-next-moves.html?ref=sports],” which is only funny because I first read it as “Youngest U.S. Grandmother, 14, Weighs Her Next Move.” I might need reading glasses.

U.S.
Ohio Bridal Shop Where Ebola Patient Shopped Will Close, Manager Says
By MITCH SMITH

CHICAGO — Unable to shake its reputation as “the Ebola store,” an Ohio bridal shop visited by a woman who later tested positive for the virus will close this year, the store’s manager said Thursday.

Business has been slow at Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal in Akron since Amber Joy Vinson, a nurse from Dallas, shopped there in October, days before she was told she had Ebola, said Kayla Litz, the store’s manager. Rather than invest more money and hope that customers would overcome their fears, Ms. Litz said the longtime owner had decided to sell the remaining gowns and tuxedos.

“We get calls, ‘Is it safe to come in there?'” Ms. Litz said. Some customers refuse to venture past the doorway, she said, and others have demanded refunds because they fear their gowns could be contaminated.

Although no one in Ohio has ever contracted Ebola, public health officials monitored customers who were in the store at the same time as Ms. Vinson. For days, local and national news media published photographs of the shop, which is on the side of a busy commercial strip.

Ms. Vinson visited Coming Attractions during a trip to Ohio after she treated an Ebola patient from Liberia named Thomas Eric Duncan, but before she learned she had the virus. Ms. Vinson had recently become engaged and had flown home to plan her wedding with her mother. News that she had flown commercially after coming in contact with an Ebola patient prompted some to question the judgment of officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said Ms. Vinson could travel because she did not have a fever and was not showing any other symptoms.

While Ms. Vinson, who later recovered, was treated at hospitals outside Ohio, state and federal public health officials mobilized in the state in case anyone who had come into contact with her there became ill. The police guarded the home of her relatives in nearby Tallmadge, Ohio, and doctors at an Akron hospital practiced how they would respond if someone else tested positive for the virus.

After an intense cleaning, Coming Attractions reopened in November with steep discounts and a visit from Akron’s mayor, Donald L. Plusquellic. But since that sale ended, Ms. Litz said, business has been down more than 50 percent over the previous year.

A spokeswoman for the mayor said Mr. Plusquellic had called the store’s owner after hearing of her plans to close to see if city officials could assist in relocating or applying for grants.

“We feel we can help, if she is interested in continuing the business,” Stephanie York, the spokeswoman, said in an email. “We would hate for a 30-year-old profitable mom-and-pop business to close due to a situation that was completely out of their control.”

Ms. Litz said Coming Attractions was a thriving business for more than 30 years before it became synonymous with the virus. But now, she said, “we are referred to as ‘the Ebola store.'”

The owner, Anna Younker, who declined to be interviewed, had just ordered new dresses and introduced tuxedos to her inventory before Ms. Vinson’s visit, Ms. Litz said. But the lost business from being closed for weeks was substantial, Ms. Litz said, and insurance did not help because of a clause exempting losses from viruses. Still, they had hoped to carry on.

“This was never the plan, ever,” Ms. Litz said. “This wasn’t even the plan after all this happened. We tried for months to bounce back.”

Ebbing of Ebola Complicates Testing of Vaccines

As authorities and drug companies hurriedly prepare to begin testing Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] vaccines in West Africa, they are starting to contemplate a new challenge: whether an ebbing of the outbreak could make it more difficult to determine if the experimental vaccines are effective.

“For this reason, it’s very urgent that we get into the field very quickly to do these clinical trials, because if there are very, very, very few cases of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], as I’m sure you understand, it’s going to be difficult to test whether the vaccines work or not,” Dr. Helen Rees, an adviser to the World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/], said during a news conference Friday at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva.

Dr. Rees, a professor and viral disease expert at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, led a meeting Thursday of public health officials, pharmaceutical executives and others to discuss the plans for testing vaccines in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The epidemic has sickened about 21,000 people and killed more than 8,000[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/] of them, the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said this week, but there are signs that the epidemic may be coming under control as more treatment centers are built and safer burial practices are used. Still, the evidence is far from conclusive, and experts are mindful that the outbreak surged again last year after authorities thought it was ebbing.

Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, an assistant director general of the W.H.O., said two vaccines had been found safe enough in early testing in countries outside the outbreak zone to justify wider testing in the affected countries. But she said it would take two to four weeks more to determine the proper doses.

She said a clinical trial in Liberia could begin as soon as the end of this month, with studies in Sierra Leone and Guinea starting in February.

Dr. Kieny said it could take up to six months to determine if the vaccines are effective. Production has already begun, so if any of the vaccines proves safe and effective, millions of doses could be quickly made available.

Vaccine effectiveness is determined by how many vaccinated people come down with a disease compared with those who are not vaccinated, or vaccinated later. If few new cases of the disease are occurring, it would be harder to see any difference. Dr. Kieny said plans were already being made to increase the size of the trial in Liberia if needed.

In Liberia, there were eight confirmed new cases and 40 probable new cases recorded in the five days ending Jan. 2, down from a peak of 300 confirmed new cases a week in August and September, according to the W.H.O. The number of new cases has been falling in Sierra Leone, but it remains the most heavily affected country. In Guinea, it is not clear if case numbers are falling, the health organization said.

If the epidemic continues to ebb, it may be too late for the vaccines to make a difference in this outbreak. Dr. Rees said that a working group had been formed to discuss how to deploy the vaccines, should they prove safe and effective, but that the situation was changing too rapidly to make such a decision now.

“Hopefully, we will have broken the back of this epidemic by the time we finish these trials,” she said.

Even if that is the case, she and Dr. Kieny said, sporadic cases would most likely occur and vaccinations[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immunizations-general-overview/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] might be given to people nearby to protect them and help prevent further spread of the disease — a strategy known as ring vaccination. And it might be wise to vaccinate health workers for long-term protection, they said.

The two vaccines that are most advanced in testing are being developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Merck. The Glaxo vaccine is being developed with the National Institutes of Health[http://www.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/]; Merck’s was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.proxy.bc.edu/index-eng.php] and licensed to a small Iowa company, NewLink Genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which in turn transferred development to Merck.

Testing of the Merck vaccine at a hospital in Switzerland[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/switzerland/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] was suspended in December[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/business/geneva-hospital-pauses-test-of-an-ebola-vaccine.html] after a number of patients developed pain in the joints of their fingers and toes. Testing resumed this week using a lower dose. Dr. Kieny said the pain was generally transient and mild and “not of sufficient concern to stop the development of this vaccine.”

A third vaccine, being developed by Johnson & Johnson, began early safety testing in volunteers this month. That company is also planning tests in West Africa.

There has been debate over how to conduct the studies. Some experts say that testing the vaccines against a placebo would be the surest way to determine whether they work. Others counter that it would be unethical to administer a placebo during a deadly epidemic.

The trials will cover all the approaches, with different designs in each country. In Liberia, the Merck and Glaxo vaccines will be tested against each other and against a control, with about 9,000 people in each of the three arms of the study.

In Sierra Leone, vaccine doses will be given to health care workers and others directly involved in responding to the disease. There will be no placebo, and effectiveness will be determined by looking at whether there are fewer cases of Ebola among workers who are vaccinated earlier compared with those who are vaccinated later. Which vaccine is used will depend on which one appears to be the best after data on immune responses is analyzed, Dr. Kieny said.

Guinea will test using the ring vaccination strategy, vaccinating communities when a case of Ebola occurs. Some communities will be given vaccine right away, and others will receive it later, based on random assignment.

World Health Organization adviser Dr Helen Rees says developing and testing Ebola vaccines and their effectiveness may become more difficult as outbreak comes under greater control; two vaccines have been determined to be safe enough in tests taking place in countries outside outbreak zones, but dosages have not been calibrated and it is not known if they are effective in Africa's most heavily impacted countries.

Photographs of Mayor Bill de Blasio, Year One

No one wants a picture with a state senator. City Council members rarely elicit cheers or hisses from passing vehicles. A sitting comptroller could wear a sash and parade down the Canyon of Heroes after a budget triumph and remain anonymous to all but a few devotees of municipal arcana.

But the modern mayoralty confers a peculiar kind of celebrity on the officeholder, elevating, say, an affable political-operative-turned-public-advocate into rarefied urban company: somebody New Yorkers can be bothered to recognize.

Accordingly, Year One for Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per] became, in a way that Candidate de Blasio surely imagined but could not possibly prepare for, Year One of always being On. On screen, on message, on site when bad things happen in his city.

In any other local office, some of Mr. de Blasio’s 2014 foibles — a tendency toward lateness[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/nyregion/arriving-late-de-blasio-angers-attendees-of-flight-587-memorial-in-queens.html], a misadventure with a knife and fork at a pizza shop[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/nyregion/de-blasio-skewered-for-eating-pizza-with-utensils.html], a purported role in the death of a notable groundhog[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/nyregion/a-groundhog-day-whodunit-the-mystery-of-chucks-death.html] — would not have registered. Nobody cares if the public advocate is late.

Now he is news personified, a walking story. Here is the mayor, shoveling his driveway[http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/01/bill-de-blasio-shovels-his-own-driveway-thank-you-very-much/356670/], adjusting his tie, standing clear of the closing doors on the No. 4 train. There he is in prime time, sober and stern, assuring a city that Ebola need not be feared[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-ebola-patient-bellevue.html].

Did you see him in the classroom[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/nyregion/new-york-city-can-add-29000-seats-for-pre-k-mayor-says.html], all 6-foot-5 3/4 of him, trading stories with the prekindergartners?

Can you believe what he said about his son and the police[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/nyregion/de-blasio-reacts-as-mayor-and-a-father-to-chokehold-case-decision.html?_r=0]?

What about the funeral, where the officers turned their backs on him[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/nyregion/police-officers-gather-for-the-funeral-of-wenjian-liu-killed-in-an-ambush.html]?

Recently, a taller fence was constructed around Gracie Mansion[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/nyregion/fence-at-gracie-mansion-now-taller-than-de-blasio.html], the mayoral residence on East End Avenue. Passers-by, Mr. De Blasio’s team said, had been able to see into the yard. Now there is privacy, in theory.

He will still be hard to miss.

Nobody said freshman year would be easy.

On Jan. 1, 2014, Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the skilled politician yet untested executive, was thrust into one of the world’s most scrutinized jobs: leading the City of New York.

As mayor, he has proved more adept in some areas than others. He calmed an anxious city when an Ebola panic struck, and he began a universal prekindergarten program. He showed flashes of defiance, got into trouble for running late and found his political instincts were not always on point.

Here you will find a report card on the mayor’s first year, written by reporters who cover him and the government he oversees. Take it as a snapshot, a pause for reflection amid the unending headaches, compromises and, yes, occasional triumphs that are the hallmarks of the mayoralty.

Mr. de Blasio’s team prefers to focus on the long term, privately pledging to ignore the pressures of day-to-day politics and trusting that his successes will be judged by the voters in 2017.

But an administration is often measured in crises and flash points, in the moments — rarely predictable or anticipated — when a mayor’s ability to lead this rowdy metropolis is thrown into the sharpest relief.

A mere 12 months into the job, Mr. de Blasio now faces one of those moments: a rift between City Hall and law enforcement[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/nyregion/a-widening-rift-between-de-blasio-and-the-police-is-savagely-ripped-open.html] that has raised fundamental questions about justice, race and public safety.

Nobody said sophomore year would be easy.

MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

First Term, First Marking Period

For a progressive mayor, a progressive report card: No failures, but plenty of opportunities for improvement. Mr. de Blasio’s first year in office included several important accomplishments while revealing areas in which he may need to apply himself further. Here, reporters for The New York Times break it down.

Grades:

S = Area of Strength

R = Meets Requirements

C = Area of Concern

I = Incomplete

Conduct and Behavior

Arrives on Time: C. The mayor has not placed a premium on punctuality. Rather, he has inspired a new temporal scale (“de Blasio time”), and his bad habit has landed him on the front page of The New York Post wearing a nightcap. That bit of Photoshop fun came after Mr. de Blasio missed a moment of silence during a morning memorial service for victims of a plane crash in Queens. He attributed his late arrival to a “very rough night” and uncooperative boating conditions. (Heavy fog delayed his waterborne ride from Gracie Mansion, but he also admitted to a slow start.) Since then? The mayor has generally been no more than 15 or 20 minutes late to public events. Close enough. MATT FLEGENHEIMER

Works Well With Others: I. The mayor has solid interpersonal skills, but he has deployed them in peculiar ways. Tormented by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] on Ebola and charter school[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/charter_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] policy, he responded with praise, helping his sometime rival win re-election. He embraced the Rev. Al Sharpton, among the city’s most divisive figures, antagonizing many in the police ranks. And when Comptroller Scott M. Stringer pointed out accounting errors by City Hall, Mr. de Blasio belittled and dismissed him. The mayor says he is absolutely confident in his decisions, but these are complex relationships to manage for three more years. M.M.G.

Shows School Spirit: S. The mayor has wasted no time angling for a spot on the national stage, pitching Democrats on Brooklyn as the base for their 2016 national convention and taking frequent field trips to Washington, where he has touted his White House connections. A proud partisan, he did not bother to invite Republicans to an immigration conference he held at Gracie Mansion. But some national Democrats grumbled after the mayor loudly advised them to tack left in 2016, suggesting that an untested liberal mayor was not the guru the party needed. M.M.G.

Shows All Work: C. As public advocate, Mr. de Blasio attacked the delayed, inconsistent responses of city agencies to requests under the Freedom of Information Law. But his administration, like its predecessors, has stalled to avoid releasing potentially damaging information. When reporters asked about the failure to turn over records related to the arrest and release of a prominent minister[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/nyregion/at-church-service-pastor-makes-no-mention-of-de-blasio-or-arrest.html] about whom he had personally called the police, Mr. de Blasio said, “I’m no lawyer.” And the stated reason was security, but the symbolism seemed to suggest something other than transparency when Gracie Mansion’s fences were made four feet higher[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/nyregion/fence-at-gracie-mansion-now-taller-than-de-blasio.html]. NIKITA STEWART

Developmental Progress

Basic Safety: C. The mayor rode into office on a wave of minority discontent with police practices and vowed to repair police-community ties. He directed his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, to ease up on low-level arrests for marijuana, and he presided over a vast retraining of officers and a steep decline in recorded street stops. Despite critics’ dire predictions, crime has gone down; murders dipped to new lows. But with the death of Eric Garner, after a police chokehold, and the demonstrations that ensued; the murders of two officers by a gunman who targeted police officers; and public protests by officers who turned their backs on the mayor, old wounds have been ripped open, and left the central challenge of the mayor’s first year unmet. J. DAVID GOODMAN

Sets Achievable Goals: S. On his signature initiative, expanding the city’s prekindergarten programs, Mr. de Blasio pledged to enroll more than 53,000 children in the current school year and reshape the city’s education system in the process. His administration accomplished the first feat — heartening liberals and establishing a measure of credibility for a mayor at the controls of a sprawling bureaucracy for the first time. While the long-term effects remain to be seen, the pre-K rollout has gone off without a major hitch. M.F.

Motor Skills: I. Though his motorcade ran through stop signs and exceeded the speed limit early on, the mayor has since urged New Yorkers to slow down. A City Council vote reduced the city’s speed limit to 25 miles per hour from 30, as part of a Swedish-style Vision Zero plan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/nyregion/de-blasio-unveils-plans-to-eliminate-traffic-deaths.html] to eliminate traffic deaths[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/new-york-pedestrian-deaths-are-lowest-on-record.html]. And the mayor has called for more aggressive traffic enforcement, though many transportation activists have grown frustrated with the pace of change. Elsewhere, Mr. de Blasio has largely built upon the transportation plans of his predecessor, agreeing to expand the presence of green cabs and bring Citi Bikes to more neighborhoods. M.F.

Discipline: C. Rikers Island[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rikers_island_prison_complex/index.html?inline=nyt-org] was not high on his list of priorities when Mr. de Blasio took office. But reports of pervasive brutality and dysfunction — of inmates suffering broken bones and perforated organs, and guards smuggling drugs and weapons into jails — made the problems impossible to ignore. Saying the city has a moral obligation to fix Rikers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/nyregion/rikers-needs-culture-change-mayor-de-blasio-says.html], the mayor promised to triple the number of surveillance cameras, expand programs for inmates with mental illness and provide better training to guards. All that was not enough for the United States attorney in Manhattan, who is suing the city for failing to make significant changes quickly enough. MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

Hygiene: R. The weather deities did not smile upon the mayor in his first few months: Successive snowstorms prompted heavily scrutinized decisions on school closings and made enemies of snowed-in Upper East Side residents and, at least briefly, Al Roker. (The weatherman’s gripe: Mr. de Blasio left schools open in a blistering storm.) Still, the blizzards — which have not yet been reprised in his second winter — supplied an instant opportunity for the mayor to demonstrate leadership in a crisis. He flashed a personal touch, shoveling in front of his own home in Brooklyn and performing a mock striptease in response to a question about his clothing layers. He also reconciled with Mr. Roker. M.F.

Science and Math

Health: S. Trying to save Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn from being turned into condominiums, Mr. de Blasio overpromised, saying the battle was won. Months later, the property was sold for — yes, condominiums (with some health care thrown in). But the mayor became the voice of reason when a doctor home from West Africa, Craig Spencer, developed Ebola: He tamped down fears that the virus could spread in the subways, ate meatballs at a shop the doctor had patronized and denounced the stigmatization of hospital workers. Then, when Dr. Spencer was released, the mayor led everyone in administering a round of hugs[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-ebola-patient-bellevue.html]. ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

Earth Science: I. With a cadre of diplomats in town to discuss climate change at the United Nations in September, Mr. de Blasio moved to make his mark: promising to overhaul the energy-efficiency standards of all municipal buildings and pressing private landlords to do the same. Though some activists have suggested that the mayor needed a bit of a push on climate issues, his major plan has been well received. M.F.

Technology: I. Mr. de Blasio stopped the long-delayed procurement of a new 911 system that was $1 billion over budget after learning that it still would not be completed until 2018. The Department of Investigation is examining what went wrong. In another plan, the city is pushing to create Wi-Fi hot spots across the city at old public pay phones, in a bid to help close the “digital divide” — though Mr. de Blasio drew criticism from the city comptroller, who warned that the plan, to be paid for with advertising, could actually perpetuate inequality by providing faster Internet speed in wealthier neighborhoods than in others. N.S.

Biology: R. For Mayor de Blasio, City Hall is a family affair. His wife, Chirlane McCray, holds an unpaid post leading the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York, and their children, Chiara and Dante de Blasio, had unpaid summer internships in city government. But Mr. de Blasio has protected them from the harsh glare of the spotlight. In May, he scolded The Daily News and The New York Post for misunderstanding his wife’s comments in a New York magazine cover story recalling her struggles years ago as a new mother torn between work and home. The Post headline read, “I Was a Bad Mom.” The mayor demanded an apology. N.S.

Arithmetic: S. The mayor said he would not engage in “Kabuki theater” when it came to his first spending plan. But his proposed $73.7 billion budget included a tax on wealthy residents to pay for the expansion of prekindergarten classes that the governor and state legislators said wouldn’t be approved. (Mr. de Blasio later procured state funding without the tax.) The final budget grew by $1 billion and included new investments in public housing and a plan to provide free lunch to all middle school children. He also found enough money to cut new labor deals with most of the city workforce. N.S.

Calculus: R. Discipline, stagecraft, leverage — this mayor plays politics like a pro. He handpicked a City Council speaker and consolidated power by creating a nonprofit fund-raising operation exempt from many city disclosure rules. Yet he projected an image as a family man ambivalent about fame. His strained relations with the Police Department turned into a major crisis by year’s end. But the mayor still has immense support among liberals and blacks, and that, advisers say, is enough to recapture the Democratic line in 2017. M.M.G.

Humanities

Rhetoric/Vocabulary: C. Sometimes the mayor’s feats are “transcendent.” Sometimes they are “transformative.” And sometimes, it seems, he has trouble describing his work any other way. Though hyperbole in politics is nothing new, Mr. de Blasio has married the practice with a series of verbal tics that consistently tip his hand. Fellow officials become “extraordinary” partners. Some adverbs are abused, “profoundly” and “deeply” so; others are “literally” misapplied. A thesaurus at City Hall would be transformative. “Very, very.” M.F.

World Civilizations: S. He is simpatico with Italy’s foreign minister, amiable with Paris’s socialist mayor and honored in England, where his speech to the Labour Party earned a standing ovation. Mr. de Blasio, a veteran globe-trotter, loves the cosmopolitan side of being mayor[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/nyregion/de-blasio-walks-tightrope-between-municipal-politics-and-international-influence.html] — so much so that he vacationed in Italy after just seven months on the job. Overseas, he showed off his fluent Italian; at home, he speaks a passable Spanish. It’s stilted, but a step up from his predecessor’s, which famously inspired a Twitter account, @ElBloombito. No sign yet of @deBlasito. M.M.G.

Social Studies: S. Mr. de Blasio’s successful 2013 campaign for mayor relied on promises to address inequities related to race, ethnicity and income. He can boast a list of actions: municipal ID cards for undocumented immigrants; dropping a court fight in defense of police stop-and-frisk[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/stop_and_frisk/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] tactics; ending another long-running legal battle by agreeing to a $41 million settlement with the Central Park Five; and expanding the paid-sick-leave law to cover about 500,000 more workers. N.S.

Vocational Study

Home Economics: I. He came up with an ambitious plan to produce more affordable housing and delivered the lowest rent increases ever for nearly a million rent-regulated apartments. But the mayor may find it harder to get Albany to reform rent laws and housing subsidy programs after Democrats failed to retake the State Senate. A comprehensive plan for maintaining public housing, which has suffered years of disinvestment, is still in the works. And the homeless population in city shelters is continuing to break records, with no large-scale initiative in sight. MIREYA NAVARRO

Industrial Arts: R. On the numbers, Mr. de Blasio looks like a master of economics: Unemployment reached a six-year low, and 100,000 more residents have jobs. But Albany rejected his push for a minimum wage 30 percent higher in the city (though companies receiving new city subsidies will have to pay wages of at least $13.13 an hour). The mayor did not blink when JPMorgan Chase demanded $1 billion in subsidies to move across town, but the deal fell apart. City Hall is hoping its plans to revive manufacturing along the Brooklyn waterfront do not meet a similar fate. PATRICK McGEEHAN and CHARLES V. BAGLI

Additional Subjects

Physical Education: R. The mayor has taken his own exercise seriously — even being spotted working out while other dignitaries were attending the funeral of Herman Badillo, a former congressman. As for the great outdoors, Mr. de Blasio entered a roiling debate over whether private conservancies caused city parks in wealthy neighborhoods to outshine those in poor communities. He vowed to wring money from the private groups to address perceived inequities, but failed. Instead, he dedicated $130 million in public money to rebuild 35 of the city’s most neglected neighborhood parks. LISA W. FODERARO

Drama: C. Mr. de Blasio was giddy to appear on “The Good Wife” in February. Then he and the actor Steve Buscemi wore matching tracksuits[http://digg.com/video/de-blasio-and-buscemi-train-for-the-inner-circle-show-on-march-22] in a self-deprecating video. But drama inside City Hall took an unwelcome turn with reports that a top aide’s boyfriend was not just a convicted killer — but one who had railed against law enforcement on social media. The aide, Rachel Noerdlinger, and her boyfriend, Hassaun McFarlan, endured withering scrutiny until, after Ms. Noerdlinger’s 17-year-old son was arrested on a trespassing charge, she took an “indefinite leave,” then quickly landed a new political consulting job. Cliffhanger? Finale? N.S.

PLAYA BUREH, Sierra Leona — Hay por lo menos un lugar en este país, a lo largo de una caleta tranquila y bordeada de palmeras, donde nadie habla de cargas virales o índices de mortalidad, centros de tratamiento o trajes de protección.

Más bien el interés se centra en algo más elemental y poderoso: en el ritmo de las olas, el tirón del océano, los grupos que llegan.

Los fines de semana, pese a que el país es presa de la epidemia de ébola, o quizá precisamente por eso, una docena más o menos de surfistas acendrados reman con las manos hacia el oleaje verde-azul, flotando en sus tablas como bichos marinos.

“¿Cómo te va, K.K.?”, le grita un surfista a otra a través del agua, una mañana reciente.

“¡Estoy bien!”, respondió a gritos K.K. Su sonrisa era enorme. “Acabo de agarrar una ola grande.”

El ébola sigue royendo a Sierra Leona, el país más afectado por el virus en todo el mundo. Cientos de personas se contagian cada semana y la cifra oficial de muertes se está acercando a los 3,000. Las excavadoras derriban árboles, allanando los terrenos para construir más cementerios. Pequeñas camionetas con vidrios oscuros recorren los caminos del país, como ominosa visión en el horizonte, con las letras “RIP” pintadas en los costados.

Pero si la muerte continúa, también continúa la vida, cada una tan terca como la otra.

Cada mañana, miles de personas llegan procedentes de las espesas colinas verdes que rodean Freetown, la capital, para ocupar su lugar en escritorios, en quioscos de lámina de metal o a lo largo de los caminos, donde cambia de manos buena parte de la economía, desde mangos y pilas de pantalones hasta tubería de plástico y cubetas de grava.

Los valientes empresarios han convertido la tragedia en arte y en comercio: hacen películas de bajo presupuesto sobre el ébola que venden a dos dólares el DVD. Los pollos rostizados giran en las vitrinas de los restaurantes libaneses, donde la gente se reúne a almorzar y hojear los periódicos para ver la ronda más reciente de malas noticias. Los hoteleros aseguran que el negocio se ha desplomado pero siguen poniendo buena cara.

“Buenos días, ‘mano; buenos días, ‘mana”, cantan a todo pulmón los empleados cada nuevo día.

Pero en las afueras de Freetown, a lo largo de una perfecta media luna de arena dorada, donde unas cabañitas de madera miran al mar y las palmeras se doblan bajo el peso de los cocos, el Club de Surf de Playa Bureh le ha dado otro significado a la palabra resistencia. Aquí nadie se doblega ante el virus. Más bien, los surfistas parecen empeñados en vivir su pasión como forma de lidiar con el mal.

El club apenas estaba empezando cuando atacó el ébola. El propósito del club era fomentar el ecoturismo, proteger la prístina costa de Sierra Leona y crear algunos empleos. El de la playa Bureh es el único club de surf del país y sus más o menos 30 miembros se ganan la vida alquilando las tablas de surf y preparando comidas en la playa para los turistas, que antes llegaban por docenas. Estos días básicamente ven a solitarios trabajadores asistenciales o algunos otros que llegan a trabajar en el ébola.

El letrero a la entrada de la playa, grabado en una vieja tabla de surf, lo dice todo: “Las olas te harán sentir bien”. Jahbez Benga, cuerpo musculoso que solía ser jornalero pesquero hasta que se paró en una tabla de surf por primera vez y nunca quiso mirar atrás, asegura que el surf es como una terapia, especialmente en tiempos como éstos.

“Cuando estamos en el agua”, explica, “no debemos estar pensando en nada, ni en el ébola, ni en nada; solo en las olas.” Los surfistas de Bureh prácticamente hacen zen para bloquear todo lo demás al deslizarse en los labios de las olas del océano y cabalgar en la espuma. Pero alrededor de la pequeña caleta, los demás, en especial los que han tenido la suerte de sobrevivir al ébola, están luchando por volver a encarrilar su vida.

George Bangalie, que vive como a una hora de distancia, apenas recuerda su descenso en la enfermedad. Estaba mareado y después delirante cuando corrió a una clínica de ébola. Lo único que puede recordar ahora son los gemidos de los pacientes, los médicos anónimos y un manchón de enfermeras, trabajadores de limpieza y ordenanzas que lo miraban detenidamente, todos ellos cubiertos de pies a cabeza por trajes amarillos de plástico.

“Era como ver otro mundo”, afirma.

Bangalie se recuperó del ébola y ahora está de regreso en su mundo de antes, una barriada.

“Me siento mejor”, afirma. “Pero necesito mucho un empleo.”

Para muchos pacientes de ébola, el ejercicio es un factor importante de su recuperación.

Quizá haya sido simplemente sicológico, pero muchos sobrevivientes dicen que recuperaron sus fuerzas trotando alrededor de la clínica y haciendo lagartijas en el piso de concreto de los pabellones, animados por sus médicos.

Ese vigor parece ser parte del espíritu nacional de Sierra Leona, especialmente ahora que tanta gente está empeñada en mantenerse saludable. Las calles de Freetown rebosan al atardecer de hombres y mujeres ataviados con brillantes prendas de espándex: trotando, estirándose, saltando la cuerda o haciendo sentadillas y lagartijas en el césped.

Los domingos en la mañana, algunas calles y glorietas están tan atestadas de entusiastas del ejercicio que parece que está por empezar un triatlón. No es raro dar la vuelta a la esquina y encontrar a un entusiasmado hombre de edad haciendo saltos de tijera solo, a mitad de la calle.

En la playa Bureh, todos parecen estar en magníficas condiciones. Los surfistas son esbeltos y fuertes, con cintura de avispa, amplios hombros y abdominales bien definidos. Ninguno del grupo se ha enfermado. A la entrada de la playa hay un retén custodiado por un surfista armado de un termómetro infrarrojo para revisar a todos los visitantes y asegurarse de que todos estén sanos.

El club consiste en un pequeño laberinto de cabañas, algunas para dormir, otras para cocinar. Una docena de tablas de surf se apoyan en un estante de madera blanqueada. Benga es el jefe de instructores y cobra 12 dólares por clase. Examina al visitante con cuidado.

“¿Primera vez?”, pregunta.

“Sí”, responde el turista.

“Ésta servirá”, responde tomando una table de dos metros.

Los dos avanzan difícilmente por la arena suave y húmeda hasta hundirse en las olas. El agua no podía estar a menos de 26 grados. Las olas llegaban, limpias, de un metro de altura en la playa.

A la distancia, dominando la caleta, se levanta un hotel terminado a medias, una víctima más del virus. La playa Bureh estaba preparada para celebrar su primer torneo internacional de surfing hace unos meses, y esperaba atraer a 1,500 turistas y crear 500 empleos. El ébola lo canceló.

Después de unos tambaleantes resbalones, el visitante por fin toma una ola. No hay nada como el siseo que produce el borde de la tabla al cortar el agua como cuchillo, levantando una fina línea de rocío blanco, impulsado por la naturaleza.

“¡Ya se levantó, ya se levantó!”, exclama Benga.

Después de eso, un suntuoso festín aparece en las cabañas de la playa: cangrejo en barbacoa, pescado recién atrapado, papas fritas rebanadas a mano y montañas de arroz condimentado.

Benga irradia orgullo al presentar la comida en platos viejos y despostillados.

Después toma su tabla y vadea hacia el oleaje. Él no pensaba en el torneo cancelado, en el hotel abandonado o en las heridas de su país.

En ese momento, lo único que importaba eran las olas.

Los surfistas de Sierra Leona cuentan con las olas para lidiar con el virus. | Daniel Berehulak para The New York Times | El de la playa Bureh es el único club de surf del país y sus más o menos 30 miembros se ganan la vida alquilando las tablas y preparando comidas para los turistas, que antes llegaban por docenas. | Daniel Berehulak para The New York Times

Health Care as High Drama

With ''America's Bitter Pill,'' Steven Brill's new book, on this week's cover, we asked reporters at The Times with experience covering health care to name a favorite book on the subject.

Sheri Fink recommended Anne Fadiman's ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,'' about the conflict between a California hospital's procedures and a Laotian family's religious beliefs.

''When it came out,'' Fink said, ''it was almost required reading at my medical school. What I appreciated about it was how a single story, deeply reported and well told, could reveal something so profound and broadly important. In this case, it was that a gulf exists between how medical professionals understand illness and how patients and their families do sometimes, and that failing to recognize that can be perilous.'' Fink was also impressed to learn years later that ''the doctors Fadiman wrote about critically maintained a good relationship with her after the book's release and acknowledged their mistakes.''

Pam Belluck selected Tracy Kidder's ''Mountains Beyond Mountains,'' about Paul Farmer, the doctor who helped found the medical aid group Partners in Health. Belluck said the book ''had a profound impact'' on her, in part for its picture of ''the enormity of the tragedy of poverty in the developing world. Much of this was brought back to me during the past two months as I worked with other colleagues on our just-published investigation of how the Ebola outbreak in West Africa exploded out of control. The mountains that remain to be scaled in the Ebola epidemic are daunting, but the commitment of some of the people I spent hours talking with offers a glimmer of hope.''

Quotable

''Coincidence in narrative form is trying to tell us something. We need it because the idea of coincidental encounters that are not really coincidental -- in fact, they're serendipitous in the larger scheme of things -- draws our attention to the idea that we're at home in the world.'' -- Will Self, in Interview magazine

An Optimistic Bear

This week, just a few days before the movie ''Paddington'' hits theaters, Pico Iyer writes about his admiration for one of literature's most famous bears. Michael Bond, 88, Paddington's creator, recently discussed the character's outlook with The Guardian, and it's one well tailored to a new year. ''Paddington is eternally optimistic,'' Bond said, ''and always comes back for more, no matter how many times his hopes are dashed.'' The latest Paddington book was published just before Christmas, and Bond says there will be more. ''If you're a writer, people don't expect you to retire. I don't want to retire, and I'm very happy and very lucky that I'm working.''

British Nurse With Ebola Is Improving, Hospital Says

LONDON — A British nurse who contracted an Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] infection in Sierra Leone last month is no longer in critical condition, the hospital treating her in London said on Monday.

The nurse, Pauline Cafferkey, who returned to Britain[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/unitedkingdom/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] on Dec. 28 and received her diagnosis the same day “is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill,” a statement issued by the Royal Free Hospital said.

Concern about Ms. Cafferkey’s condition grew when it emerged that there was no stock left of the antiviral drug ZMapp, which had been successfully used on a previous Ebola patient in Britain, Will Pooley, also a nurse.

Ms. Cafferkey, a 39-year-old Scottish volunteer for the charity Save the Children, has received experimental drugs and blood plasma from Mr. Pooley, who has recovered. She remains in an isolation unit.

Picturing the Invisible

The thermal imaging systems used by the French police to find the two brothers suspected in the Charlie Hebdo massacre[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html] last week are based on a rapidly evolving technology now turning up in hospitals, airports, and even smartphones.

Like GPS, thermal imaging was once used exclusively by military and law enforcement. In the early 1990s, National Guard aircraft relied on thermal sensors to look for illegal drug activity at the Branch Davidian Compound in Waco, Tex.

In 2013 a Massachusetts State Police helicopter used thermal imaging to locate the Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/09/us/boston-bombing-trial-dzhokhar-tsarnaev.html?ref=us], after a homeowner reported that the bloodied fugitive was hiding in a boat in his yard.

In June last year, a military surveillance aircraft equipped with infrared sensors played a key role in the hunt for Justin Bourque[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/07/world/ap-cn-canada-shooting.html], a fugitive who had killed three police officers in Moncton, New Brunswick. The cameras found him hiding in deep brush late at night.

While humans see reflected light, all objects that surround us — other people, animals and even “cold” objects such as ice — give off heat, radiation beyond the visible spectrum that can be imaged in the form of a “heat signature.” A human body usually gives off more heat than the surrounding field, so it stands out.

Unlike night-vision devices, which amplify small amounts of visible light, thermal imaging cameras rely on sensors known as microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, to make images from heat.

Thermal imaging cameras are made up of a large array of exotic MEMS devices, as well as specialized optics. Conventional glass and plastic lenses cannot be used because they block heat. Instead, these cameras require special lenses manufactured of transparent silicon.

Long used by the military for surveillance, thermal imaging has raised privacy concerns. In 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of sensors by police to detect marijuana plants growing inside a home was a violation of civil liberties because it constituted an unreasonable search.

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in Kyllo v. United States[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/21/us/heat-seeker-s-ability-to-pierce-the-home-comes-under-supreme-court-s-scrutiny.html] that the thermal imaging sensors could reveal things that the average person standing outside a home would not be able to determine — for example whether “the lady of the house” might be taking “her daily sauna and bath.”

Yet despite Fourth Amendment restrictions, the technology has rapidly found its way into low cost-commercial applications where there are no clear legal barriers.

Essess[http://www.essess.com/], a software company started by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has equipped a fleet of vehicles with thermal imaging sensor arrays that make it possible to quickly map energy efficiency in neighborhoods of household and commercial buildings.

FLIR Systems[http://www.flir.com/home/], based in Wilsonville, Ore., and the world’s large maker of thermal imaging gear, has shifted from making 70 percent of its sales to military and government customers to roughly 30 percent today. The company, which had $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013, now makes thermal imaging cameras for consumers that cost less than $300.

“Our target is the do-it-yourself homeowner,” said Andy Teich, FLIR’s chief executive. The company also sells a thermal imaging system that connects to smartphones and allows homeowners to hunt for cold air leaks and plumbing problems.

Mr. Teich said he kept an obsolete military GPS system in his office to remind him of the parallels between that technology and thermal imaging. Once used just in military missiles and planes, GPS receivers are now standard in many consumer devices.

Thermal imaging technologies have now also become part of the arsenal used to halt the spread of disease. Infrared cameras at airports detect high body temperature as passengers pass through airport terminal checkpoints.

The cameras, which can detect changes in body temperature as small as one-tenth of a degree Fahrenheit, were initially used in Southeast Asia in response to outbreaks of SARS and bird flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and more recently to alert officials to individuals who might have contracted Ebola.

A bartender who worked at House Speaker John A. Boehner’s Ohio country club is facing federal charges after the authorities accused him of threatening to shoot Mr. Boehner and poison his drinks, according to court documents[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/13/us/politics/boehner-threat-court-documents.html] unsealed on Tuesday.

The bartender, Michael R. Hoyt, told the authorities in October that he had lost his job at the country club because several members had complained that he had a bad attitude, the documents said. Among those members, Mr. Hoyt said, was Mr. Boehner.

Mr. Hoyt had worked at the Wetherington Country Club in West Chester, Ohio, for five and a half years. He has a long history of mental illness, and he was placed in a psychiatric hospital after the authorities learned of his threats against the speaker, according to the documents.

“Hoyt advised that he often poured drinks for Boehner and could have already put something in his drink, but he did not,” the documents said. “Hoyt stated that no one checks the drinks he poured for Boehner, and it would have been very easy to slip something into his drink.”

Mr. Boehner was “aware of this situation and sincerely thanks the F.B.I., the Capitol Police and local authorities in Ohio for their efforts,” a spokesman for the speaker said in a written statement.

Mr. Hoyt told the authorities that “he was Jesus Christ and that he was going to kill Boehner because Boehner was mean to him at the country club and because Boehner is responsible for Ebola,” the documents said.

The bartender also said that he had a loaded handgun that he was going to use “to shoot Boehner and take off.” The police later recovered a handgun from Mr. Hoyt’s home.

It was not clear Tuesday night whether Mr. Hoyt was in custody, either in or out of a hospital. The United States Capitol Police led the investigation, and a spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment.

Mr. Hoyt sent at least two emails to Mr. Boehner’s wife, Debbie, shortly after he was fired in which he implied the threat against the speaker while seeking information about why he lost his job, the documents said.

“If I had any intention of hurting Mr. Boehner, I could have poisoned his wine at Wetherington, many, many times,” he said.

In response, Ms. Boehner said, “What is this about?”

“Mrs. Boehner, I was fired,” Mr. Hoyt said. “I could not email Mr. Boehner directly because of the ZIP code block on his email. It doesn’t matter anyway. If he took a real interest in anything, he would ensure his club was better than the country, but they are exactly the same and life goes on.”

He added: “Sincerely, Mike. Mike, your former bartender.”

No Time for Bats to Rest Easy

LEWISBURG, PA. — The 10 hibernating little brown bats hang from a corner of their tailor-made refrigeration chamber at Bucknell University like a clump of old potato skins, only less animated. In torpor, bats become one with their wintry surroundings, their body temperatures falling to just above freezing, their heart rates slowing to one or two beats a minute, their breathing virtually undetectable.

But suddenly, a male yanks himself free of the bunch and hops down to a dish on the floor. After taking a long, slow drink of water, the bat uses the claws on his folded wings to hoist himself along the wire mesh of the chamber, his motions angular, deliberative and spidery. A second bat rappels down for a drink, and then a third.

“Well, that’s a lucky break,” said Thomas Lilley, a tall and crisply composed postdoctoral fellow from Finland. “Multiple rounds of bat drama.”

As Bucknell’s de facto bat concierge, Dr. Lilley helps wild bats acclimate to life in captivity, a difficult task with an urgent spur. He and his colleagues are laboring mightily to understand white-nose syndrome, a devastating fungal disease that has killed at least six million North American bats since it first appeared in Albany a decade ago and that threatens to annihilate some bat species entirely.

Because the fungus attacks bats as they hibernate in caves, the researchers are exploring the complex biology of normal bat hibernation, and so-called arousal bouts turn out to be a big part of the puzzle, said Kenneth Field, an associate professor of biology.

Hibernating bats will warm themselves out of torpor every week or two throughout the winter, for several hours at a stretch. Though researchers don’t yet understand the reasons for the thermal interludes, they have quantified just how important such thaws must be to bat survival.

“All the work that bats do during the fall, feeding nonstop and putting on fat until they’re like butterballs on wings, and 90 percent is spent to sustain the winter warm-ups,” said DeeAnn Reeder, a professor of biology and one of the nation’s leading bat ecologists.

New research suggests that white-nose syndrome begins disrupting the arousal-torpor cycle long before any telltale white fuzz appears on the bat’s face and wings, and that the disorder really spins out of control when the bat’s immune system behaves in a distinctly unbatlike manner, mounting a zealous response against the fungal spores.

Unbatlike because, as scientists are discovering, the bat immune system is astonishingly tolerant of most pathogens — a trait that could pose risks to people, but that also offers clues to preventing human diseases of aging, including cancer.

Evidence is mounting that bats can serve as reservoirs of many of the world’s deadliest viruses[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC3958617/]], including the pathogens behind Ebola, Marburg and related hemorrhagic fevers; acute respiratory syndromes like SARS and MERS; and even familiar villains like measles and mumps.

Yet bats appear largely immune to the many viruses they carry and rarely show signs of the diseases that will rapidly overwhelm any human, monkey, horse, pig or other mammalian host the microbes manage to infiltrate.

Scientists have also learned that bats live a seriously long time for creatures of their small size. The insectivorous Brandt’s bat of Eurasia, for example, weighs an average of just six grams, compared with 20 grams for a mouse. But while a mouse is lucky to live for a year, the Brandt’s bat can survive well into its 40s — a disparity between life span and body mass that a report in Nature Communications[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/23962925] called “the most extreme” of all mammals.

Bats may be girded against cancer, too. “At this stage, the evidence is anecdotal,” said Lin-Fa Wang, a bat virologist at the Duke-NUS Graduate School in Singapore and the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong. “But of all the bat biologists I’ve spoken with, I’ve only heard of one or two cases of bat tumors.”

Researchers are scrutinizing bat DNA and the details of the bat vocation for clues to what sets the flying mammals apart from other members of the lactating clade. Preliminary findings indicate that bats’ apparent indifference to the viral throngs they harbor, together with their Methuselah-grade longevity, probably arose from the adaptations needed to grant them the power of flight.

Bat experts argue that a keener understanding of bat biology could not only help prevent the next outbreak of Ebola or other cross-species “zoonotic” infection, but also offer a fresh take on immune and inflammatory disorders like diabetes or heart disease.

Scientists warn against misguided calls in some areas for the culling of bats as a way to combat the risk of viral transmission, and they urge the public not to succumb to old-fashioned bat phobia that long linked bats to witches, vampires, demons and cobwebs.

Bats play essential roles in the environment, researchers said. Insectivorous bats are the top predators of night-flying insects, including mosquitoes: Dr. Reeder estimated that for every million bats killed by white-nose syndrome, 692 tons of insects go undevoured each summer. Fruit- and nectar-eating bats are major pollinators and seed dispersers.

“A politician in Australia said, ‘Bomb the bats,' ” Dr. Wang said. “But if you do that, you’ll destroy the ecosystem and then you’ll get more infectious disease, not less.” The risks from wanton batricide could well be immediate: Recent research suggests that bats are likeliest to shed viral particles when they are under stress and their numbers are shrinking[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/25392474].

Besides, wherever you go, there they are. With some 1,200 species under the Chiroptera trademark, bats are the second-most populous mammalian order, after rodents. “One in every five mammals is a bat,” Dr. Reeder said.

They’re found on every continent but Antarctica and range in size from the Kitti’s hog-nosed bat — which at an inch long vies with the Etruscan shrew for the title of world’s smallest mammal — to the giant golden-crowned flying fox, with a wingspan approaching six feet and a soulful face that Raina Plowright, an infectious disease ecologist and bat expert at Montana State University, likened to that of a puppy dog.

Scientists traditionally have divided bats into two big suborders: the fruit-eating megabats and insect-eating microbats, deeming the groups so distinct they might have evolved flight independently.

Yet a recent genomic analysis[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/23258410] in the journal Science reveals that the ability to fly dates to the earliest days of the bat lineage, some 90 million years ago, and that megas did not split from micros for another 10 million years, after which the micros alone evolved the capacity for echolocation, to help them hunt their insect prey.

The new study also described other important traits that bats of both suborders share. For one thing, researchers found an “unexpected concentration” of genes involved in repairing damaged DNA. Those fix-it factors, the scientists proposed, are the bat’s solution to the blistering demands of flight.

When a bat flies, its heart beats an impressive 1,000 times a minute, and its metabolism ramps up 15-fold over resting rate. By contrast, said David Blehert of the United States Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., the metabolism of a running rodent is seven times normal, “and that’s only for a short burst, whereas a bat can fly at 15-fold metabolic rate for hours.”

All that fiery flapping ends up generating a huge number of metabolic byproducts called free radicals, which could mutilate the bat’s DNA were it not for its extra-strength molecular repair crew. And countering DNA damage happens to be a great strategy for overall health, which could explain bats’ exceptional longevity and apparent resistance to cancer.

Other clues to bat exceptionalism can be found in its molecular profile. Immune factors that serve as the body’s first responders have been ramped up, while immune molecules that in most mammals turn aggressive at later stages of an infection are damped down in bats.

As a result, Dr. Wang said, “when a virus comes in, bats are very efficient at handling it, but they don’t overreact.” And the overreaction of the body’s immune system, scientists have found, often proves far more dangerous than the viral infection itself.

Researchers suggest that changes to the bat’s immune system originated as part of the heightened demand for DNA repair, and later proved valuable for its general life strategy.

Bats often live in colonies of hundreds of thousands. They travel long distances and are exposed to a staggering array of pathogens. They cannot afford to be flustered by every freeloading microbe, and for the most part, they do not.

That makes the lethality of white-nose syndrome that much more confounding. “Here we have an animal that can survive some of the scariest viruses we know,” Dr. Blehert said, “and it’s undone by a common soil fungus.”

He and his colleagues have found that, starting at the earliest stages of infection, afflicted hibernating bats begin burning twice as much energy as unaffected bats. Dr. Reeder and her colleagues have shown that bats with white-nose come out of hibernation twice as often as healthy bats.

And while normal bats spend much of their arousal time resting, “sick bats don’t,” she said. “Instead, they’re grooming constantly, so their arousals are even more costly.” The ultimate blow may come from the bats’ immune response to the fungus, which preliminary evidence suggests is unusually strong.

“And that,” Dr. Field said, “could be what’s dooming the bats.”

World Bank Lowers Expectations for Global Growth in 2015

WASHINGTON — The World Bank[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org], citing stagnation in Europe and Japan and a slowdown in China, downgraded its forecast for the global economy this year. It also reported that world economic growth came in below expectations in 2014.

The bank predicts the world economy will expand 3 percent this year, up from 2.6 percent in 2014 but down from predictions last June by World Bank economists of 3.4 percent growth this year and 2.8 percent for 2014.

“The recovery has been sputtering in the euro area and Japan as legacies of the financial crisis linger,” the bank said on Tuesday in the first of its twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects[http://www.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/en/publication/global-economic-prospects] reports.

Plunging oil prices and stronger growth in the United States are expected to help raise global growth in 2015. The bank expects the United States economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, up from 2.4 percent in 2014.

Growth among the 19 European Union members that use the euro currency is expected to pick up modestly — to 1.1 percent in 2015 from 0.8 percent last year. Likewise, the Japanese economy is expected to rebound to 1.2 percent growth this year from 0.2 percent in 2014.

The bank expects China’s economy to expand 7.1 percent this year, down from 7.4 percent in 2014. The slowdown reflects in part the Chinese government’s effort to rein in excessive lending and wasteful investment.

Over all, the bank expects high-income countries to grow 2.2 percent this year, up from 1.8 percent in 2014. Developing countries will grow 4.8 percent, an improvement from 4.4 percent in 2014.

But the bank sees risks that could spoil its forecast. There is potential for a financial crisis if investors withdraw money from emerging markets to take advantage of rising interest rates and improving economic prospects in the United States. That could cause emerging-market currencies to plummet and squeeze companies that have borrowed in United States dollars — a partial replay of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.

Conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East also could disrupt economic growth. The Chinese economy could tumble into a “disorderly slowdown.” And sub-Saharan African economies, expected to grow a healthy 4.6 percent in 2015, could be devastated instead if the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not contained.

The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Tuesday that the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa could be brought under control, but that “we are by no means out of the woods.” The director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said he was “very confident we can get to zero cases in this epidemic if we continue the way we’re going and nothing unexpected happens.” But he said that the recovery was patchy and fragile. Liberia and Sierra Leone have made progress, said Jeremy Konyndyk, an official with the Agency for International Development. But the situation in Guinea remains troubling, Dr. Frieden said, partly because of resistance to efforts to combat the disease.

A Nurse Decides to Get Hands-On in the Ebola Zone

Lindsey Hallen is in the bug spray aisle at REI, the outdoor equipment emporium in SoHo, looking for exactly the right mosquito repellent to take to West Africa’s Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] zone, when her phone rings. Three ascending tones, the personal anthem of an emergency room nurse, captured in a ringtone called “Summit.”

“Hello?” she says, pulling the phone out of her jacket pocket. Then in an aside, “I think this is them.”

Ms. Hallen listens, pacing back and forth along the aisle, as her gaunt face takes on the same wide-eyed look of concentration it assumes as when she works in the emergency room at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. Total Focus. Matter of Life and Death.

Since the latest Ebola outbreak entered public consciousness, most accounts of United States health workers have focused on the ones returning; the missionaries who were airlifted out and brought back from the brink of death, or Craig Spencer, the young doctor cured of the virus at New York City’s premier public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, while much of the city held its breath.

Now Ms. Hallen, a 31-year-old nurse with two years’ experience working with critically ill patients in this country, is going the other way, heading to West Africa to fight an epidemic that has sickened 21,000 people and killed more than 8,000.

“Why?” her friends and colleagues invariably ask when they find out what she is doing. Why would a relatively young, untested nurse want to risk putting her life in jeopardy to help save people living thousands of miles away, people sick and dying of a brutal, bleeding, contagious fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]?

The question annoys her. Her reasons are instinctive, from the gut. You feel driven to do this or you don’t. The thinking only comes later.

“Why not?” she replies. “Why not me?” So the phone call shakes her. The woman on the other end of the line is a recruiter for Partners in Health[http://www.pih.org/], the Boston organization that is sending her to West Africa. Instead of Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], as had been planned, the group now wants her to go to Liberia, the woman says. Ebola cases there have fallen, but they need people who can rebuild the shattered medical system, teach about controlling infection. She won’t have direct contact with patients. Yes, she can still go to Sierra Leone if she wants to, and take care of patients there. The final decision is up to her.

So the choice is this: Be an instructor, safe, teaching other people how to wear a protective suit, or be the one wearing the suit. She is given a day to decide.

Ebola officially reached American shores on Sept. 30, when Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian visiting family in Dallas, tested positive for the virus. Preparing for a possible onslaught, Lenox Hill Hospital set up a room within the emergency department where Ebola patients would be isolated. The staff had to be trained in wearing protective gear, the stifling, fluid-proof layers that include bootees, gloves, gowns, goggles and face shields. The more Ms. Hallen learned, the more she wanted to know. She volunteered for advanced training. She started lingering on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/]. “I was looking at the case numbers and I started to become a little obsessed with everything that was going on over there, and how it was impacting us here,” she said.

She spoke of her newfound interest to her older sister, Kimberly, a real estate photographer, who sensed that this was more than a casual attraction. “She texted me saying she had volunteered to train how to handle Ebola if it came to New York City,” Kimberly recalled. “In the back of my head, I was like, ‘Oh, God, I feel like this is going to expand into her wanting to do a little bit more.’ But I kind of put it away. Maybe not.”

“She’s always been like this ever since she was little,” Kimberly Hallen said. “She was always the one who was trying to find the next fun thing to do. She was bored so easily.”

Lindsey Hallen, a slight blonde with eyes that shift from green to blue depending on the weather and her mood, grew up in suburban Cheshire, Conn., and was a communications major in college, but not a very serious one. “I was very social and that was what I cared about,” she said. After graduation, she moved to Hawaii, without knowing anyone or even having visited. “I was amazed how well everything fell into place,” she said.

She worked at an animal clinic and went to South Africa on an unpaid internship in wildlife conservation. After two years, she moved to Boston, where her sister lives, and began working at Global Vision International[http://www.gviusa.com/], the organization that had sponsored her internship. Her job sent her to South Africa, Guatemala and Costa Rica, to make sure projects were running smoothly. As a memento, she wears three bracelets on her right arm made of twisted copper and brass that she bought at street markets in South Africa. She never took them off, but she had to leave them with her sister before departing for Africa.

After three years, she wanted to grow. She thought about veterinary school, but she also wanted to travel. “Nursing came to mind as a perfect middle ground,” she said. Now, after two years in the E.R., the dread that she has done something wrong no longer wakes her at night. She can rattle off the medical script for an alcoholic with the shakes, a child with the flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or an elderly woman with a broken hip like someone reciting a Social Security[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] number.

There has to be more to life than the three-block dash from her Upper East Side brownstone studio to the 8-a.m.-to-8-p.m. shift at Lenox Hill, and back.

The Ebola patient in Dallas died on Oct. 8, having set off a rapid chain of events. Two nurses who treated him fell ill, shaking confidence in the United States health care system. In mid-October, several New York hospitals volunteered to be Ebola treatment centers, including a sister hospital to Lenox Hill. On Oct. 23, Dr. Spencer, recently returned from Guinea, was rushed to Bellevue and tested positive. The next day, Kaci Hickox, a nurse returning from Sierra Leone through Newark Liberty International Airport, was forced into quarantine because of public officials’ fears.

Rather than being frightened, Ms. Hallen was swept away. Ebola was her 9/11, the disaster that nourished her sense of purpose.

Scrolling through the C.D.C. website, she came across a link to an application form for medical volunteers willing to go to West Africa, kind of like a universal college application online.

She recalls sending it in a few days after Ms. Hickox returned. Her first response, from Partners in Health, arrived on Halloween[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/halloween/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] night. She sent back an email as she dressed for a Halloween party. She was not a sexy witch, or even a nurse. She wore a $12 zombie suit with a zipper splitting her face.

Still, she didn’t really think it would happen. And she assumed that even if she were selected, she would not be paid, and she could not afford that. But Partners in Health agreed to pay for her travel, expenses and medical insurance, as well as provide a stipend that would cover most of her lost salary for nine weeks; six weeks in West Africa and three weeks upon her return, during the disease’s incubation period. As a single person, she didn’t have to worry about disrupting anyone else’s life.

The agency also agreed to pay for her evacuation if she contracted Ebola — a further reminder of the dangers.

Her mother, Laura, cried when she heard the news. Her father, Dan, “had a million questions” but was proud of her.

“I think that she’s got the right mentality to perform in this type of environment,” Mr. Hallen said. “I guess what I would liken it to is firefighters that rush into a burning building when everyone else is running out. All I can say to that is, thank God for them. Where would we be without them?”

That mentality is not widely shared, the numbers suggest.

Since November, about 1,300 people have applied to travel to West Africa through Partners in Health, and about 360 have been hired, Sheila Davis, chief of the agency’s Ebola response, said. She said she was still looking for people with the right “humility,” but the number of applicants has declined as Ebola has moved off the front pages.

North Shore-LIJ Health System, the hospital network that includes Lenox Hill, has 54,000 employees. Ms. Hallen is only the second one to go to West Africa to treat Ebola, Joseph Moscola, the system’s chief of human resources, said. An informal survey of other New York City hospitals found few if any volunteers at most of them.

At some hospitals an internal debate rages over whether highly trained specialists should be volunteering to do menial work in African field hospitals or can make a better contribution at home, perhaps by doing Ebola research.

“Major academic institutions, you would think, would be those who would be pushing it,” Ms. Davis said. “But it’s the opposite. It’s definitely been Middle America, and California, but not the numbers you would think in Boston and New York.”

In preparation for Ms. Hallen’s trip, Partners in Health sent her a packing list. Mostly it is similar to a list for summer sleep-away camp: shampoo, toothbrush, underwear. But not entirely. She will need a headlamp, in case the electricity goes down, and some fancier clothes to wear for Embassy events. Also, styptic pencils to stanch cuts, and tampons, for nosebleeds, ominous inclusions in an environment where bodily fluids may be deadly. Ms. Hallen has scratched out the word “condoms[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/condoms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].” She has enough contagion to worry about, she said. She trades email with other volunteers. Bring washable shoes, they say. Dried fruit, nuts and granola bars, to break the monotony of rice and beans.

She picks up her mosquito net at REI and jokes that she might use it to keep away the cockroaches in her apartment. Last night she slept with a hat on, haunted by a woman who had arrived at the emergency room with ear pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/earache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. The diagnosis: a cockroach stuck in her ear canal.

At the checkout counter, the brooding, longhaired salesman examines her basket and asks where she is going. “Sierra Leone or Liberia,” she replies.

“You should read this book,” he says, and on a scrap of paper writes the name Peter Piot[http://www.un.org.proxy.bc.edu/ga/aids/PeterPiot.html], author of a memoir about the discovery of Ebola and AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

The next night, she writes an email to the recruiter from Partners in Health. Deletes it. Writes it again. Presses “send” at 11:42 p.m.

PORTLAND, Ore. — “It is a solemn and important duty we have,” Allan Metcalf, a grandfatherly looking man, said into a microphone. He was standing in front of a crowd of the nation’s top linguists, many of whom were still flooding into the already packed room. The space was tight, Mr. Metcalf apologized, but the linguists had only an hour. They had to get started.

“What happens after this?” I whispered to a man next to me.

“After we choose the Word of the Year[http://www.americandialect.org/woty]?” he asked. “Pillaging. I expect downtown Portland to be wrecked.” He paused. “That’s rekt,” a shorthand spelling of the word. “R-E-K-T.”

It was a bit of linguistic humor for the start of what is perhaps the year’s most anticipated lexicological event: the annual selection of the Word of the Year (also known as WOTY) by the American Dialect Society[http://www.americandialect.org/]. If wordsmiths had a Super Bowl, this would be it, a place where the nation’s most well-regarded grammarians, etymologists and language enthusiasts gather to talk shop.

The convention itself is about more than WOTY. Attendees have their choice of lectures on vocal fry (a creaky voice vibration common among young women), an exploration of “totally awesome,” multisyllabic rhyme in hip-hop and the Cronut, as well as more “complicated and linguisticky” topics, as one of the event’s hosts put it, like “On the nucleus-offglide trajectory of the mid-back rounded vowel in California English.”

It was also a kind of Who’s Who of the linguistic elite. Among them were Geoff Nunberg, who frequently speaks alongside Terry Gross as NPR’s linguistic contributor, and Anne Curzan, a language historian, whose TED talk on what makes a word “real”[https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real] has logged more than a million views. There was the forensic linguistics pioneer Roger Shuy, who has testified in dozens of criminal court cases, as well as Michael Adams, the author of “Slayer Slang[http://www.pbs.org/speak/words/sezwho/buffy/],” a 285-page investigation into the language of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”

But as far as WOTY went, this convention was special. It was the event’s 25th anniversary. From “Not!” — the 1992 selection, a “Wayne’s World” classic — to “chad” (the hanging bits of paper that almost swayed the 2000 presidential election), this year’s vote had drawn the largest crowd to date.

The rules for WOTY selection are simple: Anyone, including the public, can participate. Words can be nominated from the floor (perhaps the only time you’ll see a linguist shout). And the terms should be “newish,” said Ben Zimmer, the chairman of the new words committee and the event’s M.C. Though the contest is called, yes, word of the year, multiword expressions are allowed (to the chagrin of some purists).

By the time the linguists had arrived on this dreary Friday evening, a shortlist had been printed, the result of a small nominating ceremony the night before.

Among the finalists, in the “most creative” category, was “manspreading,” when a man spreads his legs on public transportation, blocking other seats (A woman quipped from the floor: “Really, men. People want to sit next to you!”), and “narcisstick,” a pejorative term for the selfie stick[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/style/the-selfie-stick-takes-manhattan.html].

There were serious words like Ebola, as well as “platisher,” a blend of “platform” and “publisher” that Grant Barrett, the host of a linguistic radio show, deemed the “ugliest word of 2014.” “PEOPLE JUST VOMITED,” he typed onto the projection screen.

Being that this year’s event was in Portland, it was only fitting that the “lumbersexual” (a fashionably rugged man who adopts the dress and facial hair of a lumberjack) was included in the “most unnecessary” category.

“Sometimes the words are just fun,” said Tyler Schnoebelen, a San Francisco-based linguist who looked not un-lumbersexual in a chunky sweater and beard.

But, he added, “There is something beautiful about a perfectly chosen word or phrase.”

This year, the linguists decided that neither emoji nor emoticons would be considered among the entries, despite the pleas of Gretchen McCulloch, the editor of the language blog at Slate, who vowed to argue for it again next year. But the hashtag was given its own category for the first time. Among the “most notable hashtags” were #yesallwomen, spawned in the wake of the shooting near the University of California, Santa Barbara; #icantbreathe, the final words of Eric Garner; and #blacklivesmatter, which has become a rallying cry against racial injustice after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

“It’s exciting to see the hashtag be taken as a viable linguistic unit,” said Allison Shapp, a 28-year-old who is studying language on Twitter.

Yet while a contest of the most topical words may be good for press — indeed, Oxford, Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com all have their own WOTYs now, too — it doesn’t mean the terminology will endure. Back when the American Dialect Society’s contest began in 1990, Mr. Metcalf, the society’s executive secretary, hoped it would bring the joy of wordplay to the masses. Then again, the first winner was a head-scratcher: “Bushlips,” to describe insincere political rhetoric.

As Mr. Zimmer explained, “It was a reference to George H. W. Bush’s promise of ‘Read my lips: No new taxes.’ But now it just sounds. ...”

Dirty? Unintelligible?

“It’s true that things that seem very zeitgeisty at the moment may be incomprehensible to future generations,” he said.

That’s particularly true these days, as each new word seems more memey than the last. Linguists now use Twitter to study word patterns, and many of this year’s nominations originated online, including “Columbusing,” to define acts of cultural appropriation (i.e., Columbus “discovering” America).

“The word I will always regret not voting for is nomnomnom,” Mr. Schnoebelen said, referring to the voracious onomatopoeic eating sounds of Cookie Monster (think, “om nom nom nom!”). That entry lost to “app” in 2010.

“I remember distinctly the linguist who nominated nom saying that ‘A vote for nomnomnom is a vote for joy,' ” Mr. Schnoebelen said. “I think she was right.”

Meanwhile, in the back of the room, two young women explained to an older attendee what a “bae” was (another word for a beau). Which makes “baeless” a person without a bae (i.e., single).

At the suggestion of “conscious uncoupling,” made infamous by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, there were audible groans. But there was lively discussion of “budtender,” part of the new vernacular of legal marijuana[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/fashion/vape-joins-pot-lingo-as-oxfords-word-of-the-year.html] to describe a bartender for pot. “Marijuana dispensaries are only going to increase,” a woman in the front said.

And then there was “basic,” which began in hip-hop but has come to define a certain breed of human (usually female) who likes mainstream products and is probably wearing Uggs. (“Drinking pumpkin lattes, wearing leggings,” said Jane Solomon, a lexicographer at Dictionary.com[http://Dictionary.com].)

“Basic! Basic! Basic!” younger linguists began to chant.

Mr. Zimmer called the crowd to order. There were only a few minutes remaining.

The final vote would prove a rare moment when a room of linguists would all agree: #blacklivesmatter should be Word of the Year.

As a political statement, it was a virtual lock. But, naturally, the debate over its linguistic validity had just begun.

“By what manner of well-meaning legerdemain,” the linguist Jonathan Lighter, a slang expert, later asked, “does a three-word Most Notable Hashtag become Word of the Year?”

Fred Shapiro, a Yale law librarian, asked, “So I guess there is no real distinction between ‘word of the year’ and ‘quotation of the year’?”

Ms. Shapp explained that one must understand “that what makes a word a word is not even a settled concept in our world.”

This, it seemed, was a very modern new word order.

Correction: January 25, 2015, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the selection of the 2014 Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society described incorrectly the location of shootings in California last May in a reference to the judges’ consideration of #yesallwomen, a phrase used on the Internet after the shootings. They occurred near the University of California, Santa Barbara — not on the campus.

The hashtag #blacklivesmatter was selected as the winner of the American Dialect Society’s Word of the Year competition for 2014. | Dan Cronin for The New York Times | Room for debate at a linguistics convention. | Dan Cronin for The New York Times

Along the Niger, the Beat of the Sahel

Down by the Niger River last February, a Tuareg street performer was warming up the crowd. The evening concert at the Festival on the Niger was about to begin, and the promenade inside the concert grounds was filled with early arrivals. Dozens had gathered in a circle around the elderly nomad, who was draped in a blue robe and a black veil. Robe flying, the toothless dervish hurled himself to the ground, flipped and twirled with the loose-limbed dexterity of a teenager. Two Tuareg women, seated cross-legged on the ground, served as his musical backups: One beat a calabash with a plastic sandal, the other played a tapered wood-and-goatskin drum known as a tendé.

Just down the river, light and sound engineers were prepping the stage -- a huge barge moored just off the bank -- for the evening's main event, performances by bands from across the Sahel -- Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.

I had arrived in the Niger River town of Ségou two days earlier, after a rough four-hour drive on a decaying tarmac road from Bamako, the capital of Mali. The last time I had made this journey, in January 2013, I had shared the road with an armored French convoy, which was speeding to the front lines in Timbuktu to drive out the jihadists who had occupied the north. But now the country was quiet -- more or less -- and, after a year's hiatus because of the war, the Festival on the Niger was back in business. For four evenings during the first week of February, many of the country's best musicians performed before a crowd of thousands, including several hundred foreigners. The highlight was a final-night performance by Salif Keita, the golden-voiced singer who kicked off a Malian music boom, along with Ali Farka Touré, in the 1980s.

I've long been a Malian music aficionado, but I had only recently heard about this festival. Though it debuted in 2002, it was, until a few years ago, overshadowed by its rival, the Festival in the Desert, known as the ''African Woodstock,'' set in the sand dunes 40 miles west of Timbuktu. Big-name Western performers -- Robert Plant, Bono, Jimmy Buffett, Manu Chao -- made a pilgrimage to the desert, playing alongside famous local bands such as Tinariwen. But in early 2012 an alliance of Tuareg separatists and jihadists from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb occupied the north and imposed sharia law. Jihadists smashed guitars, burned studios and threatened to kill musicians. Half a million people, including many performers, fled to the south of Mali or to refugee camps in neighboring countries.

The French military intervention, known as Operation Serval, was largely successful, but it couldn't totally eradicate the rebel threat. Despite hope that the Festival in the Desert would return to the Sahara in January 2014, occasional rocket attacks, ambushes and kidnappings in the north made that impossible. The festival's promoters canceled it again for 2015.

With the Festival in the Desert out of commission, the Festival on the Niger in Ségou -- a southern city never occupied by the jihadists -- has become the best place in the world to hear live Malian music. The desert's loss has been the river's gain.

No doubt the festival will be greeted as a welcome reprieve from the specter of Ebola, which killed six people in Mali last fall after leaving thousands dead in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. In mid-December the World Health Organization reported that the last confirmed Ebola patient in Mali had left the hospital, and the last person who had contact with someone with Ebola had been declared virus-free after the 21-day quarantine. The prospect of a major outbreak of the virus did worry promoters, but the festival should be moving ahead as scheduled from Feb. 4 to 8.

Last year, the director of the Festival on the Niger had decreed that the theme would be ''cultural diversity and national unity.'' In keeping with that spirit, the festival opened with a concert by the Peace Caravan, a group of northern musicians, many of whom had performed at the Festival in the Desert and had been forced to flee for their lives.

That evening, I took a taxi through Ségou -- a pleasantly dilapidated town of rutted streets, motor scooters, donkey carts and a few faded colonial-era villas -- to a crumbling cultural center surrounding a postage-stamp concrete stage. A few hundred chairs had been set up in a dirt courtyard.

There was some grumbling from the Peace Caravan performers about being relegated to a second-class venue far from the barge. Some voiced the suspicion that the treatment reflected lingering resentment toward the Tuaregs, the Berber people whose latest uprising and alliance with Al Qaeda had torn apart the country. But a standing-room-only crowd -- United Nations peacekeepers, Malian generals in camouflage uniforms and red berets, European and American tourists and locals -- filled the modest concert space, and the complaints quickly faded.

Khaira Arby, a half-Tuareg, half-Arab diva known as ''the Nightingale of the North,'' had fled when the jihadists took over Timbuktu in April 2012. Al Qaeda militants trashed her guitars and recording studio and threatened to cut out her tongue if they captured her. In a sequin-studded green gown and a tiara of gold coins, rows of silver bracelets jangling on her arms, she swept back and forth across the stage, gesticulating grandly, her voice booming as she sang in Tamasheq, the Tuareg language.

Ahmed Ag Kaedi, a Tuareg guitarist from Kidal, in Mali's far northeast, and his band, Amanar, followed Ms. Arby onto the stage. In August 2012, Mr. Kaedi had returned from a sojourn in the desert to find his house in flames. Jihadists had doused his guitars in gasoline and set them on fire, then left a message with his sister: ''When Ahmed comes back tell him [that if] he plays music again, we will come back and cut off his fingers.''

Amanar's music was stark and haunting: a few hypnotic guitar phrases, call-and-response vocals and fingerpicking guitar solos. The music evoked Carlos Santana, Mr. Touré and their Tuareg compatriots Tinariwen. After midnight, all the musicians gathered onstage for a jam session, joined by a hundred jubilant spectators.

During the daytime, the promoters arranged cultural events: art exhibitions, symposiums on Malian music. But I preferred to spend my days between concerts sleeping late, having a leisurely lunch in one of several terraced restaurants along the river and then, in the cooler part of the afternoon, wandering down footpaths along the Niger. Fishermen cast their nets from wooden pirogues, and farmers tilled the furrowed plots along the riverbank. The river, about half a mile wide here, has a rich history: It was from this bank that the French colonial army, led by Lt. Col. Eugéne Etienne Bonnier, set off in gunboats to conquer Timbuktu in December 1893 -- only to be massacred by Tuareg warriors.

On the third evening of the festival, I made my way to the main concert venue by the river. Hawkers inside the grounds proffered silver jewelry, CDs, bamboo chairs and embroidered leather saddlebags. The aromas of frying fish, incense and gasoline wafted through the air. People sat in plastic chairs in front of makeshift restaurants, drinking bottles of Flag and Castel beer under a half moon. The muddy riverbank between the barge and the bleachers was still fairly empty, and I planted myself at the edge of the murky water. Then the lights came on and the M.C. took the stage, launching into a patter of Bambara, French and English.

''Is there anybody from the United States here? Do you speak English?'' he asked. The crowd roared back. Though French is the lingua franca of Mali, the United States is popular, and English nowadays has the greater cachet here.

An all-female group called the Kaladjoula Band, seven singers and instrumentalists from southern Mali, got the crowd rocking, with lively harmonies and dance moves. Almost imperceptibly the crowd before the barge had swelled, pressing me on all sides.

The Malians shared the bill this evening with several non-Malian acts, reflecting the growing international flavor of the festival. Sékouba Bambino, from neighboring Guinea, draped in white silk, singing in a rich tenor, reminded me of Salif Keita, whose performance the following night I would have to miss because of a reporting assignment in the still-unstable north. Stelbee, a beautiful young woman from Burkina Faso in a matching yellow turban and floor-length gown, sang infectious melodies in a mix of Swahili, French and English.

Then Ms. Arby, the diva from Timbuktu, who had complained about being relegated to a second-class status on opening night, took the stage. Her complaints had won her an encore performance, this time on the barge before perhaps 8,000 people.

''I'm singing for the Tuaregs who never picked up arms against their country,'' she proclaimed to the crowd's roar of approval. It was a gesture of reconciliation, and a plea for unity, in a nation that had been torn apart by war and occupation. This Festival on the Niger offered perhaps the best indication that the country was regaining a degree of normality.

Exhausted after a long day and night in the tropical heat, I stole away from the concert at 1 a.m. and made my way back in a taxi to the hotel through Ségou's deserted streets. The music was still going strong.

Unlike Ebola, flu or polio, cancer is a disease that arises from within -- a consequence of the mutations that inevitably occur when one of our 50 trillion cells divides and copies its DNA.

Some of these genetic misprints are caused by outside agents, chemical or biological, especially in parts of the body -- the skin, the lungs and the digestive tract -- most exposed to the ravages of the world. But millions every second occur purely by chance -- random, spontaneous glitches that may be the most pervasive carcinogen of all.

It's a truth that grates against our deepest nature. That was clear earlier this month when a paper in Science on the prominent role of ''bad luck'' and cancer caused an outbreak of despair, outrage and, ultimately, disbelief.

The most intemperate of this backlash -- mini-screeds on Twitter and hit-and-run comments on the web -- suggested that the authors, Cristian Tomasetti and Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University, must be apologists for chemical companies or the processed food industry. In fact, their study was underwritten by nonprofit cancer foundations and grants from the National Institutes of Health. In some people's minds, those were just part of the plot.

What psychologists call apophenia -- the human tendency to see connections and patterns that are not really there -- gives rise to conspiracy theories. It is also at work, though usually in a milder form, in our perceptions about cancer and our revulsion to randomness.

It takes several mutations, in specific combinations, for a cell to erupt into a malignant tumor. The idea that random copying errors are prominent among them is thoroughly mainstream. What was new about the paper was its attempt to measure this biological bad luck and see how it compares with the two other corners of the cancer triangle: environment and heredity -- mutations we inherit from our parents that can give cancer a head start.

The mix of these influences varies. A lifetime of heavy smoking has been shown to multiply the risk of lung cancer -- the most common malignancy in the world -- by some twentyfold, or about 2,000 percent. But that is an anomaly. One of the great frustrations of cancer prevention has been the failure to find other chemical carcinogens so definitive or damaging, especially in the dilute amounts in which they reach most of the public.

For a handful of cancers, biological agents are important, like human papilloma virus in cervical cancer and helicobacter pylori in stomach cancer. On another level, inflammation and hormonal imbalances, like those associated with obesity and diabetes, can drive cells to multiply more frequently, increasing the chance of mutations causal and accidental.

Finally, heredity -- like the BRCA mutations involved in some breast cancers -- can have a profound effect in individual cases. But inheritance appears to be involved in just 5 to 10 percent of all cancers.

What that leaves is a large role for random, spontaneous mutations -- the ones that just happen because of the microscopic grind of life.

That is not a reason for resignation. It is frequently estimated that some 40 percent of cancers are preventable. But that means some 60 percent are not.

To get a feel for that balance, the authors looked at stem cells -- those that are capable of dividing indefinitely and renewing themselves. First, they estimated the number of these cells in different tissues of the body and how many times they would copy themselves during a human lifetime. The higher the count, the greater the vulnerability to mutations.

Then they compared that number with the likelihood that a tissue would develop a malignant tumor. The result was a strong correlation, a steep sloping line suggesting that two-thirds of the difference in cancer susceptibility could be explained by spontaneous errors.

Tissues that deviated from the relationship, contracting cancer at a higher rate, were presumably swayed more strongly by something else.

For cancers like those of the bone and brain, chance seemed to rule. But at the other end of the spectrum were those that were more ''deterministic'' -- like lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, a usually harmless skin malignancy where sunlight plays a deciding part. Also at that extreme were rare cancers mostly determined by inherited defects, like some familial forms of colon cancer.

The more common colon cancers were near the middle of the range. Random mutation was important, but environment -- like the carcinogens in digestive waste -- seemed to hold a modest edge.

There are still ambiguities to resolve. The cellular dynamics of two of the most common cancers, breast and prostate, were not certain enough to be included in the analysis. But however they might tilt the lineup, random mutations will remain a dominant driver.

It is always possible that what we call randomness will turn out to be complexity in disguise. Some mutations attributed to chance may eventually be revealed to have subtle causes.

Over the years, however, the scale seems to be tipping the other way, with the discovery that some long-suspected agents like dietary fat and artificial sweeteners may not be so potent after all.

For all our agonizing, it can be liberating to accept and even embrace the powerful role chance plays in the biology of life and death. Random variation, after all, is the engine of evolution.

Because of spontaneous mutations in germ cells -- sperm and eggs -- each generation of our species is subtly different. Some of the variations confer an advantage and others a vulnerability. They are sifted by natural selection, and so we adapt and evolve.

In the ecosystem of the body, cancer cells go through a much faster version of this same process. The fittest of the bunch develop the weaponry to invade and destroy their surroundings, like a fractal reflection of what humans do in their own world.

The evolution of our brains, so compelled to find patterns, has given us an edge -- discovering cancers that can be avoided or, failing that, identified and excised before their deadly storm. But try as we might, we can never be in complete control of a condition so deeply rooted in the trade-offs of being alive.

Exposure Offers Clarity in the Risky World of Investing

Last week, a conversation with a friend reminded me how easily we can confuse actual risk with our own exposure to that risk. My friend travels a lot for work, and I asked him where he planned to go this year. His answer surprised me. “I don’t know,” he replied. “With everything going on in the world, I’m not sure I want to travel as much.”

Based on the headlines, it’s tempting to think the world is falling apart. Who wouldn’t think it’s safer to just stay home, go to work and deal with our everyday lives? But there’s a problem with this supposed logic, and I’m guilty of it, too.

I traveled to Australia twice last year. One of those times, I happened to eat in the chocolate cafe at the center of last month’s hostage crisis. When I heard the news, I started playing the “what if” game. Something similar happened when I heard about the attacks in Paris. I’d been in Paris last year, too … what if?

The issue both is that we assume a one-for-one possibility. For instance, we begin to think that because a handful of commercial airplanes[http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=2014&lang=&page=1] crashed around the world last year, air travel is suddenly riskier. But it’s not really. According to Flightglobal’s Annual Review for 2014[https://d1fmezig7cekam.cloudfront.net/VPP/Global/Flight/FG%20Club/In%20Focus/Environment/Safety%20Annual%20Review%202014-1.pdf], flying was still considered safe with “a global fatal accident rate of one per 2.38 million flights.” The review also noted that, “on this limited basis, 2014 was, narrowly, the safest year ever; the exact opposite to the claims by some media agencies that it would be ‘the worst year ever’ for air safety. The previous ‘best year’ was 2012, with a fatal accident rate of one per 2.37 million flights.”

By comparison, many people don’t think twice about getting into cars, even though the risk of becoming a traffic fatality is much greater at 10.8 deaths per 100,000 people[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/nchs/fastats/accidental-injury.htm]. Many of us ride in a car every day. As a result, our exposure to dying in a car accident is actually greater than our exposure to a plane crash if we fly only a handful of times during the year. But the headlines do a fantastic job of confusing the issue, so much so that it trickles into other areas of our lives, too.

For example, I’ve already lost track this year of the number of people who’ve asked me if events in Russia, the rest of Europe or China should impact their investing strategy. Should they get out of stocks completely? Should they sell just their international investments? Should they horde butter and guns?

Let’s be really clear about this. Living, let alone investing, is not a risk-free proposition. Simply existing means dealing with risk. After all, risk is what’s left over after we’ve thought of everything else. We know what risk looks like when it shows up, but it’s very difficult to define beforehand.

In investing, we have some measures that are helpful as reference points, like volatility. But they still leave a lot of room for improvement. Risk is in the category of things we have little or no control over, making risk something that’s rarely worth our time and attention.

Exposure, however, is much easier to define and offers clarity in a risky world. If a hypothetical event were indeed to happen, we could still come pretty close to knowing how it would impact us before the fact. It’s much easier to define, measure and control because it’s about us. It’s specific to our situation and helps us know what we can do.

As we deal with a world that feels more risky, I suggest making exposure our priority. While risk poses the question, “What could happen?” exposure asks, “What impact would it have on me?” We can’t always answer the first question, which creates stress and confusion. But we always have a pretty good idea how to answer the second.

It means we talk about asset allocation[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/asset-allocation/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in our portfolios instead of whether Russia will invade one of its neighbors. It means we weigh life insurance[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/life-and-disability-insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] options instead of worrying about whether we’ll catch Ebola. And it means we wear our seatbelts in the car, even on short trips to the store.

Risk will remain hard to define and measure, even as it continues to generate some of the biggest headlines. It’s one of the unknown unknowns of the world. By understanding and evaluating our exposure, however, we can gain valuable control over our lives in a seemingly out-of-control world.

Obama Puts Cuba Captive on Guest List for Speech

WASHINGTON -- Alan P. Gross, the American released last month after five years of captivity in Cuba, and Scott Kelly, an astronaut scheduled to leave soon for a year aboard the International Space Station, will be among President Obama's guests at this week's State of the Union address.

Other guests will include a wounded Afghanistan war veteran, a doctor fighting Ebola in Africa, the chief executive of CVS Health, a young immigrant allowed to stay in the country under an order by Mr. Obama, and several people who overcame difficult upbringings in places like Compton and the South Bronx.

The White House announced the guest list on Monday, a day before Mr. Obama is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress and a national television audience to lay out an agenda for his seventh year in office. Ever since Ronald Reagan, presidents have invited guests to sit in the first lady's box at the Capitol, with an eye to making symbolic points during their speeches.

Mr. Gross, who will be accompanied by his wife, Judy, was an American government contractor working in Cuba when he was arrested in 2009. He was later sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison for trying to deliver satellite telephone equipment. He was released last month as part of a deal between Mr. Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba that will also restore full diplomatic relations between the countries for the first time in more than half a century.

Mr. Kelly, an astronaut since 1996 who has spent a total of more than 180 days at the space station, will head back up in March, this time to stay for a year, the first American astronaut to do so. Scientists will compare his medical status over that year with that of his twin brother, Mark Kelly, another astronaut, who will remain on the ground. Mark Kelly has become a prominent gun control advocate since his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head in 2011 while a congresswoman.

Also in the box with Michelle Obama will be Dr. Pranav Shetty, the global emergency health coordinator for the International Medical Corps, who spent months fighting Ebola in Liberia. Nearby will be Larry J. Merlo, the CVS Health chief, whose stores eliminated tobacco sales last year.

The president will use his guests to highlight a push for better policing after last year's tumult in Ferguson, Mo., following a white police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man. Sitting with Mrs. Obama will be Capt. Phillip C. Tingirides of the Los Angeles Police Department, who leads a program that has helped Watts fight crime and promote better relations between officers and the community.

The Obamas will also highlight those working to overcome backgrounds of poverty and crime. One guest, Prophet Walker, who served a six-year sentence for robbery, helped found a program to help inmates get an education to avoid the revolving door of prison. Another guest, Anthony Mendez, who grew up in the South Bronx in a family that was homeless for a time and whose best friend was murdered, managed to finish high school and attend to college.

To make a point in a running battle with Republicans over immigration, Mr. Obama invited Ana Zamora, who was allowed to stay in the country under a 2012 program to end the risk of deportation for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally while they were children. The House this month voted to try to reverse that program as part of broader legislation aimed at undercutting an executive action signed by Mr. Obama to allow millions more immigrants to remain in the country.

The president also invited Jason Gibson, who lost both legs in Afghanistan and first met Mr. Obama in 2012 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Despite 21 operations and being unable to use prosthetics, Mr. Gibson took up surfing and skiing, completed marathons on a hand cycle and obtained a pilot's license, the White House said.

Following is President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per]’s State of the Union address[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/state_of_the_union_message_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], as prepared by the White House.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:

We are fifteen years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.

But tonight, we turn the page.

Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.

Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service.

America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:

The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.

At this moment – with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production – we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.

Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?

Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?

Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another – or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?

In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.

So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.

It begins with our economy.

Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way.

They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.

“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”

As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/student_loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction – and home for dinner every night.

“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”

We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.

America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.

We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.

We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/solar-energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.

We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before.

We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.

At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.

So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way. We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.

Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007. But here’s the thing – those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.

Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.

In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], Medicare[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and Medicaid[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet – tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.

That’s what middle-class economics is – the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success – we want everyone to contribute to our success.

So what does middle-class economics require in our time?

First – middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement – and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.

Here’s one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority – so this country provided universal childcare. In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It’s not a nice-to-have – it’s a must-have. It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America – by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.

Here’s another example. Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It’s the right thing to do.

Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It’s 2015. It’s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.

These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That’s not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage – these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that’s what all of us – Republicans and Democrats alike – were sent here to do.

Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.

America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.

By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.

That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college – to zero.

Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you’ve got to earn it – you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.

Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships – opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.

And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.

Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.

Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago – jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.

So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.

21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure – modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.

21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.

Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But ninety-five percent of the world’s cust
