Fears over health of Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary priest being treated for Ebola in Madrid, amid row over payment for his repatriation

The first victim of Ebola to be treated on European soil is "weakened" but has yet to develop bleeding associated with the virus as a row broke out over who will foot the bill for his repatriation and treatment.

Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary priest arrived in Madrid on Thursday morning after being repatriated by military jet from Monrovia, Liberia, and was transferred to a hospital specially set up to receive him.

Flown out with the priest, was Juliana Bohi, 65, an Equatorial Guinean nun with Spanish nationality who worked with him at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital where they cared for patients infected with Ebola.

Although she has tested negative for the virus she would be kept in specially equipped isolation rooms at the Carlos III hospital in Madrid along with the priest.

His condition was described as "stable" on Thursday evening although he was said to be "weakened and feverish". He has shown no sign of bleeding, a symptom associated with the late stages of the virus but the hospital said it would not be providing medical updates for the missionary, at his request.

The two missionaries belong to the San Juan de Dios hospital order, a Catholic humanitarian group that runs hospitals around the world, which on Friday said it was ready to assume all the costs associated with the repatriation and treatment of its two workers.

Jose Maria Viadero, the director of the order made a statement following debate about whether public funds should be used to pay for the costs at a time when Spain's health system was struggling under austerity cuts.

"Our organisation stands ready to assume the costs and responsibilities that need to be taken," he said, adding that he had yet to receive such a request from the Spanish government.

Critics argued that the priest could have been treated equally well in Liberia if a specialist team had been sent out there – and at a fraction of the cost.

Warning comes after US authorities warn disease will 'inevitably' spread beyond region and reach America; Greece says it is testing suspected case

The deadly Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation on Friday, as the death toll neared 1000 and authorities expressed fears the virus could spread worldwide.

Dr Margaret Chan, WHO director-general appealed for global help to combat the regional epidemic, which she said was “the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the nearly four-decade history of this disease”.

A coordinated response was essential to stop the international spread of the disease, the organisation said in a statement after a two-day emergency meeting.

“The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it,” Dr Chan said, noting that the countries affected - mostly deeply impoverished and with only basic healthcare infrastructures - could not cope with the virus on their own.

“I am declaring the current outbreak a public health emergency of international concern,” she announced, stressing the “serious and unusual nature of the outbreak”.

The WHO warning came after US health authorities admitted on Thursday that Ebola could well spread beyond West Africa and possibly to the United States.

“We are all connected and inevitably there will be travellers, American citizens and others who go from these three countries - or from Lagos if it doesn’t get it under control - and are here with symptoms,” Tom Frieden, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told a congressional committee. A spokesman later stressed that those with suspect symptoms might not necessarily have Ebola.

“We are all connected and inevitably there will be travellers, American citizens and others who go from these three countries - or from Lagos if it doesn’t get it under control - and are here with symptoms,” he said.

Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable haemorraging. There is no known cure, but yesterday, the scientists who discovered the virus in 1976 called for an experimental drug, ZMapp, being used on two infected Americans to also be made available for African victims.

The toll from the outbreak has now risen to 961 across Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, with more than 1700 confirmed cases. Nigeria has so far been the least affected, with two deaths and seven confirmed cases in Lagos - but the city’s status as a regional hub for international travel and business makes the prospect of a wider outbreak there a major concern.

Benin, to the west of Nigeria, was awaiting test results from two patients with Ebola-like symptoms. In Uganda, a suspected Ebola patient tested negative - but the case fuelled fears that the virus could spread to East Africa.

In Europe, Greece reported on Friday that a citizen who had recently travelled to Nigeria was being tested for Ebola at an Athens hospital. An earlier suspected case had turned out to be malaria, the country’s health ministry said.

The first confirmed Ebola patient to be treated in Europe - an elderly Spanish priest who was airlifted to a Madrid hospital after becoming infected during aid work in Liberia - was said by officials to be “weakened and feverish” but stable.

The European Commission insisted that the risk to the continent from the virus was “extremely low”, in part due to high standards of healthcare and prevention.

In Britain, the government pledged more funds to help affected countries. After a meeting of the Cobra emergencies committee, a Foreign Office spokesman said the danger to the UK was “very low”, but added that the situation would be closely monitored.

The WHO stopped short of calling for international travel restrictions, but urged exit screening in affected countries and increased precautions at airports.

States of emergency have been declared in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with soldiers guarding clinics and sealing off roads to the worst hit areas - a measure the WHO said was a necessary first step towards containing the outbreak.

But the WHO declaration on Friday drew some criticism from medical experts who questioned the efficacy of such an announcement.

“Statements won’t save lives,” said Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, which earlier warned that the disease was “out of control”.

“Lives are being lost because the response is too slow.”

Public Health England has sent British experts to Africa to offer advice and help contain the outbreak on the ground as an international health emergency is declared

British doctor confident he can stay safe while treating Ebola victims

British health experts have flown out to African countries at the heart of the Ebola crisis in an effort to help contain the growing crisis.

Public Health England revealed ten of their health workers will have been flown into hotspots for the disease by the end of August to support Government's in the region who are struggling to contain the disease.

They will offer advice on how to keep track of the number of people infected and methods to control the outbreak. While the experts will 'categorically' not be directly treating patients they will offer laboratory testing.

The help comes as the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak an international health emergency.

Duncan Selbie, the head of Public Heath England has also warned that Britain’s defence systems against Ebola need to be “watertight”.

Mr Selbie said that the UK is “unlikely to see many” cases of Ebola but said that the authorities need to be prepared so that they can “manage it promptly and appropriately”.

However he suggested British hospitals, airports and institutions must be ready to immediately “detect, diagnose and manage” the illness if anyone infected with the virus arrives in the UK.

Mr Selbie said: “Although it is not transmissible in the same way as flu because it is not airborne and we are unlikely to see many, if any, cases here, we nonetheless need to ensure our defence systems are watertight so that if someone does return to the UK with the infection, we can detect, diagnose and manage it promptly and appropriately."

He has told GPs to "remain vigilant for unexplained illness" in those who have visited the affected area, and actions to take in the event of a possible case.

He added: “Some of our experts have gone out to the region to support teams on the ground. I am very grateful to everyone for their tremendous work and especially those who have gone out to Africa.”

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: "Though it is possible a case could be identified in the UK in a person returning from an affected country, this is unlikely.

"Even if a case were identified, there is minimal risk of it spreading across the general population as UK hospitals are well prepared to handle infectious diseases. Ebola causes far more harm in countries with less developed healthcare facilities and public health capacity."

The WHO made the decision to declare a international health emergency after a two-day emergency session behind closed doors in Geneva. It means global travel restrictions may be put in place to halt its spread as the overall death toll nears 1,000.

The move comes as US health authorities admitted on Thursday that Ebola's spread beyond west Africa was "inevitable", and after medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned that the deadly virus was now "out of control" with more than 60 outbreak hotspots.

WHO director Dr Margaret Chan appealed for greater international aid for the countries worst hit by the outbreak.

"The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it," she said.

Residents of Guinea's capital Conakry criticise emergency services for their slow response to help a man who collapsed in the street and was left for nearly five hours because of fears he might be suffering from Ebola

Ebola outbreak explained in 60 seconds

A man lay helpless in the street for almost five hours without medical assistance in Guinea's capital Conakry[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/equatorialguinea/] while passers-by went about their daily routine due to fear of the Ebola virus[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] .

The Ebola virus - first detected in the West African country in March[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11018918/First-European-Ebola-patient-admitted-to-Madrid-hospital.html] - has led people to be wary of close contact with anyone who might have been infected.

But they were shocked that it took almost five hours to get medical assistance to the man who lay helpless in the street while passers-by went about their daily routine.

A local mechanic, Amidou Camara, saw the collapsed man when he arrived to open his garage on Wednesday morning.

"I called the police and when they came they said they were going to call the doctors but up till now nobody has come here," Mr Camara said.

The country is one of four West African nations gripped by the Ebola outbreak, the most serious since the disease first emerged in Africa nearly 40 years ago.

It has killed more than 932 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria since it first emerged in remote tropical forests.

Passers-by in Conakry said they were worried about the cause of the man's collapse, even though it was not clear if he was in fact suffering from Ebola.

"I don't know whether he was suffering from Ebola or not," said Amadou Barry, "so let them come and take him from here because we are afraid."

Eventually, four and a half hours after the man's collapse was first reported, two members of the Ebola group arrived at the scene saying they were there to conduct an investigation.

"There is a special group that will come in to seal off and protect the area, but all depends on the investigation result we are going to produce and submit to them. They will then send a team with a responsibility to come and pick the man," one of the officers who would not give his name.

While health officials say the virus is transmitted only through direct contact with bodily fluids, many sick patients have refused to go to isolation centres and have infected family members and other caregivers.

A British doctor who is volunteering with other medical professionals to help those affected by the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] virus in Sierra Leone[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/] has reassured families and colleagues that he is "safe" doing his job.

Oliver Johnson said: "I think it's all on our minds here that we're trying to be careful. But that said, I understand Ebola, I understand how its transmitted...we've got the equipment we need to stay safe...it's just about maintaining those very high standards for ourselves.

"Relatives back home and colleagues are worries for us but when were here on the ground I think we feel like we're able to do this safely - we have confidence in that and confidence in each other as a team.

"I think what we've seen a bit here is a perfect storm. We've got a very dangerous virus that's in a group of countries that are very interconnected - a lot of trade and transport between these three countries that are affected - on top of weaker systems where there aren't always supplies or the infrastructure of training."

But Mr Johnson added: "it's going to need a lot of input from the international community and some really strong national leadership, and we're starting to see both of those now in a very big way".

The World Health Organisation on Friday declared the Ebola outbreak ravaging parts of west Africa an international health emergency and appealed for global aid to help afflicted countries.

Nearly 1,000 people have died from the virus to date.

Ebola crisis: why is there bush meat in the UK?

The Ebola virus was probably spread by illegal bush meat - and there’s plenty smuggled into the UK

We don’t know why West Africa is currently suffering from the largest outbreak of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/], but humans were almost certainly first infected through contact with “bush meat”.

The virus, which causes internal and external bleeding and is often fatal, is spread through close contact with the sweat, blood and organs of infected animals.

Wild animals killed in the forest are an African delicacy known as bush meat, and many of these illegally-hunted creatures, including chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines, carry Ebola. Every year, 7,500 tonnes of bush meat is imported into Britain, according to wildlife charity the Born Free Foundation.

Food critic Charles Campion, who has investigated the sale of bush meat in London markets, says that African immigrants buy the black-market meats for a taste of home.

“Bush meat is nostalgia for Africans,” he says. “You dry and smoke the meat and smuggle it into Britain, where it becomes dinner. People I spoke to said you can eat other meats instead, just like you can make spaghetti bolognese using meat other than beef, but it’s just not quite right. When you make a bush meat dish, it tastes proper, they said.”

Monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees are considered a delicacy, known for their tender meat, while a large cane rat, known as the grasscutter, is cooked according to traditional recipes.

“It’s stew – you’ve got a boiling pot and put things in it. It doesn’t taste like chicken, that I can tell you,” says Campion.

But carrying bush meat into Britain is illegal for health and safety reasons and to protect animal welfare. There’s no oversight into cleanliness of the meat, and the methods of transportation are often unsafe.

The animals are usually poorly smoked, says Campion, and with a “dubious provenance”. The dried meats are transported to Britain in suitcases – “it’s not especially hygienic,” he says.

A 2010 investigation into bush meat in Europe found 270 tonnes[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/18/illegal-bushmeat-smuggled-europe] coming through Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport alone. Researchers discovered 11 different types of bush meat from African forests, including whole sheep and calves that were wrapped in plastic and kept in holdalls during flights.

Once the bush meat arrives in Britain, street markets and Africa restaurants are thought to stock the black market goods, keeping them hidden under the counter for familiar customers. Six butchers and food stores in Ridley Road Market, Dalston, were discovered selling illicit rat meat by a BBC investigation[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19622903] in 2010, and Campion says he knows of Hendon restaurants that sell bush meat.

“I was rather too white [to be served],” he says. “But I’d heard the negotiations before hand so I knew they were selling it.”

The meat can cost £20 per kg, and research from the Zoological Society of London found that a 4kg monkey can cost £85.

Will Travers, president of the wildlife charity the Born Free Foundation, says the UK government should do more to prevent bush meat from leaving Africa. Court cases should hand down higher penalties for those convicted of importing the illicit meat, he says, and the government should create a database record of all illegal wildlife imports.

Mr Travers says we need to work with the leaders of communities where bush meat is a traditional or prestigious food, and “explain the risks and encourage them to alert their respective communities to try and reduce demand.”

So no matter how curious you are, don’t accept any offerings of monkey meat. Chicken may be boring, but at least there’s no risk of Ebola.

WHO experts elevate the Ebola outbreak to a worldwide health emergency as the number of new cases continue to soar

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa an international public health emergency that requires an extraordinary response to stop it spreading.

Its experts announced the Ebola outbreak, the largest and longest in history, is worrying enough to merit being declared an international health emergency.

It declared similar emergencies for the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and for polio in May.

WHO chief, Dr Margaret Chan, said the announcement is "a clear call for international solidarity" but acknowledged that many countries would probably not have any Ebola cases.

Ebola outbreak: Bodies 'dumped in the street’ as Liberia faces panic over virus

As fears of the virus increase, chief medical officer and assistant health minister, says the outbreak has forced a number of hospitals and clinics to close because staff were scared to work in them

Liberian medical chiefs warned that their war-shattered health service was being overwhelmed by the Ebola outbreak[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/], as reports emerged of residents dumping bodies of suspected victims of the virus in the streets.

Tolbert Nyenswah, the deputy chief medical officer and assistant health minister, said the outbreak had forced a number of hospitals and clinics to close because staff were scared to work in them. He disclosed that some 67 health workers had become infected, and that many of the 6,000-strong work force were reluctant to return to their jobs.

He spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday in Liberia’s seafront capital, Monrovia, from where the government is mounting a desperate fight to stop the disease spreading.

On Wednesday night, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared a state of emergency across the country, and also despatched troops in full combat gear to block people travelling to Liberia’s capital from rural areas hit by Ebola.

In some parts of the country – devastated by civil war during the Nineties – locals had been dumping bodies of family members on the streets rather than taking them to hospitals or morgues, said Liberia’s information minister, Lewis Brown.

Health facilities are sometimes feared to be sources of the virus, while many are scared that if they identify a body as being that of a relation, they will be ostracised in their communities or forced to go into quarantine in government clinics. Such fears increase the risk of people incubating the virus without the authorities detecting it.

On Sunday, health workers turned up in Monrovia's Clara Town district to remove two bodies of possible victims of the Ebola virus, four days after they dropped dead there when nobody would take them to hospital.

Nema Red, a resident of Clara Town, said the two men who lay dead in the street for days had shown symptoms of Ebola such as bleeding and vomiting.

"They started seeking help from the community to take them to the hospital, but community members ran for their lives ... they both gave up and dropped dead on the ground in the streets."

Mr Brown confirmed the bodies had been collected but said they had only been there for a few hours.

Separately, the first European victim of the Ebola outbreak arrived in Spain on Thursday and was taken to a Madrid hospital.

Miguel Pajares, 75, was helping to treat Ebola patients at a Roman Catholic mission in Liberia when he tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

He was flown to Spain along with a colleague, Juliana Bohi, a nun from Equatorial Guinea with Spanish nationality. The priest’s condition was said to be stable with no signs of bleeding, while the Sister Juliana appeared to be well.

In Liberia, Mr Nyenswah said that the authorities were gradually getting the message across that Ebola was a threat, ending widespread myths such as that it was the work of witchcraft, could be cured by prayer, or was simply a ruse by the government to frighten people.

But he warned with 95 per cent of the country’s health infrastructure having been destroyed during the civil war of the Nineties, it was still “simply too weak” to cope with major challenges.

“We need support from the outside for an outbreak like this,” he said. “Ebola is a global public health problem that is crossing international borders and it is too much for poor health systems like ours that are devastated by conflict.”

Many Liberian health workers were scared to return to work, he said, because the early symptoms of Ebola were very similar to other illnesses, such as malaria and influenza, with which patients might turn up to clinics. As a result, they were wrongly demanding to be issued with full protective overalls and masks, when these were in fact only necessary – and practical – for staff working with full-blown Ebola patients in isolation wards.

“Some of the health workers are panicking and so it is difficult to get them back to work, and besides, we wouldn’t want to give every clinic full protective clothing, even if we had the resources to,” he said.

Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives and infected more than 1,700 people since breaking out in West Africa earlier this year, according to the World Health Organisation.

Sierra Leone and Liberia are worst affected but there have also been cases in Nigeria and Guinea.

In Sierra Leone, military forces also deployed yesterday as part of “Operation Octopus”, which officials said was aimed at preventing “the unauthorised movement of Ebola-infected persons”. Two towns in the east of the country, Kailahun and Kenema, were put in quarantine, a government spokesman said, as nightclubs and entertainment venues across the country were ordered shut.

West Africans battling to contain the spread of the virus would have to wait for months until a potentially life-saving experimental drug used on two Americans infected with the disease could even be made, officials said. There is little of the experimental drug ZMapp available now, and even if it could be made in large quantities, its safety and effectiveness have yet to be tested.

Officials in Nigeria say they have asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about access to the drug, but a CDC spokesman said “there are virtually no doses available”.

Britain announced on Thursday it would give a further £3 million in aid to shore up Sierra Leone’s beleaguered health system.

A woman has died after landing at Gatwick airport on a flight from Sierra Leone

A woman has died after landing at Gatwick airport on a flight from Sierra Leone, one of the countries at the centre of the deadly Ebola outbreak[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] .

The 72-year-old was understood to have been “vomiting and sweating” before she collapsed and was taken by ambulance to hospital.

She had been travelling on a Gambia Bird flight with 128 passengers on board from Sierra Leone, which has declared a state of emergency after more than 200 people have died in the country from the disease.

The plane, which landed at 8.15am on Saturday from Freetown in Sierra Leone after stopping in the Gambia, is quarantined, the Daily Mirror reported[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ebola-scare-gatwick-39-hours-3979485] .

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said a test for Ebola had come back negative.

Sierra Leone has the highest number of victims of the disease, which has killed more than 700 people across western Africa. Ebola has no vaccine and there is no cure.

A spokeswoman for East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed they were called to the airport at 8.27am on Saturday and took an “extremely unwell” adult woman to Surrey Hospital in Redhill.

The hospital declined to comment on the incident.

A spokeswoman for Gatwick airport confirmed that a woman in her 70s became unwell when the flight landed at Gatwick.

She said: “Given the origin of the flight, the hospital carried out tests for Ebola and other infectious diseases as a precaution. The tests came back negative."

The woman died of natural causes.

After she became unwell the plane was held on the tarmac and names of passengers recorded.

She added: " We did not allow any crew to board the flight until we had spoken to Public Health England who cleared the plane for its return journey."

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global public health at Public Health England, said: "Yesterday morning a passenger became unwell after disembarking a flight at Gatwick from The Gambia, and sadly died in hospital.

"There was no health risk to other passengers or crew, as the passenger did not have symptoms during the flight. It was considered very unlikely to be a case of Ebola but testing was done as a precaution, and was negative.

"The correct procedures were followed to confirm there was no reason to quarantine the airplane, the passengers or staff.

"PHE can confirm there was no public health risk around the sad death of this individual."

Miguel Pajares, 75, a Spanish missionary priest working at a hospital in the West African country, will be taken to Spain by a military jet

Spain has been preparing to accept Europe’s first confirmed case of the Ebola virus[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] .

A medically-equipped military jet has been sent to Liberia to repatriate Miguel Pajares, 75, a Spanish missionary priest working at a hospital in the West African country.

The priest was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.

Brother Pajares and his two fellow workers, Chantal Pascaline Mutwamene of Congo and Paciencia Melgar from Equatorial Guinea, belong to the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Catholic humanitarian group that runs hospitals around the world, and had been helping to treat patients infected with the virus.

They had been in quarantine since Saturday along with two others – who have since tested negative - following the death of the hospital’s director, Brother Patrick Nshamdze.

The priest was due to arrive back in Madrid in the early hours of this morning and would be immediately transferred to the capital’s Carlos III hospital where an isolation ward had been set up in preparation.

The priest, who has spent five decades working as a missionary in Liberia, will be treated by only two medical professionals in a bid to contain the risk of virus spreading.

“The safety protocols we will use guarantee minimum risk,” said Mercedes Vinuesa Sebastian, the director general of public health in Spain.

On hearing that he would be repatriated, the Spanish priest told Spain’s ABC newspaper by telephone: "This news has lifted my spirits, it is great. I am very happy. It is worth fighting on.”

It will be the first time a confirmed case of Ebola is to be treated on European soil.

The total death toll from the Ebola outbreak climbed to 932 in four West African countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which said another 45 patients had died between Aug 2-4.

The number of suspected, probable or confirmed cases rose by 108 over the same period to a total of 1,711 since the start of the outbreak earlier this year. Most of the newly reported deaths were in Liberia while the number of cases in Nigeria climbed from 4 to 9.

On Wednesday, a Nigerian nurse became the second confirmed victim to die of the virus in Lagos. She had treated the first victim who died in July.

Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia, officials confirmed a man who was being tested for the Ebola virus has died. The 40-year-old was hospitalised after showing symptoms of the viral hemorrhagic fever after returning from Sierra Leone on Sunday but it has not been confirmed as Ebola.

The second American aid worker infected with the virus arrived back in the US on Tuesday and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Her fellow medical missionary, Dr Kent Brantly, was admitted to the same facility on Sunday.

An experimental serum treatment on the US missionaries raised hopes of an effective treatment after doctors reported a “miraculous” improvement in the health of Dr Brantly.

Ebola can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone carrying the virus, but the incubation period can last up to three weeks.

There is no proven vaccine or treatment but WHO said it would convene a meeting of medical ethics experts early next week to consider the implications of making experimental treatments more widely available.

Doctors say the individuals are 'voluntarily' confined at home after returning from an Ebola infected country in West Africa

Several Britons are quarantined across the UK with suspected Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/], public health officials admitted on Tuesday.

The revelation comes as a Welsh national who fears they may have contracted the deadly Ebola virus while abroad has returned home and placed themselves in voluntary quarantine.

The potential victim is understood to be living in Cardiff and is being “closely monitored,” health officials said.

Doctors from Public Health Wales said the individual had been “voluntarily” confined at home for the past week after returning from an infected country in West Africa. They confirmed there were several similar cases throughout Britain.

Medical experts are in daily telephone contact with the person in case they start to show symptoms of the deadly disease.

The person visited West Africa where more than 1,600 people have been infected with the virus in recent months, resulting in 887 deaths.

Public Health Wales said the person is "currently staying away from work and limiting contact with other people voluntarily".

The official said there were "several cases" across the UK where people have placed themselves in quarantine after they believed they had come into contact with infected people in West Africa, although this was being done as a precaution and none had developed the symptoms.

Anna Humphries, of Public Health Wales, said: "There are other people in the UK, not in Wales, but we are aware of other people that have come back from affected countries and have been at risk because whatever they have done while they have been over there. They have been in a similar situation and they have been monitored for an incubation period to check they have not gone onto develop symptoms.

"There is a process for dealing with returning travellers and this is an example of that. Quarantine really depends on where exactly they have been."

The details of where the other individuals are quarantined has not been disclosed.

The news comes as British Airways cancelled its flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia, cutting off the only direct flights between Britain and the Ebola-infected area of west Africa.

The carrier, which operates a direct flight four times a week from London to Sierra Leone and onto Liberia, announced on Tuesday it was suspending flights "due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries".

It follows warnings at the weekend from the World Health Organisation the epidemic, which has killed nearly 900 people since February, was spreading faster than it could be controlled.

Health officials are believed to be particularly concerned about Liberia, where staff are understood have fled hospitals in some areas because of fears they themselves could become infected.

A statement from Public Health Wales insisted that the individual in quarantine does not have symptoms and "there are no cases of Ebola in Wales".

The statement added: "We are alert to the possibility of Ebola cases in the UK, given the outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have travelled from the area.

"Processes have been developed to protect public health in the event that we are notified of any individual who may have been exposed to Ebola."

A spokeswoman said people cannot be tested for the virus before the onset of symptoms. The person is not symptomatic so has not been tested and is being monitored by experts.

The individual has so far been under surveillance for a week and "seems well", she said.

Ebola is a severe acute viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. In its early stages its symptoms can often be confused with a cold or flu.

In Ebola cases, other symptoms emerge which include vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The maximum period the virus usually incubates before symptoms emerge is 21 days.

Ms Humphries added: "If somebody, say was a health care worker in that region said they had touched somebody that had the infection, you would want to make an assessment of that and say you could be at risk and it might be a good idea to not go to work if you are a doctor or regularly came into contact with someone.

"We and Public Health England have a procedure in place to ensure we manage the risk to the UK. Because it we did have people who come back and go unchecked and wander around and pass Ebola to other people, that's when problems start. It's really so we are aware of people who might be at risk and manage them appropriately."

She said the individual in Wales told doctors they “may have been exposed” to the deadly virus which has so far killed 826 people across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea.

She said: “We don't have a case of Ebola at the moment. We have an individual who has travelled in the West Africa region where the outbreak is.

“Upon returning to Wales a week ago, the individual realised they may have been in contact with people with Ebola, although the risk is minimal.

“The person is voluntarily staying at home and away from work for 21 days.”

She added that Public Health England is in daily contact to monitor the individual, who is currently showing no symptoms.

“As a result, there is no case – and no suspected case and 'no risk to the public' posed by the quarantined traveller,” she said.

“They don't have symptoms at the moment. This is someone who may have been exposed to Ebola and we are keeping an eye on them.

“The reason we haven't spoken about this before is the individual is not currently a case of Ebola."

Public Health Wales said good hygiene is the most effective way of stopping the virus spreading.

Fears that Ebola may reach Britain intensified on Sunday night after a passenger from a flight which stopped in Sierra Leone died at Gatwick airport.

The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country, but tests later revealed she did not have the disease.

The British hospital with the necessary expertise for treating the Ebola virus is the Royal Free Hospital in London and is where any infected person would eventually be taken in the event of an outbreak.

British Airways says the 'deteriorating public health situation' relating to the Ebola virus is why they have suspended flights until August 31

British Airways has cancelled flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia, cutting off the only direct links between Britain and the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] -infected area of west Africa.

The airline, which operates a direct flight four times a week from London to Sierra Leone and on to Liberia, suspended the flight “due to the deteriorating public health situation both countries”.

It follows warnings at the weekend from the World Health Organisation that the outbreak, which has killed nearly 900 people since February, was spreading faster than it could be controlled. Health officials are believed to be particularly concerned about Liberia, where staff are understood have fled hospitals in some areas because of fears that they themselves could become infected.

A statement from British Airways sent to travel companies said: “British Airways services from London Heathrow to Freetown and Monrovia will be temporarily suspended from tomorrow, 6 August until 31 August 2014, due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries.”

The BA move follows some other international airlines serving the two countries, as well as neighbouring Guinea, which is also affected, though others are still operating to all three.

It comes as health officials revealed that an American who died of Ebola in Nigeria last month is now believed to have infected at least eight other people with the disease.

Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian finance ministry employee with joint American and Liberian citizenship, died in the capital, Lagos, shortly after arriving by air.

Nigeria’s health commissioner, Jide Idris, said all of the eight suspected Ebola cases in Lagos involved people who had been in contact with Mr Sawyer. So far two were confirmed as having the disease, one of them a doctor who had looked after him.

Since Mr Saywer’s case emerged, health officials have tried to find and monitor anyone who came into contact with him, including fellow plane passengers at higher risk because of the enclosed environment.

Six others known to have made contact with Mr Sawyer have been put into quarantine but are not yet showing symptoms. It was not clear whether they had been in touch with Mr Sawyer before or after his plane journey.

A specially-equipped charter plane also transported Nancy Writebol, an Ebola-stricken American aid worker, to the disease hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where her colleague Dr Kent Brantly was already receiving treatment. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, but both US patients have received an experimental serum.

Bruce Johnson, president of the missionary group for which Ms Writebol works, said it was having less effect on her than on Mr Brantly because of her “more weakened condition”.

Ms Writebol arrived at the hospital in Atlanta shortly before 1pm and was wheeled into the hospital strapped onto a gurney and dressed in a protective suit. She did not walk, as Dr Brantly had when he arrived at the hospital last weekend.

Separately, doctors in New York were testing a patient with symptoms similar to those of Ebola - vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and sometimes bleeding - who had recently travelled to West Africa, but said it was not likely to be the disease. However, David Reich, a spokesman for the Mount Sinai Hospital, said: “Odds are this is not Ebola. It’s much more likely it’s a much more common condition.”

In Wales, health officials said an unnamed person believed to have come into contact with the virus in west Africa was in precautionary quarantine. Public Health Wales said: “The individual does not have symptoms of Ebola and there are no cases of Ebola in Wales.”

The World Bank has pledged up to £120 million ($200 million) to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to help those nations contain the outbreak.

Ebola outbreak: We're heading towards a catastrophe, warns top medic

We are heading towards pending 'catastrophe' after 'woefully inadequate' response, warns head of the World Health Organisation

The health chief leading the fight against the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has warned it was spiralling out of control towards a “catastrophic” epidemic that could engulf the region.

Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation, said the response to the disease had been “woefully inadequate” and it was “moving faster than our efforts to control it”.

Her warnings - the starkest to date - were delivered to the leaders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as they held a crisis summit to discuss how to curb the crisis, which has now claimed at least 729 lives.

“If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socio-economic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries,” Dr Chan said, according to a transcript seen by the Reuters news agency of her remarks to the summit in the Guinean capital, Conakry.

“This meeting must mark a turning point in the outbreak response.”

Meanwhile, two Ebola-infected American aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol, were expected to arrive in the US for treatment in high-security intensive care wards.

Both are believed to be in “stable but grave” condition after contracting the disease in Liberia. It will be the first time an Ebola sufferer has been treated in the US.

Dr Chan’s comments came amid growing signs of panic in the affected nations, where the fight against the disease has been hampered by lack of public health education and a widespread belief that it is caused by witchcraft.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia, said there was now fear and panic across the country, adding: “There are dead bodies all over the place and they now know that it’s real. They know that it’s deadly and they are now beginning to respond.”

She said some Liberians were continuing to keep infected patients at home or take them to traditional healers, fearing wrongly that bringing them to the specialist treatment clinics would increase their chances of catching the disease.

On Wednesday, Sierra Leone ordered its security forces to take health officials on house-to-house searches to find anyone suspected of harbouring an Ebola sufferer, despite fears such a robust approach could alienate the public.

In a further sign of disagreement over how to respond to the outbreak, the leader of the Ebola task force in Guinea said moves by neighbouring Liberia to shut all schools to contain the disease could prove counter productive.

“When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse,” said Aboubacar Sidiki Diakita. “Currently, some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder.”

Nigerian officials also reported an outbreak of panic in the state of Anambra when it was discovered that a local man had died while visiting Liberia.

There was no immediate evidence that he had caught Ebola, but such was the anxiety that the authorities took the precaution of quarantining his body, which had been repatriated by his relatives over the weekend.

The mounting sense of unease came as Dubai’s Emirates airline became the first global carrier to announce it was suspending flights to the stricken area.

The United States, Germany and France also issued warnings against travel to the three African countries.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said it was launching a $100m (£60m) drive to recruit several hundred additional staff to combat the west African crisis.

Health experts say since it is the first outbreak of its kind in the region, local officials have no practical experience in how to combat it.

'It couldn’t be Ebola, could it?’

Dr Naomi Platt, 27, who has just returned from working in a hospital in Sierra Leone, on the fear now rife in rural communities with few resources

Am I the first person to be told that they have malaria and feel a sense of relief? Possibly. However, my diagnosis five weeks ago was given while I was working in a small rural hospital in Sierra Leone, where contact with the Ebola virus[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11007678/US-aid-worker-infected-by-Ebola-arrives-in-America-for-treatment.html] was a real possibility.

I’d had a fever, cold symptoms and was struggling to walk for more than a few minutes. Whatever was wrong with me, I attempted to reassure myself, it couldn’t be Ebola, one of the most virulent of viral diseases, for which there is no cure and a mortality rate of up to 90 per cent. The climate of worry and the feeling of vulnerability that affected me and my fellow health workers was far from unwarranted.

Figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO) show that the latest outbreak of the deadly virus in western Africa[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/11000309/The-deadliest-Ebola-outbreak-in-history.html] has infected more than 1,320 people and killed at least 729. Sierra Leone now has the highest number of confirmed cases, at 473, surpassing neighbouring Guinea, where the outbreak originated in February and where 336 cases have been confirmed.

My colleagues and I were working at the 100-bed Masanga hospital in the rural district of Tonkolili, which borders Kenema, the region where the Ebola virus is most prevalent.

In the week before I developed symptoms, we had tried to save the lives of three patients – two of them children – who had presented at the hospital with non-specific symptoms. They all died despite the fact that we provided treatment for the most likely causes of their illness. It was only afterwards that I realised none of us working in that hospital had been protected against the transmission of Ebola. It was a sobering moment.

I’m not sure what I had expected from my work experience at Masanga[http://masangahospital.org/], a hospital part-funded by a British, Danish, Dutch and Norwegian alliance. In January, I had taken a three-month diploma in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and had been due to follow it with three months of work in Sierra Leone in April. Early reports of an Ebola outbreak delayed the sabbatical by a month, while safety was assessed, but in May I went out with my fellow doctor-in-training, Aatish Patel.

I’ve travelled in Africa before, as my parents had lived in Zimbabwe, and I have carried out a short research project in Burkina Faso, so there was no great feeling of culture shock when I arrived in Sierra Leone. However, the facilities at the hospital – which is surrounded by jungle – were more basic than I had anticipated.

The infrastructure had been damaged during a civil war that ended in 2002. There was no running water and a generator provided power for two hours a day and during operations. There was no isolation unit and many common drugs were not available. If someone came in with a non-specific set of symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain or diarrhoea – which are also signs of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/11000015/Ebola-what-are-the-symptoms-of-deadly-disease.html] – we would treat them with antibiotics for sepsis or typhoid, antimalarials, paracetamol for fever, and fluids or oral rehydration salts for diarrhoea. We could send blood for testing to Kenema, Sierra Leone’s main treatment centre, but samples sometimes went astray, as happened with those from one of our suspected Ebola patients. Waiting for the results could mean delaying alternative, potentially life-saving treatments.

We mostly saw malaria, diarrhoea and non-specific fevers on our ward rounds, but in the back of our minds was Ebola. I always imagined I would recognise the disease the minute a patient arrived with it at the hospital. However, most sufferers at an early stage have the same symptoms as the majority of other patients; and only half of them experience telltale bleeding. With Ebola, there is also a long incubation period of up to 21 days, so if you see a patient with a fever that is unresponsive to standard treatment, you wonder: could this be it?

As rumours reached us that the disease was spreading towards our region, we began to feel very vulnerable. We’d talk about it at night, and senior doctors kept us updated with the latest information from the Sierra Leone government, but it was obvious that the hospital needed to prepare for infection control.

We asked for additional gowns, aprons and masks. I had visions of head-to-toe boiler suits, thick gloves and full-face masks, with not a glimpse of bare skin. The reality was thin gowns, latex gloves, hairnets and goggles like those worn in science lessons at school. Better equipment was being sent from Europe, but shipments invariably took weeks to arrive.

To control properly any infection, you need chlorinated running water; for the entire isolation unit and decontamination area that we rapidly set up, we had only nine buckets of it.

Perhaps our biggest problem, however, was the refusal of locals to believe in the existence of Ebola. I met some who simply dismissed the disease, and even learnt of one health officer who would not take precautions. Sadly, he contracted the disease in June and died.

We had a problem with the first patient to use our isolation unit. He and his family accepted that Ebola was real, but they could not grasp how easily it is transmitted. On the ward round one morning, he was found naked on a bed stripped clean of sheets. He had passed his clothes and bedding to his mother through a window, which she had then taken away to hand-wash in a communal laundry area. They thought they were doing the right thing for the hospital, but had he been found to be suffering from Ebola, he could have inadvertently spread the virus to his mother and the wider community.

The most upsetting cases I saw were when a 26-year-old woman and two children arrived within the space of 48 hours, with fevers and diarrhoea. We gave them what help we could, but soon after admission, they died without us knowing why.

After trying desperately to resuscitate one of the children, I realised I had done so without gloves. In the heat of a desperate moment, I had not protected myself against Ebola.

It was that weekend when I began to feel ill. I could tell my fellow workers were worried about me, but everyone was supportive. Malaria was the most likely explanation, but when the first course of anti-malarial drugs didn’t work, the chief medical officer moved me into his own house to take care of me. He later told me he’d been quite worried at that point. A second course of antimalarials did work, and lab tests confirmed that I had malaria rather than Ebola. There was relief all round. I flew home feeling completely well last month, as planned, while the Ebola epidemic has worsened.

Being in Sierra Leone has taught me that you can learn from these situations as long as you respect the diseases and don’t think you are invincible. Medical staff are at real risk – Dr Sheik Umar Khan, who died in Sierra Leone last week, was one of the local experts we consulted when we had a suspected case. Two American aid workers – one a doctor – are in a serious condition with Ebola, and are being transferred back to the US to be cared for in isolation units.

You can protect yourself, but you rely on everyone else to do that, too – that nurses disinfect themselves, auxiliary staff handle equipment properly, and lab staff correctly make the chlorine water vital for disinfection.

Masanga hospital has had to close to new patients, because of the crisis. Knowing the staff as I do, they will struggle to turn away anyone who requires treatment; however, there simply aren’t the facilities to cope. It will take a mammoth effort, co-ordinated on a global scale, to get this epidemic under control.

Ebola outbreak: end of epidemic could be in sight, says scientist

Prof Chris Witty of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says the epidemic has already peaked in Guinea and will hopefully begin to decline across other countries in the near future

The end of the Ebola epidemic may be in sight, with the disease already peaking in the county where the outbreak originated, the Department for International Development’s chief scientist has claimed.

Chris Witty, a DFID advisor and Professor of Public and International health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Guinea had already seen the worst of the outbreak and cases were now beginning to decrease.

Although the number of infections is continuing to rise in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Prof Witty said the situation was likely to peak soon and then the epidemic would begin to decline.

“The outbreak is very unusual,” he said in a podcast[https://soundcloud.com/dfid/ebola-in-west-africa-professor-chris-whitty-on-the-outbreak] .

“All previous outbreaks have tended to die out after a relatively short period of time and a much smaller number of cases. This is the largest outbreak of Ebola that so far has been recorded.

“The situation is moving very quickly. The numbers are increasing in Sierra Leone but they appear to have peaked in Guinea where the epidemic first started.

“What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it will start to decrease.”

The epidemic has, so far, claimed the lives of 826 people.

The UK has never had a case of Ebola but border staff are on alert to watch for signs of the disease at immigration points.

On Sunday night a woman in her 70s was tested for the virus after dying shortly after arriving at Gatwick Airport from West Africa. However the test came back negative.

Liberia and Sierra Leone have declared national emergencies with Liberia closing all schools and putting all non-essential government workers on compulsory 30 day leave.

Some airlines have stopped flying into infected West African countries, although British airlines said they would continue to travel.

Public Health England (PHE) warned health officials to be on the look-out for any unexplained illness in people returning from the affected countries.

The Royal Air Force is also on standby to bring back UK citizens infected with the disease in Africa.

Shipping bodies including the London based International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) issued new guidelines to merchant vessels yesterday.

Captains were told to give ‘careful consideration’ to allowing shore leave in ports affected by the disease.

Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks - in Nzara, Sudan; and in Yambuku, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines.

The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission.

Symptoms begin with fever, muscle pain and a sore throat, then rapidly escalate to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period can be up to 21 days.

Health workers tackling the outbreak in the region have been especially vulnerable to contracting the disease.

“The biggest problem with Ebola is the panic is causes, and it tends to lead to people worrying about travelling. It can lead to people worrying about going to work,” added Prof Witty.

“It’s not possible to catch Ebola just from sitting next to someone, You can only catch it by coming into contact directly with them or their body fluids like vomit or diarrhoea.

“The great majority of people who live in the affected areas will not get Ebola at any point.

“So it’s much less infectious than many people imagine and just being in the same room as someone with Ebola is not actually a particular risk.”

Ebola: new serum raises hopes for cure

As the Ebola death toll continues to climb in West Africa, the "miraculous" effect of an experimental serum on two US missionaries has raised hopes of an effective treatment

An experimental serum treatment on two US missionaries has raised hopes of an effective Ebola treatment after doctors reported a “miraculous” improvement in the health of one of those who contracted the haemorrhagic disease.

The development came as a leading British scientist claimed the end of the Ebola epidemic may be in sight, with the disease already peaking in the county where the outbreak originated.

Chris Witty, a DfID advisor and Professor of Public and International health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Guinea had already seen the worst of the outbreak and cases were now beginning to decrease.

Although the number of infections is continuing to rise in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Prof Witty said the situation was likely to peak soon and then the epidemic would begin to decline.

“The outbreak is very unusual,” he said in a podcast. “This is the largest outbreak of Ebola that so far has been recorded. The numbers are increasing in Sierra Leone but they appear to have peaked in Guinea where the epidemic first started.

“What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it will start to decrease.”

As the death toll from the epidemic in West Africa reached at least 887 by August 1, while the total number of cases in the four West African countries affected stood at 1,603 on the same date, the World Health Organisation said.

The body also confirmed that Nigeria was now dealing with four cases of Ebola, including a doctor who treated Patrick Sawyer, a US lawyer who died in Lagos last month after contracting the disease in Liberia, spreading panic in Africa’s biggest city.

Just three vials of the experimental serum known as “ZMapp”, which had only previously been tested on monkeys, were flown to Liberia for the treatment of two US missionaries.

Dr Kent Brantly, who has since been flown to an isolation unit in Atlanta, at first bravely insisted the serum be given to his older colleague, 59-year-old Nancy Writebol, but when his own condition deteriorated sharply he was given the first dose.

“Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly’s condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away. One of his doctors described the events as 'miraculous’,” reported CNN, citing sources with firsthand knowledge of the situation.

A medevac flight using a specially adapted private jet carrying Ms Writebol, who is in a “serious” condition, left Liberia last night and was due to arrive in Atlanta this morning.

“ZMapp”, which had been developed by a San Diego-based company, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, is a one a class of new drugs known as “monoclonal antibodies” that use uniquely manufactured proteins to prevent the Ebola virus from infecting new cells. They have also been used in the treatment of some cancers.

Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that the ZMab category of drugs had “a good record of safety” but would need further clinical trials.

“In this case (ZMAb), the antibodies have been shown in several animal models to be 'neutralising’, and thus they act by eliminating the virus, probably by stopping the virus infecting new cells,” he told The Telegraph.

“Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been available for another virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV), for some years and there is hope this approach may be applicable to other viral diseases, such as Dengue [Fever],” he added.

The performance of the drug could explain the sudden improvement in Dr Brantly’s condition that enabled him to take a shower on his own hours after it was administered, and then walk almost unaided into Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital, where he is now being treated.

Doctors in Atlanta said on Sunday that Dr Brantly, 33, who has two young children, was still “improving” but cautioned that it was too early to predict with certainty if he would survive.

Amber Brantly, who has been able to speak with her husband through the glass, said in a statement that he was in good spirits and had “thanked everyone for their prayers and asked for continued prayer for Nancy Writebol’s safe return and full recovery.”

Ms Writebol, a missionary also working for the North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse organisation, was said by her son Jeremy to be “still struggling” but also showing signs of “improvement” with the family optimistic she will recover.

The continuing threat of the Ebola outbreak cast a shadow over a flagship three-day US-Africa Summit that opened in Washington DC yesterday attended by nearly 50 African heads of state, although the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone were both forced to cancel.

The Summit was intended to present Africa as a new investment destination for US companies and break stereotypes about the Continent as a place of war and disease, a message that officials conceded has not been helped by Ebola occupying most of the headlines on Africa in recent weeks.

If Ebola was in the UK we'd cure it, says leading doctor

A leading British public health doctor says western drug companies have no reason to cure the deadly Ebola virus because it mostly affects "powerless minority groups"

The international community has failed to deal with the deadly Ebola virus because it mainly kills poor Africans, Britain’s top public health doctor has claimed.

Dr John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, compared the situation to the early years of the AIDS epidemic and attacked the “moral bankruptcy” of a system which gives drug companies no reason to invest in treatments for “powerless minority groups”.

Writing in the Independent on Sunday[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/theyd-find-a-cure-if-ebola-came-to-london-9644515.html], he said: “We must respond to this emergency as if it was in Kensington, Chelsea, and Westminster. And we must ‘get real’ over economic development.

“We must also tackle the scandal of the unwillingness of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in research to produce treatments and vaccines, something they refuse to do because the numbers involved are, in their terms, so small and don't justify the investment.

“This is the moral bankruptcy of capitalism acting in the absence of an ethical and social framework.”

He said the international community needed to be “shamed into real commitment” to address the “poverty and environmental squalor” in which epidemics can thrive.

On Friday officials from the World Health Organisation said the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was “moving faster than our efforts to control it” and would be “catastrophic” if it continued to get worse.

The disease, which has a fatality rate of 90 per cent without proper treatment and has no cure, has already claimed more than 700 lives across Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria in what is now the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.

As if to underline Dr Ashton’s words, two US aid workers infected in the region have been flown back for specialist treatment in the States[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/11009788/Ebola-outbreak-Second-US-missionary-with-the-virus-to-leave-Liberia.html], even as locals suffer from a lack of clean water and adequate health facilities.

But while his comments are perhaps the strongest intervention on the topic so far by a medical professional in the stalled Ebola market, they are by no means the first.

Last week Dr Daniel Bausch, an Ebola specialist at Tulane University in New Orleans, told the US website Vox[http://www.vox.com/2014/7/31/5952665/ebola-virus-vaccine-why-hasnt-it-happened] that there had been “significant developments” in fighting the disease but that “economics” stood in the way.

He said: “These outbreaks affect the poorest communities on the planet. Although they do create incredible upheaval, they are relatively rare events. So if you look at the interest of pharmaceutical companies, there is not huge enthusiasm.”

He added that research in the US was “almost exclusively” funded by the government and driven by fears that terrorists might use the disease against first world citizens.

A viral vaccine effective in macaque monkeys has existed since 2005, but money has not been available to test it on humans, according to Heinz Feldman[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/news/ebola-treatments-caught-in-limbo-1.15634] of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

In 2009, it was used on a German lab technician who had accidentally pricked herself with an Ebola-infected needle, but there is no way to tell whether the vaccine was what saved her, or even if she was infected in the first place.

Another project, using $140m from the Department of Defence, shows promise, but has only now reached human testing after a brief funding limbo in 2012. Scientists at the time lamented that a commercial vaccine was “unlikely”.

Inequality is not the only reason for a weak market in Ebola vaccines, as the disease only afflicts a relatively small number of people worldwide. The WHO lists only 1,590 known Ebola deaths since it was discovered, whereas measles killed 122,000 in 2012.

Serious outbreaks are comparatively rare, and its extreme fatality actually limits its ability to spread because its victims die before they can infect too many others.

Miguel Pajares, an elderly Spanish priest, could be treated with US experimental drug ZMapp being used on two infected American aid workers, but US says serum not yet proven effective

The first European victim of the West African Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11018918/First-European-Ebola-patient-admitted-to-Madrid-hospital.html] outbreak arrived in Spain on Thursday morning and was rushed to a Madrid hospital, officials said, as hopes rose that a US experimental vaccine could soon be available for wider treatment.

Miguel Pajares, 75, who was said to be in a stable condition, was helping to treat Ebola patients in the Liberian capital Monrovia when he tested positive for the deadly virus earlier this week.

He was swiftly flown to Spain in a medically equipped Airbus 310 along with a colleague, Juliana Bohi, a nun from Equatorial Guinea with Spanish nationality who is to be retested for the disease after a negative result in Liberia.

Their evacuation came as Liberia and Sierra Leone imposed states of emergency over the outbreak, which has killed almost 1000 people and spread fear through much of West Africa. In Liberia, the dead lay in the streets, many of those infected regarding Ebola treatment units as death traps. Sierra Leone sent troops to guard hospitals and clinics handling Ebola cases.

Spain said the arrival of an Ebola patient in the country presented minimal risk to public health. The pair landed amid high security at a military air base near the capital and were transferred into ambulances on stretchers enclosed in transparent tents, pushed by medical staff wearing protective suits. They were then taken to La Paz hospital accompanied by a police escort.

There they were being kept in isolation at the Carlos III centre, which has cleared out the entire six floor for the two patients. The priest, who has spent five decades working as a missionary in Liberia, will be treated by only two medical professionals in an effort to contain the virus.

No one could have foreseen that the solemn anniversary of the the First World War would coincide with so many new wars, says Gillian Reynolds

FOLLOW TELEGRAPH TV ON FACEBOOK [https://www.facebook.com/telegraphtvradio?]

Commemorations of the First World War have been years in the planning. No one could have foreseen when they began that this solemn anniversary would coincide with so many new wars. The Archbishop of Canterbury noted the grim paradox in his Radio 4 Thought for the Day on Monday morning, “We watch and feel for those suffering,” he said, “fear for those not born.” His final plea, to end war by making friends with our enemies, was heartfelt but, alas, unlikely to be widely translated into action.

Every news bulletin that morning was carrying headlines in a sequence that summed up the day’s jarring agenda: First World War commemoration; end of Commonwealth Games; temporary ceasefire in Gaza; latest on the outbreak of Ebola. Yet the schedules rolled on with programmes made in anticipation of an audience wanting to know more about what their forebears fought for in 1914.

Home Front (Radio 4, daily, at noon) is a serial that will stretch over the four years of the First World War, fiction but based on fact, a big enterprise, every one of its 600 episodes focused on a particular character, each of its five series based on a separate part of the UK. The first is Folkestone, transformed from seaside town to military embarkation port and, we will discover as the fighting begins, close enough to France to hear the gunfire.

On Monday we met Kitty Wilson (played by Ami Metcalf), young and outspoken, in service as a maid, in love with a nice young man. She is also pregnant. Her father, a railway signalman, doesn’t know that but knows the boyfriend, likes him. Or did until war loomed, for Dieter (Joe Sims) is German, a butcher, long resident in Folkestone, now torn between loyalties. Even if they get married, what’s to become of them?

Yesterday we met Councillor Gabriel Graham, throwing a lavish dinner party to send his son Freddie off to the front – carrying on as usual, he says proudly. “Are you German?” his wife asks the waiter. Swiss, he says. Funny how many Swiss are suddenly in Folkestone, she says. We will meet all these people again as the weeks roll by. There’s an omnibus edition on Friday nights.

That’s where the rub between fiction and fact will show. The omnibus, bringing together the week’s five little fictional lives of a hundred years ago, precedes The World Tonight, where the real world is soberly reported, bombs, shells, tears, accusations, bodies piling ever higher. It’s been disturbing enough to hear Radio 5 Live presenters break away from their excited commentary of the Commonwealth Games to bring urgent news flashes from Gaza. The disjunction between remembered and real wars is something I find unbearable. Here we are, commemorating the war supposed to end all wars while the new wars rage on, too many to count.

The embrace of fiction consequently allures. It doesn’t always satisfy. The Radio 4 Saturday Play (insistently promoted all week) was His Master’s Voice, a close-to-fact version of why Peter Brough, the real radio ventriloquist of the Fifties, locked away Archie Andrews, the doll that made him famous. Archie had become a threat, a perpetual watcher, speaker of truths Brough couldn’t voice. Rob Brydon played both Brough and Archie, trying hard to bestow a gleam of pathos onto the play’s wooden dialogue. Anyone who remembers the joyous malarkey of the real Educating Archie will have found it just sad.

The Diary of Samuel Pepys is back on Radio 4 all week, in Hattie Naylor’s perky dramatisation. Kris Marshall plays Sam, Katherine Jakeways is Elizabeth, his wife. We’re in 1669 now, the Great Fire long behind us, Sam still dabbling amorously (or thinking of it), Elizabeth, fretting, raging, flirting in revenge. Yet Sam always manages to coax her back into the marital bed. On Monday, though, she woke him up with red-hot tongs in her hand, threatening to render him sexless. On his promise never to hurt her again, they stayed up all night talking. That was in January. By March, when Sam has had his 36th birthday, Elizabeth is in a suspicious rage again. He denies misbehaviour, but imagines it, longingly. “And then, with all possible kindness, to bed.”

Eugenie Grandet (Radio 4, Sundays) has been most restorative, the power of Balzac’s novel beautifully captured in Rose Tremain’s dramatisation and fine performances from Ian McKellen as old Grandet, Alison Pettit as daughter Eugenie and wonderful Shirley Dixon as Nanon, the strong, wise, peasant, the only character to find unexpected happiness. Gordon House directed and, for once, this really was a Classic Serial.

Imagination is the Apple of investors' eyes as hype for gadgets grows

Market report

INVESTORS snapped up shares in Imagination Technologies on hopes that the microchip designer will receive a boost when Apple releases its highly anticipated new product range.

The tech group booked one of the biggest gains in the FTSE 250, jumping 8.9p, or 4.9pc, to 191.1p, on speculation that the launch of the iPhone 6 and iWatch, expected in coming months, will provide a fillip for Imagination's graphics royalties. Apple is Imagination's single biggest customer and accounts for 33pc of revenues, Liberum analyst Eoin Lambe told clients yesterday.

"Imagination's graphics and video intellectual property is included in all of Apple's mobile products," he said. "We believe Apple's forthcoming iPhone 6 and iWatch ... could be positive catalysts for Imagination."

Traders buy into the FTSE 250 company to gain exposure to the US giant, the analyst explained.

"In the past, Imagination's share price has generally performed well into Apple product launches as investors looked for ways to play Apple's growth."

Optimistic about Imagination's prospects, Mr Lambe upgraded his recommendation on the shares to "buy" and, as a result, the stock was the second biggest riser in a FTSE 250 that dipped 10.66 points to 15,351.91. The FTSE 100 managed to snap four straight sessions of falls to edge up 4.96 to 6,682.48. Weir led London's benchmark index higher, climbing 51p to £25.76 after RBC Capital Markets named shares in the maker of industrial pumps a "top pick". A touch of bid speculation also lent support to the stock.

Intertek, the product testing group that jumped 173p on six–month results a day earlier, rose a further 49p to £27.55, buoyed by upbeat analyst comments in the wake of its numbers. Well–received half–year earnings from Standard Life pushed the insurer 5.6p higher to 370p.

Annuities group Just Retirement put on 8.8p to 148.2p in the FTSE 250, adding to Monday's 2.3p rise. The gains marked a recovery from a period of share price weakness that saw the stock slide 5.4pc over the course of last week. One theory doing the rounds to explain that fall was that Espirito Santo Investment Bank, which helped float the company last year, had been selling shares in Just Retirement, putting pressure on what is a relatively illiquid stock.

Meggitt, a maker of aircraft components, slumped 23.8p to 479.7p – a 4.7pc decline that was the heaviest in the FTSE 100 – after cutting its revenue guidance for the year.

Holiday Inn–owner InterContinental Hotels, off 77p at £22.88, was marked lower on half–year figures that were not expected to result in significant market upgrades.

"Overall, we would be surprised if consensus changed in any meaningful way," Geof Collyer of Deutsche Bank told clients.

Staying with the fallers, analysts at Credit Suisse pushed Royal Mail down 15.2p to 405½p – the lowest level since its initial public offering – by repeating their "underperform" rating and slashing their price target to 360p, just 30p above the company's float price. The analysts think Royal Mail will miss its 2015 margin guidance, and forecast a 30 basis–point rise against Royal Mail's expectations for a 50 basis–point improvement. They put the miss down to a range of headwinds, including the "well–flagged competitive pressures" posed by rival TNT Post UK.

Housebuilders were broadly weaker following Monday's news that Lloyds was capping loans made under the Help to Buy scheme. Persimmon slid 27p to £12.19 and Barratt Developments was down 7.4p at 337½p.

Afren, the oil explorer that plunged last week when it suspended its chief executive and chief operating officer, remained unsettled by the shock development and tumbled a further 8.9p to 98.1p. Analysts at UBS didn't help by slashing their price target to 135p from 200p, although they kept their "buy" recommendation.

"Restoration of investor confidence will require a root and branch audit of Afren's historical transactions," they said. "Until this is complete we expect the market to continue to apply a high discount to the equity."

On Aim, Sierra Leone–focused iron ore producers London Mining, down 2¾p at 35p, and African Minerals (AMI), off 11p at 47p, were sold lower amid worries about the potential impact of the Ebola outbreak in the country. Should the Ebola virus disrupt AMI's operations, it may heighten concerns about the company's ability to continue to meet interest payments on its debt, analysts said. Those worries could explain why AMI fell far heavier than London Mining yesterday, they added.

Finally, big data group WANdisco jumped 10¾p to 442¾p on Aim after announcing it had secured a $10m credit facility with HSBC, news that alleviated concerns the company would tap the investors for funds via a share sale.

SEVERAL Britons across the country have been quarantined after potentially coming into contact with victims of Ebola, health officials admitted yesterday.

The disclosure was made as a Welsh national, who fears having possibly contracted the deadly virus while in West Africa, has returned home and placed themselves in "voluntary" quarantine.

The potential victim is understood to be living in Cardiff and is "currently staying away from work and limiting contact with other people".

The person is being "closely monitored," doctors from Public Health Wales said, in case they start to show symptoms of the disease.

Anna Humphries, of Public Health Wales, said: "We have an individual who has travelled in the West Africa region where the outbreak is.

"Upon returning to Wales a week ago, the individual realised they may have been in contact with people with Ebola, although the risk is minimal."

She also said there were "several" similar cases.

"There are other people in the UK, not in Wales, who have come back from affected countries and have been at risk because whatever they have done while they have been over there," she said.

"They have been in a similar situation and they have been monitored for an incubation period to check they have not gone on to develop symptoms.

"There is a process for dealing with returning travellers and this is an example of that. Quarantine really depends on where exactly they have been."

Flights cancelled

BRITISH Airways cancelled flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia yesterday, cutting off the only direct links between Britain and the Ebola–infected area of west Africa.

A statement from the airline which was sent to travel companies said: "British Airways services from London Heathrow to Freetown and Monrovia will be temporarily suspended until August 31 2014, due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries."

The BA move follows cancellations by several other international airlines serving the two countries, as well as neighbouring Guinea, which is also affected, but some companies are still flying to all three.

In the Club, BBC One, review: 'melodramatic'

BBC One's new drama about an ante-natal group may need time to gestate, says Vicki Power

The first episode of In the Club was in many ways a typical Kay Mellor drama[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/10992650/Antenatal-classes-mother-of-all-marvels-or-sheer-misery.html], only on steroids. Mellor is the creator of numerous warm, populist ensemble dramas centring on gutsy Yorkshirewomen – prostitutes in Band of Gold, female footballers in Playing the Field, slimmers in Fat Friends – all grappling with life’s dilemmas. Pregnancy is the link in Mellor’s latest series, but she crammed so much drama into last night’s opener it’s hard to imagine where she’s left herself to go, short of an Ebola outbreak in Leeds.

We were introduced to six females linked by an antenatal class who all had major life stuff going on – a forty-something pregnant by her toyboy, a lesbian in love with her sperm donor, a gymslip mum who gave birth just as her father was (killed, presumably) in a lorry crash. A fourth woman discovered she was having miracle twins just as her secretly unemployed husband impulsively robbed a bank because he couldn’t afford to pay for the pizza their other kids were eating in the café next door. It was like half a year of Coronation Street[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/10587389/Coronation-Streets-10-biggest-storylines.html] crammed into an hour. All a bit extreme – a Mellor-drama, if you will.

Despite that, the main storyline of bank-robbing dad Rick (Will Mellor, no relation) was very affecting. Watching Rick beg a foreman for a job as a labourer’s apprentice was reminiscent of Yosser from Boys from the Black Stuff, and we felt for him as his desperation grew and he embarked on that pathetic bank hold-up, pretending his key fob was a bomb. Let’s hope Kay Mellor has plans for Rick other than shipping him off to the nick; he was the best character in it and Will Mellor pitched his anguish just right.

Also well done was the tale of secretly pregnant teen Rosie (nicely underplayed by young Hannah Midgley). Alone in a bleak highrise while her dad worked nights, Rosie prepared for birth by watching episodes of One Born Every Minute, clutching her dead mother’s dressing gown. The story had an edge of Jimmy McGovern’s grit to it.

At first glance, the pregnant characters feel tokenistic – posh gal, traditional Asian, working-class housewife, lesbian – whose close friendship would seem implausible in any other context. But parents will know that antenatal class is where such unlikely bonds can be forged over the shared experience of impending parenthood.

So despite a crammed and uneven first episode, In the Club has drawn us in. Mellor has a track record of writing strong roles for women, and once the series takes a deep, relaxing breath, we expect the female characters to be fleshed out as fully as their waistlines. The drama just needs a bit of time to, well, gestate.

Hope for Ebola miracle as serum 'reverses' disease

AN EXPERIMENTAL serum treatment on two US missionaries has raised hopes of an effective treatment for Ebola after doctors reported a "miraculous" improvement in the health of one of those who contracted the disease.

The development came as a leading British scientist claimed the end of the Ebola epidemic may be in sight, with the disease already peaking in the county where the outbreak originated.

Chris Witty, an adviser to the Department for International Development and a professor of public and international health, said Guinea had already seen the worst of the outbreak and cases were now beginning to decrease.

Although the number of infections is continuing to rise in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Prof Witty said the situation was likely to peak soon and then the epidemic would begin to decline.

"The outbreak is very unusual," he said in a podcast. "This is the largest outbreak of Ebola that so far has been recorded. The numbers are increasing in Sierra Leone but they appear to have peaked in Guinea where the epidemic first started.

"What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it will start to decrease." As the death toll from the epidemic in west Africa reached at least 887 by Aug 1, the total number of cases in the four west African countries affected stood at 1,603 on the same date, the World Health Organisation said.

The body also confirmed that Nigeria was now dealing with four cases of Ebola, including a doctor who treated Patrick Sawyer, a US lawyer who died in Lagos last month after contracting the disease in Liberia, spreading panic in Africa's biggest city. Just three vials of the experimental serum known as "ZMapp", which had only previously been tested on monkeys, were flown to Liberia for the treatment of two US missionaries.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, who has since been flown to an isolation unit in Atlanta, at first insisted that the serum be given to his older colleague, Nancy Writebol, 59, but when his own condition deteriorated sharply he was given the first dose.

"Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away. One of his doctors described the events as 'miraculous'," reported CNN, citing sources with first–hand knowledge of the situation.

A flight carrying Ms Writebol, who is in a "serious" condition, left Liberia last night headed for Atlanta.

"ZMapp", which had been developed by a San Diego–based company, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, is a one of a class of new drugs known as "monoclonal antibodies" that use proteins to prevent the Ebola virus from infecting new cells.

The threat of the Ebola outbreak cast a shadow over a US–Africa Summit that opened in Washington DC yesterday attended by nearly 50 African heads of state, although the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone were forced to cancel.

The summit was meant to present Africa as an investment destination and break stereotypes about the continent as a place of war and disease.

THE doctor in charge of preventing the spread of Ebola to the United States has defended the decision to bring a US aid worker who fell ill with the virus back to America for treatment.

Dr Thomas Frieden insisted that his team would be able to prevent an American outbreak, and that looking after the doctor who caught Ebola in Liberia was an "acceptable risk".

He was speaking as many Americans voiced concern over the decision to transport Dr Kent Brantly to a specially–adapted hospital in Georgia – the first time anyone carrying the Ebola virus has entered the Americas.

The hospital in Georgia is next to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which Dr Frieden heads. Appearing on television, Dr Frieden sought to calm rising panic about the potential for Ebola to spread across America. He told ABC's This Week: "The plain truth is, we can stop Ebola. We know how to control it. The single most important thing we can do to protect Americans is to stop this disease at the source in Africa."

Dr Frieden said he was sending 50 doctors and nurses to west Africa to help tackle the disease over the next month. More than 800 people have died during the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

On Saturday, Dr Brantly, 33, was brought back to the US on a speciallyadapted plane. The plane was returning to Liberia to collect a second infected American. Nancy Writebol, who like Dr Brantly was working for a missionary organisation, fell ill while at a unit treating Ebola victims.

Ebola victims must be cremated, Liberian government says

Growing alarm in Monrovia at rapid spread of the disease

Ebola victims in Liberia should be cremated, the government has said, in a move to stop the infection spreading from highly-contagious corpses.

The ruling was made after bodies of victims were left to lie in the streets for four days, with terrified residents refusing to remove them. One proposed burial site was surrounded by angry villagers, who refused to let the grave diggers enter; another potential site was ruled out when the landowner refused to sell the land.

Lewis Brown, the information minister, made the announcement of cremations after an emergency meeting on Sunday.

“From now on, victims will be cremated,” he said.

The ruling came as the death toll from the virus in Liberia rose to 227 people, and at least 826 people in the region, according to the World Health Organization.

Two American doctors who contracted the disease were being cared for by US medical experts. Dr Kent Brantly was flown to Atlanta on Saturday, and Dr Nancy Writebol was expected to leave the country on Tuesday.

But in the capital, Monrovia, there was growing alarm at the rapid spread of the disease.

Liberian Christians pray for God's divine intervention in the eradication of Ebola out of Liberia at the Providence Baptist Church in Monrovia.

Strong resistance from workers too afraid to handle infected corpses, or communities opposed to burying them nearby, has slowed down stretched West African governments as they seek to control the worst Ebola outbreak in history.

Monrovia’s overcrowded and understaffed Elwa Hospital has had to turn away Ebola cases this week.

In the densely-populated Monrovia district of Clara Town – which was already known for its poor sanitary facilities – two Ebola victims were left to lie on the street for four days, in 28-degree heat, when no one would dare to take them to hospital.

Nema Red, a resident of Clara Town, told Reuters that the two men who lay dead in the street for days had shown symptoms of Ebola such as bleeding and vomiting.

“They started seeking help from the community to take them to the hospital, but community members ran for their lives,” she said. “They both gave up and dropped dead on the ground in the streets of Clara Town.”

Mr Brown confirmed the bodies had been collected – but said they had only been there for a few hours.

“They have been removed,” he said, adding their houses would be fumigated and relatives placed under surveillance.

In another incident, the health ministry ordered 100 graves to be dug for victims of the deadly tropical virus, but only five shallow holes, partly filled with water, had been prepared by Saturday evening.

An angry crowd gathered at the site, shouting at health workers dressed in white protective suits who sought to appease them by handing out Ebola information fliers.

“You will have to kill us first,” shouted one group.

Soldiers from the Liberian army with shields and bulletproof vests arrived on the scene shortly afterwards. A source in the health ministry said the bodies were finally buried overnight with the help of around 40 additional workers.

And Monrovia’s first burial site for 30 bodies, in the poor township of Johnsonville, was abandoned by health workers after the land owner refused to sell the land to bury Ebola victims.

A few of the corpses were left floating in body bags in pools of water, which led to complaints from the residents.

A local man, Bill Marshall, said residents had not been consulted before the cemetery was created. “Ebola, we don’t know where it came from and we don’t know its effect,” he said. “The grave will give us Ebola, it will kill us.”

Mr Brown admitted: “The Johnsonville burial did not go that well.”

The World Health Organisationprovides strict guidelines for burial procedures [http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/resources/publications/ebola/whoemcesr982sec7-9.pdf], which run contrary to the West African tradition of bathing and preparing the bodies of the deceased.

They recommend that, wearing two pairs of thick protective gloves, the body and surrounding area should be sprayed with a 1:10 concentrated bleach solution. The body should be placed in a sealed sack, which should then be sprayed in the same solution.

It should be taken swiftly for burial, via the shortest possible route, and buried in a grave at least two metres deep.

“Be aware of the family’s cultural practices and religious beliefs,” the WHO recommends.

“Help the family understand why some practices cannot be done because they place the family or others at risk for exposure.

“Counsel the family about why special steps need to be taken to protect the family and community from illness. If the body is prepared without giving information and support to the family and the community, they may not want to bring other family members to the health facility in the future. They may think that if the patient dies, the body will not be returned to them.”

And the WHO recommends that staff “identify a family member who has influence with the rest of the family and who can make sure family members avoid dangerous practices such as washing or touching the body.”

The 72–year–old was understood to have been "vomiting and sweating" before she collapsed and was taken to hospital.

The Department of Health said tests showed she did not have the disease.

She had been travelling on a Gambia Bird flight with 128 passengers from Sierra Leone, which has declared a state of emergency after more than 200 people have died from the disease.

The plane is quarantined, the Daily Mirror reported.

American doctor being treated in the US for the Ebola virus able to speak with wife through glass window in hospital

An American doctor flown from Africa to the United States for treatment for the Ebola virus was well enough to speak briefly to his wife.

Dr Kent Bradley arrived back in America on Saturday and is now being treated in isolation in a special hospital in Atlanta having contracted the deadly disease while treating victims in Liberia.

He is thought to be in a better condition that first feared, and was able to walk into the hospital unaided.

His wife, Amber, was permitted to view him for 45 minutes through a glass window.

She said in a statement to CNN: "I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the US. I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital."

A family representative said Dr Brandley was "in great spirits and so grateful."

Dr Bradley, 33, was flown by a specially-adapted private jet from Liberia to Dobbins Reserve Base before being escorted by staff in sanitation suits to Emory University Hospital, which is attached to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The plane has room for only one patient at a time, and will now return to Liberia to repatriate a second American, fellow missionary Nancy Writebol, who came down with the highly-contagious disease after working at the same hospital. She was responsible for disinfecting doctors and nurses treating victims, and is also expected to be treated at Emory.

A third American to have come in contact with the disease in Liberia, retired doctor Alan Jamison, 69, has voluntarily quarantined himself at his home in Tennessee.

He has not developed symptoms since returning to the US, but as Ebola has an incubation period of some weeks he said he thought it best not to mingle with the public until he knew for sure that he did not have the disease.

Head of America's main disease control organisation says fears over decision to treat Dr Kent Brantly are unjustified

The doctor in charge of preventing the spread of Ebola to the United States has defended the decision to bring a US aid worker who fell ill with the virus back to America for treatment.

Dr Thomas Friedan insisted that his team had the power to prevent an American outbreak, and that looking after a doctor who caught Ebola in Liberia was an "acceptable risk".

He was speaking as many Americans voiced disquiet about the decision to transport Dr Kent Brantley to a specially-adapted hospital in Georgia, the first time anyone carrying the Ebola virus has entered the Americas. The hospital in Georgia is next door to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which Dr Friedan heads.

Taking part in a round of interviews for the Sunday morning US political shows, Dr Friedan sought to calm the rising panic about the potential for Ebola to spread across America.

He told ABC's This Week: "Ebola's scary, and it's understandable that with a deadly disease, people are concerned. The plain truth is, we can stop Ebola. We know how to control it.

"We're not going to hermetically seal the borders of the US. We're reliant and interdependent with the world for travel, for trade, for the economy, for our families and communities. The single most important thing we can do to protect Americans is to stop this disease at the source in Africa."

Dr Friedan said he was sending 50 doctors and nurses to West Africa to help tackle the disease over the next month. More than 800 people have died during the Ebola outbreak, most in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation.

On Saturday, Dr Brantly was brought back to the US on a specially-adapted plane. He was able to walk unaided while wearing an isolation suit into Emory Hospital in Atlanta, where his wife, Amber, spoke to him through a glass window for around 45 minutes.

The private plane, which can carry only one patient at a time, is now returning to Liberia to collect a second infected American.

Nancy Writebol, from South Carolina, who like Dr Brantly was working for a missionary organisation, fell ill with the disease while working at a unit disinfecting doctors and nurses treating Ebola victims.

Asked if Dr Brantly's return was an acceptable risk to the US, Dr Friedan said: "He's an American citizen, and what our role is in public health is to make sure that if an American is coming home with an infectious disease we protect so it doesn't spread. That was what we did in transit and at the hospital."

The 33-year-old Texan's condition was reported to have improved. In a statement, his wife said: "I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the US. I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital."

A family representative said that Dr Brantly was "in great spirits and so grateful."

What's hot or not this week?

Sunday's here, the weekend is nearly over, but don't feel blue - there's a new week ahead and here's a break down of what to - and not to - do ...

What's in...

Do

If you're a carnivore, in the country (there seems to be a new trend of people taking the whole of August off), a commuter, or just visiting the capital this week, then head to new restaurant Forge[http://www.forgedinlondon.com/?gclid=CKWY5IzR9L8CFSvpwgodj30Amg] . Situated in the heart of the city - which is so beautiful at this time of year, the sun illuminating its architecture - Forge has an extensive menu brimming with delicious dishes. To start try the Pig & Fig Terrine and for the main, if you're feeling decadent, test out the Tomahawk steak for two.

Watch

For some light-hearted fun and an excuse to stare at the beautiful Channing Tatum for 120 minutes, head to your local cinema and watch 22 Jump Street. The sequel to 21 Jump Street, the new film is an easy and entertaining watch. Oh, and it has Channing Tatum in it - did I mention that?

Dress

'What are you doing showing me a rug? It's summer!' I hear you cry. True, but this week is your chance to get ahead of the fashion game. Plus, we all know how temperamental the weather can be in old Blighty. The rug coat, poncho and blanket wrap, are set to be all the rage come Autumn. Get an early deal and be the first of your friends to bank one ready for September, which - sorry to be the bearer of bad news - is less than a month away.

Eat

When you have time, breakfast can be the best meal of the day. But one rarely does. Bacon and eggs, pancakes, home-made blueberry muffins, yes they're delicious, but they're also time-consuming. Once that alarm gets snoozed a few times, even getting your bread toasted can be an ask. Before you know it, you're grabbing an almond croissant and a coffee and then back at the cursed desk. A few pounds heavier. It doesn't have to be the case! Welcome Cuckoo Bircher Museli[http://www.cuckoofoods.co.uk/] - a healthy breakfast pot on the go. Scrummy and gentle on the waist-band.

Drink

This week, start to dabble in punches. Not fisty-cuffs, no, the summery drink. August is the time for slowing down. The excitement of July, when the temperature really gets going, makes it zip on by. In a bid to slow down the pace, to cling onto summer for as long as possible, punch is the perfect answer. A long drink, filled with the fruitiness of the season, punch will see you slowly through August. So this week, get perfecting your recipe! Or use this one[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/10363619/Reggae-rum-punch-recipe.html] .

What's out...

Don’t

This app has been floating around Facebook quite a lot over the past month. Yes, I can see the appeal. There is nothing like a good trip down memory lane, as they say. But that should be when you decide. The danger of having an app constantly reminding you what you were doing this time last year, the year before, the year before that, is that you may have gone down in the world. You may have been more successful last year, you may have had a better job, you may have been in a relationship (and they dumped you soon after the picture was taken). With good memories, also come bad. And you don't need an app siphoning through and reminding you of the latter.

Watch

Sharks raining from the sky - for a second time. If the original Sharknado wasn't ridiculous enough, its sequel certainly is. Starring Ian Ziering and Tara Reid, the science fiction thriller, which sees Great Whites hail down on New York, does not thrill. Best to be avoided.

Dress

These choker tattoo necklaces may have only just come in, but they need to be shipped off pronto. So this week, if your daughter, son, sister, brother or, god forbid, parent, buys one - throw it straight in the bin. The throaty monstrosities are horrifically unattractive. They cut the neck off making even the most dainty ones look thick. Just get rid.

Eat

The majority of you wouldn't, but to the minority who are tempted - do not eat bush meat. Not only is eating wild animals illegal but the trade could spread Ebola. As Telegraph journalist Olivia Goldhill writes [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/11006343/Ebola-crisis-why-is-there-bush-meat-in-the-UK.html] "The [Ebola] virus, which causes internal and external bleeding and is often fatal, is spread through close contact with the sweat, blood and organs of infected animals."

Drink

Don't drink excess alcohol (get intoxicated) abroad, especially in Germany. Britain's reputation is in tatters thanks to the loutish behaviour of some of our citizens. German newspaper Bild wrote a whole article on our incapability to handle booze and it's embarrassing. Drink, get tipsy, nigh verge on drunk, but don't get hammered. It's unattractive.

Two swear words slipped on to the airwaves without warning in the BBC station's 'tea-time' slot last week

Is it no longer safe to have Radio 4 on “in the background” at home?

Since the start of the summer holidays, young ears may have heard a panellist on the Friday night News Quiz use the phrase “p----d off”, while last week’s episode of I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10914419/Im-Sorry-I-Havent-a-Clue-smuttiest-jokes.html]contained the word “a---”. Neither swear word was bleeped out, nor were warnings given before either programme, which are broadcast in 'tea‑time’ slots.

Teams on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue were asked to suggest “film titles likely to prove popular with an audience of dog-lovers”, to which Barry Cryer replied: “Hawaii Fi-Do”, “The Postman Always Tastes Nice” – and “A---lick and Old Lace”.

Cryer, 79, has made regular appearances on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue since it first aired in 1972, serving briefly as its chairman before becoming a panellist.

It is not the first time this year that “the antidote to panel games” has courted controversy. In January, a row about sexualised puns – which seasoned listeners know as a staple feature of the show[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10914357/Im-Sorry-I-Havent-a-Clue-Too-smutty-for-Radio-4.html] – prompted Cryer’s colleague, Tim Brooke-Taylor, to reveal that the cast had discussed resigning if they were approached to tone down the jokes[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10914419/Im-Sorry-I-Havent-a-Clue-smuttiest-jokes.html] . “Fortunately,” said Brooke-Taylor, “the BBC saw sense.”

Unlike television, radio does not apply a 9pm watershed, although “protecting children from harmful material” is one of broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s most important duties.

Last year, Radio 4 broadcast a late-night documentary about the F‑word, which was presented by Stephen Fry, as well as Tony Harrison’s notorious long poem, V, about social divisions – which features 25 instances of the F-word, the C-word 17 times, and racial epithets.

A radio adaptation of W P Blatty’s horror novel The Exorcist, broadcast in February, included the C-word. However, in each of these cases, listeners were warned that the programmes were not suitable for children.

Barbara Hepworth’s giant missing piece

When the Barbara Hepworth retrospective, which was announced last week, opens at Tate Britain in 2015, it will be the Cornish sculptor’s first major exhibition in half a century. However, it won’t include her most popular piece, Winged Figure. It couldn’t: it is installed permanently on the side of John Lewis’s Oxford Street store.

In 1961, the Yorkshire-born artist, pictured, was commissioned to create an abstract public installation that would evoke “a sense of freedom” to adorn the flagship store’s exterior east wall. It is estimated that the 19ft aluminium work is seen by some 200 million people a year.

At the 1963 unveiling, Hepworth commented: “If it gives people a sense of being airborne in rain and sunlight and nightlight, I will be very happy.”

The Sunday Telegraph art critic at the time, Edwin Mullins, who watched as Winged Figure was hoisted into place, said John Lewis deserved “the warmest praise” for offering something to “gladden the eye of the passer-by”.

He added: “The austere, unrelieved plainness of most modern architecture tends to make any work of art look like a self-conscious Unesco project.”

Who wears the trousers on the Great British Bake Off?

What is it about The Great British Bake Off [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/great-british-bake-off/] that causes such a frenzy on social media?

During the last series, the finalist Ruby Tandoh was routinely trolled on Twitter, described as “annoying”, “a whiny, pouty cow”, and worse.

This kind of vicious online misogyny is “a problem for almost any woman who goes on TV”, according to the BBC’s head of documentaries commissioning, Emma Willis.

However, the show – which begins a new series on Wednesday – has scored one small triumph for women. “There are three women, on the telly, all wearing trousers,” says Willis of presenters Mary Berry, Mel and Sue. “I defy you to find another show where all the women wear trousers.”

To think feminism, thanks to a baking show, is rising again…

Baby number three makes a hat-trick for Jeremy Hunt

Congratulations to Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, who has just become a father for the third time. His daughter Eleanor was born late last month at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

Lucia, Mr Hunt’s Chinese-born wife, and Eleanor are understood to be doing well. The minister is now on paternity leave, having reassured government colleagues that NHS medical staff are ready to “deal with anything” in the event of an Ebola emergency.

The birth completes something of a hat‑trick for Mr Hunt, because all three of his children – Eleanor, Jack and Anna – have been born since the Coalition was formed in 2010.

THE BRITISH PUBLIC is "deeply disturbed" by the suffering of the people of Gaza, Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, has said.

His comments are the Government's strongest condemnation so far of the crisis in the Middle East.

In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hammond said he had received thousands of emails, from a "broad swathe" of people, expressing horror at the impact of Israel's bombardment on Gaza's civilian population.

The Government agreed that the situation in Gaza had become "simply intolerable", he said.

Mr Hammond also raised concerns that Israel's military action, launched in response to Hamas rocket fire, would lead to an increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Britain.

Calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the Foreign Secretary said: "The British public has a strong sense that the situation of the civilian population in Gaza is intolerable and must be addressed — and we agree with them."

He made the comments as a heated political row broke out over the Gaza crisis, with Ed Miliband criticising David Cameron's "silence" over Israel's actions as "inexplicable".

Downing Street hit back, saying it was "shocked" that the Labour leader should "play politics" with the crisis.

Mr Hammond delivered his strong message on the Gaza crisis in his first newspaper interview since being promoted from Defence Secretary to Foreign Secretary in the reshuffle three weeks ago.

In his interview, the Foreign Secretary also: ÞWarned that more civilian airliners could be shot down by Russianmade missiles that end up in the hands of terrorists or militias "anywhere" in the world; ÞSaid Russia was "certainly not an ally" and that Britain's faith in Vladimir Putin's good intentions has been "shattered" over Ukraine; Þ Declared that his "priority" between now and the general election next May would be to prepare for negotiating a new relationship with the European Union, with reforms to immigration and trade; ÞSignalled a shift in foreign policy to focus diplomatic efforts on pursuing national interests, saying the Foreign Office should think of itself as "the British Office"; ÞPromised to send support to help treat any British citizens who become infected with the deadly Ebola virus overseas but ruled out flying victims home for treatment; ÞConceded that families did not yet feel any better off as a result of the economic recovery but promised living standards would begin to improve over the next year, if Britain was disciplined about continuing austerity.

The number of dead in Gaza yesterday rose to 1,655, with thousands more injured, most of whom were Palestinian civilians.

The fatalities followed the collapse of a ceasefire brokered by the US and the UN on Friday.

Palestinian officials said 55 people had died in Israeli strikes on Saturday alone, most in Rafah.

According to the British government, since the Israeli offensive began on July 8, 136 schools, 24 hospitals and clinics and 25 ambulances had been damaged or destroyed.

Some 65 Israelis, all but two of whom were soldiers, have died in the conflict.

Speaking at the Foreign Office on Thursday, shortly after Israeli shells killed 19 refugees sheltering in a UN school, Mr Hammond said he feared the Middle East was descending into "an endless loop of violence". He said he had been shocked by the extent of the violence and destruction.

Asked if he feared there may be more anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish communities in Britain as a result of the crisis, Mr Hammond said: "Of course it's a concern and we have already seen certainly an upturn in anti-Semitic rhetoric.

"But what has struck me most looking at my own constituency inbox as well as the thousands of emails that I'm receiving from the general public here is that it isn't Continued on Page 4 Gaza reports Page 22

Doctor infected with Ebola arrives on US soil for treatment despite high-profile opposition

AN AMERICAN aid worker infected with the Ebola virus landed in the US last night for treatment after being flown in by private medical jet from Liberia.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, who is the first person suffering from the disease ever to be admitted onto US soil, was taken to a specialist unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

Television footage showed him being led into the hospital by a medic, the two both wearing white protective boiler suits and masks. The ambulance that transported him received a police escort from a nearby air force base, where his jet had landed.

Dr Brantly will be joined in the coming days by another infected aid worker, Nancy Writebol, 59, who has had to remain in Liberia for the time being as the jet's isolation tent can only take one patient.

While medics are confident that there is no risk of the disease spreading, health offi-cials have had their work cut out dispelling public anxiety about their arrival on US soil.

Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman, drew widespread condemnation for issuing a series of tweets demanding that they be kept out of America.

MrTrump, who is known for his fastidious sense of personal hygiene - he once described handshakes as "barbaric" - wrote on Friday: "Stop the Ebola patients from entering the US. Treat them, at the highest level, over there, the United States have enough problems." His comments have drawn a brusque response from specialists at the hospital.

Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease specialist, said of the pair: "They have gone over on a humanitarian mission and they have become infected giving medical care. We owe them the right to receive the best medical care that is available."

They will now be in the care of the most sophisticated hospital isolation ward on the planet, which was opened at Emory to deal with contingencies including pandemics and bioterrorism attacks.

Located near America's main Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, it is one of a handful of units around the country for testing and treating people infected with dangerous, infectious germs. It has its own laboratory equipment, so samples do not have to be sent to the main hospital lab, and is fully separate from other patient areas. There is no known cure for Ebola, which kills most of those who contract it. But patients diagnosed with the disease early enough can pull through if the symptoms, which include vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from the nose and eyes, are adequately treated. "If there's any modern therapy that can be done, such as better monitoring of fluids, electrolytes and vital signs, workers will be able to do it better in this safe environment", said Dr Philip Brachman, an Emory University public health specialist. "That's all we can do for such a patient. We can make them feel comfortable and let the body try to beat back the virus."

While being treated, they will be able to see loved ones through a plate-glass window and speak to those outside their rooms by phone or intercom.

More than 700 people have now died from the west Africa Ebola outbreak, which has affected Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. On Friday, the World Health Organisation issued a new warning that the disease was spreading faster than it could be controlled. Dr Naomi Platt: Page 17

New man at the Foreign Office embraces his baptism of fire

INTERVIEW

As a string of global crises erupt, Philip Hammond is casting off his low-key image with forceful positions on Gaza, the EU and Russia

By his own admission, Philip Hammond, the new Foreign Secretary, has had "a baptism of fire". Since his promotion three weeks ago, world-changing events have kept him to a frantic pace.

He has chaired the Government's emergency responses to the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine and to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa; negotiated the toughest sanctions against Russia since the Cold War; and flown to the Middle East to lead efforts to end the spiral of violence engulfing Gaza.

With Libya also in flames, forcing the temporary closure of the British Embassy, and Nato facing a crisis of confidence, he is in danger of becoming known as the "minister for the apocalypse".

But the 58-year-old former businessman wouldn't have started his new role any other way.

"Jumping straight in has a lot to recommend it," he says. It is "a better way of getting into the job" than reading endless reports "in peacetime".

But he believes he had a head start, crossing the road to the Foreign Office from the Ministry of Defence, where as defence secretary, he received security briefings and became familiar with MI6 and GCHQ, the government's listening station, both of which now report to him.

His contact with the Pentagon also prepared him well for his new role of nurturing the "special relationship" with the United States.

Our interview takes place in the Secretary of State's official room in George Gilbert Scott's 1868 Foreign Office building. This vast corner office, furnished with lavish wallpaper and antiques, is so grand that even the Prime Minister has expressed envy at its opulence. From here, Britain's economic and diplomatic power is projected through a network of 14,000 people in 270 embassies and consulates across the world.

However, such grandeur could not be more at odds with the personal manner of the Foreign Office's newest inhabitant.

Mr Hammond has acquired an image of solid competence, which has led to unkind comparisons with a cautious, dreary manager at an accountancy firm. He was known sarcastically as "box office Phil" in certain parts of the BBC.

But the message he now brings to the world is far from monochrome.

In his first newspaper interview, the new Foreign Secretary issues his most outspoken criticism to date of the impact of Israel's bombardment on Gaza; announces plans to turn the Foreign Office into the "British Office", rigorously pursuing the national interest; and declares his personal determination to claw back power from bureaucrats in Brussels before offering the British people a referendum on EU membership.

Perhaps the gravest threat in his ministerial red box comes from Russia and its missiles that brought down Flight MH17. They are being sent to the militias in Ukraine and, Mr Hammond fears, could easily end up in the hands of terrorists anywhere in the world, who want nothing more than to shoot down more civilian airliners.

RUSSIA

Russia is "certainly not an ally" and is fast becoming one of Britain's adversaries, Mr Hammond warns, as he lists the conditions that Russia must meet if it is to resolve the crisis in Ukraine.

Mr Putin must take "immediate steps" to ensure international investigation teams can work unhindered at the site of the Malaysia Airlines crash.

He says: "It is an unspeakable abomination that two weeks after this crash, there are still bodies on the crash site unrecovered and the Russians have not used their influence with the separatists.

"I said last week that there is one man who can snap his fingers and make this happen, and he hasn't done so. He must now do so."

What else must Mr Putin do? "Cut off the supply of weapons to the separatists, in particular the supply of sophisticated weapons that could proliferate anywhere, could be used to down other civil airliners - and if they are, Russia will have to be held accountable for any such actions in the future. And stop destabilising and interfering in a sovereign nation."

If Russia takes these steps, it may be possible, gradually, for relations between Mr Putin and the West to return to some semblance of normality, he says.

"We thought that Russia was becoming part of the community of nations, slowly but surely. And, over the last year, our confidence in that has been shattered."

So is Russia now an ally or an enemy? "It's neither at this stage. It is certainly not an ally.

"It is not an enemy, but we have a relationship with Russia at the moment which I would describe as more adversarial than partnership. We have never deluded ourselves on either side that we were allies," he says. "But over the last months, that relationship has moved towards the adversarial end of the spectrum, and it cannot normalise unless and until Russia changes its behaviour."

His grave assessment comes as Nato struggles to devise a coherent response to what Mr Hammond identifies as a new form of state-directed "asymmetric" warfare.

"Russia remains one of the world's great military powers," he says, with "the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons", and a willingness to use them "much earlier" in a conflict than Britain would.

But its new doctrine is one of shadowy proxy warfare, in which weapons are funnelled to the mercenaries, criminals, militia groups and undercover special forces that have destabilised Ukraine and, before that, Georgia.

"What we have seen is a clever and calculated approach to challenging us without provoking a military-type response. It hasn't provoked a military-type response - and wouldn't." Instead, the West has responded with deep economic sanctions - "our area of relative advantage".

GAZA

The Foreign Secretary warns that the crisis engulfing Gaza risks becoming "an endless loop of violence", with consequences for civilian suffering that have already appalled the British public.

One of his first trips was for emergency talks in the Middle East as the violence grew. He fears that reprisals against Israel will lead to more anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish communities in Britain.

But what has struck him most is the widespread public horror at the scale of suffering of the people of Gaza.

"It's a broad swathe of British public opinion that feels deeply, deeply disturbed by what it is seeing on its television screens, coming out of Gaza," he says. "The British public has a strong sense that the situation of the civilian population in Gaza is simply intolerable and must be addressed - and we agree with them. There must be a humanitarian ceasefire that is without conditions," he says. "We have to get the killing to stop."

EUROPE

Mr Hammond declares his focus between now and next year's general election will be preparing for a radical renegotiation of Britain's EU membership, to give the public the choice of a better deal.

David Cameron has promised voters a say on whether Britain should remain a member of the EU with an in-out referendum if the Tories win a majority.

"My priority is going to be the European Union ahead of the negotiations," he says. "Over the next nine months, we are in a pre-negotiation stage."

This will require alliances to be built with other EU countries. But earlier this summer, Mr Cameron risked scuppering the mission by very publicly trying - and failing - to stop Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Brussels federalist, becoming European Commission president.

He insists the failure to stop Mr Juncker does not mean - as some Tory MPs fear - that Britain will never succeed in changing the EU and should instead withdraw. "We have to be pragmatic," Mr Hammond says. "You still have to work with the people you've been fighting. I am an optimist."

IMMIGRATION

Failure to reform European immigration rules in the negotiations would be unacceptable, Mr Hammond says.

"There will have to be reform of the way mass flows of people across the continent of Europe work," he says. "There will have to be an addressing of the abuse of welfare systems that is at the heart of many of those flows."

Preserving and extending the free market to make the EU more competitive will also be essential to stop countries such as Brazil and China "stealing our markets", the Foreign Secretary warns.

His first experience as a voter was in the 1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Economic Community, in which he voted "yes". But last May's European Parliament elections, which saw a surge in support for anti-EU parties, shows that Brussels has "lost public opinion". He has even warned he would vote to leave the EU if there were no changes.

'THE BRITISH OFFICE'

It is time to turn the Foreign Office into "the British Office", focusing ruthlessly on the national interest and doing less in countries that do not directly affect national security or prosperity, the Cabinet minister says.

Last Wednesday, he told civil servants that a new emphasis was required, for the remainder of this Parliament, at least.

"I said to staff here that we may be called the Foreign Office but we need to think of ourselves as the British Office." This means putting "Britain and Britain's interests" first, on national security, economic prosperity, promoting British values and supporting UK citizens around the world.

THE ECONOMY

British people "still feel squeezed" by the recession and its aftermath - austerity - the Foreign Secretary declares.

He held a shadow Treasury brief in Opposition, and would be a front runner to succeed George Osborne as chancellor in any shake-up after the election.

"We have rescued the country from a financial and economic catastrophe, and people's personal balance sheets have taken a huge battering," he says. "Everybody has felt the pain and many people are still feeling bruised. They haven't yet started to feel their standard of living recovering."

However, an important milestone has passed, with the economy now larger than it was before the crisis hit, and it would be "a huge risk" to abandon public spending restraint.

THE PARTY

Even before he became Foreign Secretary, with the world on the brink of a new Cold War, Mr Hammond had a reputation as a hardliner.

He was vocal in his criticism of Mr Cameron's gay marriage reforms, and burnished his Eurosceptic credentials - to the delight of the Tory grass roots - by declaring that he would be ready to leave the EU if a referendum were held now.

But he has been rewarded for his competence - first as transport secretary, then at defence - with promotion to one of the top jobs in government.

Luckily for a man facing a mountain of problems at home and abroad, he lists hillwalking among his chief means of relaxation, along with spending time with family.

"Scotland is my favourite walking territory but when I can't get to Scotland, the Surrey hills," says the MP for Runnymede and Weybridge.

"It has been a baptism of fire, but it's not the first time. When I went into [the Department for] Transport, I had the volcano erupting," he says, recalling the Icelandic ash cloud that halted thousands of flights across northern Europe in 2010.

Some senior Tories regard Mr Hammond as a dark horse for the leadership one day, should another crisis engulf the party or the country.

If he can survive his brutal initiation, and keep Britain out of a new inferno, he would make an obvious choice as a steady hand.

"Russia remains one of the world's great military powers, with the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons and a willingness to use them much earlier in a conflict than Britain would

"My priority is going to be the EU ahead of the negotiations. You have to work with the people you've been fighting

"Putin must cut off the supply of weapons to the separatists, weapons that could proliferate and be used to down other civil airliners - and if they are, Russia will be accountable

Congratulations to Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, who has just become a father for the third time. His daughter Eleanor was born late last month at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

Lucia, Mr Hunt's Chinese-born wife, and Eleanor are understood to be doing well. The minister is now on paternity leave, having reassured government colleagues that NHS medical staff are ready to "deal with anything" in the event of an Ebola emergency.

The birth completes something of a hat-trick for Mr Hunt, because all three of his children - Eleanor, Jack and Anna - have been born since the Coalition was formed in 2010.

Ebola is just one of a series of devastating environmentally related diseases. Outbreaks are reckoned to originate with the hunting, preparing and eating of fruit bats in Africa (they are normally consumed dried or in a spicy soup, since you ask).

HIV/Aids is similarly believed to have originated with such bushmeat, this time from chimpanzees in the forests of western Central Africa.

As Sir Mark Walport, the Government's chief scientist, pointed out to The Daily Telegraph this week: "The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species."

Yet some five million tons of wild animals are "harvested" in this way annually in the Congo Basin alone – and they also provide 80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon.

Deforestation makes the animals easier to reach, while also increasing the risk of other diseases. Bites from malaria–carrying mosquitoes are 300 times more frequent in felled areas: the bare land is hotter, with little shade, letting the insects live longer and breed faster.

Similarly, schistosomiasis, which infects 200 million people globally, spread in Cameroon because a snail harbouring the worm that causes it flourished on cleared land. It is yet another reason why a sick environment is an unhealthy place to be.

As the death toll from Ebola reaches 670, a second American doctor contracts the virus in Liberia, and it is feared to have spread to Nigeria, here's an explanation of what Ebola is, how it is spread, and how worried we should be

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

What is Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10999981/Ebola-virus-outbreak-live.html] ?

Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is described by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as "a severe, often fatal illness in humans."

It first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks - in Nzara, Sudan; and in Yambuku, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

It is mainly found in tropical Central and West Africa, and can have a 90 per cent mortality rate - although it is now at about 60 per cent.

How is it transmitted?

The virus is known to live in fruit bats, and normally affects people living in or near tropical rainforests.

It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.

The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission, with infection resulting from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the disease is not contagious until a person begins to show symptoms.

A big problem in West Africa is that burial ceremonies, in which mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person, can increase the spread of the disease because a person can transmit the virus even after death.

Men who have recovered from the disease can still transmit the virus through their semen for up to seven weeks after recovery from illness.

Ebola kills indiscriminately, but women are particularly badly affected [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10998058/Ebola-virus-Meet-the-women-who-have-survived-the-deadly-disease.html] . Because it is transmitted through bodily fluids, it spreads easily to people caring for the sick. In West Africa, it is generally women that prepare dead bodies for funeral and look after ailing members of their communities.

What does it do to your body?

Symptoms begin with fever, muscle pain and a sore throat, then rapidly escalate to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from two to 21 days.

Health workers are at serious risk of contracting the disease - two American doctors have already contracted it, and a Liberian medic has died. Sierra Leone announced on July 23 Sheik Umar Khan, the doctor leading the fight against Ebola in the country, had himself contracted the disease following the deaths of several nurses at the treatment centre where he works.

Early treatment improves a patient's chances of survival.

How is it treated?

There is no vaccine or cure, and testing to confirm the virus must be done with the highest level of biohazard protection.

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive. Patients are frequently dehydrated and require oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes or intravenous fluids.

A significant problem with the current outbreak is families lose faith in Western medicine, which cannot yet cure the patients. They then take them home to traditional village healers, which often leads the disease to spread.

Where have there been outbreaks before?

The WHO is calling this the largest outbreak ever recorded of the disease.

But there have been sporadic outbreaks before - mainluy in Uganda, the DRC, Sudan and Gabon.

The worst previous outbreak, in 2000 in Uganda, saw 425 people infected, of which just over half died.

How likely is it to reach Britain?

There has been a previous case in the UK, when in 1976 someone was accidentally infected in a laboratory, but survived.

And up until a few weeks ago, the cases were mainly in remote areas affecting rural workers unlikely to take flights and spread the disease internationally.

However, concern is now growing that this large outbreak is spreading beyond the rural areas of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - where it has been concentrated so far - and into the capital cities and beyond.

A Liberian man died in Nigeria on July 24, having flown in to Lagos after a stopover in Togo. That the man died in Africa's largest city has deeply worried authorities.

There have been no Ebola cases from people returning to the UK from Africa.

Guinea is not a big tourist destination with only around 2,600 visits a year from the UK, mostly on business - but 117,000 Britons visit Nigeria each year.

Travellers who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus in West Africa should seek urgent medical attention immediately if symptoms develop within 21 days of coming home. UK doctors who suspect Ebola can get expert advice from the Imported Fever Service.

Public Health England says the risk of a traveller contracting Ebola is very low without direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person or animal

Diesel drivers should be fuming

Boris Johnson's proposals that diesel vehicles should pay an extra congestion charge is final proof that the petrol alternative is flawed

For more than two decades, well-meaning motorists have been persuaded, by successive governments, to buy diesel cars because they are good for the environment. Yet those same governments knew, all along, that they increase the air pollution that is killing thousands of people a year.

Now – with the situation in cities reaching crisis levels – such owners face being punished for their high-mindedness, as the drive for diesel goes abruptly into reverse. For this week’s proposals by the Mayor of London to crack down on diesel vehicles are likely to be only the start of a process of “unwinding” the incentives to buy them that have long been on offer, and replacing them with penalties.

Launching his new “air quality manifesto”, Boris Johnson proposed that all but the cleanest diesels should pay an extra congestion charge to enter central London, likely to be about £10 a day. One of his senior officials has also called for “a tax weighting on diesel”, though the Mayor merely said he is pressing for “fiscal incentives” to promote the least polluting cars. Ministers in Whitehall are considering national measures.

However necessary – indeed overdue – it may be to make diesel unattractive to consumers, motorists have a right to be aggrieved. For more than a quarter of a century, blinkered governments – spurred first by the Seventies fuel crises and then by global warming – have encouraged diesels as more energy efficient and less carbon-emitting than petrol-driven vehicles. They were usually subject to less Vehicle Excise Duty, or sometimes none at all. Until a year ago, many were exempt from London’s congestion charge.

The results were dramatic. Over the past decade, diesels have increased from 7.4 per cent of the country’s car fleet to more than a third of it, and now make up more than half of new car sales.

Yet for at least 20 years, governments have known that this policy was greatly increasing the levels of two serious air pollutants, particulates and nitrogen dioxide. In 1995, for example, the Government Expert Panel on Air Quality pressed the Major administration to introduce tough emission standards for diesel, and the then environment secretary, John Gummer, unsuccessfully pressed for higher taxes on it. Yet under Labour, Gordon Brown increased the incentives in its favour.

Now, London is the European capital most polluted by nitrogen dioxide, which is closely linked with asthma and other respiratory diseases. King’s College London reported last month that average levels of the gas in Oxford Street are the highest in the world, at three times the EU’s maximum allowable level.

Britain promised to meet those European limits by 2010, but ministers have just admitted that many cities will not achieve this until 2025, and London, Birmingham and Leeds will be in breach into the 2030s. The European Commission is prosecuting the Government over its tolerance of such pollution – “perhaps the longest-running infringement of EU law in history” – in the European Court of Justice. Britain could be fined hundreds of millions of pounds a year.

No less than 95 per cent of the nitrogen dioxide emitted by vehicles comes from diesel exhausts. And the effects of particulates, 91 per cent of which also come from diesels, are even more serious, causing more than 7,000 deaths a year. By World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, 96 per cent of British urban-dwellers are exposed to dangerous levels of them.

In all, a study by Public Health England reported in May, the risk of dying from air pollution in central London is four times higher than in the cleanest parts of the country. Scientists reported last month that children born and bred in Britain’s polluted cities suffer “stunted lung development”. And the WHO has officially classified diesel fumes as a cause of cancer.

To add insult to injury, it seems that the dash to diesel has not even achieved what it set out to do in terms of increasing fuel efficiency and combating climate change. Which? has shown that diesel cars get fewer miles per gallon than manufacturers claim. And the particulates they emit are largely made up of soot, which is emerging as one of the most important causes of global warming. Moreover, nitrogen oxide emissions from petrol engines have tumbled by more than 95 per cent since 2000, while those from diesel ones have remained as high as ever.

It is long past time that people were persuaded to switch back, but given the way they were duped in the first place, this must be done fairly. One idea could be to introduce a scrappage scheme, which rewards motorists for turning in dirty diesels; the similar version introduced for old bangers during the financial crisis, to boost the motor industry, proved remarkably successful.

Certainly, carrots should take precedence over sticks. For it would be grossly unjust to punish drivers for doing what they thought – and were repeatedly told – was the right thing.

Fined if you do, fined if you don’t: those US sprinkler laws in full

Can you beat this? At the height of the three-year (so far) crippling Californian drought, a Los Angeles suburb is threatening criminal proceedings against residents who don’t water their lawns enough.

The well-heeled municipality of Glendora has sent an official warning to Michael and Laura Korte – who, trying to do the right thing, water just twice a week – saying they could be fined $500 (£292).

With impeccable timing, the warning arrived just as the state passed emergency regulations to stop people “overwatering” their lawns – on pain of a fine of, er, $500. A brown lawn should be “a badge of honour”, it said.

Not in Glendora, it seems – or in nearby Anaheim, where residents have also been warned to keep their grass verdant. The Kortes can’t even paint it, as some Californian householders have done. They were sent an exemplary picture of a sprinkler playing.

Watering is essential, apparently, to “keep landscaping looking healthy and green” and to maintain the suburb’s reputation as “The Pride of the Foothills” – a designation few outsiders have heard of.

Otherwise, it is feared, property prices will go down the plughole.

If you have recently travelled to an area that has been affected, such as Liberia, Ghana or Sierra Leone, or have come into contact with someone who may at risk, there are several ways of limiting your chance of catching Ebola

• Ebola virus outbreak: live[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Ebola is spread by contact with the fluids of someone who is infected with Ebola, including saliva, sweat, blood and vomit. No vaccine or cure is available.

But there have been no reported cases in the UK, so coming into contact with the disease at this stage is really unlikely.

However, if you have recently travelled to an area that has been affected, such as Liberia, Ghana or Sierra Leone, or have come into contact with someone who may at risk, there are several ways of limiting your chance of catching Ebola.

Despite the seriousness of the disease, which causes bleeding from the mouth, ears and eyes, preventing it spreading is relatively simple.

According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, it is important to wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap or, if that is not available, a hand sanitiser can be used.

Avoid any contact with someone you believe is infected, especially with their bodily fluids, advises the World Health Organisation (WHO).

If you need to go near someone with the virus, use protective gear such as face masks and gloves.

Health workers in West Africa have taken full precautions, wearing protective suits that cover their entire bodies, as well as hosing down areas infected patients have used.

WHO states any areas an infected person could have had contact with, such as bed linens, should be disinfected.

If you believe someone you know has been infected, or if you think you might have contracted Ebola, the best thing to do is isolate yourself from any other people around you and call medical help immediately.

A sudden temperature, muscle aches, vomiting or a rash might indicate you have the disease.

Ebola virus: the tiny airport in Sierra Leone that has direct link to Britain

Passengers on only direct flight to Britain from Ebola-infected area are ordered to wash hands in chlorine and take fever tests

As a last line of defence in stopping the spread of the deadly Ebola virus to Britain, Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone would not be an obvious first choice. Sitting on the far side of an estuary from the capital, Freetown, the tiny airport terminal is accessed via a collection of ageing ferries and taxi-boats - none of which, as the Foreign office travel guide points out, is “without risk”.

Such was the reputation of the airport’s officials for taking bribes and backhanders that its management was handed two years ago to a private contractor in a bid to stamp out corrupt practices.

On Thursday, though, as the only airport that operates flights from Africa’s Ebola-affected region directly to London, Britain is relying on its teams of security officials to screen passengers for the disease as they board the four-times weekly flight to Heathrow.

At the airport on Thursday, visitors to the airport were required to wash their hands in chlorinated water before they embarked on the estuary crossing, and then again when they entered the airport terminal itself, which is only open to people with airline tickets.

A masked official with an infra-red temperature gun - which requires no bodily contact - then assessed passengers for any sign of fevers, with anyone with a temperature above 101.6F (38.7C) banned from travelling.

However, given that the disease has incubation period of up to three weeks before symptoms begin, there was nothing to stop potential carriers boarding the British Airways flight 136 to Heathrow, which starts its journey in neighbouring Liberia, another affected nation.

Health experts, though, said despite the growing spread of the disease across the region - Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency - there was not yet any need to consider a ban on direct flights.

“If the disease does continue to spread through west Africa, there will probably be sporadic cases arriving at Heathrow via direct flights,” said Dr Derek Gatherer, a specialist in the evolution of viruses at Lancaster University. “But right now I don’t think there is much to worry about. The infected areas are mainly villages in remote areas, where people are not generally in the habit of international travel. The other main 'at risk’ group are medics who have been treated affected people, but they do generally take very stringent precautions against being infected.”

On Thursday night, the World Health Organisation said it was launching a new $100 million fund to improve the response to the outbreak across the region, which will bring in several hundred new staff to fight it. The US also issued a new travel warning to its citizens, urging them to avoid “non-essential” visits to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone. The move represents a greater level of official caution than the Foreign Office, which has so far stuck to posting advice on its website warning of the dangers posed by the disease.

Staff at Lungi Airport appeared to be taking the risks seriously, with no passenger allowed to enter the airport without undergoing the checks. Posters around the terminal warned people of the telltale signs of the illness, which include vomiting, bleeding from the eyes and acute diarrhoea.

For passengers who could not read or write, a set of graphic illustrations left nothing to the imagination. Others symbols showed a picture of a monkey - a warning to avoid eating the bushmeat that is thought to have been the source of original outbreak.

Despite the spread of the disease - which has seen official vehicles touring the streets of Freetown megaphoning public health warnings - passengers for the six-hour BA flight seemed largely unconcerned. While a few wore protective white gloves to reduce the risk of infection by handshake, none claimed to be leaving Sierra Leone because of fears about Ebola’s spread.

Momodu Koroma, 57, a businessman, told The Telegraph: “There was ample screening at the airport, with every single passenger checked, which made me feel very relieved. I took care to stay safe in Freetown but in certain parts of the country there’s a lot of fear. I feel glad in a sense to be leaving.”

However, on arriving at Heathrow, passengers said they did not undergo additional checks or receive additional advice on what to do if they fell ill. Border officials have already complained they have not been adequately prepared in what to in case they encounter infected people.

Meanwhile, the government of Sierra Leone on Thursday began ramping up its efforts to counter the disease, ordering the authorities to conduct house-to-house searches for anyone suspected of having the disease but failing to come forward for treatment.

Some families are believed to have kept loved ones at home, given the high death rates at clinics where Ebola patients are quarantined.

The country also saw the burial on Thursday of Umar Khan, its sole virologist, who was branded a “national hero” after saving the lives of more than 100 Ebola patients before succumbing himself to the disease.

In neighbouring Liberia, officials begun shutting down schools in infected areas and ordering most public servants to stay away from work, while the US Peace Corps began withdrawing hundreds of volunteers posted to the affected countries, Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. Two Peace Corps workers are already medical observation after coming into contact with someone who later died of Ebola.

More than 700 people have now died from the disease, according to the World Health Organisation, which announced dozens of new fatalities on Wednesday.

An asylum seeker who had arrived in Britain from Liberia was suspected of carrying the deadly virus Ebola, it has emerged

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

An asylum seeker was suspected of having the deadly Ebola virus after developing symptoms within days of arriving in Britain from Libera, it has emerged.

The man, who was awaiting processing at an immigration centre run by security company G4S in Gatwick, was feared to be carrying the disease, which has killed more than 700 people in West Africa.

Immigration staff isolated the man and tested him for Ebola earlier this week, but he did not have the infection.

However the incident shows how easy it would be for the deadly disease to enter Britain through illegal channels.

Border staff at UK airports also claim they have not been trained to deal with suspected cases coming into the country.

Major British hubs like Heathrow have failed to tighten procedures even through airports in Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa have introduced beefed up screening.

Keith Vaz MP, the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, has written to Theresa May, the home secretary, demanding to know which entry point in the UK is most at risk and how border staff are being protected against infection.

“I am concerned that officers enforcing our borders suggest they may not be fully prepared to protect the public from the spread of this deadly virus.

“Prevention is not just better than cure, in this case it is essential. I have written to the Home Secretary to ensure that we are doing all we can to protect the UK on the frontline.”

Immigration Service Union general secretary Lucy Moreton said customs, border and immigration staff were worried about being infected and had not been given proper advice about how to deal with people suspected of being sick.

Mrs Moreton said: "They serve on the front line; they are the first point of contact usually for people coming off an aircraft and the concern is what do they do if they're confronted with someone that doesn't appear well who appears at the border.

"There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all as to what they should do."

Ms Moreton said members had been contacting the union for guidance on what to do and how to protect themselves, but that it had no answers for them.

A spokesman for G4S said they were monitoring new entrants who had been in the country less than 21 days, the maximum incubation time for the disease.

Professor John Ashton, President of the Faculty of Public Health, said the disease was likely to spread further.

“Epidemic diseases do not respect country boundaries, which is why we need collective action to tackle the causes of outbreaks to prevent further tragedies,” he said.

Latest figures from the World Health Organisation show that the outbreak of the deadly virus in western Africa has infected more than 1,300 people and killed at least 729. Ebola has no vaccine and there is no cure.

The outbreak has centred on Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. There has also been particular concern after densely populated Nigeria reported what is thought to be its first death from the disease on Friday.

The scientist who helped to discover the Ebola virus has said there was a ‘good probability’ that someone with the disease would enter Europe and warned that health workers were particularly at risk.

However Professor Peter Piot, who was part of the team that discovered the virus in 1976, said that the likelihood the epidemic could spread in the UK was "very, very, very low".

Prof Piot, who is now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said even if someone came to the UK during the incubation period, infection control measures in Britain would prevent the spread of the virus.

He said: "In Europe, the way I see it is that there is a good probability that someone will enter a country while incubating - when you have Ebola, frankly you can't travel you are so sick - it's the incubation time when people can enter the country.

"Here, because of our infection control and standards in hospitals, I think that the likelihood that would give rise to an epidemic is very, very, very low."

He said that he wouldn't mind sitting next to an infected person on a plane or train, adding: "By that I mean someone who is already infected but is not yet ill. Even in the early days when they have fever, that's also not risky for others.

"It's when they start bleeding, have diarrhoea and are vomiting, that's risky, but someone with full-blown Ebola infection can't travel. Even then you still need close contact. It's not like tuberculosis or Sars or the flu - that you can catch on a bus, but not Ebola.

"When someone is extremely ill - that is when they are very infectious, but at that stage patients can hardly move - they are not mobile.

"This is not a very contagious infection, you need close contact with someone who is really ill or who died from it.

"For border agents there is no problem that I can see.

"I think the key risk is for health workers. When someone comes (to hospital) with fever and some other symptoms health workers just have to ask where the person has been in the past month. If the answer is Sierra Leone then the red light should be flashing.”

Public Health England said border officers have been given guidance on how to identify and deal with suspected Ebola cases safely.

Yesterday, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond sought to reassure the public over fears that the disease could come to Britain, saying it was "most unlikely" it could spread within the UK.

He did, however, describe the outbreak as a "very serious threat", and health experts have met to discuss the possibility of people contracting the virus in West Africa and falling sick here.

The Government's emergencies committee Cobra met to discuss the situation yesterday, after which Mr Hammond said the "logical" approach was to tackle the disease at source in West Africa.

He said that the "frankly different" standards of infection control in the UK meant it was unlikely it could spread here, and that the disease appeared to be contained within the worst outbreak areas.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said that Britain had expertise in the NHS and extensive experience dealing with dangerous diseases through the work of organisations such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

American medic working for charity in Monrovia being treated for deadly virus sweeping Africa

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

A US doctor working with Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10999981/Ebola-virus-outbreak-live.html] patients in Liberia has tested positive for the deadly virus.

The charity Samaritan's Purse issued a news release Saturday saying Dr Kent Brantly was being treated at a hospital in Monrovia, the capital. DR Brantly had been serving as medical director for the aid organisation's case management centrE there.

Photos of Dr Brantly working in Liberia show him in white coveralls made of a synthetic material that he wore for hours a day while treating Ebola patients.

Brantly was quoted in a posting on the organization's website earlier this year about efforts to maintain an isolation ward for patients.

"The hospital is taking great effort to be prepared," Dr Brantly said. "In past Ebola outbreaks, many of the casualties have been healthcare workers who contracted the disease through their work caring for infected individuals."

Samaritan's Purse spokeswoman Melissa Strickland says Dr Brantly's wife and children had been living with him in Africa but are currently in the US.

The disease has already killed 672 in four West African countries since the outbreak began earlier this year.

Nigeria announced it would screen all airline passengers for the highly contagious Ebola virus after a traveler from Liberia died of the contagious disease in Lagos, Africa's most populous city.

Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old civil servant who was suffering from severe vomiting and diarrhoea on a flight from Liberia, collapsed on arrival at the city's international airport.

He was transported to hospital where he subsequently died.

Laboratory tests have confirmed the Ebola virus as the cause of death.

The deadly haemorrhagic fever has killed more than 660 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since March, in the largest ever outbreak.

Nigeria is the fourth West African country to be affected.

Health authorities there are on alert and are trying to trace other passengers in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus across Lagos, a densely populated metropolis of up to 20 million people.

"All the passengers that the patient came in contact with have been traced and are being investigated," said Nigeria's Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu.

In a separate concerning incident, the first person to test positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown was forcibly removed from a hospital by her family.

A public service announcement was broadcast on radio stations around the city of 1 million, asking for help locating the 32-year-old woman.

"She is a positive case and her being out there is a risk to all. We need the public to help us locate her."

Public attitudes and confusion over treatment have undermined the response to the outbreak.

Health officials have warned that some families have sought to "break out" relatives from quarantine facilities due to a lack of understanding of the disease.

Weak public health systems, in some cases damaged by decades of war, have also hampered efforts to contain the virus.

Spread through direct physical contact with bodily fluids, family members caring for the sick and health workers are at risk of the disease, for which there is no vaccine.

Sierra Leone's top medic leading its Ebola response has himself become infected in the last few days.

Medical workers dealing with the highly contagious fever are advised to wear head-to-toe biohazard suits, even when handling patients who have already died.

Several species of fruit bat are thought to carry the virus, and it may cross the species barrier through eating of "bush meat".

Because its host species are found in forests, the disease has rarely been seen in an urban setting.

Outbreaks have tended to burn out in remote regions, where the disease has little opportunity to spread widely given the extremely high fatality rate.

The ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus in Western Africa is now by far the biggest in the 38-year history of the disease, with more than 670 deaths and 1200 suspected cases so far across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and concerns it will spread further

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are in the grip of the worst outbreak of Ebola virus in history. According to the latest figures from the Centre for Disease Prevention, 672 people have died so far from 1201 cases. That number is likely to have already risen.

To put that in context, the biggest previous outbreak of the disease saw 224 deaths from 425 cases, and there have only been 2,300 deaths from all previous outbreaks of the virus. This outbreak, which has been growing since March, concerns the deadliest form of the Ebola virus, Zaire ebolavirus.

Named after the country which saw the first outbreak of the disease in 1976, the Zaire strain kills on average 78 per cent of those who contract it. It is mainly found in tropical Central and West Africa and can have up to a 90 per cent mortality rate.

“This is the largest outbreak of this disease to date, and it's clear it is not under control, ” said Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England.

The health body has issued an urgent warning to doctors in England to watch for signs of the lethal disease. Phillip Hammond, the foreign secretary, will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Wednesday to discuss the outbreak.

The Ebola virus first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks - in Nzara, Sudan; and in Yambuku, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The outbreak in DRC was in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines.

Early symptoms are similar to those of flu but are followed by severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and eventually internal and external bleeding.

UK 'leads world' in disease protection

BRITAIN is ready for an Ebola outbreak if the disease arrives in the UK, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has said.

Mr Hunt said that the expertise and experience of NHS medical staff meant that Britain would be able to "deal with anything" which might threaten public health in the coming weeks.

Yesterday US health officials warned that Western countries were just "one plane ride away" from infection while David Cameron said the Ebola outbreak was a "very serious threat" to the UK .

Charities on the front line also said the disease was almost certain to spread to new countries.

But after a meeting of the Government's emergency planning committee, Cobra, ministers said that although the West African outbreak was "significant" it was "highly unlikely" that it would spread in Britain, with only isolated cases likely.

Mr Hunt said: "We have a lot of experience of dealing with diseases that are very dangerous.

"We are very confident that we have very good people in the NHS, very experienced people who will be ready to deal with anything, if it were to arrive in the UK."

The disease, which can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has now killed more than 670 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The charity Action Aid said the outbreak was "the worst the world has ever seen" and was "speeding up rather than slowing down".

However, there have been no reported cases of Ebola in Britain yet. Two Britons have been tested after reporting symptoms, but neither had the disease.

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, who chaired yesterday's meeting of Cobra, said: "I would emphasise again, in terms of the UK, the issue is about the possibility of somebody who has contracted the disease in Africa getting sick here," he said.

"It is not about the disease spreading in the UK because we have frankly different standards of infection control procedure that would make that most unlikely."

Liberia and Sierra Leone have declared national emergencies with Liberia closing all schools and putting all non–essential government workers on compulsory 30–day leave.

Some airlines have stopped flying into infected West African countries, although British airlines said they would continue to travel.

Public Health England warned health officials to be on the lookout for any unexplained illness in people returning from the affected countries.

The Department of Health said: "Protecting the public from infectious diseases is a priority and we lead the world in this field. We are well–prepared to identify and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, though there has never been a case in this country."

Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines. The virus then spreads in the community through human–to–human transmission.

Health workers tackling the outbreak have been especially vulnerable. Dr Sheik Umar Khan, who had been hailed as a national hero for his work treating patients with Ebola in Sierra Leone, died on Tuesday after being quarantined in a hospital in the country.

Two American health workers are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non–essential personnel from the country.

RAF on standby to fly out Britons with Ebola

THE Royal Air Force is on standby to bring back UK citizens from West Africa if they are suspected of being infected with Ebola disease.

David Cameron yesterday warned that the outbreak posed a "very serious threat" to the UK, and Cobra, the Government's emergency committee, was convened to discuss how to tighten defences against the virus.

Major Thomas Fletcher, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, said the military would be on alert to "repatriate" Britons infected with the disease.

The RAF's Infection Prevention Control Team is on standby to collect UK citizens and return them to Britain in quarantine conditions if they are suspected of being infected with the disease.

Major Fletcher, a consultant on infectious diseases who has been seconded to the World Health Organisation to help with the outbreak, said: "The UK has a close relationship with West Africa and there will be British citizens in those countries. Cobra will be discussing the possibility of the Royal Air Force offering assistance to UK nationals abroad who may become infected and who need to be repatriated."

Major Fletcher said it was a concern that one Ebola victim, Patrick Sawyer, had travelled on two flights in Africa before he died in Nigeria and warned that infected travellers risked "importing" the disease to the UK.

"The passenger who died in Nigeria is clearly a concern as it is highly likely he was infectious during the flights he took, and potentially there are people out there who are also now infected," he added.

"With the advent of global travel there is increasing risk of importing Ebola into the UK."

Two Britons have already been tested in London and Birmingham after reporting symptoms, but neither had the disease. Prof Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, suggested people travelling back from West Africa who were worried about picking up the disease should go into "voluntary quarantine".

"This will almost always be something else," he said. "But it would be sensible to make absolutely sure, possibly with additional blood tests or recommending voluntary quarantine – 'stay at home until you feel better or we see what happens' ."

Dr Derek Gatherer, a specialist in the evolution of viruses from Lancaster University, warned that passengers who had flown alongside Mr Sawyer could be "anywhere in the world by now" adding: "Aids spread from Central Africa to the western world in the 1980s – Ebola could do the same. Anyone on the same plane could have become infected because Ebola is easy to catch. That is why there is such alarm over Mr Sawyer because he became ill on the flight so anyone else sharing the plane could have been infected by his vomit or other bodily fluids."

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, who chaired yesterday's meeting of Cobra, said the Government was considering "extra precautions" but added that it was "most unlikely" that Ebola could spread within the UK because of worldclass standards of infection control.

Customs, border and immigration officials are worried about being infected and do not know what to do if they suspect someone of being sick, says Immigration Service Union general secretary Lucy Moreton

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Border officials have little idea about what to do when confronted with people coming to the UK with suspected cases of the Ebola virus, a union leader has said.

Immigration Service Union general secretary Lucy Moreton said customs, border and immigration staff were worried about being infected and had not been given proper advice about how to deal with people suspected of being sick.

Fears are rising after an epidemic of the deadly virus - for which there is no vaccine - swept West Africa, killing more than 670 people.

Public Health England has warned health officials to be on the lookout for any unexplained illness in people returning from the affected countries.

But Mrs Moreton told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight programme that border staff in the UK did not know what to do with suspected cases.

She said: "They serve on the front line; they are the first point of contact usually for people coming off an aircraft and the concern is what do they do if they're confronted with someone that doesn't appear well who appears at the border.

"There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all as to what they should do."

Ms Moreton said members had been contacting the union for guidance on what to do and how to protect themselves, but that it had no answers for them.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond sought to reassure the public over fears that the disease could come to Britain yesterday, saying it was "most unlikely" it could spread within the UK.

He did, however, describe the outbreak as a "very serious threat", and health experts have met to discuss the possibility of people contracting the virus in West Africa and falling sick here.

Health workers tackling the outbreak in the region have been especially vulnerable to contracting the disease, with one doctor treating patients in Sierra Leone dying after becoming infected.

Two American health workers - a doctor and a missionary - are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease.

There have been concerns that the disease could move to the UK after it emerged two people have been assessed for the virus in Britain.

A man was given the all-clear following tests in Birmingham after he travelled from Benin in Nigeria via Paris to the Midlands, while doctors ruled out the need for an Ebola test in a second male in west London.

A British doctor volunteering with victims of the disease in Sierra Leone called for more help for agencies such as Medecins Sans Frontieres working in the region.

Benjamin Black, an obstetrician from Manchester who worked in hospitals in London, has been working 24-hour shifts in a clinic in the southern city of Bo, and says doctors have been struggling to cope with the pressure.

He said it was a "major concern" what might happen around the world, adding: "The main challenge here, though, is that the health authorities just don't have the infrastructure to cope. They're overwhelmed."

In an interview with Metro he described how he tried to save pregnant women struck with the disease, performing an emergency hysterectomy on one sufferer and helping a pregnant woman who had suffered severe bleeding and fever after preparing bodies of Ebola victims for a funeral.

Mr Black, 32, told the newspaper: "I couldn't believe this was my first shift, on my first mission. As I operated, I kept thinking I was going to drown in the pressure."

The Government's emergencies committee Cobra met to discuss the situation yesterday, after which Mr Hammond said the "logical" approach was to tackle the disease at source in West Africa.

He said that the "frankly different" standards of infection control in the UK meant it was unlikely it could spread here, and that the disease appeared to be contained within the worst outbreak areas.

Ebola outbreak: hundreds of Western aid workers evacuated as death toll approaches 750

US Peace Corps, Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA among aid organisations pulling staff out of Ebola-hit regions of west Africa

Hundreds of Western charity volunteers working in Ebola-hit West Africa are being evacuated for their safety as the death toll from the virus approached 750 and 122 new infections were discovered in just four days.

The US Peace Corps said it was moving 340 of its volunteers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone "due to the increasing spread of the Ebola virus".

Two other Christian aid organisations, Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA, both of which have staff members infected with the haemorrhagic fever, said they were pulling out all non-essential staff.

Amber Brantly, the wife of Kent Brantly, an American doctor fighting for his life in Liberia after being infected at the hospital where he worked, said that her husband's spirits had been boosted by international messages of support.

"We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support," Mrs Brantly said.

"Kent remains very physically weak but his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal."

British aid organisations including Save The Children, Cafod, Oxfam, Plan UK and ActionAid all told The Telegraph that they had no plans to move international staff from the region, or said that they worked only with local staff.

Foreign Office health advisers say there is no need yet for Britons working or holidaying in the affected countries to leave, or to take precautions beyond basic avoidance of Ebola hospitals or apparently infected individuals.

A total of 729 people have now died in 1,323 cases spanning four countries, the World Health Organisation reported on Thursday, quoting figures accurate up to July 27.

The outbreak, the worst ever, has been described as "out of control", a phrase used by governments and aid agencies, and Sierra Leone has followed Liberia in implementing extraordinary measures to try to contain its spread.

Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone's president, deployed the army to work alongside health workers to go house to house in areas hit by the outbreak to make sure infected people are moved to professional medical care.

Many people living in rural areas of the three affected countries are suspicious of Western medicine and refuse to take their relatives to clinics if they show symptoms of Ebola.

"Ebola is real, and we must stop its transmission," Mr Koroma said in a live address to the nation on Wednesday evening.

"It is very necessary to get those with the virus to treatment centres not only to prevent others from contracting the virus, but also increasing their own chances of survival."

Liberia has already closed its borders and restricted movement in affected areas.

Ebola virus is terrifying, says Dr Alexander van Tulleken, an expert in tropical medicine. It isn't going to come to Europe – but its spread and death toll is a warning that we aren't prepared for diseases that could

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Ebola Virus Disease is one of those rare infections that is so sinister and appalling that it inspires Hollywood movies and bestselling thrillers.

In brief: Ebola is terrifying.

It sporadically emerges from the African jungle and is famous not for the numbers of people affected – since its discovery in 1976 we have recorded less than 3,000 infections – but for its shocking effects: untreated, the most virulent strains of Ebola virus kills 90 per cent of the people it infects. The time from infection to death can be as little as a few days, and the deaths are painful and appalling as it is a haemorrhagic fever: victims bleed uncontrollably. There is no vaccine, and no cure, so the only treat we can currently offer is "supportive care": fluids, pain relief, management of clotting problems.

The infection spreads readily and is found in all bodily fluids so patients and the bodies of the deceased have to be isolated. The virus itself is so dangerous that it can only be researched in Biosafety Level 4 facilities, meaning that there are only a handful of laboratories worldwide that can deal with it. These labs have airlocks, isolated water supplies and staff wear positive-pressure protective suits. It is also considered "weaponiseable" by the US Department of Defense: it is a Class A Bioterrorism Agent.

And now it has now made the leap, on an aeroplane, to Lagos in Nigeria, Africa's most populous city, inside a 40 year-old Liberian civil servant, who was sick on arrival and died only a few days later. Authorities are monitoring a total of 59 people who were in contact with Sawyer, including airport contacts, the Lagos state health ministry said. The hospital where he died has been shut down and quarantined.

Nigeria's airports, sea ports and land borders are on "red alert", while Liberia has closed most of its border crossings.

So, is it time to panic?

On my Facebook page and Twitter feed friends discussed their plans for the Ebola apocalypse, and one of my undergraduate students posted a "How to recognise Ebola" fact sheet (I live in New York City – will we soon need to recognise it here?) .

The current epidemic began in March this year in Northern Guinea and then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. It has now made the leap to Lagos. This outbreak is huge by Ebola standards: it has infected over 1,000 people, where as all the previous epidemics combined recorded only 2,300 infections. And in this epidemic over half of the people who have been infected have died.

It is in the news prominently right now because two American aid workers, Dr Ken Brantly and Nancy Writebol, have contracted the infection in Liberia. Both are expected to live as they sought care early.

So, far, so bad. We have an epidemic deadly disease with no cure that has now infected the very Westerners that were attempting to contain it – and it has moved, on a plane, to a global hub.

But this is not a disease that can easily sweep through London or New York.

It has three problems as a virus: it kills its victims too quickly and infected people are extremely symptomatic. So unlike, for example, HIV or tuberculosis infections, where people can be contagious but asymptomatic for years, thus infecting many others, it's easy to steer clear of people with Ebola.

Secondly it's actually not that contagious. Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian man who brought Ebola to Lagos, doesn't seem to have infected anyone else – despite being extremely unwell on a crowded plane.

But we can't afford to relax.

You don't have to worry about Ebola but you do have to care. Primarily, I would argue, for humanitarian reasons – but also for reasons of self-interest. The epidemic disease is a threat which desperately needs attention, and this epidemic is revealing weaknesses in the ability of the international system to respond. Death is not the only threat posed by epidemic disease: disruption to trade and travel are potentially vast.

There are currently only two international NGOs working across a vast region of West Africa on this epidemic: Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders), probably the most expert medical NGO in the world, and Samaritan's Purse, a large, highly competent faith-based NGO. The work they are doing is, quite simply, heroic.

I trained in tropical medicine and I have worked in Sudan, Congo and Gabon, all countries where Ebola epidemics have occurred. These places are hard to work in at the best of times but today in Monrovia, Liberia it will be 35 degrees Celsius. The field hospitals are not air-conditioned and the staff will be clad from head-to-toe in thick, protective clothing. They will deal with death all day. These organisations need money and resources and they also need attention and support.

As well as this we need more support and funding for the World Health Organization, the UN body that is charged with managing epidemic disease.

So what can you do? You can give money and you can support political funding of these organisations. This epidemic is an opportunity to improve our regional and international co-ordination of epidemic control and the capacity of NGOs and UN agencies.

This Ebola epidemic isn't going to come to Europe but its spread and death toll is a warning that we aren't prepared for diseases that could.

Calls for Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, two US medical staff battling Ebola in Liberia, to be flown to facilities such as the Hamburg isolation ward

Ebola virus outbreak: live[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Friends of a US doctor and his colleague who are fighting for their lives after contracting Ebola are calling for them to be moved to Europe to raise their chance of survival.

A hospital in Hamburg had set up an isolation ward behind three separate air locks that was reportedly being readied for a senior Sierra Leonean doctor infected with the virus, who died before he could be moved.

There are now appeals for Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, two US medical staff battling the haemorrhagic fever in Liberia, to be flown to facilities such as the Hamburg isolation ward.

There are grave concerns, however, that moving anyone with the contagious disease, which kills between 60 and 90 per cent of those it infects, would risk wider outbreaks.

The death of Patrick Sawyer, an American doctor, earlier this month has raised fears that the virus could spread throughout the world. He was able to take two flights from Liberia — where he is thought to have contracted the disease — before being quarantined in Lagos, Nigeria, where he died.

Perry Bolton, who studied with Dr Brantly at Abilene Christian University in Texas, said: “Whatever needs to be done to get the best possible care for Kent and Nancy, we want to see that happen.

“We’re not completely aware of all the conditions where he is, but it would seem that if we can find a hospital in Europe that’s willing to take them and where they would get better care, that should be done.”

Dr Brantly, 33, from Fort Worth, Texas, is married with two young children. Ms Writebol, 60, a missionary, comes from Charlotte, North Carolina. Samaritan’s Purse, the US Christian aid organisation which both were working with, has said they are being treated in an isolation unit on the outskirts of Monrovia, the Liberian capital.

The charity said last night that Dr Brantley had shown slight signs of improvement, although he remained in a serious condition since being diagnosed while treating patients. Ms Writebol was said to have improved slightly.

Fears that the West African Ebola outbreak[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/]could spread to other continents grew on Wednesday with European and Asian countries on alert and a leading medical charity warning the epidemic was out of control.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said the crisis would only get worse and warned there was no overarching strategy to handle the world's worst-ever outbreak of the disease.

The virus has spread across four countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and now Nigeria - and has prompted border closures and suspension of some flights to and from the affected areas in a bid to contain the advance of the disease.

In Liberia, the football association has banned all matches from taking place for fear of transmitting the virus, which can be passed between humans through sweat.

Meanwhile Sierra Leone has declared a public health emergency.

Dr Kent Brantly, a former GP who moved from Texas to help fight disease, becomes third senior doctor in less than a week to fall ill with Ebola

Ebola virus outbreak: live[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

An American doctor working in Liberia to save West Africans infected with the deadly Ebola virus[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10999981/Ebola-virus-outbreak-live.html] has contracted the illness himself and has been quarantined in an isolation unit while he fights for his life.

More than 660 people of the 1,100 who have fallen sick with Ebola have died, in the worst outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever on record – a death rate of more than 60 per cent. Some strains kill nine in 10 of those who become infected.

Dr Kent Brantly, a former GP in Fort Worth, Texas, became the third senior doctor in less than a week to fall ill with the virus he was trying to treat in others. Dr Samuel Brisbane, from Liberia, died on Saturday at a clinic in the country's capital, Monrovia.

Sierra Leone's leading Ebola specialist, Dr Sheikh Umar Khan, also tested positive last week, and is being treated at a Medecins Sans Frontieres clinic. He is expected to survive.

Dr Brantly had fallen ill with the virus on Saturday, according to a statement from Samaritan's Purse, the American Christian aid agency for which he worked.

"He is currently undergoing treatment at a Samaritan's Purse isolation centre," the organisation said in a statement. "We are committed to doing everything we can for Dr Brantly at this time of crisis."

The 33 year-old had left behind his comfortable life as a community doctor in the US in October 2013 and moved to Liberia with his wife and two children to work for Samaritan's Purse. His family was on leave in the US when he fell sick.

The current Ebola outbreak shows no signs of abating, with authorities across West Africa now on higher alert after a Liberian man carrying the illness flew unchecked from Monrovia to Lagos, Africa's most populous city, and died there. He was vomiting during the flight, raising concerns other passengers could have caught the illness.

Any surge in infections in Lagos could be impossible to contain. Travellers leaving airports in the main affected countries – Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia – were undergoing extra checks, but doctors have warned that symptoms can take time to show.

Relatives of the virus's victims in Sierra Leone are increasingly mistrustful of Western doctors' attempts to save their family members, and are resorting to traditional healers.

But that means that they are forcibly carrying their sick relatives from isolation wards back to their villages, significantly raising chances of further contagion.

More people have died now in Sierra Leone than in Guinea, where this outbreak of the virus was first identified in February. World health authorities have warned infections could continue for months.

British doctor at Ebola clinic in Sierra Leone says many locals believe outbreak is 'witchcraft not disease'

Ebola virus outbreak: live[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

A British doctor fighting the devastating Ebola outbreak in west Africa has told how belief in witchcraft is hampering the fight to stop the spread of the deadly disease.

Benjamin Black, 32, a volunteer with the charity Médecins Sans Frontières in Sierra Leone, said that some of those in infected areas were not seeking medical treatment as they thought the disease was the work of sorcerers. Belief in witchcraft and traditional medicine is still prevalent in parts of west Africa, particularly the remote rural areas of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia where the outbreak has been concentrated.

In an interview with The Telegraph, Dr Black, who completed a four-day stint earlier this week at an Ebola treatment clinic in Kailahun, near Sierra Leone’s northern border with Guinea, said: “There is a section of population here who simply don’t believe Ebola is real, they think it is witchcraft and so they don’t come to the treatment centres.

“Sometimes, even those who turn up at clinics with symptoms of the disease will be resistant to the idea that they have it. They will say 'yes, people in my family have died already, but this is witchcraft rather than Ebola’.”

Dr Black, who is from Manchester but currently works as an obstetrics & gynaecology registrar at north London’s Whittington Hospital, went to Sierra Leone back in June, where he originally expected to be working in maternity wards. He was seconded to an Ebola clinic in the wake of the spread of the epidemic, which is the largest of its kind in medical history.

More than 1,200 cases have so far been reported in the three affected nations, with 224 deaths in Sierra Leone, 129 in Liberia, and 319 in Guinea, where the outbreak is thought to have first begun. Among the fatalities in Sierra Leone has been Sheik Umar Khan, a doctor who was playing a leading part in the fight against the disease.

Avoiding a similar fate for themselves has been one of the main challenges for Dr Black and his colleagues in the 56-bed clinic at Kailahun, which lies in a densely-forested district that is at the centre of one of the worst outbreaks.

While treating patients, medics must wear an all-encompassing plastic yellow body suit, along with two face masks, two pairs of gloves, a plastic apron and medical scrubs. In Sierra Leone’s humid tropical heat – temperatures at this time of year are around 80F – those wearing the suits have to be careful not to pass out from the heat.

“The protective equipment is very hot to wear and incredibly claustrophobic – I once tried working in it in the heat of midday and could barely last 15 minutes,” said Dr Black. “Most of the time we try to start very early in the morning before the sun comes up, and even then the goggles eventually become misted over.”

After working, each medic disrobes in a special non-contaminated area, where each garment has to be sprayed with chlorine as it is removed. Outside of work, they also observe a strict “no touch” policy, whereby even handshakes are forbidden. “At first it’s a reflex to touch other people when you interact with them, but it soon becomes normal,” Dr Black said. “A lot of health workers have unfortunately contacted the illness already, and the risks are very high.”

The clinic, he said, operated a triage assessment system to work out which patients were confirmed as having the disease. Contrary to popular depictions, many Ebola sufferers do not seem particularly ill at first, complaining only of flu-like coughs or vomiting rather than the nose and eye-bleeds that characterise its later stages.

But doctors can go on certain warning signs, in particular patients saying that they have recently attended a funeral of a friend or relative. Local funeral customs often include the practice of touching and kissing loved ones’ bodies, which by that stage are a prime incubator of Ebola.

Dr Black added that many of those referred to the clinic were children, some of whom had already lost both their parents to the disease. “We had one ambulance turn up with a mother and a child in it, but the mother had died during the journey to the clinic, leaving her daughter of eight on her own,” he said.

Ebola has a fatality of around 90 per cent, but if treated early enough, patients can fight the disease off. While a number of patients passed away during Dr Black’s time at the clinic, every day there was usually “a couple” who pulled through and were discharged.

“There were many sad stories, but the discharges were amazing, emotional occasions, where the whole clinic, from the cleaning staff to the head of the mission, would come out and give big applause,” he said. “I can still feel goose pimples talking about it now. The problem is that often the kids are coming out as orphans, and they may face stigma when they get home because they’ve had Ebola, although we send outreach workers with them to spread the message that they are OK.”

Another problem, he added, was that the medics’ spaceman-like attire frightened locals. In neighbouring Guinea, some village chiefs have barred medics from entering, claiming that they are actually spreading the disease. Other teams of doctors have been threatened by mobs with machetes.

“Many patients who come to us are already very sick by the time they do so, and so often all people see at the clinic is a doctor sticking a needle in someone for a blood test and then them dying shortly afterwards,” said Dr Black.

“That becomes a conspiracy theory that we are actually injecting them with something that kills them. There is a huge amount of work that needs to be done in terms of education on all this, otherwise this epidemic is just going to continue.”

One plane ride away

Ebola is just "one plane ride away" from Western countries, health experts warned yesterday.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US said the outbreak highlighted the need for countries across the globe to increase health security.

Patrick Sawyer, 40, an American, was able to travel on two flights in West Africa despite showing symptoms of the deadly disease. He died in Lagos, Nigeria, but had been due to return to his home of Minnesota next month.

"It's true that anyone with an illness is just one plane ride away from coming to the US," said John O'Connor, a spokesman for the CDC. "But we have protections in place."

The charity Médecins Sans Frontières said there was no overarching strategy to tackle the outbreak and warned there was a "real risk" of new countries being infected.

Bart Janssens, MSF's director of operations, said: "This epidemic is unprecedented, absolutely out of control and the situation can only get worse, because it is still spreading, above all in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in some very important hot spots.

"If the situation does not improve fairly quickly, there is a real risk of new countries being affected."

Two African airlines – Arik and Asky – have grounded flights into infected areas, but British companies said they were planning to keep flying.

A spokesman for British Airways said: "The safety of our customers and crew is our first priority.

"We are complying with guidance provided by local health authorities and are continuing to monitor the situation closely. Currently our flights to the region are operating as normal."

Virgin also said it would not be stopping flights, but was monitoring the situation at international and local level.

"We always follow the advice of the World Health Organisation in such matters," said a spokesman.

Ebola: worst ever outbreak shuts Liberia borders

Liberia shuts border as Ebola spreads, but World Health Organisation and British authorities yet to recommend any screening or controls at airports

Liberia became the latest West African country to seal its borders on Monday after the worst ever outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10999981/Ebola-virus-outbreak-live.html], which has claimed 670 lives.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, where 129 deaths have been reported, announced that all borders were being shut except for major entry posts and the airport. Two US doctors there have contracted the disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not recommending any travel restrictions to prevent spread of infection.

International flights continue to depart from Liberia and other affected countries such as Guinea, where the outbreak began and 319 people have now died, and Sierra Leone, where there have been 224 victims so far.

Officials at airports in those three countries say they are checking for signs of fever in departing passengers. Sidie Yayah Tunis, a spokesman for Sierra Leone’s health ministry, said buckets of chlorine were on hand for disinfection purposes at the airport in Freetown.

International health experts say that such screening of passengers is difficult and ineffective, as in its early stages the disease shows similar signs to malaria, typhoid and other common illnesses – fever, muscle aches, weakness and vomiting. “We would have to consider any travel recommendations very carefully, but the best way to stop this outbreak is to put the necessary measures in place at the source of infection,” said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. Closing borders “might help but it won’t be exhaustive or foolproof”, he said.

The risk of travellers contracting Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10996915/Could-deadly-Ebola-virus-reach-Britain.html] is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. Ebola cannot be spread like flu, through casual contact or breathing in the same air, and patients are only contagious once the disease has progressed to the point where they show symptoms – by which stage they are often too sick to travel.

Yet in Nigeria, health officials are trying to trace anyone who may have come into contact with a Liberian man who died of Ebola after he travelled from his home country, via Togo, to Lagos, the most populous city in Africa.

Patrick Sawyer, an official in the Liberian ministry of finance, collapsed on arrival at Lagos on July 20 and died several days later. His sister had recently died from the disease. Mr Sawyer fell ill on the plane, reportedly vomiting, and health workers were concerned that the disease could have spread.

The hospital where Mr Sawyer died has been sealed off and shut for a week and staff who came into close contact with him have been isolated.

Jide Idris, the health commissioner for Lagos state, said: “The decontamination process in all the affected areas has commenced.”

There are currently no additional precautions at British airports, despite 117,000 Britons travelling to Nigeria each year.

Dr Brian McCloskey, the director of global health at Public Health England, said: “PHE’s assessment of the risk to the UK from Ebola has not currently changed, and remains low.

“However, in the light of the continuing outbreak, we will be meeting to review our existing assessment shortly.”

The most vulnerable people remain health care workers and relations who come into close contact with the sick.

Patrick Sawyer could have brought Ebola to US but died in Nigeria while en route to family in Minnesota

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Deadly foreign diseases are 'potential major threat' [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10998514/Ebola-outbreak-deadly-foreign-diseases-are-potential-major-threat-says-Chief-Scientist.html]

An Ebola victim who was allowed to board an international flight was an American citizen on his way home to the United States, it has emerged.

Patrick Sawyer worked for the Liberian government and was visiting his sister there when he developed symptoms while on a plane to Nigeria. He was quarantined on arrival in Lagos and died on Friday.

His wife, Decontee, 34, who like Mr Sawyer is originally from Liberia, currently at the heart of the terrifying Ebola outbreak, said he had been due to travel on to America where he could have become Patient Zero in a US epidemic.

The 40-year-old father-of-three is believed to have contracted the disease from his sister, whom he was caring for without knowing she had Ebola.

Mr Sawyer took two flights to get to Nigeria from Liberia, where he had attended his sister's funeral. The first took him from Monrovia to Lome in Togo, where he boarded a plane to Lagos. He collapsed at the airport on landing.

The Nigerian authorities have closed the hospital he was treated at, First Consultants Hospital in Obalende, one of the busiest parts of the city with a population of around 21 million.

Manifests of the passengers and crew who travelled on the same flights as Mr Sawyer have yet to be released

His job involved promoting trade in West Africa and he was on his way to a conference in Lagos from where he planned to travel back to the US when he fell ill with vomiting and diarrhea.

Fellow passengers on his plane were given warnings about the disease’s symptoms, which can include bleeding from the nose and mouth, but were allowed to continue on their journeys.

As Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days, there are fears that some may even now be spreading the disease still further.

Mrs Sawyer said her husband’s job involved long periods away from home, but that he had been planning to return home in time for two of his daughters’ birthdays next month.

"I have three daughters who will never get to know their father,” she told the Pioneer Press.

“I don't want any other families to go through this. Ebola has to stop. This can't happen anymore.

"Patrick was coming here. What if he still wasn't displaying symptoms yet and came? He could have brought Ebola here."

The couple, who lived in the town of Coon Rapids, Minnesota, married there in 2008. She came to America in 1991 while he moved over in the early 2000s, and both had become US citizens.

American Nancy Writebol is battling Ebola in Liberia while husband waits to learn if he has disease

The son of an American missionary who fell ill in Liberia while helping to battle the Ebola outbreak has said she is "fighting through it".

Nancy Writebol, who is originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, but has been in Liberia for a decade, came down with the disease last week after working in a unit which disinfected doctors and nurses treating victims of the Ebola epidemic.

Her husband, David, is also in Liberia and is being tested every six hours to see if he has the disease. Due to Ebola's long incubation period, he may not known for some time if he is in the clear.

The couple's son, Jeremy, said that Mrs Writebol was in isolation, and her husband is able to see her through a window but is not allowed direct contact with her.

He told NBC's Today programme: "She's stable. As dad put it, she's fighting through it, and continuing to express a few symptoms, but she's able to move around on her own, and they're getting lots of fluids into her. She's working real hard to get through this."

The Writebols were working with the charity Serving in Mission, which has a hospital in Liberia now dedicated to treating Ebola patients.

Referring to his father, the younger Mr Writebol said: "We're concerned, but he's been very healthy right now.

"As I talked with him last night, he was feeling fine, working hard, and so we just continue to hope and trust for the best in his case and situation.

Everything's been fine, and he's strong and healthy right now."

Mr Writebol asked his son to pass on a message to those concerned about him and his wife, saying: "We are privileged to be here at this time serving the people of Liberia."

An American doctor at the hospital, Kent Brantly, 33, a father-of-two from Texas, is also fighting for his life against the virus. His condition is said to have worsened and he can no longer get out of bed.

His mother Jan told the Today programme: "We will continue to focus on praying for Kent."

Government's chief scientist warns that Britain is increasingly at risk from foreign diseases as doctors told to watch for spread of outbreak

DEADLY diseases such as Ebola are a "potentially major threat" to Britain, the Government's chief scientist has warned, as public health officials urged doctors to watch for signs that the virus has spread to the UK.

The disease, which can be fatal for up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has killed more than 670 people in an outbreak across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Public Health England issued an urgent warning to doctors to watch for signs of the lethal disease after an infected man was allowed to travel through an international hub. Officials said the virus was "clearly not under control".

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph Sir Mark Walport, the Government's chief scientific adviser, said the increasingly "interconnected" world was placing Britons at risk.

"The UK is fortunate in its geographical position. We're an island," he said. "But we are living in a completely interconnected world where disruptions in countries far away will have major impacts.

"The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species. They are a potential major threat to us. Emerging infectious disease is a global grand challenge.

"We were lucky with Sars. But we have to do the best horizon scanning. We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.

"The Government is keeping a close eye on the Ebola outbreak and they will be prepared."

Ebola has never been reported in the UK and the risk of travellers in west Africa contracting the disease was "very low", Sir Mark said. However the death of an American, Patrick Sawer, in Lagos, Nigeria, has led to fears that the virus could spread beyond Africa.

Mr Sawyer, 40, had travelled from his home of Minnesota to attend the funeral of his sister, who died from Ebola.

It is unclear how he was allowed to board multiple international flights after he had started presenting symptoms. Despite vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, the employee in the Liberian finance ministry was able to fly from Liberia, via Ghana, and Togo, before arriving in Nigeria, where he died.

Experts say he could have passed on the disease to anyone sitting near him or who used the same lavatory on one of the planes. They are now trying to trace fellow passengers.

Yesterday Asky Airlines, which Mr Sawyer used for his flights, said it was suspending flights to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. The World Health Organisation is considering closing the borders to infected countries.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, said the Ebola outbreak was being closely monitored.

"It is the largest outbreak of this disease to date, and it's clear it is not under control, " said Dr McCloskey. "We have alerted UK medical practitioners about the situation in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area."

The government agency is reviewing its advice to decide whether to raise the risk level. The closest the disease has come to Britain was in the Nineties when a veterinarian travelled to Switzerland while infected. The disease was caught early by doctors and she was treated before she passed on the virus.

Ebola: Germany accepts infected patient for treatment

As medical services across Europe are on high alert to prevent any risk of Ebola spreading here, a hospital in Germany accepts a patient with the virus

With medical services across Europe on high alert to prevent any risk of the Ebola virus spreading here, a hospital in Germany has agreed to accept an infected patient for treatment.

More than 670 people have died so far in West Africa, as doctors struggle to contain the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history.

The country of Liberia has closed most of its borders to prevent the spread of the disease.

But, amid speculation their patient may be one of the world’s leading Ebola experts, doctors in Germany insist there is no risk of the infection spreading from him.

He will be kept in a special isolation ward behind three separate air locks. The air inside the ward will be kept at lower pressure than outside, so none can escape – even though it is not believed Ebola can be transmitted by air.

Doctors and nurses will wear complete protective bodysuits with their own oxygen supplies whenever in contact with him. The suits will be replaced and burned every three hours.

The extreme precautions are an indication of how feared the Ebola virus is. The disease is spread by direct contact of blood or bodily fluids, including sweat and saliva. It causes massive internal bleeding, and is deadly in up to 90 per cent of cases.

German doctors agreed to accept the patient after a special request from the World Health Organisation (WHO), but it is not certain he will be able to come to Germany, amid reports he may be too sick to travel.

The patient has not been named, but the confirmation he is a Sierra Leonean national has fuelled speculation he may be Sheikh Umar Khan, one of Africa’s leading ebola experts, who was infected last week.

Dr Khan is one of a number of medics battling the outbreak in West Africa who have themselves become infected.

Samuel Brisbane, one of Liberia’s most famous doctors, died a few days ago after contracting the disease while treating patients.

Kent Brantly, an American doctor, and Nancy Writebol, an American paramedic, are in serious condition after becoming infected while working at a mission hospital in Liberia.

Doctors working with Ebola patients are at high risk of infection, and both Dr Brisbane and Dr Khan are regarded as heroes in Africa for their work with those infected with the disease.

The latest outbreak began in Guinea in February, before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Last week the first case was reported in Nigeria, and there are fears it may have spread to the city of Lagos, home to some 21 million people.

As the worst outbreak of Ebola claims the lives of nearly 700 people, what is actually being done to contain the deadly virus?

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

What is Africa doing?

* Liberian and Nigerian airports and seaports began screening international arrivals for Ebola symptoms, however these can take up to 21 days to appear

* Pan-African airline ASKY has suspended all flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone over the worsening health crisis

* The Liberian Football Association has decided "to cease operations of football activities considering that football matches are contact sports and Ebola is spread through body contacts with an infected person”

* The finance ministry in Liberia, where 127 people have died of the disease, said it had placed several senior officials under observation for three weeks after a top ministry official died from the virus

What is the world doing?

* The International Civil Aviation Organisation have said they need to “act quickly” to stop the spread, and may soon introduce new flight restrictions aimed at containing outbreaks,

* In the US, airline workers are being trained to spot symptoms, and quarantine officers at 20 major US airports, including New York City’s JFK, are ready to respond to an in-flight illness. The Centre for Disease Control has also deployed teams to West Africa to help contain the outbreak on the ground

* The UK's international airport staff were also being briefed on what they need to do if they suspect a passenger to be carrying Ebola.

And in the last couple of weeks Public Health England has used its national medical alert system to advise all UK doctors to "remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area"

As the deadly virus claims its first victim in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country which has close links with the UK, experts warn British doctors to look for the signs

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

Ebola has killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since it was first diagnosed in February and more than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus.

On Friday, a Liberian man who had travelled to the Nigerian capital Lagos died for the disease, heightening concerns international air travel could speed up its spread.

The Government’s Public Health England on Monday sent letters to British doctors telling them to watch for anyone with strange illnesses who have recently travelled in West Africa.

Cambridge University’s Dr Peter Walsh, a lecturer in archaeology and anthropology and Ebola expert, said: “It’s possible someone infected will fly to Heathrow having infected other people sitting next to them or by using the toilet.

“This strain of Ebola is probably the second most deadly virus in the world after canine rabies. If you get canine rabies, you’re going to die, but we also have vaccines for that.

“This is worse than anthrax, but there are vaccines and treatments for anthrax, too.”

The fatality rate of the current outbreak is around 60 percent although the disease, which can go unnoticed for three weeks, can kill up to 90 percent of those who catch it.

Derek Gatherer, a virologist at Britain's University of Lancaster, said anyone on the plane near Sawyer could be in "pretty serious danger," but that Nigeria was at least better placed to tackle the outbreak than its neighbours.

"Nigerians have deep pockets and they can do as much as any Western country could do if they have the motivation and organisation to get it done," he said.

Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.

Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told the Daily Mail: “If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern.

“Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.”

The last diagnosed case of Ebola in the UK dates back to 1979, when someone was accidentally infected in a laboratory, but survived.

The body deals with potential outbreaks and Dr Brian McCloskey, Public Health England’s director of global health, said: “There is the recognition this is a problem that is not under control… At the moment its preparatory thinking rather than alarm.”

World Aviation Agency says they have to act quickly to guard against the spread of the deadly disease

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

The deadly Ebola virus hitchhiking across borders for the first time aboard a pan-African airline could spell new flight restrictions aimed at containing outbreaks, the world aviation agency has said.

International Civil Aviation Organisation Secretary General Raymond Benjamin said: "Until now (the virus) had not impacted commercial aviation, but now we're affected."

Earlier, Togo-based airline ASKY announced the suspension of flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, both hit by an outbreak of Ebola virus.

This followed the death of one of its passengers from the virus on Friday after the 40-year-old man had traveled from Liberia to Nigeria via the Togolese capital Lome.

"We will have to act quickly," Mr Benjamin said. "We will consult with the WHO (World Health Organisation) to see what types of measures should be put in place" to guard against spreading the disease.

No date, however, has been set for an emergency meeting of both WHO and ICAO officials to discuss possible new protocols.

A Canadian doctor has also put himself in quarantine as a precaution after spending weeks in West Africa treating patients with the deadly Ebola virus alongside an American doctor who is now infected, local media said Tuesday.

Azaria Marthyman of Victoria, British Columbia had worked in Liberia, one of four countries hit by an outbreak, with the Christian relief organization Samaritan's Purse.

He has not tested positive for the virus, nor shown any symptoms since returning to Canada on Saturday, but one of his American colleagues, doctor Kent Brantly, is being treated for the disease.

"Azaria is symptom-free right now and there is no chance of being contagious with Ebola if you are not exhibiting symptoms," Melissa Strickland, a spokesperson for Samaritan's Purse, told broadcaster CTV.

Since March, there have been 1,201 cases of Ebola and 672 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ebola virus: what is happening in West Africa today may be relevant in London tomorrow

In a world made so much smaller by the ease and speed of travel, we have to get better at dealing with outbreaks of infectious diseases

Ebola represents a huge challenge that must not be underestimated. The current outbreak in West Africa is the worst seen since the virus was first identified in 1976. From the spread of countries affected to the number of those who have lost their lives, this worrying situation is compounded by the movement of people and the infrastructure and capacity of the health care systems in the regions affected. As the disease tightens its grip, it surely threatens the resolve of those on the ground, who are doing all they can despite incredibly difficult circumstances.

Information is hard to come by and rumours abound, and there are a surprising number of basic elements that we still do not understand. For example, we know little about the characteristics of this virus infection and the clinical response in humans – despite the large number of deaths, the mortality rate during this outbreak has so far been lower than might be expected for the strain of the virus we believe is responsible. Does this mean there is more to this virus than we know? Or perhaps there are differences in the human physiological response that we don’t yet appreciate or in the clinical care of the patients.

It is easy to think of Ebola as an outlier, a rare and exotic disease that is particularly hard to learn about due to the sporadic nature of its outbreaks. Yet there is much we could and should learn from this, and quickly. Even if Ebola does not reach our shores, other emerging infectious diseases or drug resistant pathogens will and this must be addressed in an equitable and globally responsible way. These issues affect all of us. Indeed Sars, avian and swine flu outbreaks have already had an impact much closer to home, and while we are much better at the surveillance of such outbreaks we are still not tackling them – or learning from them – fast enough.

In a world made so much smaller by the ease and speed of travel, what is happening in Lagos or Shanghai today may be relevant in London tomorrow, and vice versa. This means we have to get much better at dealing with outbreaks if we are to be truly prepared for the global damage they may bring. We need to work with at-risk communities and national governments to discuss potential new treatments and how they might work within ethical, logistical and assessment frameworks, and we need them to be ready to go within days. We also have to work out how to ethically and practically undertake the essential clinical research in an emergency that is critical to save lives and reduce disease transmission. This needs extensive preparation in the period between epidemics, full engagement with all countries, particularly those most at risk of epidemics, and full consideration of the ethical and health frameworks involved. It is a huge undertaking, complex and challenging in many ways. But our ability to control this and future outbreaks may depend on it.

Two people in the UK went to hospital over fears they had symptoms of Ebola as experts warn the interconnected nature of the world means the deadly disease could be a threat in Britain

Ebola virus outbreak: live [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

A man has been tested for Ebola in Birmingham and another has visited a UK hospital over fears he was showing symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus.

The checks come after the Government’s chief scientist warned that deadly diseases such as Ebola are a “potentially major threat” to Britain following the death of an American man who was able to travel through an international hub.

A man, who had travelled from Benin in Nigeria via Paris to the Midlands was taken to hospital in Birmingham on Monday after he said he felt feverish.

A spokesman said: “A patient returning from West Africa underwent routine tests at Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital and tested negative for Ebola and similar imported conditions.”

He was given the all clear, as was a second man in his twenties who went to Charing Cross Hospital in London this week, the Sun reported. His symptoms were confirmed as not being linked to the bug and doctors ruled out the need for an Ebola test.

The Department for Health confirmed the Birmingham incident. A spokesman added: “We’re well prepared to identifyand deal with any potential cases, though there has never been a case in this country.”

The disease, which can be fatal for up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has already killed almost 700 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Doctors in Britain have been put on alert to watch out for signs of the disease as officials said the disease was “clearly not under control.”

However Professor Jeremy Farrar said we are “not in grave danger of a global epidemic.”

“What we are in danger of is this spreading much further across Africa,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“I don’t think closing borders and restricting travel will have much of an impact.”

Prof Farrar said he would not avoid travelling to the infected countries in Africa but said he felt there needed to be more education about the disease so people in these countries had the confidence to come forward if they had symptoms.

“I hope that at some point in the future we will have vaccines and drugs but these will not be available in the very near future.

“In the short term it will be about infection control.”

Sir Mark Walport, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, has told the Telegraph that the increasingly ‘interconnected’ world was placing Britons at risk.

Sheik Umar Jhan, the doctor leading Sierra Leone’s fight against the virus died of Ebola on Tuesday.

Two American health workers - a doctor and a missionary - are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non-essential personnel from the country.

Patrick Sawyer, an American, travelled from his home of Minnesota to attend the funeral of his sister who died from Ebola. He was able to board multiple flights despite vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, arriving in Nigeria where he died.

The major regional airline ASKY has suspended flights to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and Freetown in Sierra Leone.

No cases of Ebola have ever been reported in the UK and the risk of visitors to West Africa catching it is very low, said Sir Mark.

The closest the disease has come to Britain was in the 1990s when a veterinarian travelled to Switzerland while infected. The disease was caught early by doctors and she was treated before she passed on the virus.

Dr Brian McCloskey, global health director at Public Health England, said the current outbreak was the largest to date.

It started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, forest antelope and porcupines.

The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission.

Symptoms begin with fever, muscle pain and a sore throat, then rapidly escalate to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period can be up to 21 days.

We explain the symptoms of Ebola, which so far this year has killed more than 600 people - the most deadly outbreak in history

Since February, 670 people have been killed by the most deadly outbreak of Ebola in history. That amounts to around half of total number of people who have died from the disease since the discovery of the disease in 1976.

Symptoms of the disease can start to show from two days after infection, but this can take up to 21 days. People are contagious for as long as their blood and other bodily fluids contain Ebola.

For the most part, early symptoms are similar to diseases like malaria and cholera, as well as the flu, which can mean the disease can be difficult to detect.

Here is a list of the common symptoms of Ebola:

• Fever

• Headache

• Weakness

• Cramps

• Aching in the muscles and joints

• Diarrhoea

• Vomiting

• Stomach pain

• Sore throat

As the disease progresses, additional symptoms may include:

• Rash

• Internal and external bleeding from the nose, mouth, ears and eyes

• Reduced liver and kidney function

• Trouble breathing

• Bruising

People who believe they could have been infected with Ebola must be isolated from the public immediately.

The Royal Air Force’s Infection Prevention Control Team is likely to be placed on standby to collect UK citizens and return them to Britain in quarantine conditions if they are infected with Ebola

Ebola virus outbreak: live[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/10999981]

The Royal Air Force could be called in to bring back UK citizens infected with the deadly Ebola disease from West Africa.

David Cameron has said that Ebola outbreak is a ‘very serious threat’ to the UK and the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, is preparing to chair an emergency meeting today on how to tighten Britain’s defences against the virus.

Major Thomas Fletcher, of the Royal Army Medical Corps said it was likely the meeting would discuss putting the military on alert to ‘repatriate’ Britons infected with the disease.

The Royal Air Force’s Infection Prevention Control Team is likely to be placed on standby to collect UK citizens and return them to Britain in quarantine conditions.

The ‘Deployable Air Transportable Isolator Team’ is made up of military doctors and specialists from the London Royal Free Hospital.

The team was last deployed in 2012 and has been used five times over-all for the repatriation of 3 suspected cases of Lassa fever, 1 suspected case of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and 1 case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Major Fletcher, a consultant on infectious diseases who has been seconded to the World Health Organisation to help with the outbreak, said: “The UK has a close relationship with West Africa and there will be British citizens in those countries.

“The COBRA meeting is probably discussing the possibility of the Royal Air Force offering assistance to UK nationals aboard who may become infected and who need to be repatriated.

“There is no doubt about it that this outbreak is going to last for many months so it is a big deal. It is the largest and most complicated outbreak we have ever seen and it is clearly not under control yet.

“With the advent of global travel there is increasing risk of importing Ebola into the UK.

“The main risk is of contact with an Ebola sufferer who has the disease but hasn’t begun to show symptoms. There is also a risk from healthcare workers coming back.

“That is why the passenger who died in Nigeria is clearly a concern as it is highly likely he was infectious during the flights he took and potentially there are people out there who are also now infected. “

The disease, which can be fatal for up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has now killed more than 670 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Public Health England has issued an urgent warning to British doctors to watch for signs of the lethal disease after an infected man was allowed to travel through an international hub. They said the virus was ‘clearly not under control.’

The government’s Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Mark Walport has said that the increasingly ‘interconnected’ world was placing Britons at risk.

Another health expert has warned could spread to Britain in the same way that AIDS did in the 1980s, a health expert has warned.

Dr Derek Gatherer, a specialist in the evolution of viruses from Lancaster University, warned that the virus was as easy to catch as flu and passengers on flights from infected areas risked catching the deadly disease.

American Patrick Sawyer died in Lagos, Nigeria, after being allowed on several flights despite showing symptoms of the disease.

The airline he flew with his attempting to contact dozens of passengers who came into contact with Mr Sawyer over fears they may also be infected.

Dr Gatherer said that those passengers could be ‘anywhere else in the world now.’

“Aids spread from Central Africa to the western world in the 1980s - Ebola could do the same,” he said.

"Anyone on the same plane could have become infected because Ebola is easy to catch. It can be passed on through vomiting, diarrhoea or even from simply saliva or sweat - as well as being sexually transmitted.

"That is why there is such alarm over Mr Sawyer because he became ill on the flight so anyone else sharing the plane could have been infected by his vomit or other bodily fluids.

"Only about 10 per cent recover. The outlook is pretty bleak. They will need to trace everyone on the passenger list and isolate them as a precaution.

"I believe they have contacted about half so far but the others could be anywhere else in the world now.”

Two Britons have already been tested for the disease in London and Birmingham after reporting symptoms, but neither had the disease.

Mr Hammond said no British national so far had been affected by the outbreak, and there had been no cases in the UK but he would be chairing the Government's Cobra emergencies committee later today to assess the situation.

"As far as we are aware, there are no British nationals so far affected by this outbreak and certainly no cases in the UK. However the Prime Minister does regard it as a very serious threat and I will be chairing a Cobra meeting later today to assess the situation and look at any measures that we need to take either in the UK, or in our diplomatic posts abroad in order to manage the threat," he told Sky News.

"We are very much focused on it as a new and emerging threat which we need to deal with."

Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks - in Nzara, Sudan; and in Yambuku, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.

It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines.

The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission.

Symptoms begin with fever, muscle pain and a sore throat, then rapidly escalate to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period can be up to 21 days.

Dr Sheikh Umar Khan, one of Africa's most famous doctors and a national hero in Sierra Leone, dies from Ebola

One of Africa's most famous doctors, and a leading expert in the fight against Ebola, has become the latest to die in the current outbreak of the disease.

Dr Sheikh Umar Khan was regarded as a national hero in Sierra Leone for his work with Ebola patients. Officials confirmed he has died after contracting the disease while treating patients last week.

Dr Khan is the second famous African doctor to die of Ebola within a few days in what is the deadliest outbreak of the disease in history.

At the weekend it was confirmed that Dr Samuel Brisbane, the leading Ebola expert in neighbouring Liberia, had succumbed to the virus.

More than 670 people have died of the Ebola outbreak so far in West Africa, and medical services around the world are on high alert amid fears it may spread.

Two American medics are in serious condition after contracting the virus while treating patients in Liberia.

"I am afraid for my life, I must say, because I cherish my life," Dr Khan told reporters in June, before he contracted the disease.

It is not clear exactly how Dr Khan became infected, but health workers are at particular risk from Ebola, because it is spread by contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids, including sweat and saliva.

"Even with the full protective clothing you put on, you are at risk," Dr Khan said.

There has been wide speculation in Germany that Dr Khan was the unnamed patient a Hamburg hospital had agreed to treat after an urgent request from the World Health Organisation (WHO), despite fears of the spread of the disease.

German doctors refused to confirm the identity of their proposed patient.

Ebola is one of the world's most feared diseases. It causes massive internal bleeding, and is fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases.

The American widow of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian government official who died after contracting Ebola says she fears that there could be an outbreak of the virus in the US

Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old consultant for Liberia's Finance Ministry collapsed July 20[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10998222/Ebola-outbreak-Victim-who-sparked-fears-of-global-epidemic-was-on-way-home-to-US.html] in Lagos, Nigeria after flying there from Liberia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/] . He had been working in Liberia since 2008.

Sawyer had been put in isolation in a hospital in Nigeria and died on Friday. His was the first recorded case in Nigeria of the disease.

His wife Decontee Sawyer, speaking from her home in Coon Rapids, in the US state of Minnesota, said her husband had planned to come home for two of his three daughters' birthdays next month.

She had learned that her husband caught the disease from his sister, who fell ill and died of Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10999981/Ebola-virus-outbreak-live.html] . He did not know at the time that she had Ebola, Sawyer said, as the virus shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria.

More than 670 people have died[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10996915/Could-deadly-Ebola-virus-reach-Britain.html] during the recent outbreak in West Africa.

Ms Sawyer said: "We ought to be concerned about that. If we're not, we're kidding ourselves. If we think that it can't come to the US and that's another fear of mine. Because we've already lost Patrick and we're losing tons of people there. And we don't need that killer to come here as well."

No cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the US, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday it posed little risk to the general US population, but it is causing some to cancel travel plans and stirring fear in Minnesota, which has the largest Liberian immigrant population in America.

THE CURSE OF EBOLA

Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone are facing the worst ever outbreak of the disease, for which there is no cure and no vaccine. But deadly as the virus is, it is also easily destroyed, says Tom Chivers

In a hospital somewhere in a rural part of sub–Saharan Africa, a patient presents with an unknown disease. That sounds more dramatic than it would appear on the ground – the patient has a fever, perhaps a headache, perhaps nausea, symptoms that could mean anything. Most of the time it will be one of the waterborne diseases that are rife in these poverty–stricken places. But in this case, it is something else.

Ebola is a frightening disease that can kill as many as nine out of every 10 people infected. It is painful and horrible; it kills by making its victims bleed to death internally. There is no cure or vaccine. And right now, in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, it is killing people – 670 at least, at the time of writing, have died. More than 1,000 people have been infected in this outbreak, making it the world's worst ever: there have been only around 2,300 deaths in all the previous outbreaks.

Most of the time, the disease sits pretty harmlessly in fruit bat populations. But every so often, says Prof John Oxford, a virologist at the University of London, it makes an unlikely leap into humans. "Perhaps someone eats bush meat, or comes into contact with bats. But then the virus makes it into a human body, and that human is pretty unlucky.

"After about a week, you get a huge frontal headache, a high temperature, maybe a rash. Then a few days later you get nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea – and then bleeding, from the eyes, from the mouth, from the backside." And from there, if you are left untreated, you will probably die.

For the men and women on the front line, the key is identifying the disease as early as possible. By the time an outbreak has been noticed, your best chance of containing it has long gone, says Prof Paul Hunter, a specialist in health protection at the University of East Anglia, who has dealt with outbreaks of infectious diseases in Congo and Sudan. Most doctors in Sierra Leone don't have equipment to do blood tests or other diagnostic procedures that would be straightforward in Western hospitals. "The early symptoms are generic, so your judgment on whether the case in front of you is something dangerous depends on what's going on in the region – if there's been an outbreak of typhus, for instance."

What that means, though, is that in those early, crucial days of an outbreak, things are much more difficult. Later on, Ebola is, in a gruesome way, easier to manage than some other diseases – the fact that it is a haemorrhagic fever, that it has this terrible but distinctive bleeding in its late stages, means that by the time the patient is dead, you probably know the cause. With other diseases, says Hunter, you could still be guessing.

But once doctors know what they are dealing with, the question is how to stop it from spreading. And in one sense, we're lucky – as frightening and unpleasant as Ebola is, it is not, actually, very infectious. "It doesn't spread very easily – it's not an airborne virus. You need to get close to fluids, such as blood or vomit," Oxford says. This means its "reproductive number" – how many people are infected, on average, by each carrier – is very low: about one, compared to 12 for measles. What's more, it's not very hardy. "We know it as a filovirus – not a typical virus, which looks like a kind of tiny football, but this extraordinary–looking thread, like a piece of cotton." Simply washing one's hands destroys the long, fragile virus.

The trouble is that Ebola, as mentioned, is both hard to diagnose in its early stages, and frightening. "It's not easy to tell that you've got Ebola. If you present at a hospital in west Africa with vomiting, you'll probably be diagnosed as having cholera," says Oxford. "So nurses and doctors won't take appropriate precautions and will become infected." And once a case has been detected, it terrifies people. "A lot of hospital staff abscond when the diagnosis is made," Hunter says. "And lots of people who were on the plane with the first man who died in Nigeria have absconded, because they didn't want to be quarantined."

Local practices in the affected regions do not help to slow the disease. The Ebola virus can survive for several days outside the body, and in much of west Africa it is common at funerals to touch the skin of the deceased. In a haemorraghic fever victim, that means the skin will be covered with the still infectious virus that killed them. "If you touch the person's face or something, and then touch your eyes or mouth without first having washed your hands, you could be infected," Oxford says.

He is keen that the World Health Organisation and other groups work with local religious leaders and faith healers – "it might be odd, a professor of virology saying that, but they are the ones people trust". The trust in Western medicine, sadly, is lacking. "When I was in east Africa, all sorts of rumours were flying around when we tried to get blood samples – it's a Western plot to give us HIV/Aids, that sort of thing," Hunter says. He refers to a terrible case in 2008, when French aid workers took babies out of Chad. "That played very badly – people said, you have to be careful with white people, they want to steal your babies."

Dr Tim Jagatic is a Canadian doctor with Médecins Sans Frontières, who has just come back to Europe after facing the outbreak in Sierra Leone. "The 'hospital' is a group of tents in a clearing in the jungle, away from the population to reduce the risk," he says. "It's a low–resource setting, just doing basic medicine: hydration, nutrition, fever control, promoting hygiene." But even with such limited tools, his team has brought the death rate of patients down from around 90 per cent to below 60 per cent, at some risk to themselves ("There is a sense of – not fear, but precaution. If you don't pay attention, you do put yourself at risk"). And, equally importantly, he is addressing the two problems of poor disease control and the lack of trust. "What we're doing is gaining trust, dispelling rumours – showing that we're not here to steal organs or take blood, we're providing food, providing medicine." And they're promoting the basic hygiene that will stop the next outbreak: "They go away knowing to wash their hands, and they tell their families."

All three men agree that the risk of the disease making it to Britain is slim, and if it does, the methods of hygiene applied in Western hospitals would ensure that it didn't spread far. But the thought of the disease in Europe or America is instructive. "If there was a disease in the UK with a similar mortality rate and risk of spread, potential new treatments would be made available," says Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and the head of the medical charity the Wellcome Trust.

He has pointed out in the past that the response to Ebola is essentially the same now as it was when it was first noticed in 1976 in Zaire and Sudan: a response he calls "shut you away and bury you nicely". The sporadic nature of the disease and the fact that it survives in bats between outbreaks makes it harder to come up with vaccines and cures, but the fact that it is exclusively a disease of sub–Saharan Africa means that the urge even to try has been disgracefully lacking in the West. There is still much to learn about the disease: for example, Farrar points out, the mortality rate of this outbreak, though still high, is lower than we normally expect, and we don't know why. (The lower mortality rate may be the reason this year's outbreak has spread so widely and rapidly: normally Ebola kills its victims too quickly for it to spread to many people.) In general, the way the virus behaves in the human body is poorly understood.

Perhaps that will change in the future. But for now, Oxford says, "it's all about calming people down". The current outbreak will die out relatively soon, he says, because the various governments have started to take steps – quarantining, improved hygiene, altered funeral practices – that will break the chain of infection. And, as unexciting as it sounds, the way the disease will be defeated will probably not be marvellous medical breakthroughs, but getting more people to wash their hands.

Ebola virus: Meet the women who have survived the deadly disease

The Ebola virus kills indiscriminately, but women in West Africa are particularly badly affected. Sandra Smiley meets some of the lucky ones who have beaten the odds to survive

Fear and misinformation

Largest outbreak

Loss and stigma, the survivor’s burden

Spreading the word

Most of us have mopped the brows of our spouses, children or family members when they are sick. But what if those kind gestures could lead to serious illness, or even death?

For many women in West Africa, that’s a very real threat.

Over the past six months, the Ebola virus[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/10995322/at-is-the-Ebola-virus-and-how-worried-should-we-be.html] has swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The disease is difficult to identify, as its first symptoms – vomiting, fever, body aches and diarrhoea – look like those of other common illnesses. It can cause internal bleeding in its advanced stages and can kill up to 90 per cent of its victims. There is no vaccine or cure.

Ebola kills indiscriminately, but women are particularly badly affected. Because it is transmitted through bodily fluids, it spreads easily to people caring for the sick. In West Africa, it is generally women that prepare dead bodies for funeral and look after ailing members of their communities.

Mbalya is one of those women. In her village in Guinea she was a healer, treating the sick with traditional remedies. “I got the virus through a patient,” she says. “At that time, nobody knew about Ebola.” She received treatment at a Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) facility in Guinea’s capital city, Conakry. Despite her old age and frail state, she recovered.

</br>In a country like Guinea, where more than half the population lives below the national poverty line, it is hard to contain a disease this contagious. Even before this outbreak – the first ever reported in this region – the health system was struggling. Last year the maternal mortality ratio was 650 deaths per 100,000 live births – more than 80 times greater than in the UK.

And a climate of fear, mixed with a poor understanding of the virus, has created optimal conditions for its spread in West Africa. People do not necessarily recognise the signs and symptoms and attempt to treat it by other means. They do not take precautions to avoid exposing themselves to the disease, and when it strikes, fail to report it.

“Progress is being made in terms of reaching communities, but there are still many that remain in denial; where they still believe the outbreak is a government plot, or that we are there to steal bodily organs,” says Katherine Mueller, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

“In communities where people believe Ebola is real, they refrain from touching [a sick person] and call the authorities. Where they don’t, that phone call is never made and the person becomes sicker and dies. The community then continues with the traditional burial which includes handling the body and results in a high risk of transmission.”

</br>Meanwhile, the number of victims continues to rise: the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that Ebola has killed an unprecedented 672 people since the outbreak began in March.

“Every day we would hear about the numbers of cases going up and up. That makes you feel quite powerless,” says Dr Hannah Spencer, a MSF medic from Surrey who recently worked in Liberia. To bring the outbreak under control, she says, more resources must go to treating patients, tracing contacts and, crucially, educating people about the disease.

“One day four feverish children arrived in an ambulance with their mother and an aunt. They all lived in the same house where two people had already died of the disease. The mother refused to let the children out of the ambulance. She didn’t believe they had Ebola, or that their family members had died from it – she was convinced they had been poisoned.”

</br>When Ebola is identified and treated early, patients have a better chance of survival. People do beat the odds and recover from the disease, but for survivors its after-effects can be hard to bear. Ebola can kill many members of a single family, leaving survivors to carry on alone. And though a person may recover from the virus, they continue to live with the stigma.

Mariam (not her real name), 24, from Conakry, Guinea, contracted Ebola from her cousin. He died, along with his partner, child and Mariam’s adoptive father. When she fell ill, her fiancé broke off their engagement. She was sacked from her job as a secondary school teacher. She does not want to show her face or share her real name with me for this piece, because of the stigma associated with Ebola.

“There were at least two weeks where I didn’t go out at all,” she says. “At a certain point, I thought, if people are going to avoid me, I’m going to avoid them too. I reasoned that if I tried to get close to someone and they pushed me away, that’d really hurt,” she explains.

“Word spread that I was dead. When I rang up a friend of mine, he said, ‘You’re not Mariam. She’s passed away. Stop pretending to be her. Why don’t you let her rest in peace?’”

</br>Though Mariam is in good health again, her outlook is bittersweet. She has lost a lot, but has gained something as well: a new role as a health promoter. She now works with victims of Ebola and their families to come to grips with the disease.

“Things will never be as they were before,” she says. “But I feel fine in my new life. It’s because of ignorance and a lack of information that my family suffered such a loss. If I can save other families from the same, I feel proud to be doing it.”

As for Mbalya, following her ordeal, if she sees a patient with Ebola-like symptoms she will know just what to do. “I’ll show them where I was treated,” she says. “I’ll tell them that when you come here to the health centre, they don’t kill you. They take care of you and give you what you need so that you can come out of this alive.”

Medical professionals seek individuals who may have come into contact with Patrick Sawyer when he travelled by plane before his death

Medical professionals are trying to trace an unknown number of passengers and flight attendants who may have come into contact with an American citizen who died of ebola.

No new cases have been recorded, but fears mount about the spread of the disease after fellow passengers from the two flights he took travelled on to other cities in Nigeria.

Patrick Sawyer, a consultant to the Liberian finance ministry, flew between Liberia and Nigeria while he was contagious last week.

He died five days after arriving in Lagos, where he had been quarantined.

Nigerian authorities have so far identified 59 people who came into contact with Sawyer, and 20 of them have been tested for ebola.

Authorities are relying on “contact tracing” whereby medical professionals monitor anyone who came into contact with Mr Sawyer, as well as anyone they may have subsequently had contact with.

Health experts claim the risk of people contracting ebola, which can cause people to bleed from the eyes, mouth and ears, by air travel, is low, since the disease requires direct contact with bodily fluids such as urine, blood or saliva.

Ebola cannot be spread through casual contact or breathing in the same air, for example.

Experts say the disease can also be contracted from traces of faeces or vomit.

On his second flight on his way to Nigeria, witnesses claim Sawyer was vomiting and had diarrhoea. Around 50 other passengers were on this flight and could have been exposed to the disease after using the same lavatory as Mr Sawyer.

The incident has now prompted questions over why Mr Sawyer was allowed to fly.

Dr David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The best thing would be if people did not travel when they were sick, but the problem is people won’t say when they’re sick. They will lie in order to travel.”

One of Liberia’s top medical professionals died from the disease on Sunday, while an American aid worker is in “grave” condition after he was infected.

Since the outbreak of the disease in February, 670 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have died from Ebola.

Over the weekend, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said a new policy on inspecting and testing all outgoing and incoming passengers will be strictly observed.

She announced some borders were being closed and communities with large numbers of Ebola cases would be quarantined.

Dr Heymann said: "The chance to stop it quickly was months ago before it crossed borders but this can still be stopped.

“The important thing is for countries to be prepared when they get patients infected with Ebola, that they are isolated, family members are told what to do and health workers take the right steps."

One of Germany's top universities has been accused of "abandoning" the national language after it announced plans to teach all master's degrees in English. Munich Technical University (TUM) said the move would help graduates to compete in global business. But Johannes Singhammer, an MP, said the plan risked giving the impression that German "was ready to be discarded on the scrap-heap".

NIGERIA said yesterday that Ebola virus caused the death of a Liberian man in quarantine in Lagos, confirming that the worst–ever outbreak of the disease has reached Africa's most populated country.

Nigeria's health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said "thorough medical tests" had confirmed that Ebola virus had caused the man's death.

The 40–year–old, who worked for the Liberian government, had flown to Nigeria via Togo's capital, Lomé, for a meeting organised by the west African bloc, ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), the minister said. He suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhoea after arriving at Lagos airport and was taken directly to hospital, the minister said.

He insisted that the patient "avoided contact with the general public" between the airport and the hospital. He said that "all the passengers that the patient came in contact with have been traced and are being investigated" in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus through the city of 20 million people.

As of July 20, the number of Ebola cases recorded during the epidemic stood at 1,093, including more than 660 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. Liberia has seen a total of 127 fatalities.

West Africa faces Ebola time bomb

HUNDREDS of West Africans could be carrying the deadly Ebola virus and not know it, potentially infecting hundreds more, as cash–strapped governments and overwhelmed aid agencies struggle to contain the spread of the virus.

At least 1,500 people have not yet been traced who are known to have come into contact with others confirmed or suspected to be infected with the haemorrhagic fever, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) told The Daily Telegraph.

Many more could be moving freely in the three countries battling the virus – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – but fear of the illness and mistrust of Western medicine means they refuse to come forward to speak to doctors.

The current outbreak is the worst in recorded history. So far, 467 people have died and health staff have identified at least 292 other suspected or confirmed cases. Ebola is transmitted by coming into contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. It has no cure and as many as 90 per cent of its victims die, often from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding.

The outbreak was now "out of control" and could quickly spread across West Africa, according to MSF.

The spread of the virus appeared to have been halted in late April, by which time 74 people had died. Alpha Conde, Guinea's president, said the situation was "well in hand" and "touch wood, there won't be any new cases".

But a mix of mobile populations, mistrust of outsiders, traditional burial practices and lack of funding caused it to flare up again. The number of cases jumped by 129, or 38 per cent, in the week up to Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said.

Health staff have even been attacked. The Red Cross in Guinea said it had been forced to suspend some operations in the south–east of the country after staff were threatened. "Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle," an official said. An MSF centre elsewhere in Guinea was attacked by youths saying the charity brought Ebola into the country.

"I have covered six previous Ebola outbreaks and this is unprecedented," said Michel Van Herp, an epidemiologist with MSF in Belgium, who spent March and April in the region and is returning shortly. "It is unique in terms of the number of cases, where they are and how they are spread, the difficulty of putting enough treatment centres where they are needed, and the fact that these people move about so much."

West African health ministers began a two–day emergency summit in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, on Wednesday to improve coordination of their responses to Ebola. Money was needed urgently for drugs, basic protective gear and staff pay, said Abubakarr Fofanah, Sierra Leone's deputy health minister.

Bernice Dahn, Liberia's deputy health minister, said: "In Liberia, our biggest challenge is denial, fear and panic. People are afraid but do not believe that the disease exists and, because of that, people get sick and the community members hide them and bury them."

The virus remains contagious even if the person it infected dies.

Health authorities in Glasgow and organisers of the Commonwealth Games, which start in the city on July 23, said they were "monitoring the situation on a daily basis" because a team from Sierra Leone was competing.

Scientist creates deadly new flu strain for pandemic research

Scientists are concerned that the new strain of virus could render the human immune system defenceless

A scientist who carried out research on making influenza viruses more infectious has deliberately created a potentially lethal strain of flu that can evade the human immune system.

Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has genetically manipulated the 2009 strain of pandemic flu in order for it to “escape” the control of the immune system’s neutralising antibodies, effectively making the human population defenceless against its reemergence.

Most of the world today has developed some level of immunity to the 2009 pandemic flu virus, which means that it can now be treated as less dangerous “seasonal flu”.

Professor Kawaoka intentionally set out to see if it was possible to convert it to a pre-pandemic state in order to analyse the genetic changes involved, the Independent[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/exclusive-controversial-us-scientist-creates-deadly-new-flu-strain-for-pandemic-research-9577088.html] said.

The study is not published, however some scientists who are aware of it are deeply concerned that Dr Kawaoka was allowed to deliberately remove the only defence against a strain of flu virus that has already demonstrated its ability to create a deadly pandemic that killed as many as 500,000 people in the first year of its emergence.

Professor Kawaoka has so far kept his research secret but admitted that the work is complete and ready for submission to a scientific journal. The experiment was designed to monitor the changes to the 2009 H1N1 strain of virus that would enable it to escape immune protection in order to improve the design of vaccines, he said.

“Through selection of immune escape viruses in the laboratory under appropriate containment conditions, we were able to identify the key regions [that] would enable 2009 H1N1 viruses to escape immunity,” Professor Kawaoka said in an email.

“Viruses in clinical isolates have been identified that have these same changes in the [viral protein]. This shows that escape viruses emerge in nature and laboratory studies like ours have relevance to what occurs in nature,” he said.

Prior to his statement to The Independent, Professor Kawaoka’s only known public mention of the study was at a closed scientific meeting earlier this year. He declined to release any printed details of his talk or his lecture slides.

The work was carried out at Wisconsin University’s $12m (£7.5m) Institute for Influenza Virus Research in Madison which was built specifically to house Professor Kawaoka’s laboratory, which has a level-3-agriculture category of biosafety: one below the top safety level for the most dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola virus.

However, this study was done at the lower level-2 biosafety. The university has said repeatedly that there is little or no risk of an accidental escape from the lab, although a similar US Government lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta with a higher level-3 biosafety rating was recently criticised over the accidental exposure of at least 75 lab workers to possible anthrax infection.

Professor Kawaoka’s work had been cleared by Wisconsin’s Institutional Biosafety Committee, but some members of the committee were not informed about details of the antibody study on pandemic H1N1, which began in 2009, and have voiced concerns about the direction, oversight and safety of his overall research on flu viruses.

Rebecca Moritz, who is responsible for overseeing Wisconsin’s work on “select agents” such as influenza virus, said that Professor Kawaoka’s work on 2009 H1N1 is looking at the changes to the virus that are needed for existing vaccines to become ineffective.

“With that being said, this work is not to create a new strain of influenza with pandemic potential, but [to] model the immune-pressure the virus is currently facing in our bodies to escape our defences,” Ms Moritz said.

“The work is designed to identify potential circulating strains to guide the process of selecting strains used for the next vaccine…The committee found the biosafety containment procedures to be appropriate for conducting this research. I have no concerns about the biosafety of these experiments,” she said.

Professor Kawaoka said that he has presented preliminary findings of his H1N1 study to the WHO, which were “well received”.

“We are confident our study will contribute to the field, particularly given the number of mutant viruses we generated and the sophisticated analysis applied,” he said.

“There are risks in all research. However, there are ways to mitigate the risks. As for all the research on influenza viruses in my laboratory, this work is performed by experienced researchers under appropriate containment and with full review and prior approval by the [biosafety committee],” he added.

The One With The World Cup, by David Thomas

DAVE, Ed Llewellyn and Jo Johnson settled down to watch England's first World Cup match against Italy. Dave was uneasy. He was a patriotic chap, but now he didn't know what result he wanted.

"Wouldn't it be terrific if England did well in Brazil?" he'd said, as they were putting out the beers and crisps. "They could have an opentopped bus through London, a reception at No 10, the works."

"I don't know, Dave," said Ed. "It might alter the whole hope/fear balance. We want the punters feeling hopeful enough to vote for us, but still fearful of Labour cocking things up. If the economy's booming and we've got a World Cup feelgood factor, they might become so irrationally exuberant that they elect Miliband."

"Plus there's the Scottish angle," added Jo. "An England win would stoke up Scots' resentment and play into Salmond's hands."

"But this is a perfect case of Better Together," insisted Dave. "Why can't Scots share in England's glory?"

"The Scots share England's glory?" gasped Jo. "They'd rather share the Ebola virus."

Nick wasn't watching the game. His father was English, Russian, German, Polish and Ukrainian. His mother was Dutch with a dash of French. His wife was Spanish. So he couldn't decide whom to cheer for or what to think. Just like life.

"Oh come on, Dad!" said his son, Antonio. "We've got to support England!" "I don't want to encourage that kind of nationalist thinking. I want you to think of yourself as European."

"Well, I don't. I want England to win the World Cup, just like Mum wants Spain to."

Somewhere in the distance came the sound of sobbing. "Cinco-uno… Cinco-uno?"

"What's the point in supporting anything?" Nick asked, despairingly. "I keep losing elections. Spain lost to Holland. Accept it, son: we're Cleggs. All we ever do is lose."

Meanwhile, William Hague was gazing at pictures on his laptop of himself with Dame Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. "Look, dear," he said to Ffion, who was flicking through TV channels, trying to find something other than football, "this is me and Angelina launching our anti-rape campaign. And this is us going to Sarajevo. We've worked so hard. She's earned her damehood."

"Oh yes, she's earned it all right," Ffion sighed. "Now can you please find something on the box?" William ignored her. "Oh, look! Me, Angie and Brad at our conference this week. Brad looks very well, don't you think? That cleanshaven, short-haired look, with those rather heavy specs makes him look dashing but terribly intelligent."

"I'm surprised you noticed him, with Dame Sexypants next to you."

"She looked all right, I suppose," William chuckled. "Brad said Angie and I were so close, the press would start calling us Haguelina. His first name is actually William, too. Did you know that?" Ffion felt a cold chill spread through her body. She didn't like the way this was going at all.

"Come on!" she said, with desperate enthusiasm. "Let's watch the football!" "Oh, must we?" asked William.

"Yes we absolutely must."

They switched to BBC1. The referee blew his whistle, and England vs Italy began…

Le Pens at war as father faces new racism row

AN UNPRECEDENTED family feud has erupted at the heart of France's far Right between Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National (FN), and her father and the party founder, Jean–Marie, over his alleged anti–Semitism.

Miss Le Pen accuses her father of damaging the Front National with perceived racist comments while he has blamed her for turning the party into an insipid "bizarre" grouping "without substance".

On Sunday, Mr Le Pen, 85, who already has several race hate convictions, had provoked political outrage, even from within his own party, for pledging to make an "oven load" of the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel, a vocal FN critic.

Miss Le Pen joined the chorus of criticism of her father, who is an MEP and the party's honorary president, saying he had committed a "political mistake".

"I am convinced that the meaning attributed to his words stems from a malicious interpretation," she said.

"Nevertheless, given Jean–Marie Le Pen's very long experience, not to have anticipated the way those words would be interpreted is a political mistake and the Front National is suffering the consequences."

An unrepentant Mr Le Pen hit back yesterday, saying the "political fault" lay with his daughter's stewardship of the party he founded in 1972, and which Miss Le Pen has sought to "detoxify", purging it of overt racism and xenophobia.

"I consider the political fault is with those who have aligned themselves to – la pensée unique ['single thought' of the conformist political mainstream]. They would like to resemble the other political parties. If that's the stated aim of some FN leaders, they have succeeded," he told RTL radio station.

Mr Le Pen is clearly irked at the direction the party he led until 2011 is taking despite the fact it has never been so popular, coming first in last month's European elections with 25 per cent of the vote – its best ever electoral showing.

He made that clear in the same interview, saying his daughter's far–Right political grouping, le Rassemblement Bleu Marine (Marine Blue Rally) was "a kind of bizarre formation without substance".

Father and daughter have not seen each other since Mr Le Pen made the controversial remarks. When asked whether they had fallen out, Mr Le Pen said: "Hmmm, no comment."

But they will find it hard to avoid each other Mr Le Pen has an office in the palatial family mansion of Montretout, southwest of Paris, where Miss Le Pen lives with her sister and mother.

Florian Philippot, the FN vice–president, said: "Marine and her father will obviously have some explaining to do."

Far Right experts said the public nature of the row was extraordinary. "This is the first time they've all gone this far," said Nicolas Lebourg, a political historian, who added that Mr Le Pen was clearly finding it hard to accept he "no longer has a party all to himself".

Mr Le Pen is seen by some as a growing liability for his daughter as she attempts to forge alliances with other far–Right and Eurosceptic groups.

Nigel Farage, the head of the UK Independence Party, has already ruled out joining forces, saying the party has anti–Semitism "in its DNA".

Mr Le Pen himself denied that his comment about "oven load" was intended to refer to the killings of millions of Jews in Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. "I challenge you to find a single anti–Semitic phrase in my political life," said the man who once called the Nazi gas chambers a "detail" of history. "I'm a free man," he said, rejecting any suggestion he should retire from political life.

But these are the latest in a string of controversial remarks by Mr Le Pen.

During the European elections, he suggested that the deadly Ebola virus could solve world population growth and immigration into France "in three weeks". To pre–empt any further damage, Miss Le Pen insisted that one positive result of the row was that it gave her an opportunity "to remind people that the Front National condemns any form of anti–Semitism in the strongest terms".

Some analysts suggested that the row was calculated to keep the FN's extreme fringes happy. Alexandre Dézé, an FN expert, said: "Jean–Marie Le Pen maintains the party's singularity and at the same time... it allows Miss Le Pen to take a stand against her father to say his comments are a political mistake."

Either way, all agree Miss Le Pen is condemned to living with her unpredictable father. "He is capable of even bigger scandals than that and he is unsackable as he's president of honour for life," said Sylvain Crépon, a sociologist.

Even Mr Philippot, FN vice president admitted: "No one can shut him up."

Jean-Marie Le Pen hits back at daughter Marine’s condemnation of his allegedly anti-semitic remarks, saying “the real political fault” was to turn the Front National into a mainstream, conformist party

War erupted today between the two main figures of France’s far Right as Jean-Marie Le Pen told his daughter Marine that the Front National (FN) under her leadership had turned into a “bizarre”, insipid mainstream conformist party like any other.

Mr Le Pen, who already has several race hate convictions, sparked political outrage over the weekend, even from within his own party, for pledging to make an “oven load” of the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel. The comment was widely interpreted as a reference to the furnaces used by the Nazis to dispose of their victims during the Holocaust.

Mr Bruel has spoken out against the FN on many occasions.

In a spectacular departure from her usual displays of family unity, Miss Le Pen joined the chorus of criticism of her 85-year-old father, who is an MEP and the party’s honorary president, saying he had committed a “political mistake”.

“I am convinced that the meaning attributed to his words stems from a malicious interpretation,” she said. “Nevertheless, given Jean-Marie Le Pen’s very long experience, not to have anticipated the way those words would be interpreted is a political mistake and the Front National is suffering the consequences.”

An unrepentant Mr Le Pen hit back at his daughter on Monday, saying the “political fault” lay with her stewardship of the party he founded in 1972, and which Miss Le Pen has sought to “detoxify”, purging it of overt racism and xenophobia.

Father and daughter have not seen each other since Mr Le Pen made the controversial remarks. When asked whether they had fallen out, Mr Le Pen said: “Hmmm, no comment.”

Florian Philippot, FN vice president, said: “Marine and her father will obviously have some explaining to do.”

Miss Le Pen was not the only party member to speak out about his “joke”.

Louis Aliot, Marine Le Pen’s partner and the deputy leader of the Front National, also condemned the comment as “politically stupid and distressing”. Gilbert Collard, one of the Front National’s two MPs, urged Mr Le Pen to retire.

In a series of television and radio interviews, Mr Le Pen denied that his comment was anti-semitic or intended to refer to the killings of millions of Jews in Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War.

“I challenge you to find a single anti-semitic phrase in my political life,” said the man who once called the Nazi gas chambers a “detail” of history.

“I’m a free man. I don’t feel obliged to walk in the well-trodden paths of ‘single thought’,” he said, rejecting any suggestion he should retire from political life.

He may have groomed her to succeed him as France’s far-Right figurehead, but Mr Le Pen is becoming a growing liability for his daughter as she attempts to forge alliances with other far-Right and Eurosceptic groups.

Nigel Farage, head of the United Kingdom Independence Party, has already ruled out joining forces, saying the party has anti-semitism “in its DNA”.

These are the latest in a string of controversial remarks by Mr Le Pen. During the European elections he suggested the deadly Ebola virus could solve world population growth and immigration into France “in three weeks”.

Afterwards, Mr Farage said: “These comments just reconfirm what I have always said, that Ukip will not be having any sort of pact with the Front National after these elections.”

To pre-empt any further damage, Miss Le Pen insisted that one positive result of the row was that it gave her an opportunity “to remind people that the Front National condemns any form of anti-semitism in the strongest terms”.

Miners suffer from Ebola virus fears in Sierra Leone as FTSE loses ground

Market report

MOUNTING fears about the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone have sparked a sell–off in miners focused on the West African country.

London Mining dropped 5¾, or 13.8pc, to a record low of 36p after the Aimlisted iron ore group said it had imposed travel restrictions on workers and that some "non essential" staff had left the country following the recent outbreak.

The company, which produces ore from the Marampa mine, said: "Restrictions have been imposed on non–essential travel by visitors from affected areas and some personnel who are able to work remotely, with operations personnel remaining in country and operations running as normal."

There have been no cases of the virus in its workforce or in communities near Marampa, the company added. A spokesman insisted that, contrary to reports, there had not been an operation to remove workers from the region.

Meanwhile, African Minerals, another Sierra Leone iron ore producer, tumbled 8, or 7.6pc, to 97p, after confirming that it had severed transport links to areas where Ebola had been reported. Like London Mining, African Minerals said that staff and operations at its Tonkolili mine had been unaffected by the epidemic.

Both companies have put protective measures in place after Sierra Leone last week became the third West African country to be struck by the Ebola outbreak. There have been five deaths in Sierra Leone, and at least 193 in Guinea, where the epidemic began. There have also been cases in Liberia.

There is no vaccine or treatment for Ebola, which is transferred by coming into direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. The disease is among the world's most virulent, killing as many as 90pc of those who catch it.

After edging cautiously higher on Monday, the FTSE 100 went into reverse and closed down 27.8 points at 6,836.3. Nervousness ahead of tomorrow's key European Central Bank meeting – when the ECB is expected to tackle deflation – weighed on equities across Europe.

In London, William Hill, 7½ cheaper at 350.3p, was among the heaviest fallers, dragged down by the bookmaker's impending demotion from the FTSE 100 as well as worries about increases in racefield fees in Australia.

Hill has a sizeable operation Down Under. To account for the fee rises, Goodbody analyst Gavin Kelleher yesterday trimmed his 2015 earningsper–share forecast for Hill by 1.7pc. FTSE Group will disclose the results of the latest quarterly index reshuffle today, with the moves determined by the market caps of companies at the close of trade last night.

Melrose Industries, down 4.6 at 275.3p, is expected to lose its place in the FTSE 100 along with Hill, while 3i, 1.4 lower at 426p, and Intu Properties, up 1.7 at 318.4p, are in line for promotion from the FTSE 250.

The reshuffle affects share prices, as tracker funds are forced to adjust their holdings to account for the index changes.

Grocers were under pressure following unsettling sales and market shares data from Kantar Worldpanel, which HSBC described as "shocking" for the three listed supermarket groups. Wm Morrison lost 4.2 to 194.4p, J Sainsbury shed 5.3 to 333.8p and Tesco, which reports first–quarter numbers today, slid 3.05 to 297½p.

Elsewhere among the fallers, microchip designer Imagination Technologies was off 6.9 at 226.7p after traders picked up on news that one of its licensees, Broadcom, plans either to sell or to wind–down its cellular baseband unit. The business, which develops chips used in smartphones, could have given a boost to Imagination's royalties.

The unexpected departure of Foxtons' chief executive Michael Brown, who has been at the helm for 12–years, sent the London–focused estate agency down 21.9 to 307.9p. He is leaving the company for personal reasons.

Conversely, Tullett Prebon advanced 13.8 to 304p, despite news that boss Terry Smith, the City heavyweight, is to exit the interdealer broker. Bid talk was thought to have stoked demand for the shares, with Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, noting that Smith's departure could leave the group "vulnerable" to a takeover, given there is a growing "need" for consolidation in the wider IDB industry.

Beazley, 1.1 better at 248.7p, was another that was lifted by broker comment. Recommending that clients "buy" shares in the Lloyd's of London insurer, Berenberg analyst Tom Carstairs said: "Beazley's diversified business model, with a lower reliance on reinsurance business and a significant portion of liability business, leaves it well placed to maintain its very strong results of recent years."

Oil explorer Cairn Energy was boosted 5.9 to 206.9p by speculation of positive developments in its Indian tax dispute.

Fellow oil and gas group Bowleven surged 3¼, or 9.6pc, to 37p after Cameroon gave its approval for the Aimlisted group's plans to exploit for the Etinde prospect off the coast of the African country.

The company, a favourite among punters on the internet bulletin boards, wants to supply gas to a government–backed fertiliser plant.

Wolseley was another riser, topping the FTSE 100 leaderboard in the wake of a well–received third–quarter trading update, in which the heating and plumbing products supplier said it expected like–for–like revenue growth of about 4pc in the coming six months.

Traders said that Wolseley's robust performance in America also pleased, as there had been worries that the third–quarter could have been hurt by the adverse weather in the US. The shares finished 53p dearer at £33.63.

British miner gets "non-essential" staff out of Sierra Leone after an outbreak of the deadly virus

Some “non-essential” staff employed by a British mining company have left Sierra Leone after the country became the third West African nation to be hit by an outbreak of Ebola.

London Mining, which is listed on the junior Aim market, said in a stock exchange filing that it had taken the “precautionary measure” after reports suggested there had been a rise in Ebola cases, although the company added that there had been no incidences of the deadly disease in its workforce. Production at its Marampa iron ore mine are unaffected by the outbreak.

However, investors took fright at the news and shares in London Mining dropped as much as 12.6pc. A spokesman for the company insisted that a concerted evacuation had not taken place, as had previously been reported.

“The company notes recent news reports from Sierra Leone indicating an increased number of cases of Ebola Fever predominantly in the east of the country bordering the area in Guinea where the outbreak first occurred some months ago,” London Mining said.

“As a precautionary measure in line with its standard operating procedures, restrictions have been imposed on non-essential travel by visitors from affected areas and some personnel who are able to work remotely, with operations personnel remaining in country and operations running as normal.”

African Minerals, another London-listed iron ore business that operates in Sierra Leone, also slid 7.6pc, despite confirming that its staff and operations had not been affected by the Ebola outbreak.

Sierra Leone reported its first deaths from the virus last week. Guinea and Liberia have also been hit by the epidemic.

Ebola rap warns West Africans of virus's dangers

"Don't touch your friend, no eating something, it's dangerous" lyrics warn as virus spreads and death toll nears 190

A song now sweeping the dance floors of Liberia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] and Guinea[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/guinea/] has been recorded by a group of West African rappers, warning of the dangers of the haemorrhagic fever Ebola – which has killed 188 people in the region in two months.

Ebola In Town is a fast-paced, repetitive pop song over a dance beat[https://soundcloud.com/shadowmrgn/ebola-in-town-d-12-shadow-kuzzy-of-2kings] that warns "don't touch your friend" and "no eating something, it's dangerous".

Revellers in Monrovia and Conakry, capitals respectively of Liberia and Guinea, have crafted a dance to match the music which involves no bodily contact between people – very rare in dance-mad West Africa.

Ebola in fact can only be transferred by coming into direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. It is, however, virulent, killing as many as 90 per cent of those who catch the virus.

"Ebola, Ebola in town," repeats the song, recorded by a trio of artists D-12, Shadow and Kuzzy of 2 Kings, all believed to be Liberia-based.

"Don't touch your friend, don't touch him. No eating something, it's dangerous. Ebola, Ebola in town," the lyrics continue. "Eating" here is a sly reference to sex.

In countries like Liberia and Guinea, where adult literacy is below 40 per cent, music, theatre and radio are regularly used to try to spread health messages as widely as possible, although the artists are not thought to have written the song for any aid agency or health charity.

According to the World Health Organisation and the country's presidency, 258 clinical cases of suspected or confirmed Ebola have been recorded in Guinea since the outbreak was first identified in March. Of those, 174 people have died.

Another nine people are believed to have died in Liberia and five in Sierra Leone.

A significant number of those who fell sick with the illness have recovered, but are facing stigma with friends and even family members refusing to be near them or touch them for fear of catching the virus.

There are concerns that the Ebola In Town song's warning "don't touch your friend" may worsen that stigma.

The virus is believed initially to have been passed to humans by people eating fruit bats, which are a delicacy in parts of West Africa. It is then extremely contagious.

Symptoms initially include fever, diarrhoea and muscle aches, which are similar to many other less fatal illnesses in the region and mean that patients do not initially seek treatment.

As the virus takes hold, victims may suffer serious difficulties breathing and swallowing and eventually significant internal and external bleeding.

Medical workers treating Ebola patients must wear head-to-toe biohazard suits and wards are entirely contained in sealed plastic tenting.

Marine Le Pen wins record victory for Front National in French elections

Marine Le Pen's far-Right Front National party has scored its highest ever percentage of the vote, exit polls in France show

France[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/] ’s far-Right Front National was on course for an historic victory in European elections on Sunday night, coming top in a national election for the first time in its 42-year history in a score it said represented a “massive rejection” of the EU.

Early exit polls placed the anti-European, anti-immigrant party first with 25 per cent of the vote – a result that was even better than expected.

The result put the FN well ahead of the opposition centre-Right UMP party, on 20.6 per cent, which lost nine percentage points compared to 2009.

The ruling Socialists clinched a paltry 14.1 per cent, the second drubbing they have received in nationwide elections in two months after suffering heavy losses in municipal elections in March.

President François Hollande[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/francois-hollande/] has called a crisis cabinet meeting on Monday morning to discuss his next move after this latest rout for his party.

Estimations suggest that the FN was on course for clinching 24 seats in the European Parliament – a major jump from the three it won in 2009 – with the UMP taking 19, the Socialists 13 and the Greens six.

To cheers and strains of the Marseillaise at party headquarters in Nanterre, west of Paris, a jubilant Marine Le Pen, FN leader, said: “The sovereign people has proclaimed that they want to take back their destiny into their own hands.

“Our people demands one type of politics: they want politics by the French, for the with the French. They don’t want to be led anymore from outside, to submit to laws.”

The result, she insisted, translated into a "massive rejection of the European Union".

"We must build another Europe, a free Europe of sovereign nations and one in which cooperation is freely decided. Tonight is a massive rejection of the European Union. If through the incompetence and weakness of our leaders Germany has become the economic heart of the European Union, then France has been and will be the political heart of Europe.

“What is happening in France heralds what will happen in all European countries, the return of the nation."

The result was a triple victory for the Le Pen family as Marine came top with 32.6 per cent in her constituency in the north west of France, Jean-Marie was in first position on 28.9 per cent in the South East and Louis Aliot, Miss Le Pen’s partner, scored 23.7 per cent – in pole position - in the South West.

Lumping the two main French political parties together - Left and centre-Right - Jean-Marie Le Pen, FN founder and honorary president, said: "This is a defeat, a rout for the 'UMPS'.

"Parliament must be dissolved," he said, calling on Manuel Valls, the prime minister, to resign.

Mainstream French politicians had been warning for days that first place for the FN, which wants to scrap the euro and “tear down the Berlin wall of Brussels”, would be catastrophic for France’s image in Europe and the wider world.

Mr Valls, the Socialist prime minister, described the result as a “very grave moment for France and Europe”.

“This result is more than a new warning: it’s a shock, an earthquake,” he said, pledging to push on with reforms “faster - there isn’t a moment to lose”.

Miss Le Pen, 45, appears to have been buoyed by slightly higher-than-expected turnout, estimated at 42.5 per cent – a little more than in 2009 - as her electorate traditionally stays away from EU elections.

Nationally, the FN appears not to have suffered any backlash against the comments of her father last week, who last week claimed that an epidemic of the deadly Ebola virus could solve the world’s population problems and immigration pressure on Europe “in three months”.

The results spell bad news for the opposition UMP, whose current boss, Jean-François Copé, is facing allegations that he allowed a business run by friends to cheat the party by overcharging for election events, and possibly bill for conferences that never took place.

Speaking beforehand, one UMP MP warned there would be “blood on the walls” if the party – which has been bitterly divided over its EU policy - fares poorly.

"Heads will have to roll,” he told Le Parisien.

Mr Copé, whose job is on the line, put a brave face on the result, saying: "It's above all a huge disappointment, but it's also the expression of the French's people's gigantic anger and exasperation towards the politics led by François Hollande."

Seeking to explain why his party failed to beat the FN, Mr Copé said: "We were more divided in the European elections (than in previous local ones in which they came first). This troubled part of our electorate."

But the knives were out on Sunday night for Mr Copé, and a fresh leadership battle looked on the cards.

"The UMP's credibility has been hit," said François Fillon, the former prime minister, who intends to run for president in 2017.

Alain Juppé, another former conservative prime minister, said: "This score is a severe defeat for the Right and centre".

"The UMP must change. We must have full clarity on what has happened."

The Socialists had hope to cling on to a score comparable with 2009, in which they mustered 16.5 per cent to come second. But in the event, the result was worse than their predictions.

President François Hollande’s entourage have already let it be known that there will be no reshuffle as in March, when Mr Hollande fired his prime minister after his Socialist Party suffered historic losses in municipal elections.

But one senior Hollande aide warned: “Tonight is the start of the crisis.

“The shock will be felt here and will spark a new crisis of authority for Hollande.”

Miss Le Pen plans to forge an EU parliamentary group called the European Freedom Alliance with the Dutch Freedom Party, or PVV, of Geert Wilders, along with the Austrian Freedom Party, Belgian Vlaams Belang, Italian Lega Nord, Slovak National Party and Sweden Democrats.

However, in a setback, the PVV fared far worse than expected last Thursday – coming fourth behind pro-EU parties – amid claims by its most senior MEP that it had paid the price of joining forces with Miss Le Pen.

Nigel Farage, head of the UK Independence Party is adamant he will steer clear of “any sort of pact with the Front National after these elections”.

"However impressive Marine Le Pen is, the Front National carries toxic baggage," he told The Telegraph last week.

EU elections 2014: 'toxic' Marine Le Pen blamed for Geert Wilders defeat

EU election defeat for Geert Wilders blamed on his decision to link with French Front National rather than Nigel Farage

A disastrous European Union election vote for the Dutch far-Right has been blamed on a "toxic" Marine Le Pen and is seen as vindication of Nigel Farage's refusal to work with the French Front National.

The result is a blow to Miss Le Pen and will be widely seen as the consequence of her failure to break from the Front National's extremist past, a legacy embodied by her father Jean-Marie who remains an MEP and honorary president of the party.

His close alliance with Miss Le Pen is seen as the key factor in the unexpected defeat of Geert Wilders and his Freedom Party[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/10850610/European-election-upset-for-Geert-Wilders-as-Dutch-turn-cold-on-anti-EU-party.html] (PVV) on Thursday night after Dutch exit polls put him in fourth place behind all the pro-EU Dutch political parties.

As Dutch voters went to the polls, Mr Wilders faced questions over Jean-Marie's Le Pen's claim that Ebola, the deadly virus, could solve the world's population explosion and France's immigration problems "in three months", a row that recalled his past convictions for Holocaust denial.

Mr Farage, basking in the glow of Ukip's better than expected local election results[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/local-elections/10851024/Ukip-earthquake-rocks-Labour-and-Tories-in-Elections-2014.html], told the Telegraph that he was not surprised that the link to the Front National had played badly with Dutch voters.

"However impressive Marine Le Pen is, the Front National carries toxic baggage," the Ukip leader said. "The best example is the comments by Jean-Marie Le Pen earlier this week."

Mr Wilders blamed the setback on the "65 per cent" of his Freedom Party's voters who had "stayed at home" amid low Dutch turnout estimated at around 34 per cent but admitted "the truth is that the exit polls are disappointing".

Lucas Hartong, the most senior MEP for Mr Wilders' PVV refused to campaign in the EU elections because he warned last month that the link with the Front National and the Austrian far-Right was wrong and would prove to be an electoral disaster.

"I am not at all surprised at the result. It's what I warned of. I think there will be an internal fight now, people will want to work with Farage and to drop Le Pen," he said.

"These parties have a tendency to anti-Semitism. Most PVV voters want to work with people like Ukip. They didn't come out because they were concerned."

Mr Hartong revealed that in 2011 he and his three colleagues in the European Parliament entered into talks with Mr Farage but that the proposal to form an alliance had been personally rejected by Mr Wilders, who now says he would like to work with Ukip in the future.

"It was Wilders who blocked it. My question is why did he want to work with Le Pen and not Farage?," he said.

Esther Voet, the director of the influential Dutch Information and Documentation on Israel Centre, said that the comments by Mr Le Pen had reminded voters of the Front National's past links to anti-Semitism, a political taboo in the Netherlands.

"I'm sure a lot people planning to vote for him changed their minds," she said.

Amid a French backlash over her father's comments about Ebola on Tuesday, Miss Le Pen insisted the comments had been "distorted" and that he had meant to say that the deadly virus would act as a form of brutal population control.

"He wasn't talking about immigration, he was talking about African demographics, he was talking about world demographics," she said.

"It was perhaps a disillusioned observation that was a bit pessimistic, but it had absolutely nothing to do with immigration."

European election upset for Geert Wilders as Dutch turn cold on anti-EU party

Dutch exit polls confound predictions to leave far-Right and anti-Islam leader with 12.2 per cent of vote, behind all pro-EU mainstream political parties

Geert Wilders came fourth in European elections in the Netherlands on Thursday night, confounding predictions that he would lead a populist and far-Right backlash against the European Union across the continent.

Dutch exit polls put the far-Right and anti-Islam leader on 12.2 per cent of the vote, putting him behind all the pro-EU mainstream political parties.

'Definitive' exit polls put him behind the ruling centrist VVD on 12.3 per cent and almost three per cent behind the pro-EU D66 liberals and Christian Democrats, each on over 15 per cent.

Previous opinion polls had put Mr Wilders in the lead but there was widespread controversy over his alliance with the France’s Front National and the exit polls suggested that his share of the vote fell, compared with 2009, by 4.8 percentage points.

The result is a major blow to Mr Wilders who will lose two seats in the European Parliament with his MEPs now reduced to three out a total of 26 Dutch representatives.

After delaying a downbeat post-election party in a tiny sports bar in the suburbs of Scheveningen, a Dutch seaside town on the outskirts of The Hague, Mr Wilders insisted he would fight on “for national sovereignty, for less immigration, for less Brussels”.

"Our people stayed at home. We'll carry on fighting. We'll find partners who share our views against the EU across Europe," he said.

His supporters, wearing customised “Wilders Akbar” football shirts - a provocative play on the Islam chant “Allahu Akbar”, or “God is Great” - had arrived in celebratory mood but hissed as the first exit polls were released by Dutch state broadcaster.

Around 400 million people across the EU’s 28 member states are eligible to vote in the elections that began in Britain and the Netherlands on Thursday and will conclude when most countries vote on Sunday.

The preliminary exit polls were released when voting closed in the Netherlands at 9pm local time.

Unlike Britain, which keeps all exit polls under wraps until Sunday night, the Netherlands has constitutional requirements that mean polling surveys are published immediately.

Turnout was expected to be lower than the 37 per cent who voted during the last European elections five years ago, amid fears that participation across Europe is heading for an all-time low.

After the elections Mr Wilders will join forces with Marine Le Pen’s Front National to create a European Freedom Alliance with other far-Right parties in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Slovakia and Sweden.

Mr Wilders, who has tried to distance himself from traditional far-Right groups, was forced to distance himself from comments by Jean-Marie Le Pen earlier this week that the Ebola virus could solve Europe’s immigration “problem” by killing Africans. “I don’t agree with it. I think it was a ridiculous remark,” he said.

The European Parliament has a total of 751 seats to be distributed across Europe on the basis of population size during elections that finish on May 25.

As the EU has grown and as its parliament has become increasingly important, popular participation in European elections has slumped.

In 1979, the first direct European election to the parliament, a respectable 62 per cent of eligible voters turned out to cast their ballots. But in 2009 and as MEPs became more important than ever after the Lisbon Treaty, the turnout slumped to 43 per cent.

Ebola will solve France's immigration problem, says Le Pen senior

THE DEADLY Ebola virus could solve France's immigration problems "in three months", Jean–Marie Le Pen, the founder and honorary president of France's far–Right Front National, said in remarks which shocked the country's political establishment.

On Tuesday night in Marseille, shortly before a joint rally with Marine Le Pen, his daughter and current party leader, Mr Le Pen, 85, said: "There is a demographic explosion in the world and a risk of submersion. A replacement of [the national] population is under way." However, he added: "Monsieur Ebola can solve the problem in three months."

An outbreak in Guinea of the viral haemorrhagic fever, for which there is no effective treatment or vaccine, has crossed international borders for the first time, killing at least 83 people in West Africa.

Mr Le Pen, who is running for the European Parliament in France's South East constituency, made the inflammatory remarks during an exchange with French journalists. He went on to tell a crowd of 1,500 that France's immigration situation was "made worse" by the fact that most immigrants were Muslim, "a religion whose aim is to conquer".

The Ebola comments led to outrage in France, where Stéphane Le Foll, a spokesman for the Socialist government, called them "unacceptable" and added: "For those who often make out that the Front National has changed, here is the proof once again that they have not changed."

They threatened to undermine Miss Le Pen's efforts to "detoxify" her party and shed its reputation for racism. Mr Le Pen later back–pedalled, saying he was merely making an "observation" about potential disasters that "could modify this demographic trend" and added: "In no way do I wish to spread the Ebola virus."

Miss Le Pen is aiming to come first in Sunday's European elections in France, where the FN is polling neck and neck with the centre–Right UMP party and well ahead of the ruling Socialists.

Her father's remarks will also hinder her effort to forge alliances with other nationalist or Eurosceptic parties, which are expected to make sweeping gains.

Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has previously ruled out joining forces with the FN because it had anti–Semitism "in its DNA". After Mr Le Pen's comments, Mr Farage said: "I almost feel sorry for Marine Le Pen. I cannot understand what she has done to make her father dislike her so much.

"But these comments just reconfirm what I have always said – that Ukip will not be having any sort of pact with the Front National after these elections."

Front National founder shocks France by saying a deadly Ebola epidemic would solve the country's problems with immigration and world's population 'explosion'

The deadly Ebola virus could solve France's[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/] immigration problems "in three months", Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and honorary president of France's far-Right Front National, has said in remarks which have shocked the country's political establishment.

Speaking on Tuesday night in Marseille shortly before a joint rally with Marine Le Pen, his daughter and current party leader, Mr Le Pen, 85, said: "There is a demographic explosion in the world and a risk of submersion. A replacement of (the national population) is under way."

However, he added: "Monsieur Ebola can solve the problem in three months."

Ebola is one of the most feared infectious diseases in the world and there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the viral haemorrhagic fever. A current outbreak in Guinea has killed at least 83 people – the first in Western Africa in 20 years and the first time that Ebola has been confirmed to have crossed international borders.

Mr Le Pen, who is running to be a euro MP in the South East constituency, made the inflammatory remarks ahead of a public speech during an exchange with French journalists, many of whom relayed his comments.

He went on to tell a crowd of 1,500 in the Parc Carnot that the immigration situation was "made worse" in France by the fact that most immigrants were Muslim, "a religion whose aim is to conquer", he claimed.

The Ebola outburst sparked outrage in France, where Stephane Le Foll, spokesman for the Socialist government, called them "unacceptable".

"For those who often make out that the Front National has changed, here is the proof once again that they have not changed."

Miss Le Pen has been at great pains to "detoxify" her party and shed its traditional reputation for racism and xenophobia.

Back-pedalling later, Mr Le Pen said he was merely making an "observation" about potential disasters that "could modify this demographic trend".

"In no way do I wish to spread the Ebola virus," he said.

His incendiary remarks will not help his daughter in her drive to come first in Sunday's European elections in France, in which the FN is polled neck and neck with the centre-Right UMP party and well ahead of the ruling Socialists.

Nor will it help her forge alliances with other nationalist or Eurosceptic parties, such as Britain's UK Independence Party, who are expected to make sweeping gains.

Nigel Farage, UKIP leader, has already ruled out joining forces with the FN as it had anti-Semitism "in its DNA".

Speaking to the Telegraph about Le Pen's comments, Mr Farage said: "I almost feel sorry for Marine Le Pen. I cannot understand what she has done to make her father dislike her so much. But these comments just reconfirm what I have always said that UKIP will not be having any sort of pact with the Front National after these elections".

A Pollwatch2014 prediction, based on opinion polls across the European Union, last month put Miss Le Pen and Geert Wilders, the Dutch Freedom Party leader, on course to form a far-Right parliamentary bloc of 38 MEPs from at least seven countries.

They have formed a coalition called the European Freedom Alliance to campaign against the EU.

In a recent interview with the Telegraph[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10804531/Geert-Wilders-I-respect-Ukips-Nigel-Farage-a-lot.html], Mr Wilders admitted that he was uncomfortable with the idea of being in alliance with Mr Le Pen but insisted the French FN has changed.

"I am totally not comfortable with Mr Le Pen senior but I have enormous respect for Marine Le Pen," he said. "There is nothing racist or anti-Semitic about her. You cannot change a party overnight but the most important thing is the person in charge: is she or he heading in the right direction."

The Austrian Freedom Party, Belgian Vlaams Belang, Italian Lega Nord, Slovak National Party and Sweden Democrats have joined up with Miss Le Pen and Mr Wilders with opinion polling in those countries showing growing support amid a popular backlash against the euro.

Ebola was first identified in 1976 in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, when 280 people died.

Its transmission is not airborne. It is passed from wild animals to people, and then between human populations, by direct contact with someone who is infected, or with their body fluids.

But despite being extremely virulent the disease is containable because it kills its victims faster than it can spread to new ones.

Pope Francis decries Syrian suffering at Easter

Pope uses his Easter address to appeal to banish war and the scourge of hunger

Pope Francis on Sunday called for an end to “deadly force” against the “defenceless” in Syria and the promotion of peace in Ukraine and other troublespots around the world.

In his Easter message known as Urbi et Orbi, the pope called for urgent humanitarian aid in Syria and a halt to the “brutal terrorist attacks” in Nigeria and violence in South Sudan and Iraq.

The Vatican estimated around 150,000 pilgrims gathered in St. Peter’s Square for Easter mass and to hear the pope’s traditional message which he delivered from the central balcony of the basilica where he first appeared after his election a year ago.

“We pray in a particular way for Syria, that all those suffering the effects of the conflict can receive needed humanitarian aid and that neither side will again use deadly force, especially against the defenceless civil population, but instead boldly negotiate the peace long awaited and long overdue!” the pope said.

“We ask you to comfort the victims of fratricidal acts of violence in Iraq and to sustain the hopes raised by the resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.”

Noting the Catholic Church’s fraternity with those of the Orthodox faith, Francis singled out Ukraine for particular attention.

“We ask you to enlighten and inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine so that all those involved, with the support of the international community, will make every effort to prevent violence and, in a spirit of unity and dialogue, chart a path for the country’s future,” he said.

It is not the first time that the pope has called for peace in Syria and Ukraine, but he used one of the most important occasions on the Catholic calendar to underline his concern for those suffering from hunger and poverty arising from conflict.

The Argentine pontiff also urged the pilgrims to work to overcome the “scourge of hunger” and the “immense wastefulness for which we are often responsible”.

In his message he expressed concern for those struck by the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, and greater care for those suffering from other diseases spread through neglect and dire poverty.

The pope also urged pilgrims to promote “reconciliation and fraternal accord” in Venezuela.

Francis ended his the traditional speech with his characteristic informality, wishing the crowds a “Happy Easter!” and “Have a good lunch!”

The World Health Organisation yesterday described the outbreak of Ebola virus in Guinea as one of the "most challenging" health workers had faced as it announced that there were now 157 suspected cases.

Keiji Fukuda, the assistant director–general, said the agency was concerned about the spread of the virus from its epicentre in the southern forests. According to the figures, 101 of the Guinea cases have been fatal. Of those, 67 have been confirmed as Ebola. There have also been 21 cases in Liberia, two in Sierra Leone and nine in Mali.

A Liberian bushmeat trapper who died of Ebola caught the virus despite living far from the centre of the current epidemic in Guinea, raising fears of multiple concurrent outbreaks of the deadly haemorrhagic fever.

The virus is passed only through direct contact with an infected person, or their corpse, meaning that the Liberian hunter must have succumbed to a strain unconnected to the one doctors are battling to contain in Guinea.

Already, 86 people have died there, and there are a further 51 suspected cases already known to medical staff.

France's health ministry has warned doctors to step up vigilance for the Ebola virus, after an outbreak of the deadly disease in West Africa.

France is a major portal for air traffic from the region, which includes Guinea where 84 people have died.

Medic tells of horrific scenes in fight against Ebola virus in Guinea

A MEDICAL aid worker has given the first eyewitness account of the horrific scenes facing doctors and nurses battling to control an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in some of the poorest corners of West Africa.

Naoufel Dridi, who has 13 years' experience working with the charity Médecins Sans Frontières said: "I have never had to deal with this many bodies in these few days on any job before."

Mr Dridi, who has been coordinating emergency efforts in Guinea, where the number of suspected cases has reached 122, with 78 already dead, described working with doctors in isolation wards. "You can be helping somebody by getting them a juice, or a glass of cold water, or whatever he wants because you know really he has very little chance to survive, and then less than an hour later he is dead.

"Then when you are putting his body in the bag, another one behind you has died. Then another one. One old woman died with very bad external bleeding from her body, the symptoms that are the worst of Ebola. It is very difficult."

The virus leads to haemorrhagic fever, causing muscle pain, weakness, vomiting, diarrhoea and, eventually, organ failure and uncontrollable bleeding. It is the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa in close to 20 years, and the first in Guinea.

Morocco yesterday became the fifth country in the region to introduce strict controls at border posts to stop the spread of the disease, which has no vaccine, no cure, and kills as many as 90 per cent of the people it infects.

Saudi Arabia said it had suspended issuing visas for visits to its holy sites for Muslim pilgrims from Guinea and Liberia, the second country where Ebola has been confirmed. Four people have died there. There are also suspected cases in Sierra Leone.

"The local medical staff maybe at first are not aware of the seriousness of this illness, especially in Guinea, where it is the first time they have Ebola," said Mr Dridi, 41, who is French and lives in Geneva. "We are there in our full protective equipment, and we are trying to tell everyone they must take care, that they must restrict people going in and out from the wards.

"We have to help them understand there are no drugs for this illness."

Moving patients with the virus from open wards where they can infect medical staff or relations to isolation tents that they have very little chance of leaving alive was "psychologically very hard", he said.

"It is hard for the family, and for us," Mr Dridi added. "They know we can only treat the symptoms, not the virus. Whether that person survives or not is only down to whether the body reacts well and fights the illness."

Mr Dridi arrived back at MSF's Swiss headquarters last night after 15 days in Guinea.

"I hope I don't have to go back, because if I do that's because we have not been able to manage the epidemic," he said.

'Unprecedented' Ebola outbreak spreads across three countries

AN OUTBREAK of Ebola haemorrhagic fever that doctors yesterday described as "unprecedented" has spread to three countries in West Africa and threatens to become one of the deadliest in years.

At least 82 people have already died in Guinea and Liberia and another 56 patients are suspected to be carrying the virus, including in Sierra Leone.

Many others could be infected and not yet know it because Ebola can take up to three weeks to show symptoms, before killing very quickly from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding. Nine in 10 of those infected die.

The areas where it has so far been found include Conakry, Guinea's capital, with two million inhabitants, and heavily populated parts of the country's borderlands with Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The epidemic was "unprecedented" and "of a magnitude never before seen" in terms of its spread across Guinea and its neighbours, said Mariano Lugli, project coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Conakry.

"MSF has intervened in almost all reported Ebola outbreaks in recent years, but they were much more geographically contained and involved more remote locations," he said. "This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic."

It is the first outbreak in West Africa for close to 20 years and the first time that Ebola has been confirmed to have crossed international borders. Guinea has closed all of its borders with its neighbours, but its people are beginning to complain at their government's lack of effective action to stop an outbreak now traced back to January.

"The government should block the road between the forest region and the other part of Guinea," said Amadou Sow, a doctor in the capital Conakry.

Mabinti Bangoura, who sells dried fish at Toauya market in the capital, said: "This virus has broken out since January and the government has been hiding it. But God will send his angels to protect Guineans."

Patients in Conakry's main hospital, Donka, were being isolated but those in other basic facilities across the country were being treated in what MSF called "non–optimal conditions".

Isolating infected people is the only way to stop the spread of the virus, which has no vaccine and no cure.

Ebola was first identified in 1976 in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, when 280 people died.

Its transmission is not airborne. It is passed from wild animals to people, and then between human populations, by direct contact with someone who is infected, or with their body fluids.
