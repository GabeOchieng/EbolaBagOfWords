A study in monkeys offers the first evidence that a leading drug developed to fight Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] works against the strain causing the current outbreak in West Africa.

Six animals were infected with a very high dose of the virus and then, three days later, half were given the drug, TKM-Ebola-Makona, which was designed specifically to fight the West African strain. The monkeys that got the drug survived, but all three untreated monkeys died, researchers reported[http://nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/doi:10.1038/nature14428] on Wednesday in the journal Nature.

TKM-Ebola-Makona is already being tested in Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, but results are not yet available. An earlier version of the drug, created to treat a slightly different strain, was given to several Ebola patients in the United States, but it was impossible to tell whether it helped them because they also received other treatments at the same time.

The drugs are given intravenously and can cause flulike symptoms, including headaches, chills and fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. They belong to a category called short interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, which work by blocking certain genes in the virus, impairing its ability to replicate. The design of these drugs varies depending on the genetic sequence of the virus. But viruses can mutate, and new strains can evolve. Researchers have wondered whether a drug made to treat one strain would also work against other strains of the same virus.

“There has been concern that small changes in sequence can impact treatments,” said Thomas W. Geisbert, an Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and the senior author of the report.

The original TKM-Ebola was created to fight the Kikwit strain, from an earlier outbreak. The new strain, Makona, is closely related but not identical. Lab tests show that the drug for Kikwit works against Makona, and vice versa, but Dr. Geisbert said, “The best results would probably be to use siRNAs specific for each strain.”

The great advantage of the technology, Dr. Geisbert said, is that the drugs can quickly be retooled to keep up with changes in the virus.

Dr. Geisbert was one of the main inventors of the siRNAs for Ebola and holds a patent on them but receives no royalties, he said. Other authors of the report included employees of Tekmira, the Canadian company that makes the drugs.

An Ebola expert not involved in the study, Dr. Daniel Bausch, a senior consultant to the World Health Organization and an infectious disease specialist at Tulane University, said, “They showed universal protection in a highly lethal model three days after infection, so that’s obviously good.”

Because the epidemic in West Africa is waning, the study of TKM-Ebola-Makona in Sierra Leone may not enroll enough patients to determine whether the drug works in humans, Dr. Bausch said.

He added: “Which, of course, is a good thing that we hope will continue.”

Health
Surge in Hospital Visits Linked to a Drug Called Spice Alarms Health Officials

A sharp rise in visits to emergency rooms and calls to poison control centers nationwide has some health officials fearing that more potent and dangerous variations of a popular drug known as spice have reached the nation’s streets, resulting in several deaths.

In the first three weeks of April, state poison control centers received about 1,000 reports of adverse reactions to spice — the street name for a family of synthetic substances that mimic the effects of marijuana — more than doubling the total from January through March, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers[http://www.aapcc.org/].

The cases, which can involve spice alone or in combination with other substances, have appeared four times as often this year as in 2014, the organization said. On Thursday alone there were 172 reports, by far the most in one day this year.

Health departments in Alabama, Mississippi and New York have issued alerts this month about more spice users being rushed to hospitals experiencing extreme anxiety, violent behavior and delusions, with some of the cases resulting in death. Similar increases have occurred in Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and Texas.

The total number of fatalities nationwide this year is not available, health officials said. One person in Louisiana died Wednesday and two others were in intensive care, said Dr. Mark Ryan, the director of the Louisiana Poison Center.

“We had one hospital in the Baton Rouge area that saw over 110 cases in February. That’s a huge spike,” Mr. Ryan said. “There’s a large amount of use going on. When one of these new ingredients — something that’s more potent and gives a bigger high — is released and gets into distribution, it can cause these more extreme effects.”

Experts were unsure whether the increase this month in spice-related emergencies reflected greater use of the drug or a particularly dangerous formulation. Mr. Ryan said a large portion of cases appeared to involve a form called mab-chminaca[https://www.caymanchem.com/app/template/Product.vm/catalog/16616].

Law enforcement agencies, from the Drug Enforcement Administration[http://www.dea.gov/index.shtml] to local police departments, have struggled to control the flow of synthetic cannabinoids, marijuana-looking substances that are sprayed with a hallucinogenic chemical and then smoked. Those chemicals, typically imported from China by American distributors, come in hundreds of varieties; new formulations appear monthly, with molecules subtly tweaked to try to skirt the D.E.A.[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/drug_enforcement_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s list of illegal drugs as well as drug-detecting urine tests.

Although the entire class of drugs is illegal because of the psychological effects, each new variety can present distinct health risks caused by its underlying chemistry or contaminants in renegade manufacturing facilities. Experts warn that the popular term “synthetic marijuana” is a misnomer, as the substances merely resemble marijuana but can be 100 times more potent.

The use of synthetic cannabinoids has decreased since 2011 as awareness of their danger and illegality has spread, federal data indicates[http://monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2014.pdf]. Still, about one in 20 high school students used the drugs in 2014; about one in 30 adults age 19 to 28 used them in 2013, the most recent data[http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-vol2_2013.pdf] available for that age group.

More than 400 emergency-room visits in Mississippi were attributed to synthetic cannabinoids in April, according to the state health department[http://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/index.cfm/23,16273,195,32,html]. Two of those cases involved Jeffrey and Joey Stallings of McComb, who each spent several days in intensive care in medically induced comas, their mother, Karen, said in a telephone interview.

Ms. Stallings said that Jeffrey, 24, and Joey, 29, smoked a type of spice known as “mojo” that they received from a dealer. She said that Jeffrey became delusional, thinking that a woman was bleeding in their hallway, and extremely violent; Joey became extremely agitated before she took them to the hospital.

Ms. Stallings said that her sons were released from the hospital after about a week and that doctors told her that Jeffrey might have permanent kidney damage[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/injury-kidney-and-ureter/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Efforts to reach the brothers for comment were unsuccessful.

“I told them, ‘This is killing you and you don’t see it,’” Ms. Stallings said. “There’s no telling what that stuff was. There’s no telling at all.”

A unique case occurred earlier this year in Texas. The death of Kendrick Vernell Sneed, a soldier at Fort Hood, on Jan. 13 had been considered to be possibly caused by Ebola, because he had recently returned from deployment to a hot zone for the disease in West Africa. The local police department, however, announced[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/04/16/us/ap-us-fort-hood-soldier-death.html] on April 16 that an autopsy determined the cause to be “synthetic cannabinoid intoxication.”

The increases in cases in Mississippi and Alabama demonstrate the challenge facing law enforcement officials. Last year, D.E.A. agents made about 40 arrests and seized more than 400 pounds of synthetic drugs in those states as part of a wider national operation. Yet supply chains clearly remain.

“Is it frustrating? Yes, but when you’re in this business what you come to understand is that total eradication of a drug threat just isn’t going to happen,” said Keith Brown, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.’s New Orleans field division, which covers Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. “Until we can control the demand there’s going to be someone with supply.”

Mr. Brown added: “We had success last year, and now it’s coming back. It’s like a guy who tends a garden or tends a yard. It’s impossible to eradicate weeds. They come back. They grow again.”

Mr. Ryan said his Louisiana call center had fielded fewer calls in the past several years partly because emergency-room doctors had begun to recognize the effects of certain variations of spice and knew how to handle those cases themselves, leaving most of the calls from worried individuals. The tenor of recent calls has been different, he said.

“It’s been more than 90 percent hospitals this year,” Mr. Ryan said. “It’s not, ‘Hey, I smoked this thing and I don’t feel well.’ It’s, ‘This guy’s trying to tear up the E.R. and we have him locked down in restraints. We don’t know what he’s taken. What do we do?’”

Robotica Episode 1
Technology
Cheaper Robots, Fewer Workers

This is the first episode in a video series, called Robotica, examining how robots are poised to change the way we do business and conduct our daily lives.

Faced with an acute and worsening shortage of blue-collar workers[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/as-graduates-rise-in-china-office-jobs-fail-to-keep-up.html], China is rushing to develop and deploy a wide variety of robots for use in thousands of factories.

Waves of migrant workers from the countryside filled China’s factories for the last three decades and helped make the nation the world’s largest manufacturer. But many companies now find themselves struggling to hire enough workers. And for the scarce workers they do find, pay has more than quintupled in the last decade, to more than $500 a month in coastal provinces.

Chinese businesses and the government are responding by designing and starting to install large numbers of robots, with the goal of keeping factories running and expanding without necessarily causing a drop in overall employment.

Workers are scarce partly because of the government’s “one child” policy and the rapid expansion of the university system.

Government rules limiting most couples to just one child halved the birthrate in China from 1987 to 2003. The birthrate then leveled off at a lower level per 1,000 residents than in the United States. So China has lots of workers in their late 20s, but an ever-shrinking supply of workers now entering the work force each year.

The main ages for factory labor in China and in other developing countries are 18 to 24. Compounding the labor shortage for China’s manufacturing-intensive economy is that workers are staying in school longer — much longer. And following a Confucian tradition that the educated do not soil their hands with manual labor, graduates overwhelmingly refuse to accept factory work, except in supervisory, design or engineering positions.

As recently as 1997, China had only 3.2 million undergraduate students. With the Asian financial crisis that year, China began expanding its universities quickly, in an attempt to offset job losses among young people.

The expansion of universities has continued ever since, and 25.5 million undergraduates were enrolled by last December. Roughly a quarter of China’s young people now attend at least some university, and the proportion is rising steadily.

A few low-tech industries, like garment manufacturing, are moving from China to places that still have very low wages, like Bangladesh. But many industries, particularly electronics, are still moving factories to China. That is because so many of the parts suppliers are now in China that it is often more costly to do assembly elsewhere.

So although building robots to replace workers is seldom cheap, a growing number of companies are finding it less costly than either paying ever-higher wages in China or moving to another country. — Keith Bradsher

World; Europe
Britain’s Drift From the Global Stage Becomes an Election Issue

LONDON — Its military reach has diminished. It has played little role in confronting Russia over Ukraine and strictly limited its response to crises in the Middle East and Africa. Its future in Europe is in question, and a recent snub of the Obama administration over China made clear that its alliance with the United States is no longer as central to either nation as it once was.

As Britain heads toward a general election[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/world/europe/major-british-parties-struggle-to-fend-off-challenges-as-campaigns-begin.html] on May 7, issues closer to home are at the top of the agenda. But the nation’s reduced involvement — and seeming loss of stature — on the global stage has become part of the political debate, echoing growing concern in foreign policy circles that Britain has ceded its longstanding reputation for “punching above its weight” and being Washington’s go-to ally.

“We’ve found ourselves not taking part in the biggest European crisis since the end of World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]; we’ve taken our distance under this government from Europe; and there has been a weakening of the trans-Atlantic component,” said a former senior British ambassador, asking to remain anonymous to avoid offending his current clients.

“Foreign policy has not been a priority, and both traditional pillars, Europe and the United States, are weaker,” the diplomat said. “And it’s difficult to say it won’t have some lasting effect, especially coupled with what is arguably our fastest disarming since the 1930s.”

The government has focused “on soft power, development aid and trade, but those are not substitutes for a strategic view of the world,” he said.

This was a charge echoed by the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/04/24/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-election-world.html], on Friday in a speech directed at the Conservative prime minister, David Cameron[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/david_cameron/index.html?inline=nyt-per].

“David Cameron has presided over the biggest loss of influence for our country in a generation,” Mr. Miliband said. “And that has happened because the government he leads has stepped away from the world, rather than confidently towards it.”

He called Mr. Cameron’s policy “pessimistic isolationism,” and said it had “weakened Britain.”

Britain was deeply scarred by its participation in the second Gulf War, when Tony Blair, the Labour prime minister at the time, justified an invasion of Iraq alongside the United States on the basis of flawed intelligence. A decade of fighting alongside the Americans in Afghanistan has only increased British popular unhappiness with overseas engagements, especially as a junior partner to Washington.

Mr. Miliband has been boasting that he showed his “toughness” not in the face of Russia or the Islamic State but “by standing up to the leader of the free world,” President Obama, over the possibility of bombing Syria.

As Anthony King writes in a new book “Who Governs Britain?[https://www.pelicanbooks.com/who-governs-britain/]” successive governments have cut military spending but still use the language of a world power. “Since they cannot punch above their weight, they talk above it instead,” he wrote.

After an early and ill-fated foray in Libya, Mr. Cameron has emphasized Britain’s economic needs, pushing the Foreign Office and the Treasury to use British influence to enhance trade. On numerous occasions, Mr. Cameron has overruled the Foreign Office’s hesitation about getting too close to China for the sake of British economic interests.

Most recently, Mr. Cameron went against Foreign Office advice, and without much warning to Washington, announced that Britain would break with the United States and be a founding member[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/world/europe/british-leader-diverges-from-us-on-china-policy-and-military-spending.html] of Beijing’s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/asia/china-signs-agreement-with-20-other-nations-to-establish-international-development-bank.html], considered a rival to the American-led World Bank. As Washington feared, the British decision was quickly matched by Germany, France, Italy and South Korea.

In the interests of trade with China, Britain has been tepid[http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/parliamentary-panel-urges-britain-to-stand-up-for-hong-kong/] about pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. After meeting the Dalai Lama in May 2012, prompting the usual heated complaints from Beijing, Mr. Cameron has not done so again. China’s Global Times commented[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/829371.shtml] that Britain “should acknowledge that the U.K. is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese — it is just an old European country apt for travel and study.”

Britain has also seemed absent on Ukraine. Although a signatory with the United States and Russia on the 1994 agreement that promised Ukraine territorial sovereignty in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], Mr. Cameron was not involved in the Minsk negotiations[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/world/europe/ukraine-cease-fire-negotiated-in-minsk.html] with Russian and Ukrainian leaders.

Britain has joined the American-led coalition against the Islamic State, but only in Iraq, not in Syria. Despite concerns about the numbers of British citizens going to join ISIS, the British contribution has been modest, a few sorties a day, no more than smaller countries like the Netherlands, said Ivo Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO.

Britain has also been relatively inactive against Boko Haram in Nigeria, though it did provide considerable medical and other aid to countries hit by the spread of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. But it has done little to help the French fight Islamic extremists in Mali.

Despite pushing NATO countries to commit to annual military spending of 2 percent of gross domestic product[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/united_states_economy/gross_domestic_product/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] at the summit meeting Britain hosted last year in Wales, Mr. Cameron has let British spending fall below that figure, with further decline to come

There are two key questions, said Derek Chollet, a former United States assistant secretary of defense who is now at the German Marshall Fund of the United States[http://www.gmfus.org/]:

“As the U.K. conceives its role in the world, how big a part does it still want to play in solving problems in cooperation with the United States?” he said. “And then there is the question of capabilities — if it continues to hollow them out, it won’t be able to do that. So it’s a double whammy.”

For Mr. Daalder, now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs[http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/], “this is not a momentary blip, but a trend. A country that for decades punched well above its weight is not at its weight, or even below it. From World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], Britain was our most important military ally. It was our ally in the Europe Union. And militarily, we assumed whatever we got involved in, Britain would be there.”

Now, Mr. Daalder said, “all that has changed.”

In The Spectator[http://www.spectator.co.uk/] magazine, retired Vice Admiral Sir Jeremy Blackham and retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon argued that fighting ability had been “massively reduced.”

“Consider the glaring gaps in our capabilities,” they wrote. “No maritime patrol aircraft, loss of combat power in the Royal Navy, just three squadrons of Tornado ground attack aircraft” and “major manpower weaknesses.”

Now, Mr. Chollet said, “other countries are filling the vacuum.” Britain has “not been asserting its more traditional leadership role on the big questions of security. On Ukraine, it’s Germany, and on the Mideast and Africa, it’s increasingly France that we look to.”

Intelligence cooperation is a great exception, with exceptionally close ties on all aspects, from communications intercepts to spying.

Xenia Wickett, a former American official who directs the United States program at Chatham House[http://www.chathamhouse.org/node/3602], a policy institute, uses the analogy of a three-legged stool. The first leg is military and intelligence cooperation, the second is Britain’s membership in the European Union[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org], and the third is soft power, diplomatic wisdom and partnership.

“Cuts in the British military mean the first leg is weakening, while Britain’s possible exit from the E.U. means the second is weakening — and stools do not stand on one leg,” she said.

Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to Washington, is more sanguine, seeing a cycle in Britain’s relationship with the United States, which since 1945, he said, “has had a lot of volatility at the level of the White House and Downing Street.”

Some of Britain’s inactivity has been sensible, Mr. Meyer said. “I’m pleased we were careful on Ukraine, because there’s not a lot we could have done there. The Germans and French have been extremely active and got nowhere.”

Britain remains deeply aware that “as a permanent member of the Security Council we need to act from time to time and have the capabilities to do it,” he said. “And the Russian bear flying up and down our coast[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/world/europe/britain-scrambles-jets-to-intercept-russian-bombers.html] has raised NATO from the dead, and it will impinge in British consciousness, too.”

The French are also concerned, said Camille Grand, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research[http://www.frstrategie.org/] in Paris. “We in Paris understand that Germany is a complicated partner on defense, but the assumption is that Britain is a like-minded country ready to intervene, would spend enough on defense and remain a nuclear weapons state,” he said. “All this is being challenged, and it makes Paris feel lonely.”

The ascendance of militant extremists and criminal gangs who abduct and kill reporters, combined with rising government repression in the cause of counterterrorism, has created the biggest threat to journalism in recent times, a press advocacy group said in an annual report on Monday.

The report, ''Attacks on the Press,'' by the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the menace was especially acute for freelancers, or independent journalists, whose resources and training are often limited, and who may have no established news organization to help them when they get into trouble.

''Journalists are being caught in a terror dynamic, in which they are threatened by nonstate actors who target them and governments that restrict civil liberties including press freedom in the name of fighting terror,'' Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in announcing the report's release.

He said the report provided new insights ''into the myriad threats -- from surveillance and self-censorship to violence and imprisonment -- that make this the most deadly and dangerous period for journalists in recent history.''

The report is a collection of essays by the committee's staff and regional experts on the challenges facing journalists. Underlying themes include the deadly assaults by extremist militant groups and criminal organizations like drug cartels, as well as the press intimidation and coercion by governments.

Christiane Amanpour, a CNN journalist, wrote in the report's foreword: ''From government surveillance and censorship to computer hacking, from physical attacks to imprisonment, kidnapping and murder, the aim is to limit or otherwise control the flow of information -- an increasingly complicated effort, with higher and higher stakes.''

The report's essays include an examination of how journalists have become subjects in violent propaganda videos, most notably the beheadings of James Foley and Steven J. Sotloff last summer by the Islamic State militant group in Syria.

Other essays examine how journalists deal with the stresses of physical threats and how autocratic governments jail and intimidate journalists deemed to be security threats. The report also includes a look at different types of censorship practiced in Hong Kong, India, Libya, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and West African countries affected by the Ebola epidemic.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York, compiles databases aimed at measuring threats to press freedom around the world. They include country-by-country information on journalists who have been killed or imprisoned. Last week, in advance of its annual report, the group released a list of the 10 most censored countries.

SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea has executed 15 high-ranking government officials this year, as its leader, Kim Jong-un, continues to struggle to establish his monolithic authority more than three years after assuming power, the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers on Wednesday.

Since the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, Mr. Kim has engineered a series of executions, purges and frequent reshuffles in the governing clique he inherited. South Korean officials said that Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in his early 30s, was resorting to a mix of terror and rewards to thwart any challenge to his inexperienced leadership.

During a closed briefing Wednesday for members of Parliament in Seoul, officials from the National Intelligence Service, the main South Korean spy agency, said Mr. Kim was believed to have ordered the execution of 68 senior officials, some by machine gun, between 2012 and last year, according to two lawmakers who attended the session.

Among the 15 officials killed this year was a North Korean vice minister, who was executed in January after complaining about Mr. Kim's policy on forestation, the lawmakers said. In February, another vice minister in charge of economic planning was killed for objecting to Mr. Kim's decision to change the roof design of a building under construction in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. In March, four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, where Mr. Kim's wife, Ri Sol-ju, once performed as a singer, were executed by firing squad on espionage charges, the lawmakers said. They did not elaborate.

''Kim Jong-un is demonstrating a leadership style that brooked no excuses for not following through with his orders,'' Shin Kyoung-min, a South Korean lawmaker, told reporters, citing reports by intelligence officials. ''Those who second-guessed him are considered challenging his authority and executed to set an example for the rest,'' he said.

Mr. Shin was one of two lawmakers designated by the Parliament's intelligence committee to talk to the news media about the briefing. The National Intelligence Service declined to confirm what the two lawmakers told reporters.

Mr. Kim's ''reign of terror'' included the execution in 2013 of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek -- long considered the second-most powerful man in North Korea -- who was accused of stealing state funds and plotting to overthrow Mr. Kim.

Since eliminating his No. 2, Mr. Kim has frequently shifted jobs among his closest aides, and top generals have often been demoted and others promoted.

South Korean officials said that when Mr. Kim ordered his country to close its borders to foreign tourists last October for fear of the Ebola virus, his instruction was so strictly followed that top government officials returning from overseas trips were required to go through a 21-day quarantine, and North Korean diplomats abroad were banned from home visits. North Korea lifted the Ebola ban in early March.

Mr. Kim has spent his early years in power struggling to solidify his authority, as his country's economy has continued to flounder amid stricter international sanctions. He has made frequent visits to catfish farms, textile factories and military barracks to build his image as a caring leader and legitimate successor in his family's dynasty.

His tactics of inspiring fear of purges and stoking competition for his favor, South Korean officials said, have fostered strong resentment among North Korea's elite.

Finding the right article, Opinion piece or multimedia feature in the vast archives of a newspaper that has been publishing since 1851 can feel overwhelming to students and teachers alike.

How do you locate that famous “Men Walk on Moon” front-page article[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/gst/abstract.html?res=940DE4DB1738E63ABC4951DFB1668382679EDE] from July 21, 1969? What if you want to understand or teach current news like the nuclear negotiations with Iran[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html]? How about if you just want your digital-native students to recreate the print experience of paging through the paper and finding interesting things serendipitously?

Below, some practical tips and fun tools to help you navigate The Times — whether for research, to find the perfect article for one of our contests[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/category/student-challenge/], or simply to keep up with what’s going on in the world.

Note: Though The Learning Network and everything we link to is free without a digital subscription, many of the tools we recommend below are not. The Times grants access to 10 free articles each month — enough to begin exploring the ideas here — but if you would like to subscribe at teacher or student rates or get access for an entire school, you can learn more on The New York Times in School page[http://nytimesinschool.com/].

1. Use the New York Times “Search” Function

The logical way to start a Times search is, of course, by typing keywords into our Search page[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/]. You can sort the results by “relevance,” “oldest” or “newest.”

But there are a few tricks beyond the standard advice of using quotation marks[http://websearch.about.com/od/internetresearch/a/phrasesearch.htm] or narrower searches[http://www.kyvl.org/html/tutorial/research/narrowing.shtml] that can make your search more effective.

For instance, filtering results by date range can be especially helpful for historical research.

Say you want to find articles about the completion of the first transcontinental railroad, which was officially opened on May 10, 1869. It would be helpful to remember that, before the digital age, today’s news was typically published in tomorrow’s paper — and in 19th-century editions of the paper, news sometimes wasn’t reported for several days. So you might begin your search with May 10, 1869, but you should also search May 11 and 12. However, you would also need to know that a search using “transcontinental railroad” won’t yield any results because the train line was originally called the “Pacific Railroad[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/#/pacific+railroad/from18690510to18690511/].” Do that search, and you’ll find this four-column front-page[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E5D7113CEF34BC4952DFB3668382679FDE] spread about the national celebrations heralding this technological achievement, published on May 11, 1869.

The left column of the Search page lists additional filters as well, such as author, media type, newspaper section and even image searches.[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/imagesearch/]The Times explains how to use many of these features on its Site Search[http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/search/search/search.html] page.

2. Find Infographics, Videos and Multimedia

Features like graphs, charts, slide shows and videos that can be very useful for teaching and learning often get buried in the mountain of articles published daily. Without knowing a headline, students can have a hard time unearthing them simply using Search.

While not foolproof, additional filters can help surface those interactive features. Try these:

* “Interactive Feature”[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/?action=click&contentCollection®ion=TopBar&WT.nav=searchWidget&module=SearchSubmit&pgtype=Homepage#/*/since1851/type_of_material%3A%22Interactive%20Feature%22/]

* “Video”[http://www.nytimes.com/video]

* “Slideshow”[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/?action=click&contentCollection®ion=TopBar&WT.nav=searchWidget&module=SearchSubmit&pgtype=Homepage#/*/since1851/type_of_material%3A%22Slideshow%22/1/allauthors/]

* “Multimedia”[http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/?action=click&contentCollection®ion=TopBar&WT.nav=searchWidget&module=SearchSubmit&pgtype=Homepage#/*/since1851/document_type%3A%22multimedia%22/]

For instance, let’s say you are searching for information about the former Yankee pitcher Mariano Rivera, and you want to know if The Times has published any related infographics. Use the Interactive Features filter, and you’ll discover graphs, timelines and videos — even an award[http://www.snd-e.com/en/malofiej/4c454895b1/premios/2011]-winning 3-D video[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/13/sports/baseball/mariano-rivera-3d.html] detailing how Rivera dominated hitters. (You’ll need a pair of red-cyan glasses to get the full effect.)

3. Time Travel With Times Machine

The Times reports the loss of R.M.S. Titanic which happened on this day 103 years ago today. http://t.co/GtrSUCmrkx[http://t.co/GtrSUCmrkx]pic.twitter.com/9zTuYUALQB[http://t.co/9zTuYUALQB]

— NYT Archives (@NYTArchives) April 15, 2015[https://twitter.com/NYTArchives/status/588325922668851200]

If you’re doing historical research using The Times — or are a teacher looking for primary documents for teaching about an era or event — it can sometimes be easier (and more entertaining) to find articles by paging through the actual paper from a particular day in history.

For example, reading about the sinking of the Titanic by opening the April 16, 1912, issue[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/16/p/10] of the paper in Times Machine can lead you to discover much more than you would with just a conventional search. You can see drawings of the interior of the ship on Page 3; learn about notable passengers on Page 4; read about the chaotic scene in Times Square, where many gathered to get the latest bulletins that night, on Page 5; and find a whole page of ads for trips on other ocean liners on Page 10. Along the way you can see 1912 wedding announcements, baseball reporting and an ad for Grape-Nuts cereal that promise to cure spring fever.

Times Machine[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser] includes archived newspapers from the very first edition in 1851 to 1980. You can search within Times Machine as well, so you might try putting in the name of a ’60s rock band or the phrase “shark attacks” just to see what turns up. And our own Throwback Thursday feature[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/throwback-thursday/] highlights interesting things from Times Machine and the @NYTarchives Twitter feed[https://twitter.com/NYTArchives] each week, and we invite you to post what you find [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/throwback-thursday-yankee-stadium-the-loch-ness-monster-coney-island-postal-cats-and-more/]for possible inclusion in the feature.

4. Receive News Alerts

Whether you’re doing research on climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html] or are just want to know what’s up with Kanye West[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/kanye_west/index.html], you can easily set up a keyword or topic alert[https://myaccount.nytimes.com/mem/tnt.html], and The Times will email you whenever a new article is published.

You can also subscribe to Breaking News Alerts[https://myaccount.nytimes.com/mem/email.html] so you receive alerts about significant events in the news.

5. Get an Overview With Times Topics:

News articles in The Times often assume readers possess a basic level of background information, and students new to a topic can sometimes feel frustrated when they first delve into an article.

Times Topics[http://www.nytimes.com/pages/topics/index.html] pages can help you gain a foothold on a complex subject, whether the situation in Syria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html] or medical marijuana[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/m/marijuana/index.html]. This resource provides an automatically updated chronology that pulls article summaries from the most recent coverage for thousands of subjects. It also includes a searchable archive for all the articles tagged by editors with that topic — which is often more helpful than a typical keyword search. There you can easily locate overviews of complex topics, like this one on Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html].

6. Chronicle Changing Language Over Time

Chronicle[http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/] is a tool from NYT Labs that allows you to visualize language usage in New York Times news coverage throughout its history. All you have to do is put a word or phrase into the search box, and you’ll see a graph that shows how often the word was used in Times reporting since 1851. You can add more terms to compare your findings, since each creates a new line. And, you can click at any point in the line to see articles from that era using the term.

As the inventor of the tool herself says,[http://blog.nytlabs.com/2014/07/23/chronicle-tracking-new-york-times-language-use-over-time/] “It’s a fascinating way to see historical events, political shifts, cultural trends or stylistic tropes. Chronicle can reveal things like the rise of feminism, evolution of cultural bêtes noires or when we shifted from talking about the ‘greenhouse effect’ to talking about ‘climate change’.” Here are some more ways[http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/07/30/what-a-new-search-tool-is-turning-up/] people seem to be using the tool.

So whether you’re researching terrorism[http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=terrorism] or just fooling around with language and tracking usage of currently trendy words like “hipster[http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=hipster],” Chronicle offers an interesting and powerful way to start a Times search.

And to keep up with emerging tools, check out the site for the New York Times Research and Development Group[http://www.nytlabs.com/] and explore ideas like Lazarus[http://www.nytlabs.com/projects/lazarus.html], Kepler[http://www.nytlabs.com/projects/kepler.html] and Madison[http://www.nytlabs.com/projects/madison.html], all of which will offer new ways to surface content from Times past.

7. See What’s Most Popular

The Most Popular[http://www.nytimes.com/most-popular] lists give a quick overview of what Times readers and the online community in general are talking and thinking about. These lists can help surface popular articles you might have missed. Each of the full lists — Most Emailed[http://www.nytimes.com/most-popular-emailed], Most Viewed[http://www.nytimes.com/most-popular-viewed], Most Shared on Facebook[http://www.nytimes.com/most-popular-facebook] and Most Tweeted[http://www.nytimes.com/most-popular-tweeted] — include the 20 most popular articles ranked by day, week and month.

For example, without visiting the Most Popular lists, you might have missed Angelina Jolie’s[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html] headline-making Op-Ed explaining her decision to have a double mastectomy as a way to prevent cancer. Or you might not have seen the Modern Love column detailing how 36 questions[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html] can make you fall in love with a stranger. This week the list features pieces on everything from luxury toilet seats[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/technology/personaltech/electronic-bidet-toilet-seat-is-the-luxury-you-wont-want-to-live-without.html] to David Letterman,[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/arts/television/david-letterman-reflects-on-33-years-in-late-night-television.html]income inequality[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/business/economy/income-inequality-is-costing-the-us-on-social-issues.html] and the unrest in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/opinion/michael-eric-dyson-goodbye-to-freddie-gray-and-goodbye-to-quietly-accepting-injustice.html].

What can you stumble upon this way?

8. Reproduce the Print Front-Page Experience Online

The digital experience is different from reading the printed newspaper, and not just because the ink smell is missing. The positioning of articles and photos on the front page show what Times editors consider the most important news of the day. Use this PDF Guide to Page 1[http://nytmarketing.whsites.net/inschool/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/NYT_Guide-to-Page1_2010.pdf] to teach students newspaper vocabulary like byline, refer and ear.

You can see the day’s front page, as well as a complete list of articles published by page and section in the daily paper, using the Today’s Paper[http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html] feature. There, you can look at the difference between the Times front page for the National edition, the New York edition, and the International New York Times Europe[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/ihtfrontpage/europefrontpage.pdf] and Asia[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/ihtfrontpage/asiafrontpage.pdf] editions. How do they differ? What stories appear on all four front pages? How are they arranged differently? How, if at all, does the reporting differ? Why?

For fun, you might also play our Front Page Bingo game[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/learning/pdf/activities/Bingo-Page1_NYTLN.pdf] (PDF) to familiarize yourself or your students with how the print front page works.

10. Search The Learning Network

Over the 17 years (yes, 17 years) we have been on NYTimes.com, we have published thousands of educational resources. Since 2009 The Learning Network has been a blog, but we brought more than 3,000 lesson plans from our days as a New York Times subsite over to the new platform with us.

Finding these resources, however, can sometimes be daunting.

Just as on NYTimes.com, an obvious place to start is the Search box on The Learning Network site — and using good search practice there, too, can help you find the best Shakespeare resource[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/teaching-shakespeare-with-the-new-york-times/] in the hundreds of posts we’ve published that mention Shakespeare.

But if you can’t find what you are looking for, other less obvious tools include our Teaching Topics Index, our How To Use This Blog page[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/how-to-use-this-blog/], and our category and tagging system.

The Teaching Topics Index[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/teaching-topics/] includes a continuously updated list of resource collections and lesson plans on frequently taught books[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/classic-lit/] (like “The Great Gatsby[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/teaching-the-great-gatsby-with-the-new-york-times-2/]“), topics (like World War I[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/teaching-world-war-i-with-the-new-york-times/]) and general ideas for teaching and learning with The Times (like our “50 Ways to Teach With Current Events[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/50-ways-to-teach-current-events/].”)

Our category and tagging system helps to group articles together by subject matter. At the bottom right of each post, you can find a list of categories (bold) and tags marked for that article. Click on these to find related posts — about “To Kill a Mockingbird[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/to-kill-a-mockingbird/],” basketball[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/basketball/], or news about teenagers published in The Times[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/category/teens-in-the-times/].

Obama to Nominate Gayle Smith to Lead U.S.A.I.D.
By HELENE COOPER

WASHINGTON — President Obama will nominate Gayle Smith, a senior White House official, on Thursday to be the next administrator of the United States Agency for International Development[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/agency_for_international_development/index.html?inline=nyt-org], administration officials said.

If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Smith, a longtime development and Africa specialist in the Clinton and Obama administrations, would succeed Dr. Rajiv Shah, who left the agency in February after five years on the job.

Ms. Smith, 59, who is well-known in Washington development circles, would be responsible for leading the government’s response to humanitarian disasters like the earthquake in Nepal[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/world/asia/nepal-earthquake-international-aid-agencies.html], the refugee crisis in Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/world/middleeast/un-calls-on-western-nations-to-shelter-syrian-refugees.html] and the receding Ebola epidemic in West Africa[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/world/africa/idle-ebola-clinics-in-liberia-are-seen-as-misstep-in-us-relief-effort.html], as well as managing the agency’s $20 billion budget.

She would also have to figure out a way to duplicate her predecessor’s skillful managing of congressional Republicans. Dr. Shah was widely credited with successfully defending the agency’s budget at a time of belt-tightening and intense partisanship. He was also known for innovative programs that sought to tackle global health and development challenges in unusual ways.

For instance, last fall, during the height of the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic, Dr. Shah announced the Fighting Ebola Grand Challenge[http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/dec-12-2014-united-states-announces-results-grand-challenge-fight-ebola], in which the agency invited inventors to devise equipment[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/13/health/ebola-contest-brings-ideas-for-cooling-suits-and-virus-repellents.html] for front-line medical workers fighting Ebola. The challenge produced an entry from Johns Hopkins University, with a team that included a Baltimore wedding dress designer, Jill Andrews. She designed a simplified protective suit that takes the wearer only eight steps to shed instead of 20, thus lowering the risk of exposure to the disease.

Ms. Smith should be able to match Dr. Shah’s success, said Liz Schrayer, president of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition[http://www.usglc.org/], a group of businesses and nonprofits that supports development, in part because she has backed the same initiatives.

“Gayle supports prioritizing economic growth and making sure countries have skin in the game and are committed to real reform,” Ms. Schrayer said. “That’s where I think Republicans who have been supportive of Raj will be supportive of Gayle.”

But Dr. Shah had missteps as well. The Associated Press reported in 2014 that during his tenure, U.S.A.I.D. operated[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/us-secretly-created-cuban-twitter-stir-unrest] a social media account to encourage young Cubans to revolt against the Castro government. The secret program ran out of funds in 2012, after two years; Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, called it “dumb, dumb, dumb” after it was disclosed.

The Obama administration has since taken steps[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/world/americas/obama-cuba-summit-of-the-americas.html] to normalize relations with Cuba. But Ms. Smith will inherit other efforts from her predecessor, in particular managing the end of the battle against the Ebola epidemic and trying to ensure that the next time the virus flares up, the world has a better and faster response.

She has experience in that area. As special assistant to Mr. Obama and senior director for development and democracy on the National Security Council, she helped coordinate the administration’s response to the epidemic last year, including Mr. Obama’s decision to deploy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html] 3,000 American troops to Liberia.

Ms. Smith spent 20 years in Africa — Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya — first as a freelance journalist for the British Broadcasting Corporation, Reuters, The Associated Press and The Boston Globe, and then with nongovernmental groups. She is a co-founder of the Enough Project[http://www.enoughproject.org/] to end genocide.

Insuring for Disaster
By JEFFREY D. SACHS

Copyright 2015. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
NATURAL disasters like the devastating earthquake in Nepal[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/nepal/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] constitute a highly uncertain but quantifiable risk. No one can say for sure when a major earthquake will strike. But the fault lines are known. We need a new global system of disaster insurance, akin to how homeowners guard against calamity.

Relief teams and millions of dollars of aid are arriving in Nepal, but despite the best of intentions, emergency operations will be a desperate patchwork, and long-term rebuilding will be hampered by lack of funds, donor fatigue and red tape. That’s what happened in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, in the Philippines after a string of recent typhoons, and in the West Africa Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic. We need a better approach.

Even poor countries can take precautions, especially if international organizations help them to do it. Think of commercial airline safety, which, though not flawless, is high even in the poorest regions in the world. There is an integrated system that connects airplane manufacturers, airline companies, air-traffic controllers, global insurers and national and global regulators.

Catastrophes like earthquakes, typhoons, droughts, floods and epidemics pose quantifiable risks. These risks can’t be specified with the actuarial precision that underlies home and life insurance, but there is enough precision to allow for insurance coverage. For hundreds of years, Lloyd’s and other insurers have been diversifying the risks of even one-time events; natural hazards like earthquakes are not one-time events, but occurrences that return with calculable probabilities.

Suppose Nepal’s government could have gone shopping for earthquake insurance to cover the large-scale losses and public-sector response after a disaster. Potential underwriters would examine the probabilities of earthquakes at various magnitudes, using the historical record, seismic modeling and assessments of the vulnerabilities of the buildings.

The leading insurer, generally a reinsurance company, would then sell off its excess exposure to Nepal’s earthquake risk to other insurance companies, or even capital markets around the world via so-called catastrophe bonds and similar instruments. These risk carriers would receive part of Nepal’s premium payments, and be required to pay out to Nepal in the event of an earthquake. Nepal would be financially protected, and insurers would diversify the risk.

The original insurance underwriter would have made demands of Nepal, that it implement cost-effective earthquake-preparedness measures, like updated building and zoning codes; a disaster response plan; and emergency health systems. These steps would limit expected damages caused by natural disaster — and lower the premium and expected payout. Over time, underwriting benchmarks would be standardized around the world.

Most low-income countries and some rich ones as well are woefully unprepared for the quantifiable catastrophic risks they face, whether seismological shocks, climate-related catastrophes or epidemics. After each disaster, the afflicted countries and United Nations agencies must call on other countries to make ad hoc pledges of funds and response teams; there’s no global equivalent of the fire department. It’s often too little, too late.

How would a disaster insurance system work? World-leading reinsurers, such as Swiss Re, Munich Re and others, would bid to provide countries with the service. Governments would pay annual premiums, linked to actuarial assessments of risks, with international donor agencies like the World Bank helping to share the costs, based on the resources of the insured countries. For some large and unpredictable risks, where the private sector alone won’t provide cover, additional official financing would be blended with private funds, similar to what takes place in the United States with flood and crop insurance.

Cost-sharing with international agencies like the World Bank would have to be attractive enough for poor countries to obtain coverage on reasonable terms. For high-income donor countries, the upside would be a global system with reduced vulnerability and with less need to provide ad hoc post-disaster aid.

Insurance would reveal how vulnerable certain parts of the world are to rising costs of disasters, including those associated with global warming. But at least we’d be able to begin to account for this. It would provide a powerful way to drive mitigation and adaptation investments, a point emphasized in recent years by Rowan Douglas of the insurer Willis Group.

A global system of disaster insurance would of course not be perfect and would take time to implement, but could save many lives and livelihoods in the years ahead, and help vulnerable low-income countries like Haiti and Nepal chart a path to sustainable development.

Review: ‘Frontline’ Looks at Missteps During the Ebola Outbreak
By NEIL GENZLINGER

Correction Appended

Heartbreaking stories from the Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html] outbreak are familiar by now, although that doesn’t make them any easier to hear, and a “Frontline” installment being broadcast on PBS on Tuesday night has its share. But it also has something less familiar: Officials acknowledging that they could have done a better job of responding to the crisis.

The program traces the outbreak to its origin, thought to be a tree full of bats in Guinea. And then it charts the early weeks, before the world took much notice, including the death of a revered traditional healer known as Mendinor along the border between Guinea and Sierra Leone. The customary funeral preparation, with its washing of the body, and the well-attended ceremony were the kinds of things that turned a small-scale problem into an out-of-control one.

“The healer’s funeral was a catastrophe,” the narration says. “It set off a chain reaction of infections that would ultimately lead to thousands of deaths.”

Customs and suspicions in the villages of Africa have taken a lot of blame, but the program also points fingers elsewhere as it explores why this outbreak became so severe even though other appearances of Ebola had been contained. The World Health Organization, it suggests, initially did not respond aggressively or with the right people. A company called Metabiota that was retained by Sierra Leone to assist with the response also comes across as overmatched.

The program says that the failure to follow chains of transmission early in the crisis cost lives. And at least one official candidly agrees.

“Contact tracing, I would say, is where we got it wrong,” says Dr. Amara Jambai, director of disease and prevention control for Sierra Leone’s health ministry. “We wasted like a month.”

More analysis of the Ebola outbreak lies ahead, of course, and much of it will no doubt come in the form of dry reports that certainly won’t be television-friendly. The “Frontline” examination does a nice job of at least beginning to ask the questions that need to be asked while keeping the human drama front and center.

Correction: May 5, 2015, Tuesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A television review on Monday about a “Frontline” report on PBS about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa last year misstated a word in a comment by Dr. Amara Jambai, the director of disease prevention and control for Sierra Leone’s healthy ministry. He said, “Contact tracing, I would say, is where we got it wrong,” not “contract tracing.”

Although much of the country has barely noticed, avian influenza[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/avian-influenza/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] — a version of the virus that generated “Killer Bird Flu!” headlines a decade ago — is now sweeping the Midwest.

More than 20 million turkeys and chickens have died or been culled; Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin have declared states of emergency; and teams of experts are trying to figure out how the new virus is spreading.

No humans have caught this flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], but health officials fear they might. They are requiring that cullers and barn-cleaners wear the kind of protective gear that Ebola workers do. Officials have also advised that everyone who was recently in contact with affected poultry operations — workers, truckers, veterinarians and so on — take Tamiflu[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/tamiflu-drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a flu preventive.

This is not the Asian H5N1 flu virus, which has killed 440 of the 826 people known to have gotten it since 2003. But the three avian flus found in this country since December are related to it — each produced, scientists believe, when the Asian H5N1, an efficient killer of birds and people, mixed with less dangerous avian strains.

No one knows how lethal any of the new viruses might be to humans. But because the virus spreading in the Midwest can wipe out most of a flock in two days, all are assumed to be dangerous.

The authorities are preparing for the panic that may ensue if someone catches one of these viruses and dies. Still, officials, say, most Americans are in little danger. The overall risks pale compared with those posed by well-known mortal threats that elicit no panic: car crashes, bee stings, bathroom falls and so on.

“We deem this a low human health risk — low, but not zero,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “So far, we don’t have worrisome signs. But we don’t want to be overly reassuring, because with influenza, we always take events quite seriously.”

The three flu viruses found recently in American birds are an H5N8, an H5N2 and a new H5N1.

The new H5N1 virus has been found only in three wild birds in Washington State. The H5N8 virus, moving south from Canada in December, infected a few poultry farms in California and Idaho but has not been reported recently.

The H5N2 virus, however, is spreading rapidly in Midwest poultry operations and is the largest such outbreak in North American history.

The lethal ancestor of all three viruses, the Asian H5N1, was first identified in 1997 when it killed six people in Hong Kong. To stop it, every chicken in the territory was slaughtered, and poultry imports from China were banned.

The virus disappeared, although experts assume it circulated in China without being reported. It re-emerged in Hong Kong in 2003 and has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa.

It has killed people in Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Cambodia, China and elsewhere — most of whom had contact with live poultry, often in backyard flocks. A few infections appear to have been transmitted within families after one member nursed another.

That Asian virus has never been found in the Western Hemisphere. But the flu viruses spreading here now contain some of its genes, including those for the H — for hemagglutinin — “spike” it uses to attach to cells.

The H5N8 virus is thought to have emerged before 2014, when Asian H5N1 mixed with a milder duck flu in China with a different “N” gene. (“N” stands for neuraminidase, the protein “helicopter blade” that chops away receptors on a cell’s surface so virus particles can escape. There are 18 H shapes and 11 N shapes, and each virus has six other genes that also determine its lethality.)

That H5N8 spread to Japan, Russia and Europe before turning up in Canada.

The H5N2 and the new H5N1 have some North American genes and so clearly emerged on this continent more recently — presumably when the H5N8 virus finally arrived and crossed with North American strains.

That may have happened last summer. Migratory ducks, geese and swans from around the world share ponds in the Arctic in summer. New flu gene mixes emerge and move south along the various migratory paths taken by the birds.

Whatever the mix of genes, dose size is also important in determining spread of the virus, said Dr. Peter Palese, a flu expert at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

Human flus can infect people who inhale only one to 10 virus particles, he said, but it takes 100,000 to 1 million particles of an H5 bird flu to infect a human.

“That’s why people who sleep under their chickens in markets in Asia get it, and we don’t get it on Fifth Avenue,” Dr. Palese said.

In birds, flu is primarily an intestinal disease rather than a respiratory one, so cullers and cleaners are told to wear coveralls, face masks and goggles to prevent any barn dust — much of which is powdered feces — from entering their noses, mouths or eyes.

Dr. Palese says he believes they should wear the full hoods with battery-powered air filters used in biosafety Level 3 laboratories.

Officials, he said, should also consider giving them the vaccines developed years ago against H5N1. Although it would not be a perfect match, it might provide some protection.

Several million doses of an experimental vaccine are in the National Strategic Stockpile, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

It was created in the early days of panic over the Asian H5N1.

Blood samples from people who received the experimental vaccine years ago are now being tested to see if they contain antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that help protect against the new flus, a C.D.C. official said.

The agency has also begun work on a vaccine against the new H5N8 virus, Dr. Schuchat said, and can make one against H5N2 virus, as well. But producing it in large quantities can take months or even a year.

To cull birds, farm operators normally cover them with a suffocating carbon dioxide foam. As they decompose, said Henry L. Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who tracks genetic changes in flus, the heat generated kills the virus and the carcasses can be used as compost.

But that stops poultry production in the barn for weeks.

Other methods include incineration in portable kilns, and burial, though each have drawbacks. With burial, rotting birds could end up in the water table; with incineration, infectious feathers or other particles could blow up the stack and into the wind.

Because the virus lives in dried feces and feathers that could blow off trucks, the risks to humans could increase drastically, Dr. Niman warned, if dead birds are removed from the barns prematurely.

“I’m worried that this is getting so big that they may cut corners,” he said.

State health officials in the 16 affected states are monitoring all exposed people for 10 days, said Lenee Blanton, a C.D.C. epidemiologist.

Those with diabetes[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], compromised immune systems or any other conditions that would make flu complications more serious should be prescribed antiviral medicines like Tamiflu or Relenza even if they have no symptoms.

In Asia, Dr. Niman said, even dogs that ate carcasses of culled birds caught the H5N1 flu.

“It’s like Ebola — it’s only going to take one person who dies, and they aren’t going to believe the C.D.C. saying ‘low risk, no risk.’” he said. ”People will panic.”

World Bank's Pension Holdings Clash With Its Carbon Policies
By REUTERS

WASHINGTON — The World Bank[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org] indirectly invests part of its $18.8 billion employee pension fund in companies in industries like coal and tobacco, holdings that clash with the development institution’s own calls for ethical and low-carbon investing.

In an internal post to staff members seen by Reuters, the World Bank’s treasurer said that about 40 percent of the pension fund’s equity holdings were actively or passively invested against equity index funds, which include companies in industries associated with environmental and health problems.

Reuters viewed discussions between staff members and managers on an internal World Bank website and a research note produced by bank employees. The note expressed concern about the pension and gave details of the holdings, questioning why the bank does not use socially responsible alternatives.

In its own lending practices across the developing world, the bank refuses to invest in tobacco production and has banned financial support for the construction of coal-fired electricity plants except for the poorest countries that lack other options.

The Washington-based bank’s pension fund, details of whose holdings have not previously been reported, was ranked a “laggard” in transparency and managing climate risks in a report released last week by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, which pushes asset owners to address climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] risks. It ranked lower than the pension funds of British Coal and the state oil fund of Azerbaijan, among other companies.

“It’s very difficult for the bank to take a position where it is promoting sustainable growth and not managing the risks in their large portfolio — or telling anyone about it,” said Julian Poulter, chief executive of the initiative.

While the pension fund is required to prioritize financial gains for staff members, investment analysts said it could be directed into prescreened or tailored funds that exclude companies that fail to follow sound environmental, social and governance principles.

The bank’s pension fund assets are held in a separate legal trust administered by its Pension Finance Committee, which has as its chairman the World Bank’s chief financial officer and includes a mix of members from management, employees and retirees. External managers run the funds on a day-to-day basis. The pension committee did not respond to Reuters request for comment.

The World Bank has a responsibility to manage the money “in the best interest of plan beneficiaries,” the bank said in a statement to Reuters.

The bank said it did not comment on specific pension investments, adding that it opted for a “principled yet pragmatic approach” within the fund’s overall requirements that considers environmental, social and governance principles “where material and relevant.”

That is guided by federal law that requires a plan’s investment policy to have the “exclusive purpose” of providing benefits to participants, though pension providers have flexibility on which investment principles to pursue.

The bank has called on others to divest from fossil fuel companies, and its president, Jim Yong Kim, has asked long-term investors “to recognize their fiduciary responsibility” to disclose their exposure to climate change-related impacts.

The bank is conducting a review of its corporate sustainability policies, but says its pension fund investments are not included in that process because they have a separate governance structure.

Participation in the pension fund — a combination of defined-benefit and defined-contribution savings — is mandatory for World Bank employees. It has about 15,000 current employees and around 10,000 retired beneficiaries.

Kenneth Lay, the vice president of the World Bank alumni group — the 1818 Society — said the fund should focus on maximizing returns.

While there is some evidence that investment made according to environmental, social and governance principles can improve “risk adjusted performance,” he said, “there is also extensive literature reaching the opposite conclusion.”

Some of the pension’s holdings are invested in the Russell 3000 index, which tracks 3,000 companies including Peabody Coal and Arch Coal and the tobacco giant Philip Morris, according to the research note by World Bank employees. Others are invested in funds tied to Morgan Stanley’s MSCI index, which includes major fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil, according to that note.

MSCI and other indexes offer portfolios that screen out companies in industries with perceived ethical problems.

Some of these funds have performed as well as or better than the bank’s current investments. The MSCI’s two Fossil Fuels Exclusion Indexes have outperformed the main MSCI index for the past three years, according to annual performance fact sheets.

In its statement to Reuters, the bank said that were it to consider such funds, it “would have to be convinced of their superior return and risk properties in order to make the investment consistent with fiduciary responsibilities.”

In a blog post on the bank’s internal website last October, some employees argued that the bank’s target of 3.5 percent annual real returns could be met through socially responsible investments, and raised concerns that the bank’s pension investments contradict its public mission.

Bank employees have investment choices within their plans, but none offer ethical alternatives, they said.

In response, Madelyn Antoncic, treasurer of the World Bank, posted that “things aren’t always black and white.” She cited the case of a bio-medical subsidiary of the tobacco company Reynolds American which is working to develop a vaccine for the Ebola virus from modified tobacco leaves.

Ms. Antoncic, who oversees more than $140 billion in World Bank assets as well as the pension fund, said that 60 percent of the plan’s equity holdings are in separately managed accounts.

Several other large pension funds have shifted toward more ethical investments.

Norway’s $850 billion Government Pension Global Fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sovereign_wealth_funds/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], announced in February that it had moved out of companies connected to Alberta’s oil sands[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_petroleum_and_gasoline/oil_sands/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and gold mining companies. And the $53 billion staff pension fund of the United Nations invested in two low-carbon funds by BlackRock and State Street last December.

Tracing the Ebola Outbreak, Scientists Hunt a Silent Epidemic

Scientists are using blood samples collected throughout the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak to map the virus’s spread from country to country by tracking tiny mutations in its gene sequences.

The picture is not yet complete, but intriguing discoveries have been made. Virus mutations first detected in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] last spring were found later in Liberia[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/7/15-0522_article] and Mali[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/348/6230/117.abstract], and scientists are examining whether this resulted from the chance movements of people across borders.

And while some scientists think it is unlikely that the mutations made a difference in how the virus functioned, others are looking at whether this version of the virus had properties that made it more capable of causing infection.

Scientists look for viral mutations because of their potential influence on the effectiveness of diagnostics or treatments. Researchers have changed Ebola diagnostic tests and experimental treatments based on information about how the virus has evolved from previous outbreaks to the one in West Africa.

Genetic mutations are also beginning to serve as a tool to understand the overall course of the epidemic, which could offer insights into how to improve the response to future outbreaks. “They let us trace history,” said Daniel J. Park, group leader of viral computational genomics at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard.

Tracking changes in the virus’s genetic sequence is an objective endeavor, unlike interviewing people on the ground. “We can tell you with a high likelihood that this sequence is derived from this other sequence,” said Jeffrey R. Kugelman, the chief of the bioinformatics branch of the Center for Genomic Sciences at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

But epidemiologists’ interviews rely heavily “on the quality of your conversations with people, and whether they’re telling the truth and whether they understood the situation properly,” he said.

Still, making sense of the scientific evidence from sequencing relies on good records about where and when the samples were taken. Both strategies are needed to tell a full story, said Edward C. Holmes, a fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia. “Combined, they’re very powerful,” he said.

Sequences of viruses from only about 250 people were made publicly available[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966] during the first year of the outbreak in West Africa, which is thought to have infected 25,000. Scientists have assigned the sequences[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/345/6202/1369.full] to three clusters plus the original versions of the virus discovered in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] in March 2014. The three clusters are slightly mutated descendants of the Guinean viruses, and they were found circulating in Sierra Leone two to three months later.

One of the most intriguing findings so far is that viral descendants of what is known as cluster two have been found in the blood samples of all Liberian Ebola patients whose viruses have been sequenced and made public[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/7/15-0522_article], and in patients in Mali[http://www.sciencemag.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/348/6230/117.abstract] who had traveled from and lived in Guinea.

Based on scientific publications, documents and interviews with people in Sierra Leone, cluster two was first detected in a blood sample drawn on May 23 from Victoria Yillah, one of the country’s first confirmed Ebola patients.

According to interviews with Ms. Yillah, who survived, and her relatives and neighbors in eastern Sierra Leone, people with symptoms of Ebola had already been dying for well over two months, as the outbreak went unrecognized[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html] by the authorities. Some of them crossed over to Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Guinea, they said.

Sierra Leone’s silent epidemic of illness and death can be traced back to late February 2014 with the sickness of a woman named Sia Wanda Koniono[http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/01/02/how-times-reporters-unraveled-the-ebola-epidemic/]. She fell ill in the Kailahun district when she returned to the country after traveling in Guinea, according to people close to her. Ms. Koniono crossed back to Guinea for medical treatment, where she died. Others exposed to her there were later confirmed to have Ebola, said Dr. Michel van Herp of Doctors Without Borders.

A report by officers working for the World Health Organization and Guinea, which has not been made public, shows that officials there knew in March about Ms. Koniono’s probable Ebola death and the illness of her daughter. However, this information was never followed up on by tracing their contacts across the border in Sierra Leone, according to local officials.

Doctors Without Borders staff members said in interviews that they knew about Ms. Koniono, too, and that one worker sent an email mentioning her to Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, then the point person for viral hemorrhagic diseases in Kenema, Sierra Leone, in late March, and to a laboratory worker there in early April. But those emails were not answered and may never have been opened, the laboratory worker said, as Internet connections were intermittent. Dr. Khan later died of Ebola.

By sequencing more blood samples taken in Guinea at important times, scientists say it may be possible to determine whether Ms. Yillah’s version of the virus did indeed arise in Sierra Leone during the months when the virus was probably spreading there silently, and then re-seeded in Liberia and Guinea, ultimately becoming a dominant version of the virus in those countries.

“This sort of dramatic change in the virus population could be explained by chance,” said Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a Harvard professor and computational biologist at the Broad Institute.

Still, she said, her laboratory and others are studying the function of the virus, looking to see whether there is any possibility that the mutations might have made that version of the virus more capable of infecting people just at the time the epidemic exploded.

“The genome of the virus is so small, and this outbreak so devastating,” Dr. Sabeti said, “as a scientific community, we should leave no stone unturned.”

Every time I write about an epidemic — Ebola in 2014, swine flu in 2009, H5N1 avian flu in 2004-6, SARS in 2003 — I have to gauge whether I’m adding to the panic, calming the panic, or maybe underplaying something that calls for a little panic, meaning a more vigorous effort to stamp it out.

Until it’s all over, I never know whether I did the right thing. Outbreaks are capricious.

On Ebola, I blew it. During the first few months of 2014, as reports trickled out of West Africa, I wrote very little: a short article in March[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/health/ebola-killing-scores-in-guinea-threatens-nearby-nations.html] saying that Ebola had killed 59 people in Guinea and that officials were worried it would spread. A brief[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/africa/guinea-government-bans-bat-soup-to-halt-ebola-outbreak.html] a couple of days later saying the government of Guinea had banned bat soup.

Editors asked me about it several times, and my reaction was: “People flip over Ebola because everyone remembers Richard Preston’s book ‘The Hot Zone’ or that Dustin Hoffman-Rene Russo movie ‘Outbreak’ and thinks victims explode with blood like zombies. But it’s actually not that communicable. There have been 18 outbreaks since it was discovered in 1976, and the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders have contained all of them. They’ll contain this one.”

At the time, I was focused on MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had killed over 100 people in the Middle East. It was spreading inside hospitals, and had reached Europe and Asia, and even Indiana[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/health/mers-virus-found-in-united-states-for-first-time.html] and Florida[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/health/second-case-of-mers-virus-is-announced.html]. It was exotic in that it involved bats and camels. And it was a threat because no one was sure how it spread and the annual pilgrimage to Mecca[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/health/guarding-against-disease-among-pilgrims-to-mecca.html] would start in October.

In retrospect, I guessed wrong. After some government infighting, the Saudis got MERS mostly under control[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/world/middleeast/flawed-saudi-response-fueled-outbreak-of-mers-middle-east-virus.html] by summer (it appears to be seasonal, spreading fastest after baby camels are born in winter). Meanwhile, Ebola exploded in West Africa, killed almost 11,000 people and took a massive global effort to contain.

Actually, many Americans did not care about Ebola until August[http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/10/15/356098903/ebola-in-the-united-states-what-happened-when], after two Americans, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, a missionary nurse caught it. Fear soared when it was announced that they would come home for treatment.

Ultimately, The New York Times wrote so much about Ebola that our foreign coverage and photography won Pulitzer Prizes[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/business/media/21pulitzer-winners-finalists.html].

With today’s article about avian influenza[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/health/a-flu-epidemic-that-threatens-birds-not-humans.html?ref=science], I could be accused of overcompensating. I’m now trying to head off a bird flu panic before it happens — knowing it might never erupt.

For months, I’ve been watching alarming reports from virus-watchers — the H5N8 virus moving down from Canada into the Pacific Northwest in December, a new H5N1 being found in a few birds, then this H5N2 arriving in Minnesota in March. When editors have asked, I’ve answered: “If you’re a bird, it’s a pandemic. Otherwise, this is a business story, not a medical story. The poultry industry is terrified.”

And, in fact, my colleague Stephanie Strom wrote exactly that[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/brought-by-wild-neighbors-a-deadly-flu-attacks-turkey-flocks.html] in April.

But as it spread, and Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa declared emergencies, I kept thinking about how afraid Americans were from 2004 through 2006.

H5N1 was new and exotic then. No one had ever heard of bird flu. (Since you never hear sneezes from inside trees, people barely believed it existed.)

It sounded like a joke — but it killed. Only about 800 people have caught it, but about half have died. The 1918 Spanish flu had a 2 percent kill rate.

And suddenly it was spreading fast. First detected in Hong Kong, it leapt to western China[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/11/health/11flu.html], up to Russia[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/world/europe/21flu.html], west to Azerbaijan and finally to a Scottish swan[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/07/world/europe/07britain.html]. It went southwest to Egypt and Nigeria[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/international/africa/12assess.html], southeast into Cambodia and Indonesia.

More than 200 million birds died or were culled. As it ricocheted among them, fear grew that it would mutate or cross into pigs or dogs and gene-swap to become a disease of mammals.

Eminent virologists were divided about how likely that was. Our Science staff was divided. On March 28, 2006, we devoted a special issue of Science Times to the disease. Elisabeth Rosenthal and I wrote dueling front-page profiles: hers[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/health/28skep.html] of a scientist who thought it would not mutate, mine[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/health/28worr.html] of one who fretted that it could kill five to 150 million people. (Yes, I guessed wrong again. At least, so far.)

Now, a version of what so many feared has come to pass. An H5 bird flu is solidly in the American heartland. It’s not the Asian H5N1, but it’s a descendant.

Probably because scientists and the media overplayed the threat back then, we’ve all heard of bird flu, and no one seems too worried.

But I imagined that could all change overnight if an American – a farmer, a culler, a veterinarian — caught it, the same way everything changed when Brantly and Writebol caught Ebola.

Suddenly, everyone with a parakeet would feel at risk, a driver passed on a highway by a chicken truck would fear he or she had driven through a toxic cloud. Someone who’d had the big bucket at KFC would clutch his or her throat.

Realistically, the threat to the average American would still not be very great. Still, that seemed worth describing. After all, the Ebola threat to average Americans was never great either. But a few of us worried anyway.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] on Wednesday reported the lowest weekly total of new cases in the West Africa Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic this year, calling it an encouraging development but expressing caution about complacency until all infections from the highly contagious virus have been eradicated.

In an update posted on the organization’s website, it reported 18 confirmed Ebola cases for the week ended last Sunday — nine each in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. In Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the third country that has been ravaged by Ebola, the patient with the last confirmed case died on March 27 and was buried on March 28. If no new cases are reported through Saturday, 42 days from that burial, the outbreak will be declared officially over in Liberia. The number of deaths from the Ebola outbreak, which began more than a year ago, totaled at least 11,005 as of Sunday, the update said.

Business Day
Company Creates Bioethics Panel on Trial Drugs

Johnson & Johnson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/johnson_and_johnson/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has appointed a nationally known bioethicist to create a panel that will make decisions about patients’ requests for lifesaving medicine, responding to an emotional debate over whether companies should allow desperately ill people to have access to the drugs before they are approved.

The move, to be announced by the company on Thursday, is believed to be the first of its kind in the industry and, given the size and influence of the drug maker, could inspire other companies to follow suit. It comes as a small but growing number of patients with terminal illnesses have sought the right to obtain drugs still in the testing phase that show promise for treating their diseases.

Some of the requests have become highly publicized cases on social media, where family members and advocates have lobbied the companies on patients’ behalf — often to no avail because drug makers fear that doing so would interfere with clinical trials, or, in the case of the Ebola outbreak, that they have too little available. The issue, which involves fundamental questions of fairness and equal access to care, has become so intense that more than a dozen states have taken up legislation to speed the process.

Johnson & Johnson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/johnson_and_johnson/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said the bioethicist, Arthur L. Caplan[http://www.med.nyu.edu/pophealth/faculty/caplaa01] of New York University, who has written extensively about the issue of experimental drug availability — known as “compassionate use” — would oversee an independent panel of doctors, ethicists and patient advocates that will review requests for access to a limited array of experimental medicines and decide how Johnson & Johnson should respond.

The pilot program will be funded by the company but will have no influence on the panel’s decisions, Johnson & Johnson said, adding that payments will go directly to the university. Dr. Caplan will not be paid in his work in the program.

Dr. Caplan, who has argued that the industry needs a fairer, more consistent system for deciding whose requests should be granted, said he was intrigued when company executives approached him about the idea. “If we could structure this right, this would be a chance to not just complain about what’s wrong, but maybe to suggest a way forward,” he said in an interview.

Drug companies have been granting emergency access[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/how-dying-patients-get-access-to-experimental-drugs.html] to their unapproved drugs since the AIDS[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic of the 1980s, when the Food and Drug Administration set up a process to help desperate patients get experimental treatments. The F.D.A. typically signs off on use of unapproved drugs, but not until the company agrees.

But saying yes is not so simple: Manufacturers often have a limited supply of such treatments, leading to anguished decisions over who should be given the products. The unproved drugs also might not work, or could even cause harm. And the time and resources involved in granting access to such drugs could delay efforts to get them approved for a much wider population of needy patients, especially at smaller companies. In the case of the Ebola epidemic, last year the F.D.A. allowed the makers of ZMapp, an experimental treatment, to be used on a handful of patients, but the company quickly exhausted its limited supply.

“There’s no stock answer — yes or no, black or white,” said Richard Klein, director of the F.D.A.’s patient liaison program. “Maybe you can take that responsibility off the company.”

There is no reliable data on how many requests pharmaceutical companies receive, but the F.D.A. grants nearly all of them. In the 2014 fiscal year, the agency approved 1,873 requests[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/DrugandBiologicApprovalReports/INDActivityReports/ucm373560.htm] from companies to grant what it calls “expanded access,” an 85 percent increase over the 2010 fiscal year, when it approved 1,014 requests.

Some patients and their families have started campaigns on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to try to shame companies into granting their request. In 2014, the family of Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old boy suffering from a life-threatening infection, appealed to followers on Facebook[https://www.facebook.com/SaveJoshHardy] and Twitter after Chimerix[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/chimerix-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org], a company that was developing an experimental antiviral treatment[http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/08/27/rescue-me-the-challenge-of-compassionate-use-in-the-social-media-era/], turned down their request.

Within days, supporters bombarded the company and its top executives with thousands of calls, emails and Twitter messages pleading for relief.

@chimerix[https://twitter.com/chimerix] Please make the ethical choice for Compassionate Care Use. Josh, doesn't have 1-2 years to wait for Brincidofovir. #SaveJosh[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveJosh?src=hash] — Scout (@77atticus) March 9, 2014[https://twitter.com/77atticus/status/442808130859040770]

“@Max_Cure[https://twitter.com/Max_Cure]: This boy can be saved by @chimerix[https://twitter.com/chimerix] and they say no. #savejosh[https://twitter.com/hashtag/savejosh?src=hash] There is no more time. pic.twitter.com/enlEUrlqLy[http://t.co/enlEUrlqLy]” Save Josh!!! — Jen Boudin (@Jen_Boudin) March 9, 2014[https://twitter.com/Jen_Boudin/status/442791711753125888]

Chimerix[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/chimerix-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org] quickly announced that it had set up a 20-patient clinical trial that Josh and similar patients would be able to enroll in. Josh responded to the treatment and is said to be doing well.

“It used to be you would call your local news and try to beg them to cover you,” Dr. Caplan said. “Now you build this giant Twitter thing and you make the media come to you.”

But that has only created a new kind of inequality. “The social media side is now driving attention, but it only does for those who know how to use it,” he said.

The problem, some say, is that drug makers have inconsistent approaches.

“Too often with these sorts of scenarios, it’s handled in different ways in different companies, and even within the same company, different people may have different results,” said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospitalwho recently wrote about compassionate use[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle1409465] in The New England Journal of Medicine. Johnson & Johnson’s program, while limited, “might be a model for how we could move forward,” he said.

Several states have recently passed so-called Right to Try laws[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/us/patients-seek-right-to-try-new-drugs.html], which seek to sidestep F.D.A. approval of the process. But critics of the bills, which are also pending in other states, point out that the major roadblock is not the F.D.A. but the companies themselves, which still must grant permission.

Not all social media campaigns have succeeded. The family of Nick Auden, a father of three with advanced skin cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/skin-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], went public[http://www.savelockysdad.com/] in 2013 seeking to persuade Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb to reverse their decisions denying Mr. Auden access to then-experimental cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] treatments that were in late-stage clinical trials. Mr. Auden had been accepted into a trial for Merck’s drug, but was later disqualified after being hospitalized for a partial bowel obstruction[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/intestinal-obstruction/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

[Video: Watch on YouTube.[http://youtube.com/embed/3teA62o5eLY]]

The family gathered 500,000 signatures on an online petition, thousands of followers on Facebook and even the support of celebrities like the British comedian Ricky Gervais.

But their efforts were not successful and Mr. Auden died in November 2013[http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24625182/nick-auden-who-lobbied-use-experimental-skin-cancer]. ”It was horrendous to fight the cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], as well as to fight for compassionate use,” said Amy Auden, Mr. Auden’s wife. Ms. Auden said she was aware of the complex ethical issues in approving such requests, but added: “I think each of them can be addressed if companies were to turn their mind to it, and address it as part of their business model. But I know they don’t want to play God.”

She applauded Johnson & Johnson’s move and said she hoped other companies would follow suit.

Four months after Mr. Auden’s death, Merck approved an expanded-access program for patients who could demonstrate a critical need for its drug, now called Keytruda, and it was approved by the F.D.A. last September[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm412802.htm] and hailed as a breakthrough for melanoma[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/melanoma/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] patients.

Merck said it had expanded access to the drug only after the company could provide adequate supply to patients — before that, it said, all supplies were allocated to the clinical trials then underway. Merck said it provided early access to Keytruda to more than 3,800 patients worldwide. Its policy for approving any requests for unapproved drugs is based on several factors, including the severity of a patient’s condition, whether the treatment is likely to help and whether the patient has exhausted all other options.

“Merck is dedicated to making our medicines available to all patients who may benefit from them as soon as possible,” a spokeswoman, Pamela Eisele, said in a statement.

Officials at Johnson & Johnson said that they had not kept track — until now — of how many compassionate use requests the company received, but that it probably fielded at least 100 requests a year for unapproved drugs to treat everything from cancer to infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, the chief medical officer at Johnson & Johnson, said patients were responding to the fact that her company — and others — were developing breakthrough drugs with a real potential to save lives.

New cancer drugs like Keytruda, for example, are harnessing the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells and yielding encouraging results. Johnson & Johnson’s experimental treatment for multiple myeloma[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/multiple-myeloma/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], daratumumab, is also generating excitement. It is currently in late-stage clinical trials.

“This comes at a time when innovation in science offers great potential for patients, great promise,” Dr. Waldstreicher said. “We believe there is a continued need for processes that are both fair and objective and, most important, patient-centered.”

The company has not yet said which treatments will be included in the program, but Dr. Caplan said the list would include no more than two or three drugs initially, although it could be expanded if it is deemed a success. Patients would receive the treatment free if their request was approved.

Drug companies often waive payment for drugs in such cases because they are permitted to charge only manufacturing and other direct costs of the product. Because the market prices of drugs are often many times higher, some companies pay for a drug rather than make its cost public, Dr. Caplan and others have said.

Even if drug costs are covered, patients could be responsible for other expenses, such as the cost for a doctor to administer the drug or provide other care related to the treatment. Insurance companies do not always cover those costs for experimental drugs, said Mark Fleury, a policy expert at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network[http://www.acscan.org/].

Gates to Fund Child Mortality Initiative

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plans to create a network of disease-surveillance teams in poor countries to do ''minimal autopsies'' on children to plumb causes of child mortality and also possibly spot emerging epidemics, the foundation announced Wednesday.

Although the effort will be modest at first -- a $75 million donation to start small teams in six countries -- the foundation hopes to expand to as many as 25 Asian and African countries, with dozens of members on each team.

The network will include the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University's Global Health Institute.

The surveillance teams could fill a crucial gap in detecting disease outbreaks. Local news outlets sometimes report unusual clusters of illnesses and deaths, reports of which may reach the World Health Organization in Geneva or circle the world on disease-surveillance websites. But it can still take days or weeks until the true cause is determined. That happened in rural Guinea when West Africa's large Ebola outbreak first began smoldering, for example.

Ideally, the teams will visit families as soon as possible after children die, ask about their symptoms and, if given permission, photograph the bodies and take needle biopsies from lungs, brains, livers, spleens, kidneys and other organs. The samples will be sent to W.H.O.-certified regional laboratories or to the C.D.C. in Atlanta to establish the cause of each child's death.

This kind of network ''will help make the world a healthier, safer place,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C.'s director.

Although the teams will initially focus on one limited area each, once they are trained, it will be possible to send them to any area where mysterious illnesses erupt.

''Their day jobs will be tracing childhood deaths, but if needed, they could be repurposed to track an epidemic,'' said Dr. Scott F. Dowell, a former C.D.C. epidemiologist who is now the foundation's deputy director for epidemiology and surveillance.

One public health expert called the idea ''provocative'' and potentially very useful.

''If it can be done in a culturally sensitive way, so that parents will permit the biopsies and the photographs, we could learn a whole heck of a lot,'' said Dr. William Schaffner, the chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University's medical school.

The network is to be known as Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance, or Champs.

The Mystery Behind an Eye That Changed Color

How can a viral infection change the color of a person’s eye? Months after Dr. Ian Crozier thought he had recovered from Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/health/weeks-after-his-recovery-ebola-lurked-in-a-doctors-eye.html], he was stunned to find himself developing intense eye pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/eye-pain/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and fading vision. The inside of his left eye was still occupied territory, full of live, replicating virus. And one morning during this siege, he looked in the mirror and saw that his iris had changed from blue to green.

Although such color changes are rare, they do occur from time to time during viral infections, eye doctors say. Herpes[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/herpes-simplex/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] viruses are the most common cause, but other viruses can do the same thing. The changes in hue are almost always permanent.

But in Dr. Crozier’s case, his eye color went back to normal as he recovered. Why only one eye was affected, and how the changes happened are mysteries. His doctors could not explain them, and two outside experts were also stumped, particularly when the blue-green shift reversed itself.

“I’ve been doing what I do for 40 years and I’ve never seen such a reversibility,” said Dr. C. Stephen Foster, a clinical professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and the chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution.

Usually, he said, when the eye changes color, it is because a virus has killed pigmented cells in the iris.

Before seeing a photograph of Dr. Crozier’s eye, Dr. Foster said, “The only thing I can conceive of in terms of logic, with respect to reversibility, is that the cell, although infected by virus, though not outright killed, is damaged.”

The damage may have led to the change, which then went away when the cells recovered, he suggested.

But when Dr. Foster saw the picture of Dr. Crozier’s strangely green eye, he called it “impressive” and abandoned his first theory.

“I will say that looking at the overall general structure of the iris itself, it looks awfully healthy,” Dr. Foster said. “The green color is perfectly homogeneous.”

The evenness of the color, he said, made him suspect that some alteration in metabolism in the iris might have produced a chemical that caused the color changes.

“I’m thinking it’s a consequence of the viral infection itself, that has caused a transformation in the metabolism of the iris cells that is uniform everywhere,” Dr. Foster said.

Asked what exactly that metabolic change might be, he said, “I would have to beg off.”

But he added, that given the number of Ebola cases, “if this is part and parcel to the infection, one is going to see this repeatedly.”

Dr. Jennifer E. Thorne, chief of ocular immunology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, also ruled out the usual suspects in Dr. Crozier’s case.

“I’m left with edema[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/swelling/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], or swelling of the iris,” Dr. Thorne said. “Maybe it could diffusely affect the iris, and if the edema goes away, the normal structure and color could return.”

But she added: “I’m not sure. It’s very fascinating.”

Ebola hid in doctor’s eye, signaling new mysteries

When Dr. Ian Crozier was released from Emory University Hospital in October after a long, brutal fight with Ebola that nearly ended his life, his medical team thought he was cured. But less than two months later, he was back at the hospital with fading sight, intense pain and soaring pressure in his left eye.

Test results were chilling: The inside of Dr. Crozier’s eye was teeming with Ebola.

His doctors were amazed. They had considered the possibility that the virus had invaded his eye, but they had not really expected to find it. Months had passed since Dr. Crozier became ill while working in an Ebola treatment ward in Sierra Leone for the World Health Organization. By the time he left Emory, his blood was Ebola-free. Although the virus may persist in semen for months, other body fluids were thought to be clear of it once a patient recovered. Almost nothing was known about the ability of Ebola to lurk inside the eye.

Despite the infection within his eye, Dr. Crozier’s tears and the surface of his eye were virus-free, so he posed no risk to anyone who had casual contact with him.

More than a year after the epidemic in West Africa was recognized, doctors are still learning about the course of the disease and its lingering effects on survivors. Information about the aftermath of Ebola has been limited because past outbreaks were small: no more than a few hundred cases, often with death rates of 50 percent to 80 percent. But now, with at least 10,000 survivors in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, patterns are emerging.

Dr. Crozier, 44, ruefully calls himself a poster child for ‘‘post-Ebola syndrome’’: Besides eye trouble, he has had debilitating joint and muscle pain, deep fatigue and hearing loss. Similar problems are being reported in West Africa, but it is not clear how common, severe or persistent they are. There have even been reports of survivors left completely blind or deaf, but these accounts are anecdotal and unconfirmed.

Doctors say the eye problems, because they threaten sight, are the most worrisome part of the syndrome and most urgently need attention. Dr. Crozier’s condition, uveitis — a dangerous inflammation inside the eye — has also been diagnosed in West Africans who survived Ebola.

At the height of the epidemic, health workers were too overwhelmed with the sick to worry much about survivors. But as the outbreak wanes, the World Health Organization has begun to gather information to help those who have not fully recovered, said Dr. Daniel Bausch, a senior consultant to the W.H.O. and an infectious-disease specialist at Tulane University. He added that the reports of eye trouble were of particular concern.

‘‘It’s a major thing we need to study and provide support for,’’ Dr. Bausch said. But there are hardly any ophthalmologists in West Africa, and only they have the skills and equipment to diagnose conditions like uveitis that affect the inner chambers of the eye.

At ELWA Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, run by the missionary group SIM, Dr. John Fankhauser, the medical director, said chronic pain, headaches and eye trouble were the most common physical problems among the hundred or so people attending a special clinic for Ebola survivors. Some have such severe pain that they find it hard to walk, he said. About 40 percent have eye pain, inflammation, blurred vision and blind spots in their visual fields. Some have uveitis.

‘‘We’re seeing symptoms in patients who’ve been out of the treatment unit for up to nine months,’’ Dr. Fankhauser said. ‘‘They’re still very severe and impacting their life every day.’’ These patients will need medical care for months and maybe years, he predicted.

Dr. Fankhauser said he hoped that specialists in ophthalmology, rheumatology and rehabilitation medicine would visit.

‘‘If they see enough patients, they can help us with the trends of what they are seeing, and that may help direct some of our therapy in the future, even after the team’s gone,’’ he said.

In Sierra Leone, the picture is much the same, according to Dr. John S. Schieffelin, a physician from the Tulane University School of Medicine who volunteered there. He said a strong, well-organized survivor group met regularly in Kenema.

‘‘The main problems they’re telling me about are lots of body and joint pains, chronic headaches and women who stopped having menstrual periods, and for some it’s been several months,’’ Dr. Schieffelin said. ‘‘There’s quite a bit of vision problems.’’

He added, ‘‘I have met one former patient that does appear to be deaf.’’

The hearing loss could result from brain inflammation or very low blood pressure for an extended period, both caused by Ebola, Dr. Schieffelin said.

When Dr. Crozier’s eye trouble began, he and the Emory team suspected that Ebola had weakened his immune system and left him vulnerable to some other virus that had invaded his eye, maybe one that would be treatable with an antiviral drug.

So Dr. Steven Yeh, an ophthalmologist, pierced Dr. Crozier’s eye with a hair-thin needle, drew a few drops of fluid from its inner chamber and sent them to the lab. The results came as a shock.

For Dr. Crozier, it was deeply unsettling to learn that he was still occupied by something that seemed alien and malevolent. ‘‘It felt almost personal that the virus could be in my eye without me knowing it,’’ he said.

Uveitis had been reported in some Ebola survivors from previous outbreaks, and a related virus, Marburg, had been recovered from one patient’s eye. But those cases had seemed uncommon.

A report about Dr. Crozier’s eye condition was published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The inside of the eye is mostly shielded from the immune system to prevent inflammation that could damage vision. The barriers are not fully understood, but they include tightly packed cells in minute blood vessels that keep out certain cells and molecules, along with unique biological properties that inhibit the immune system. But this protection, called immune privilege, can sometimes turn the inner eye into a sanctuary for viruses, where they can replicate unchecked. The testes are also immune-privileged, which is why Ebola can persist in semen for months.

Finding Ebola in Dr. Crozier’s eye threw his doctors off balance. Dr. Yeh had worn a protective gown and one pair of gloves but no mask when he drew the fluid. Doctors wear more protective gear when treating patients known to have Ebola. He could not rule out the possibility that he had been infected, so he slept in the guest room at home and avoided touching his infant son for three weeks, the incubation period of the disease.

Another concern was the examining room where Dr. Yeh had taken the fluid sample. As soon as they got the results, he and several Emory colleagues rushed back there, verified that no one else had used the room, and disinfected every surface.

Additional tests showed that Dr. Crozier’s tears and the outer surface of his eye were Ebola-free, so he posed no danger to others. But his case suggests that doctors performing eye surgery on Ebola survivors could be at risk. It is not known how long the virus can persist within the eye.

The big question was whether the doctors could save Dr. Crozier’s sight. They worried about both eyes, because ailments in one eye can sometimes spread to the other. But there was no antiviral drug proven to work against Ebola, and even if there had been, there was no precedent for treating an eye full of the virus. In addition, the severe inflammation suggested that the barriers that normally protect the eye from the immune system had been breached. So what was damaging Dr. Crozier’s eye? The virus, the inflammation or both? They could not be sure.

The usual treatment for inflammation is steroids. But they can make an infection worse.

‘‘What if it unleashed the virus?’’ Dr. Crozier said. ‘‘We were on a tightrope.’’

Maybe an experimental antiviral drug would help, the doctors thought.

Though Dr. Crozier was the patient, he was also part of his own medical team, and his focus on the scientific details helped counter his mounting fear that he was going blind.

As he and his physicians struggled to balance treating the inflammation with fighting the infection, his eyesight continued to deteriorate. They tried high doses of a steroid, prednisone. The drug caused mood swings like a teenager’s, ravenous hunger, weight gain, high blood pressure and insomnia. And still his sight worsened.

He also had significant hearing loss on the same side. ‘‘The whole left side of your life is gone,’’ he said. ‘‘It was a very dark and depressing time.’’

He spent Christmas in the hospital with his brother Mark, who had stayed with him constantly throughout his illness and recovery.

The pressure inside his eye, which had been dangerously elevated, began to drop — too much. The eye became doughy to the touch, as if it were turning to mush.

‘‘The eye felt dead to me,’’ Dr. Crozier said.

The biggest shock came one morning about 10 days after his symptoms started, when he glanced in the mirror and saw that his eye had actually changed color. His iris, normally bright blue, had turned a vivid green.

As the days passed with no sign of improvement, Dr. Crozier and the Emory team began to think he had little to lose. Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious-disease specialist who had handled much of Dr. Crozier’s care, got special permission from the Food and Drug Administration to use an experimental antiviral drug taken in pill form. (The doctors declined to identify it, preferring to save that information for future publication in a medical journal.) They were not even sure that the drug would find its way into Dr. Crozier’s eye.

To add to the treatment for inflammation, Dr. Yeh also gave Dr. Crozier a steroid injection above his eyeball that would slowly release the drug into his eye.

At first, there seemed to be no effect. But one morning a week or so later, Dr. Crozier realized that if he turned his head this way and that, he could find ‘‘portals’’ and ‘‘wormholes’’ through the obstructions in his eye and could see his brother Mark, who was sitting on the end of his bed.

Gradually, over the next few months, his sight returned. Surprisingly, his eye turned blue again. A video shows him excitedly calling out letters on an eye chart as he works his way down to smaller and smaller type, with his brother and the doctors standing by, laughing.

Was it the antiviral drug? He cannot be sure, but he thinks so.

‘‘I think the cure was Ian’s own immune system,’’ Dr. Varkey said, explaining that he suspected the treatments had reduced Dr. Crozier’s symptoms and helped preserve his sight long enough for his immune system to kick in and clear out the virus — just as supportive care during the worst phase of his initial illness had kept him alive until his natural defenses could take over.

Dr. Crozier believes information from his case may help prevent blindness in Ebola survivors in West Africa. On April 9, he headed to Liberia with Dr. Yeh and several other Emory physicians to see patients who had recovered from Ebola and examine their eyes.

‘‘Maybe we can change the natural history of the disease for survivors,’’ Dr. Crozier said. ‘‘I want to start that conversation.’’

‘More Like a Book Launch’ — The Times’s Push to Build Buzz for Its Nail Salon Series

The Times’s series [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] of stories [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] on the abused and underpaid young women who are the employees of New York City’s omnipresent nail salons has hit big since it appeared online Thursday.

On Friday afternoon, it was the most emailed story on the Times website and the most “liked” on Facebook. It has also put its author, Sarah Maslin Nir, on morning TV and in other interviews.

All of which amounts to a somewhat peculiar phenomenon: the news investigation that goes viral – by design.

I’ve been fielding some questions and comments about the series. I’ll try to answer them here as well, after talking with the metro editor, Wendell Jamieson.

Why was the first part of the project published online Thursday morning when it hadn’t yet appeared in the paper (it is scheduled to be published in print on Sunday morning)? One reader, on Twitter, Jordan Rau, asked [https://twitter.com/jordanrau/status/596664305153511424] me if that might be because of competitive pressure.

Mr. Jamieson said the motivation was to maximize readership.

“We went to where the readers are,” he said. For web and mobile users that means weekday morning publication; for print readers that means the Sunday paper.

Was the two-part series (nearly 10,000 words) really all that surprising in its revelations? Was it worth well over a year of a reporter’s life, not to mention great effort by other staff members, including translators who helped with the voluminous interviews and then made the series available in Spanish, Korean and Mandarin, online?

For me, it was no surprise that manicurists are underpaid, but the details of how they are treated – piling into vans every morning for 12-hour shifts and having to pay for the privilege of learning the job – were disturbing, as were the accounts of the health problems they experience. (I especially liked that all the sources were named and many of them photographed. Did that make them vulnerable? The sources were well-prepared, Mr. Jamieson said, for what the repercussions might be.)

When I called the revelations “important” on Twitter, Stephen Miller gave a digital eye roll:



@GaltsGirl This is like @Sulliview just learning about stoplights because her chouffer took the day and she had to drive herself somewhere

— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) [http://www.twitter.com/redsteeze]7 May 15 [https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/596339418165805057]

(For the record, I get around the city with my monthly metro card.) His larger point seemed to be: “Isn’t this series just the overblown elaboration of the obvious?”

Mr. Jamieson, unsurprisingly, says no. The readership is enormous, which is worthwhile and telling in itself, and there is a human problem here worth revealing.

I do wish that other Times investigations on even more weighty subjects – the Rikers Island work [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/rikers_island_prison_complex/index.html] that recently won a Polk Award and the Washington-based series [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/us/politics/attorneys-general.html] on the influence of lobbyists on state attorneys general and Congress – got some of this kind of attention.

“The rollout was more like a book launch than a newspaper investigation,” Mr. Jamieson said. “It was planned weeks in advance. It’s a whole different way of thinking.” That included not only traditional media interviews, many of which were arranged well in advance, but also “a big social-media rollout.”

All of this reminds me of my initial complaint [http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/snow-fall-tells-a-story-about-an-avalanche-and-a-newspapers-reinvention/] about “Snow Fall,” The Times’s multimedia milestone. Great stuff, I thought, but could the same attention be given to say, climate change or poverty or government surveillance? Since then, the multimedia efforts on Ebola [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html], for example, have shown that it can happen.

The all-out efforts to attract a big audience and create buzz are fine, even if I sometimes hear from readers that the print paper feels stale and irrelevant if major stories appear days earlier on line. And the work is strong. The mistreatment of these workers certainly deserves continued attention, especially with an eye to regulation and reform.

It’s no contradiction to add that I hope that when a big investigation of government malfeasance that threatens the democracy comes along, it will get the same kind of attention — or even a fraction of it.

MONROVIA, Liberia — When a taxi dropped off a man dying of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] one evening in June, the Logan Town clinic was defenseless.

Workers had no protective suits — only a few pairs of faded gloves and a shaky grasp of infection control. They examined the patient by candlelight and washed their hands in buckets.

That single case set off a chain of contagion that killed six of the clinic’s 29 employees and at least nine of their relatives, including one of the country’s top basketball players[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/world/africa/in-ebola-outbreak-in-liberia-a-familys-strength-can-be-its-fatal-flaw.html], as Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]became the center[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html] of the deadliest Ebola epidemic in history.

Ten months after that fateful evening, the Logan Town clinic is now equipped with a triage room and hand-washing station near the entrance, an isolation room, a large generator and a water pump that feeds the taps.

“From the improvements, and how we examine the patients now, Ebola will not come back,” said Bessie Johnson, 32, a nurse. “It won’t happen again.”

On Saturday, Liberia is expected to be declared free of Ebola by the World Health Organization, having gone 42 days since its last victim was buried[http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-6-may-2015], or twice the maximum incubation period of the virus.

It will be a seminal moment for a country that was once so overwhelmed by the epidemic that bodies littered the streets[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/because-of-ebola-ambulance-work-in-liberia-is-a-busy-and-lonely-business.html] and hospitals shut down, leaving the sick helpless, often seeking treatment in vain[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/world/africa/ebola-liberia.html].

“I am thrilled by the significant progress made by the people of Liberia,” said Tolbert Nyenswah, a deputy health minister. But, he warned, “We still need to keep up vigilance.”

The weak health systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three nations hit hardest by the disease, did more than just crumple in the face of Ebola’s onslaught last year. They played a central role in spreading the disease.

Clinics routinely misdiagnosed the disease and discharged Ebola patients with pills for common illnesses. Infected health care workers passed the virus to their colleagues, families and communities.

Local and international health officials are now focusing on extinguishing the waning Ebola epidemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone. But they have a bigger goal in mind as well: shoring up beleaguered health systems that were inadequate long before Ebola struck.

“I don’t want to call Ebola an opportunity, but we’re using the experience of Ebola to try to rebuild our health systems,” said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia.

In the decade leading up to the Ebola epidemic, the three nations made significant health gains, especially in reducing child mortality. In Liberia, immunization rates for childhood vaccines and life expectancy had risen significantly. Health programs were one of the biggest recipients of aid from the United States, the European Union and other donors.

But long-running conflicts, poverty, mismanagement and corruption left the three nations with some of Africa’s weakest networks of health care centers and workers.

Only 51 doctors were working in Liberia, a nation of 4.5 million people, at the time of the outbreak, the W.H.O. says. Even the biggest hospitals in the capital lacked running water, electricity and basic supplies like gloves.

Ebola has killed more than 500 health care workers in the three countries, worsening an acute shortage of medically trained personnel.

During the height of the epidemic last year, more than half of Liberia’s health facilities ceased operating. Those that stayed open offered only limited services, often refusing to treat patients without proof that they were free of Ebola.

Many pregnant women were refused admission to maternity wards when workers fearful of being infected avoided delivering babies. Immunization rates for measles and other childhood diseases fell.

Many of the sick, afraid of getting infected or being classified as Ebola patients, stayed clear of hospitals. Unable to find treatment for malaria, diarrhea, typhoid and other common illnesses, many people are believed to have died of other illnesses during the epidemic because the health system collapsed.

Dr. Bernice Dahn, who was recently picked by Ms. Johnson Sirleaf to be Liberia’s new health minister, said that most of Liberia’s health facilities had now reopened and were providing basic services.

The government, Dr. Dahn said, will focus on raising the quality of its health work force, on emphasizing disease prevention and control and on adding triage and isolation facilities.

Physical improvements have already been made to many hospitals and clinics, where infection control training has taken place.

But there is a lot more to do, and finding the money will not be easy.

Last month, Liberia put forward an Ebola recovery plan[http://www.worldbank.org.proxy.bc.edu/en/topic/ebola/brief/summary-on-the-ebola-recovery-plan-liberia-economic-stabilization-and-recovery-plan-esrp] that included its ambitions of building a “more resilient” health system — along with better schools, sanitation, and access to clean water — at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Given that Ebola delivered a huge economic blow[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/liberias-ebola-crisis-puts-president-in-harsh-light.html] to an already poor country, much of the money it needs to rebound from the epidemic will have to come from outside Liberia, the plan makes clear.

And some improvements can be fragile. During an Ebola outbreak in a neighborhood called St. Paul’s Bridge in February, the sick scattered to community clinics and hundreds of health care workers had to be placed under quarantine. A half-dozen clinics were shut down temporarily.

Dr. Dahn said that triage was not carried out properly at the affected clinics, adding, “It’s difficult to change behavior. It requires a lot of coaching and mentoring, which need to go on.”

Here in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, a major goal is rebuilding the government-run Redemption Hospital, the first health center in the capital to be crippled by Ebola. Its closure in June had a domino effect on the city’s other health facilities.

Though it is the second-largest hospital in the capital, Redemption had only sporadic running water and electricity before the outbreak. Its roof leaked. Its plumbing and sewage systems did not function. Medical and regular wastes were burned together in the open. Septic tanks underground often overflowed and gave off a fetid stench.

“When you see the environment, you can be scared,” said Wallah Seth, who took his ailing wife to Redemption a couple of years ago but never went back.

“You feel you want to give up; I never wanted to come to this place, Redemption, again,” he said, adding that his wife managed to recover nonetheless.

Because of overcrowding, patients were often placed in any ward with an available bed; in pediatrics, two to three children often shared one bed, said Dr. Phil Afolabi, who has worked at Redemption since 2009 and is now employed by the International Rescue Committee, the aid organization based in New York that is rebuilding the hospital.

“Infection control was not a main concern at the hospital,” Dr. Afolabi said, as construction crews loudly tore out walls and floors. “So many things have actually not been in place at the hospital, and that’s been the case for a long while.’’

In June, after a young woman with Ebola was admitted, eight health care workers at Redemption died in quick succession. The hospital, located in New Kru Town, one of the largest slums in the capital, was shut down.

The sick flooded the area’s private clinics, including Logan Town. The clinic serves an area of 20,000 people, according to the aid group Oxfam, which has made $7,200 in improvements to the clinic.

By the standards of Monrovia’s community clinics, Logan Town was average. Two physician assistants led the medical staff, helped by a doctor who visited twice a month.

An old generator seldom worked. Drugs and equipment were always in short supply; the staff used gloves only for deliveries and minor surgeries, and reused them until the color faded. Janitors fetched water in buckets from a neighborhood well.

“It was difficult, especially when the patients were sick and needed to use the bathroom,” said Nancy Kanneh, a nurse. “Often, we didn’t have water to wash our own hands.”

On the evening of June 25, about a week after workers at Redemption started dying, Logan Town took in an Ebola patient, a young man named James Fallah, the caretaker of a nearby Pentecostal church, United God Is Our Light.

The security guard who had wheeled Mr. Fallah into the building held him down a few hours later when he became violent before dying. A week later, the guard came down with Ebola and passed on the virus to two of his children and one grandchild, all of whom died.

After the guard was treated at the clinic, the contagion widened to five other clinic employees. All of them died, including the chief administrator, Edwin Dour, who fatally infected his son, Kaizer, one of Liberia’s most promising basketball players[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/world/africa/in-ebola-outbreak-in-liberia-a-familys-strength-can-be-its-fatal-flaw.html]. Kaizer, in turn, passed the virus on to five family members, who all died.

The clinic, which closed for three months, is now operating only during the day and seeing about half of the patients it treated before the epidemic.

“Because of the stigma, people that used to come here before are afraid to come,” said Edwin Sengar, the physician assistant who is now in charge of the clinic.

Some of the staff members had not returned, either.

“I’m afraid,” said Moses Safa, the physician assistant who was on duty the night the Ebola patient was brought in. “I’m not doing anything now. I’m just staying at home. Maybe I’ll go back after Liberia is declared Ebola-free.”

W.H.O. Urges More Care in Naming Diseases

No more animal names like swine flu, monkeypox and mad cow. Avoid place names like Spanish flu, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, Lyme disease and Ebola (a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo).

Do not use people's names like Chagas, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Alzheimer and Lou Gehrig. And infectious maladies named after groups or occupations -- Legionnaires' disease and butcher's wart -- henceforth are out.

Concerned about the inaccuracies and stigmas that names of illnesses can confer upon people, animals, regions and economies, the World Health Organization on Friday announced ''best practices'' for naming new human infectious diseases. It called on ''scientists, national authorities and the media'' to heed the recommendations.

Under the W.H.O.'s guidance, a disease name should consist of a generic descriptive term based on symptoms (respiratory disease, watery diarrhea), who is afflicted (infant, juvenile, maternal), seasonality (summer, winter) and severity (mild, severe). The name can also include other factual elements like the environment (swamp, desert) and the year and month detected.

''The best practices apply to new infections, syndromes and diseases that have never been recognized or reported before in humans, that have potential public health impact, and for which there is no disease name in common usage,'' the W.H.O. said in its announcement.

It emphasized that the recommendations ''do not apply to disease names that are already established'' and listed some of them as examples to avoid.

Disease names, the W.H.O. said, may not include geographic locations, people's names, species of animal or food, references to culture, population, industry or occupation, and ''terms that incite undue fear.''

Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O.'s assistant director general for health security, said in the announcement that the recommendations were necessary because of the emergence of diseases that can create ''unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities or economic sectors.''

He cited as examples swine flu, which many people falsely feared was spread by pigs, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which may have originated in the Middle East but has spread around the world.

The changes could lead to cumbersome new names that defy easy shorthand or headline writing.

In an inkling of what a new name could look like, the W.H.O. sought in 2011 to standardize the terminology for the virus responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic, calling it A(H1N1)pdm09.

''This is the first time that the W.H.O. has issued recommendations on what to do and what not to do'' concerning new disease names, Olivia Lawe Davies, a W.H.O. spokeswoman in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. The recommendations were devised after consultations with other organizations.

They also were created with help from experts leading the International Classification of Diseases, a system that will still determine the final technical names of newly discovered diseases, the W.H.O. statement said.

The news was welcomed by officials who had seen the damage that a disease's name can cause.

Old Lyme, Conn., for example, still suffers the aftereffects of a tick-borne disease that first sickened children and adults in the 1970s. It became known as Lyme disease, although it was subsequently found nationwide.

Dr. Jewel Mullen, the public health commissioner in Connecticut, said the W.H.O.'s new recommendations would ''help counter stigmatization and faulty assumptions made by the public and decision makers when addressing emerging infectious diseases.''

Swine flu has been a recurring problem for decades. In 1976, a deadly strain thought to be related to the one that caused a 1918 pandemic infected soldiers in Fort Dix, N.J. The 2009 strain -- a mix of a gene from a Eurasian pig flu with genes from a human flu, bird flu and North American pig flu -- raised unfounded fears that pigs were transmitting the disease. Egypt, in a misguided move, wiped out its entire pig population. Consumers elsewhere feared eating pork and prices plunged.

At the National Pork Board, an industry group in Des Moines that has been fighting the term swine flu, its top animal health executive, Jennifer Koeman, said Friday that the W.H.O. recommendations would help ''prevent that needless confusion and misunderstanding that can occur.''

MONROVIA, Liberia — It decimated hospitals, schools, families, fortunes and, for many, even their faith.

Now, it is officially over. The Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html] has ended in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the World Health Organization announced on Saturday[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/liberia-is-free-of-ebola-world-health-organization-declares.html], an enormous milestone that seemed impossibly far off last year when dead bodies blocked roads[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/because-of-ebola-ambulance-work-in-liberia-is-a-busy-and-lonely-business.html] and the sick prayed for ambulances that never came.

Desperately, the country is trying rebuild just about everything, from its health and education systems to its economy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/world/africa/liberias-ebola-crisis-puts-president-in-harsh-light.html] and international image.

But in the dim hall of the United God Is Our Light Church, its generator turned off to shave costs, the congregation has been trying to repair something more fundamental: its spirit.

“Some of you are thinking that this church will die,” the church secretary, Joseph Vayombo, recently shouted in the small Pentecostal church here, no longer able to contain his frustration at all the empty seats around him. “There are people here who want this church to die.”

The large circle of plastic chairs inevitably drew attention to the low attendance at Friday morning prayer, a monthly gathering intended to bring together a church torn asunder by Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html]. Three, four, sometimes half a dozen empty seats separated the attendees from one another.

A man started banging on a drum; a woman rattled a shaker. Two women took to the middle of the hall, dancing confidently, hands clapping in the air.

“Don’t mind if somebody’s not here,” the assistant pastor exhorted. Everybody’s gaze seemed to settle on the empty seats surrounding him.

While Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] still haunts Guinea and Sierra Leone, where infections have dwindled but refuse to disappear, Liberia has passed a remarkable threshold: at least 42 days since its last Ebola victim was buried, or twice the maximum incubation period of the virus, according to the W.H.O.

Even before reaching that official marker, the nation was trying to stitch itself back together after more than 4,700 deaths[http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-6-may-2015] from the disease, by far the most of any nation in the epidemic. Liberia has reopened markets, clinics[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/world/africa/liberia-ravaged-by-ebola-faces-a-future-without-it.html] and schools[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/world/africa/trickle-of-liberian-children-returning-to-school-reflects-lingering-ebola-fears.html], eager to move past an outbreak so devastating that it “has changed our way of life,” as President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf put it.

Similar efforts are taking place inside churches as well, bedrock institutions in West African society that were at once a place of succor and a source of contagion during the outbreak.

Like many people here, church leaders often denied that Ebola, a disease new to West Africa, was real. At an emergency meeting last July, the Liberia Council of Churches, the country’s main group for Christians, described Ebola as divine punishment for acts of homosexuality and government corruption.

Shocked by the skyrocketing number of deaths, religious leaders later began leading efforts to stop practices that could transmit the virus. Now that the epidemic has passed, many church leaders are trying to repair the damage left behind.

Across Monrovia, churches have been responding by holding special prayers, revivals and workshops, all with the common purpose of refastening ties frayed by Ebola, a disease that made many fear and doubt those closest to them.

Last year, after congregants at the United God Is Our Light Church laid their hands on a visitor with Ebola during a healing prayer, eight members died within weeks.

Some survivors blamed the church leaders; others accused the person who had invited the sick visitor. The church was placed under quarantine, closed for services during the greatest period of anguish and loss. Members scattered as Ebola raged through their city and shook their faith.

“Ebola brought problems in churches; it brought problems in relationships,” Philip Moseray, the assistant pastor, told the faithful. “But God is in control, and we’re not giving up. We are trying to rebuild. We are trying to overcome.”

The events at United God Is Our Light were repeated in countless other churches across West Africa’s Ebola belt.

The sick, unable or unwilling to seek treatment, were sometimes brought for prayers inside churches, which became sanctuaries for them. But the practice also ended up spreading the virus.

It is impossible to know how many church officials or members died of Ebola from such contact, but the numbers are high, according to the Inter-Religious Council of Liberia, the country’s main umbrella group for Christian and Muslim institutions.

In Monrovia, the Liberian capital, as many as 40 pastors died after contracting Ebola from ministering to their congregants, said St. John York, the council’s secretary general. Most were Pentecostal, the fastest-growing Christian movement in Africa, he and many Pentecostal pastors said.

It was in mid-June that a sick woman was brought for a healing prayer to United God Is Our Light. A leader in the women’s group, Tewa Fayiah, long active in recruiting new members, brought the ailing visitor to the church, where she stayed until her death. After hands were laid on her — and then on those who got infected after touching her — the disease tore through the church, killing eight members, or about a tenth of the congregation.

In a pattern seen across the hot zone, the virus quickly widened beyond the church.

The church caretaker, a young father of four named James Fallah, was taken to a nearby clinic where he died just hours later. At the clinic, called Logan Town, he passed the virus to an employee and set off a separate chain of infections[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/world/africa/liberia-ravaged-by-ebola-faces-a-future-without-it.html] that killed at least 15 people, including one of Liberia’s top basketball players[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/world/africa/in-ebola-outbreak-in-liberia-a-familys-strength-can-be-its-fatal-flaw.html], according to dozens of interviews with church members, health workers, family members and residents.

The Rev. Edward Kellie, the head pastor who co-founded the church two decades ago, also fell ill, though he said it was not Ebola. He was absent from his congregation for several weeks. The health authorities placed the church building under quarantine, leaving the members with no place to meet and worship.

“People were angry with the church leadership for taking in sick people in the church — it’s a place of prayer, not a hospital,” said Mr. Moseray, 42, the assistant pastor, explaining that some members had yet to return. “We’re still around them, talking with them to come back.”

Others singled out Ms. Fayiah, who had brought in the sick woman. Despite being a member since 1986, Ms. Fayiah has not returned to the church since the deaths last year.

“People were angry with her because of the deaths,” said Marita Kettor, 43, a longtime member. “She knows the woman’s condition, and she comes and brings the woman in.”

Across the country, pastors and church were getting infected around the same time, prompting religious leaders to intervene. The Inter-Religious Council of Liberia worked with Christian and Muslim officials to spread a common message down the ranks, calling for a temporary ban on prayers and funeral practices that involved touching the sick or dead.

Most hewed to the new rules, except Pentecostal churches, which were the most fervent deniers of Ebola, said Mr. York, the council’s secretary general.

Bishop Amos Sesay, the founder of Word of Faith Ministries, a Pentecostal church with 45 branches in Liberia, said seven of his pastors had died of Ebola despite instructions that they cease dangerous practices.

“Some of them believed that they have the Holy Ghost and they can’t be affected by Ebola,” Bishop Sesay said.

At United God Is Our Light, the church reopened its doors after 27 days. But few came at first.

“People had doubts in their minds about God,” Ms. Kettor said. “I said, ‘Papa God, why, what is this again, that we’re going to go through again?’ We just finished a civil war and now Ebola is in town. I wondered if the end time was coming.”

Ebola’s apparent randomness also took a toll. Scientists believe that some people have a greater resistance to Ebola, or even immunity.

But to church members, the deaths of some, though not others, challenged their faith. The widow of the church caretaker survived, while church members who briefly laid their hands on him during a prayer got infected and died quickly.

“We didn’t really understand this thing,” Mr. Moseray, the assistant pastor, said. “Actually, it became a mystery.”

After he recovered, Mr. Kellie, the senior pastor, began visiting members’ homes.

“ ‘Praise God,’ I told them,” he said. “ ‘God loves you. I’m appealing to you. Please come back.’ ”

After staying away for half a year, Mary Quito, a longtime member, returned to the church building, a place that had been filling her with terror.

“We trust in our God, that it’s safe,” she said. “Even if we enter here, God will work his miracle.”

Eventually, most came around to the belief that Satan had brought Ebola into Liberia and into this church, a message still repeated in Sunday sermons.

“I was vexed with the devil,” said Esther Fallah, the widow of the caretaker. “I can’t get vexed with God.” Sitta Jusu, 39, the head of the choir, said of the church, “We are still together.”

To recreate the unity and commitment that existed before Ebola, church leaders recently began holding the Friday morning prayer sessions once a month, as well as a monthly night session during which members spend the entire night praying together.

Most members have at least returned now. But conspicuous by her absence was Ms. Fayiah. Church leaders and the women’s prayer group had visited her home, offering forgiveness, asking her to come back. But she left the area and had not been seen in weeks. Until she returns, some members said, the church would not be completely healed.

“We as a church have to go to her and find her,” said Mr. Vayombo, the church secretary. “We, as a church, need to go and tell her, ‘Come, everything is over. Everything is over.’ ”

Jubilant Liberia Is Declared Free of Ebola, but Officials Sound Note of Caution

The World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola on Saturday, making it the first of the three hardest-hit West African countries to bring a formal end to the epidemic.

''The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia is over,'' the W.H.O. said in a statement read by Dr. Alex Gasasira, the group's representative to Liberia, in a packed conference room at the emergency command center in Monrovia, the capital.

Just before Dr. Gasasira's statement, Luke Bawo, an epidemiologist, showed a map depicting all of Liberia in green with the number 42 superimposed on it. This represented that two maximum incubation periods of the virus, a total of 42 days, had passed since the safe burial of the last person confirmed to have had Ebola in the country, fulfilling the official criteria for concluding that human-to-human transmission of the virus has ended.

The room, packed with reporters, workers from Doctors Without Borders and other aid agencies and dignitaries, including the American ambassador to Liberia, Deborah R. Malac, burst into applause, and some people cried, according to health officials who were present.

The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, then held a moment of silence for those who had died. She thanked Liberians who had fought Ebola and expressed her gratitude to the country's international partners and others around the world ''whose hearts were with us.'' Ms. Johnson Sirleaf added, ''Let us celebrate, but stay mindful and vigilant.''

Then she began shaking hands, a mundane act that seemed monumental in a country where people have been cautioned for months not to touch one another.

Throughout the morning, the president, wearing sneakers and a baseball cap emblazoned with the Liberian flag, visited hospitals and met with orphans, widows and survivors of Ebola.

''The health workers are dancing and clapping and singing 'no more Ebola,' '' Dr. Gasasira said by phone as he traveled with Ms. Johnson Sirleaf.

The W.H.O. says there were more than 3,000 confirmed Ebola cases in Liberia, and 7,400 suspected or probable cases, with more than 4,700 deaths estimated to have occurred since the outbreak was declared there in March 2014. Among the dead were 189 health care workers.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a senior Liberian health official who leads the country's Ebola response efforts, said in an interview that the end of the epidemic was ''a victory for Liberia and Liberians.''

''The only caution,'' he said, is that ''we are very much concerned about Guinea and Sierra Leone.''

The White House congratulated the people of Liberia but echoed those worries. It pledged to help rebuild the country.

On Saturday, the streets in downtown Monrovia, where ambulances had roared in August and September, were quiet and calm. Many people expressed a sense of relief.

''Thank God,'' said Nathan Gull, who works at a hospital that lost staff members to the disease.

Abubakar Jabbie, a 32-year-old money changer, said, ''We were in darkness -- no trading, nothing was moving in this country.''

In the past week, Guinea and Sierra Leone each reported nine cases of the disease, the lowest weekly total this year. Dr. Bruce Aylward, head of the W.H.O.'s Ebola response efforts, cautioned that hidden chains of transmission were probably occurring in those two countries. ''We don't know where that virus is,'' he said. Dr. Aylward said it had taken Liberia several months to get to zero cases after reaching single digits.

Mr. Nyenswah said Liberia would continue many of the measures that helped the country vanquish the epidemic, including surveying border areas for sick travelers, testing all dead bodies for the virus and conducting burials with specially trained teams wearing protective gear.

''We are being extremely cautious,'' Dr. Bernice Dahn, the country's incoming health minister, said in an email. She said the country's priority now was to build its critically deficient health care work force. ''Ebola highlighted our health system's weaknesses,'' she said.

An important question for Liberia is whether it can now draw foreign companies back to the country, whose economy has been battered. British Airways, for instance, which came under fire from aid officials after it and several other airlines stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone last August, has not resumed services.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped advising American citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Liberia, instead recommending that they ''practice enhanced precautions'' when going there.

''The country can get back to business,'' Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the disease centers, said Friday in an interview. ''It's a tribute to the enormous hard work done by Liberians, by the C.D.C., by partners throughout the U.S. government and the international community.''

For the time being, however, travelers from Liberia to the United States will still be subject to a 21-day monitoring program. ''That's something we'll be discussing in the coming days with other parts of the U.S. government,'' Dr. Frieden said.

The W.H.O. has recommended that Liberia maintain an additional three months of ''heightened surveillance'' for Ebola because of the continuing outbreak in neighboring countries, as well as the possibility that Ebola could re-emerge via sexual transmission from survivors.

On Friday, the W.H.O. revised its guidelines for survivors, urging men and their partners to abstain from sex or to practice protected sex for at least six months or until two semen tests have been negative for traces of the virus. That advice follows recent scientific evidence suggesting that the last patient to fall ill and die of Ebola in Liberia may have caught the virus from her boyfriend many months after his recovery. Studies have shown that Ebola can persist in semen for some time, even after a man has completely recovered and poses no risk to the general public.

The origins of the outbreak in West Africa remain undetermined, and some scientists believe Ebola is likely to be circulating in wildlife in the region. Four of six countries that suffered previous Ebola epidemics had a recurrence of the disease within three years, the W.H.O. said.

There are signs that some hygienic habits that were adopted during the epidemic may be sustained in Liberia, including hand-washing programs at schools. ''That practice should become a way of life for us,'' said Iris Martor, a nurse and the program director for the nonprofit organization More Than Me, which runs an academy for girls in the West Point slum area of Monrovia. ''If we forget ourselves and go back to the careless way of life, there could be another outbreak,'' Ms. Martor added.

One of Ms. Martor's students, Benetter Kun, 18, is the daughter of Liberia's last Ebola patient, Ruth Tugbah, who died at a treatment unit in late March. For Ms. Kun, as with many family members who lost loved ones, the end of the epidemic was bittersweet.

''It's a sad moment for me and my family because we are not complete,'' she said.

Ebola-Free, but Not Resilient

On Saturday, the World Health Organization declared Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] to be Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-free, recognizing that there had been no new cases since the end of March. While its neighbors Sierra Leone and Guinea still wrestle with this virologic demon, this is a moment for reflection and cautious optimism in Liberia. The world must ensure that what happened in Liberia never happens again — there, or anywhere.

Only eight months ago, the most tragic scenes were still unfolding in Liberia, one of the three countries hardest hit by the outbreak. Newly built treatment centers sat empty while bodies of the dead, and nearly dead, lay in the streets. Health care workers, lacking necessary equipment to provide safe treatment, were dying at even faster rates than patients. Heath workers in Monrovia, the capital, went on a brief strike in October, demanding higher wages for their perilous work. People fled city centers and rice fields alike, bringing commerce to a halt and threatening the country’s food security.

It was in every way the worst-case scenario for an unprepared and chronically under-resourced health system. And individual lives — while the greatest of all losses — were not the only victims of the disease. Before the outbreak, Liberia had been steadily recovering from 14 years of brutal, back-to-back civil wars, ending in 2003. Since then, Liberia had been making progress toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in health. It was the first African country to achieve one of the top goals — reducing child mortality by two-thirds from 1990 levels — in part by doubling rates of childhood immunization. The country also made progress toward other Millennium Development Goals, particularly those focused on reducing deaths from H.I.V., malaria, tuberculosis and pregnancy or childbirth.

But when Ebola struck, the country did not have even the most rudimentary surveillance mechanisms, or enough health care workers. The fragmented health system quickly collapsed.

Certainly, Liberia was not the only place where the epidemic severely challenged the health system. From Sierra Leone to Texas, the public health response was inadequate and uncoordinated.

One of every three dollars invested in development progress is lost when a crisis hits. In this new reality, all facets of the global health system, from local health teams to global organizations, must work in a coordinated way to build a system that doesn’t break under pressure.

A resilient health system combines active surveillance mechanisms, robust health care delivery system and a vigorous response to disease. When the first signs of contagion appear, a system should be able to act quickly to stop it in its tracks — all without compromising its core functions.

Resilience is well understood in fields like biology and engineering. Resilient systems share several characteristics. One is awareness, which in the case of health systems means, first and foremost, strong disease surveillance. A second characteristic is the ability to adapt to changing conditions. We saw this in Nigeria: When Ebola first surfaced, leaders redeployed polio eradication teams to focus on Ebola. With polio “season” over, G.P.S. tracking and contact-tracing were deployed to monitor Ebola, while traditional, religious and community leaders were on the front line raising awareness.

A third characteristic is diversity: the ability to address a broad range of challenges. A good primary care system can help do so and is most feasible in countries that have prioritized universal health coverage, because they are more likely to have health workers, facilities and other capacities that span the country, and services that are affordable and accessible — which can make the difference between life and death at the earliest stages of an outbreak.

Finally, resilient systems are integrated: information is shared across different levels of government. For example, New York City, which in this century alone has experienced a terrorist attack, a blackout, and Superstorm Sandy, prepared for Ebola far in advance of an actual case. With each crisis, the city has enhanced its resilience. So when a volunteer doctor returning from West Africa checked himself in, city leaders quickly mobilized, freely sharing information with the public to explain their Ebola management plan, providing guidance as well as assurances of public safety. This integration allowed for the single case to be successfully treated.

When a resilient system is in place, cities and countries alike are prepared to yield what we call a “resilience dividend” — benefits that are independent of crises. Building trust with the public, enhancing access to quality care, and investing in public health are all wise investments at any time, helping to increase productivity and growth.

Liberia faces new threats in Ebola’s aftermath, including a rise in malnutrition and outbreaks of highly contagious yet preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and measles. It would be easy to slip back into old patterns and treat these challenges as individual problems. But with its ambitious Post-Ebola Health Investment Plan, the Liberian government is focusing on recruiting and training health workers, particularly at the local level; building up infrastructure; and investing in labs needed to quickly detect and identify dangerous diseases as soon as they emerge. Last month, the World Bank announced an additional $650 million toward rebuilding in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, will hold a conference in July to get countries to pledge even more.

One lesson from Ebola is clear: in a resilient health system, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Liberia not only reminds us of the necessity to create such a system, but also can help to show the path forward.

Judith Rodin is the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and author of “The Resilience Dividend: Being Strong in a World Where Things Go Wrong.”Bernice Dahn is the minister-designate of health for Liberia.

An article on Friday about Dr. Ian Crozier, an Ebola survivor who discovered the virus in his left eye after his medical team thought he had been cured, described incorrectly the protective gear that Dr. Steven Yeh wore when he drew fluid from Dr. Crozier's eye. Dr. Yeh wore not only a gown and a pair of gloves, he also wore a mask; he did not perform the procedure without a mask.

NOTEWORTHY

• A song for Baltimore.

Prince released a new song, “Baltimore,” with a mention of Freddie Gray, who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody, and the lyrics “let’s take all the guns away.”

On Sunday night, he headlined the “Rally 4 Peace” concert [http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/05/11/arts/11reuters-usa-police-baltimore-prince.html] in Baltimore. Doug E. Fresh and Miguel also performed.

• Masterpiece for sale.

Picasso’s “ Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’) [http://www.christies.com/features/Picasso-5829-1.aspx]” is expected to be sold for about $140 million at an auction tonight in New York.

It could challenge the record for the highest auction price for a work of art — $142.4 million for Francis Bacon’s “ Three Studies of Lucian Freud [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/bacons-study-of-freud-sells-for-more-than-142-million.html].”

• Scoreboard.

Rickie Fowler, an American, won the Players Championship [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/sports/golf/rickie-fowler-outlasts-logjam-to-win-players-championship.html] (and $1.8 million) after a three-hole aggregate playoff. It is golf’s biggest purse.

And a buzzer-beater by LeBron James [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/sports/basketball/lebron-james-from-the-corner-and-its-all-square.html] gave Cleveland an 86-84 victory over Chicago on Sunday in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.

Tonight’s N.B.A. playoff games: Atlanta at Washington at 7 Eastern, and Golden State at Memphis at 9:30 (both on TNT).

BACK STORY

Do you know what country is bordered by Thailand and Cambodia? How about where Caribbean Hindustani is spoken?

Or which nation Hiva Oa, one of the main islands in the Marquesas Islands, belongs to?

Those were some of the recent questions in the National Geographic Bee [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/].

The annual competition for fourth to eighth graders, which tests their knowledge of the globe, begins its national finals and championship round today in Washington.

It continues for three days, and will be televised Friday on the National Geographic Channel.

First prize is a $50,000 college scholarship, a lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society and a trip to the Galápagos Islands. (Do you know where they are?)

The bee began in 1989, after a Gallup survey in 1988 found that 20 percent of 18- to 24-years-olds in the U.S. could not find their own country on a map unless it was labeled.

It’s not as old or as famous as the Scripps National Spelling Bee, which started in 1925.

That’s probably O.K. These geography whiz kids have the whole world to worry about, after all.

(Answers: Laos; Trinidad and Tobago; and France. The Galápagos are off the northwest coast of South America, and belong to Ecuador.)

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/health/weeks-after-his-recovery-ebola-lurked-in-a-doctors-eye.html?ref=health] on Friday about Dr. Ian Crozier, an Ebola survivor who discovered the virus in his left eye after his medical team thought he had been cured, described incorrectly the protective gear that Dr. Steven Yeh wore when he drew fluid from Dr. Crozier’s eye. Dr. Yeh wore not only a gown and a pair of gloves, he also wore a mask; he did not perform the procedure without a mask.

NEW YORK

An article [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/nyregion/democratic-party-is-without-a-nominee-in-a-brooklyn-assembly-race.html] in some editions last Monday about a special election in Brooklyn to fill a State Assembly seat vacated by Karim Camara misstated the name of the political party backing the candidate Shirley Patterson. It is the Independence Party, not the Independent Party. (Ms. Patterson lost to Diana Richardson, who was backed by the Working Families Party.)

BUSINESS DAY

Because of an editing error, an article [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/business/airplane-seat-swapping-once-a-gentle-sport-turns-rough-and-tumble.html] on the Itineraries page on April 14 about aircraft seat-swapping misstated the given name of a passenger who was elbowed repeatedly by a fellow passenger who wanted his window seat. He is Tim Nickerson, not Tom.

SPORTS

The On Horse Racing column [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/sports/top-talent-makes-for-more-dazzling-triple-crown.html] last Monday, about the possibility that all of the top horses from the Kentucky Derby will run in the Preakness Stakes, misstated the number of lengths Dortmund finished behind American Pharoah in the Derby. It was three, not two. The article also misstated, in some copies, the name of the horse that stopped California Chrome’s Triple Crown bid last year. He is Tonalist, not Tonality.

•

Because of an editing error, a timeline [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/13/sports/hockey/13timelinebox.html?ref=hockey] on April 13 about significant events in the Rangers’ season misstated the number of days into training camp that Rangers center Derek Stepan fractured his left leg. It was seven days, not five. The timeline also misstated goalie Henrik Lundqvist’s statistics after he returned from a two-month absence. He had a 2.29 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage — not a 2.00 goals-against average and a .925 save percentage.

OPINION

Thomas L. Friedman’s column [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/opinion/thomas-friedman-germany-the-green-superpower.html] on Wednesday imprecisely described Germany’s energy efficiency. The country gets nearly 30 percent of its electrical energy from various renewable sources — solar, wind, biomass and hydro — not just from solar and wind power.

W.H.O. Needs Reforms in Wake of Ebola Crisis, Report Says

GENEVA — The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] needs structural reform and a radical change of culture to enable it to cope with future health emergencies, a panel of experts said in a preliminary report issued Monday that was critical of the agency’s delayed reaction to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] crisis.

“This is a defining moment for the W.H.O.,” Barbara Stocking, the chairwoman of the six-member panel, said in Geneva at the release of the report. The study was commissioned by the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] to examine what went wrong in the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has resulted in more than 11,000 deaths.

“It is still unclear to the panel why early warnings, approximately from May through to July 2014, did not result in an effective and adequate response,” the report says. Although the W.H.O. identified the “unprecedented” nature of the outbreak that\ April, only last August did the agency declare it a public health emergency[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html], prompting a huge buildup in the international response.

The factors contributing to those delays are expected to be explored in more detail in the panel’s final report, due to be published in July after further investigation, including in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the worst-affected countries.

Among the panel’s chief conclusions was that it would be counterproductive to establish a new United Nations agency to handle health emergencies, as some have suggested, or that responsibility should be transferred to another United Nations body. That would require considerable time and resources, it said.

Instead, the report suggested that a new structure be set up in the W.H.O. with the capacity to deliver a full emergency response.

It will “need quite a big culture change in member states and the leadership of the W.H.O. to get it done,” Ms. Stocking said.

The panel issued an interim report so its recommendations could be considered by next week’s meeting of the World Health Assembly, the W.H.O.’s decision-making body, and so “change can be driven forward quickly,” Ms. Stocking said.

The report called for world leaders to “give W.H.O. new relevance and empower it to lead in global health.” It made clear that for the agency to be effective, it would require an overhaul of its finances, with an increase in the core funding it receives from United Nations member states and possibly the creation of new financial mechanisms, like a contingency fund.

“We certainly don’t want our report to be sitting on a shelf and not moving forward,” Ms. Stocking said. “We are very clear we are putting forward a report for action.”

Although it is an interim document, it sets out “some very big principles,” Ms. Stocking said, “and they are not going to change between now and the final report.”

Liberia’s Military Tries to Remedy Tension Over Ebola Quarantine

MONROVIA, Liberia — The chief of staff for the Armed Forces of Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Brig. Gen. Daniel D. Ziankahn [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/world/africa/amid-ebola-crisis-liberian-army-sees-its-chance-at-rebranding.html]Jr., hung up his navy blue suit, put on a bright yellow jersey and shorts, then bounded toward a sandy field.

Nine months earlier, his soldiers fired live rounds[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/world/africa/soldiers-faulted-in-deadly-crackdown-during-ebola-protests-in-liberia.html] into the seaside slum of West Point and beat residents after rioting broke out[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html] on the first day of a government quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html] of the neighborhood during the Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html].

But now, rather than manning a barricade, his troops were playing a soccer match intended to help repair the rift between the security forces and the residents of West Point.

On Saturday, the day Liberia’s Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/after-ebola-outbreak-liberian-churches-confront-crisis-of-faith.html] was officially declared over[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/liberia-is-free-of-ebola-world-health-organization-declares.html], the players scuffled and tumbled back and forth on a makeshift soccer pitch flanked by hundreds of community members, most of them cheering for the side in black, their own West Point All Star team.

It was a stark contrast to last summer, when a holding center for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] patients was set up in the same part of Monrovia, the capital, without the community’s consent. Residents feared that the government was importing the disease into their neighborhood, and some ransacked the center a few days after it was established.

The unrest, and the late-night secret burials of Ebola victims by their families, led President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to announce a quarantine of West Point that would begin on Aug. 20, effectively trapping tens of thousands of residents inside.

West Pointers woke up behind barricades[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-liberia-quarantine.html] guarded by soldiers and police officers. When the neighborhood commissioner, Miatta H. Flowers, tried to move her family on the first day, security forces helped. Rioting erupted, residents expressing fury about being cut off from the rest of the city[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html].

A few people were shot, including a 15-year-old boy, Shakie Kamara, who later bled to death [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/world/africa/liberian-boy-dies-after-being-shot-during-clash-over-ebola-quarantine.html] while Monrovia’s major hospitals reeled from the epidemic. Shakie’s body was buried without an autopsy.

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf acknowledged in an[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/africa/liberian-leader-concedes-errors-in-response-to-ebola.html] interview[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/africa/liberian-leader-concedes-errors-in-response-to-ebola.html] in March that her decision to quarantine West Point had been a mistake. “It did not take long to know that did not work,” she said. “It created more tension in the society.”

But on Monday, during a ceremony to celebrate the end of Liberia’s Ebola outbreak, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf also defended the security forces, emphasizing the role they played in helping American soldiers build treatment centers[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/world/africa/idle-ebola-clinics-in-liberia-are-seen-as-misstep-in-us-relief-effort.html] during a chaotic period for the country.

“They don’t always do good things, and sometimes some of them do bad things,” she said. She added that she wanted to commend the security forces because they “protected us in those difficult days when the sirens were screaming[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/world/africa/because-of-ebola-ambulance-work-in-liberia-is-a-busy-and-lonely-business.html] and the telephones were ringing and people were dying, there was nowhere to turn and everyone was running.”

As Ebola has disappeared from Liberia, attention has turned again to West Point, which has been lauded for organizing itself and establishing infection control measures that drove the virus out of the community almost five months before the epidemic ended throughout the country.

The quarantine was halted after 10 days. Ms. Flowers has been appointed the commissioner of another community.

On Armed Forces Day in February, Samuel Kofi Woods, a former minister of public works who is also a human rights lawyer, urged the military, known as the A.F.L., to return to West Point to mend relations.

“The A.F.L. must return to West Point, this time armed with shovels, diggers, pens, paper,” he told hundreds of soldiers at a ceremony, “and engage in community waste management and sanitation, cleanup exercises, adult literacy, sporting activities and other initiatives aimed at restoring the broken relationship.”

Mr. Woods and two American officers who helped in the Ebola efforts — Lt. Col. Allen Hahn and Lt. Col. Kevin Koerner, who worked with the United Nations mission in Liberia — set out to start the reconciliation process.

“It seemed like the right thing to do,” Colonel Hahn said, adding that the need to remedy ill will about the quarantine put the Liberian government in a “politically sensitive” position.

The two Americans helped arrange a series of community meetings in West Point focused on transforming the dark, damp school that had been used as the holding center for Ebola patients, as well as on the project to reconcile the community with the security forces.

The official reopening of the school, the Nathaniel Varney Massaquoi elementary and junior high school, was held on Friday. Built in the 1970s, it was a food market that was converted to a school under the military dictator Samuel Doe.

With weak walls and a rusty roof, the building did little to nurture learning or shelter students from the heavy rains that beat down on the country half of the year. And with few toilets and unsanitary water, it did little to protect them from disease.

Over the last two months, the school has been renovated by volunteers and the army’s engineering battalion, with the help of close to $400,000 from the United Nations and other donors.

The haunting blue walls, which surrounded patients dying on thin mattresses on the floor, have been washed white. The low-hanging roof was raised, and light now filters in. Fans spin on the walls, the electricity is steady, and water will soon run through pipes for the first time in decades.

A colorful mural of fish, canoes, a butterfly and Liberian peppers designed by an artist from Baltimore was painted across the facade. But despite the official reopening, the school was not prepared to welcome students back last week, even though three months had passed since other schools that had [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/world/africa/trickle-of-liberian-children-returning-to-school-reflects-lingering-ebola-fears.html]closed during the outbreak started up again[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/world/africa/trickle-of-liberian-children-returning-to-school-reflects-lingering-ebola-fears.html]. Final adjustments were being made for an expected opening on Monday.

While many West Pointers lauded these efforts, some chided the government for what they called its lack of involvement.

“We felt neglected by the government; the government cannot tell me it spent a dime, and it’s a government school,” said Alaowei Z. Warri, the head of the school’s Parent Teacher Association. “It was not the government initiating the reconciliation.”

But he added that sometimes the “neutral person” made an ideal mediator.

A few weeks ago, the army’s jaunty band marched down the main road of the neighborhood, and soldiers in plain clothes helped pick up trash in the community.

But whoever shot Shakie has not been identified, and the decision-making behind the West Point quarantine and the soldiers’ behavior have not been fully explained, despite inquiries[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/world/africa/soldiers-faulted-in-deadly-crackdown-during-ebola-protests-in-liberia.html] by the military and the national human rights commission. Still, many residents say the recent cooperation points to the possibility of laying the tensions to rest.

Many also say more effort must be made to improve living standards in West Point, Monrovia’s largest slum, like providing access to clean water, toilets and showers, many of which have been ripped away by coastal erosion.

“What you see here was done by the international community. It is foreign partners that came in and did it,” said Kenneth Martu, a community leader who negotiated with the government to lift the quarantine. “These things are just symbolic, but I think we need to do more.”

At a memorial service before the soccer match, Shakie’s brother, Daniel Bah, read from a piece of paper with the heading “Family Statement.” The family thanked a variety of people, including President Obama, the United Nations, the Liberian military and Mr. Woods, asking them to “ensure a better living” for Shakie’s grandmother and father.

The teenager’s relatives, along with the family of a man who was wounded during the riots, have been talking with the government about compensation for their losses. Others in West Point said they wanted the government to formally apologize for the quarantine.

For now, even critics of the government have praised the military for its initial conciliatory steps.

“The citizens of Liberia are embracing the Armed Forces of Liberia,” said Mr. Warri, the P.T.A. leader. “That bitter past is erasing little by little.”

In the feel-good match, the West Point All Star team claimed a victory, 1-0.

Kona Kalon, a West Point resident who sells dry goods, jumped up and down.

“West Point beat the soldier people,” she said. “We are very happy.”

Italian Nurse Who Worked in Sierra Leone Tests Positive for Ebola

ROME — An Italian nurse who returned from Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] last week was flown to an infectious diseases hospital in Rome on Wednesday after he tested positive for the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus a day before.

The nurse, the second person with Ebola to be treated in Italy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/italy/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], had worked with an Italian aid group in Sierra Leone, one of the West African countries hit by the outbreak last year. He started showing the first symptoms two days after his return last Sunday to his home in Sassari, Sardinia.

He immediately isolated himself in his room and was safely transferred to the local hospital’s infectious diseases ward, and then to Rome in a specially equipped Italian Air Force aircraft, the Health Ministry said in a statement.

Last year, an Italian doctor with the same aid group, Emergency[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/02/world/europe/ap-eu-ebola-italy.html], was successfully treated in the Spallanzani hospital in Rome and was released after a month. In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, the doctor said he had received infusions of the blood of Spanish and German health workers, and he speculated that his own blood might be used to treat the nurse.

Local health officials will monitor the nurses and doctors who have examined the patient as well as his closest contacts. The health minister confirmed that workers at the Sassari hospital were wearing personal protective equipment while treating that patient, and that it was not necessary to track down all the passengers on the nurse’s flights, because his symptoms showed three days after his last flight.

According to the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org], more than 11,000 people have died from Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/world/africa/who-officials-report-a-drop-in-new-ebola-cases.html?ref=topics] since the outbreak of the disease in December 2013.

Caught in Nepal’s Earthquakes

When Daniel Berehulak flew into Kathmandu four days after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal in April, his initial impression was that the damage was not as catastrophic as he had expected. His first days were spent photographing people pulling valuables — televisions and teddy bears and kitchen cupboards — from rubble piles around the city, sometimes carrying them away balanced on their heads. It was a sight that struck him as brave and hopeful.

But as he worked[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/world/asia/nepal-earthquake-photos.html], the reality of what had happened in Nepal gradually emerged into focus: The worst damage was in towns and villages that required a five- to seven-hour drive from the city, followed by a six-hour hike on trails scaling mountains studded with landslides and boulders shaken loose by the earthquake.

Photographing any disaster is 80 or 90 percent logistics, by Mr. Berehulak[http://www.danielberehulak.com/]’s reckoning, and his attention swung to the people who could help him get the story: helicopter pilots from the Indian and Nepalese military who were deployed on aid and rescue missions, navigating ravines and mountain passes, racing away from fast-moving weather systems, and mathematically calibrating the weight-to-fuel ratio, all at extremely high altitudes. On some missions, the pilots were forced to dump fuel so they could safely carry passengers. Several times his helicopter reached villages built on such narrow terraces and on such steep terrain that it was unable to land and had to turn back.

“You had these villages perched on mountainsides, and it’s incredible that they were able to scratch out an existence there,” he said. “From the air, they look like the prints on your fingers.”

He was fiercely preoccupied with keeping his camera batteries, laptop batteries and satellite phone charged, so much so that when he found shelter his first thought — one that crowded out the need to eat or wash or sleep — was finding a way to plug in. Power supply was no trivial consideration, as the only way he could reach the village of Barpak, near the epicenter of the April 25 earthquake, was to have a helicopter crew leave him in the village during an aid drop. He knew that if no helicopters returned in the next few days, he would have no option but to trek out on foot.

“We weren’t sure how we were going to get out,” Mr. Berehulak said. “I had a sat phone, I could transmit my images. My only concern was getting onto the ground shooting.”

Once in place, he worked by instinct, following whatever was happening on the ground. In one village in the Gorkha district, he found people talking about a 3-year-old girl, and he was with them three hours later when they found her body. He followed the family up to a small cemetery, where the women grieved over the child’s body for two hours. In the days before, he had seen other families mourn, but they had been mourning for adults, he said. This was different.

“Seeing them react to a child that they were meant to be protecting – that was – yes. That was the most challenging thing to see,” he said. “Children are so helpless.”

The hours in shattered villages sped by, and often Mr. Berehulak set out with no idea what he would find.

“I am not necessarily drawn to an aesthetic scene, I am drawn by the people,” he said. “More times than not, some of the situations we’ve come upon are purely by chance, purely by physically being there. When it does happen, and you do see it, you know where you need to be.”

Mr. Berehulak had spent two weeks documenting the destruction caused by the April 25 earthquake when, after sitting down for lunch in a Kathmandu restaurant, he was caught in Tuesday’s 7.3-magnitude aftershock. He called it “one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen,” and he said that powerful instinct immediately propelled him out of the building into open space.

“It took one or two seconds to realize what was happening,” Mr. Berehulak said. “You feel the start of the tremor, you basically run out to the door, not even taking into account what’s happening. You just react. You go. You run.”

He finally flew out of Nepal on Friday, torn about leaving, but physically and emotionally drained.

“There was a little fatigue that was setting in,” he said. “You start looking at the scenes and feeling that they are the same thing you had seen yesterday. I thought, ‘Maybe it’s time for a short break.’”

Daniel Berehulak was awarded the Pulitzer Prize[http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/daniel-berehulak-the-ebola-crisis-earn-photography-pulitzer/] for feature photography earlier this year for his coverage of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa for The New York Times.

Nurse Reflects on Tour Treating Ebola Patients in Sierra Leone

Returning from the Ebola zone, Lindsey Hallen worried that she would be swallowed by the petty concerns of her life as a nurse in New York City.

“I didn’t want to forget,” Ms. Hallen said last week.

But she discovered that while away, she had lost any sense that things revolved around herself and her career.

“I’ve been waiting for like a really, really bad day when I’m so overwhelmed at work, and it hasn’t come yet,” Ms. Hallen said, laughing.

Ms. Hallen, 31, a nurse at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was the subject of a Jan. 18 Metropolitan section article[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/nyregion/a-nurse-decides-to-get-hands-on-in-the-ebola-zone.html], as she left for West Africa as a volunteer on the front lines of the Ebola epidemic. Preparing to join Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid organization, Ms. Hallen dealt with the curious questions of colleagues about her motives, and the worries of her family. At the last minute, she had to choose between putting her life in danger by treating Ebola patients directly in Sierra Leone, or being posted to Liberia, where she would be involved in infrastructure building. She chose Sierra Leone, a decision she does not regret.

She worked at the Maforki Ebola treatment unit in the northern district of Port Loko. Nurses and doctors did essentially the same work.

In eight-hour shifts, they moved between the “suspected” Ebola ward and the “confirmed” ward, spending two hours at a time in sweltering personal protective gear. Medications were basic — anti-emetics for vomiting, antibiotics, anti-malaria drugs and intravenous fluids — but sometimes in short supply. Electrolytes came in glass ampuls that were hazardous to use, because they often broke and cut the hands of those who opened them.

The hardest times were when children died. “Nothing would really have to be spoken about it, but you know that you kind of shared that moment with somebody,” Ms. Hallen said.

But she said she was never nervous about her own safety. “It was just kind of, you got to do it.”

Ms. Hallen had a private room and bathroom, but no running water, in a compound called the Sugar Shack. She showered and flushed the toilet with buckets. She quickly tired of rice in cassava leaves and fish, and regretted not having brought more snack food from home. Friends living in a nearby Danish camp would sometimes bring her “gourmet” bread and cheese for lunch.

Despite the hardships, Ms. Hallen extended her tour to eight weeks from six.

On the morning of the day she was leaving, March 11, her group was called to an emergency meeting. “We kind of knew right away that it was not going to be good news,” she said. They were told that one of their American colleagues had been infected with Ebola.

As a van took Ms. Hallen to the airport, she saw living quarters being taped off and people decontaminating the premises.

“It could have happened to anybody,” she said.

The sick American, who was not identified, was flown to the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org] in Bethesda, Md., for treatment. A few days later, a Sierra Leonean community health officer working at the same unit was found to have Ebola as well.

To avoid 21 days of quarantine in her studio apartment, Ms. Hallen flew to Montana, where she was allowed to go out, as long as she stayed three feet away from other people.

Now back at work, she has not forgotten. “I did what I could to help the people there, but I feel like I really got so much more out of it than I could have imagined,” she said. She wants to go back.

W.H.O. Leader Outlines Changes in Response to Ebola Epidemic

GENEVA — The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] must act to ensure it will not be caught flat-footed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/30/health/how-ebola-roared-back.html] by future crises the way it was by the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic in West Africa, the organization’s director general said on Monday.

“I do not ever again want to see this organization faced with a situation it is not prepared, staffed, funded or administratively set up to manage,” the director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, said at the start of a 10-day meeting of the organization’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly.

As expected, Dr. Chan proposed an overhaul[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/world/africa/who-promises-reform-after-criticism-over-ebola-response.html] of the organization’s emergency response system, intended to make it faster and more effective. The measures would create a dedicated health emergency work force reporting to the director, with a $100 million contingency fund, and would streamline the organization’s procedures for hiring staff, purchasing supplies and moving them swiftly to where they are needed.

Dr. Chan spoke frankly about the shortcomings of the international response to the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 11,000 people.

“W.H.O. was overwhelmed, as were all other responders,” Dr. Chan said. “The demands on W.H.O. were more than 10 times greater than ever experienced in the history of this organization.”

The proposals were meant to stave off suggestions that a new institution should be created to take the lead in tackling health emergencies. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who opened the assembly with a speech on Monday, called the W.H.O. “the only international organization that has universal political legitimacy on global health issues.”

A United Nations panel examining the organization’s response to Ebola said[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/world/europe/who-needs-reforms-in-wake-of-ebola-crisis-report-says.html] last week that it was still unclear why it took so long to act on warnings about the severity of the outbreak. But it too came down firmly against creating another organization to handle emergencies.

“This is a unique time in history, where economic progress is actually increasing threats to health instead of reducing them,” Dr. Chan said on Monday, noting the burden of rising health care costs, the global marketing of unhealthy products and the rise of lifestyle-related diseases.

The assembly’s agenda also includes proposals for combating the rising threat posed by resistance to antibiotic drugs. Some 25,000 people a year die in the European Union alone from infections by drug-resistant bacteria, a draft plan said. Drug companies have not produced a major new class of antibiotics in more than a quarter of a century, the plan noted, while existing drugs have been losing effectiveness.

The trend is “raising the specter of a post-antibiotic era in which common infections will once again kill,” Dr. Chan said.

Ross Douthat
Opinion
The Ann Coulter Critique of American Christianity

My Sunday column[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-do-churches-fail-the-poor.html] discussed recent remarks from President Obama and the sociologist Robert Putnam on American churches and the fight against poverty, in which both men suggested that culture-war fixations have sidelined American Christianity’s mission to the poor.

Given the sums raised[http://www.religionnews.com/2015/05/13/conservative-religious-activism-numbers-speak-commentary/] and man-hours invested by religious groups in charitable work, this is not a particular compelling argument; in fact, it’s pretty dumb, as a number of writers[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-15/verily-i-say-unto-you-christians-care-about-the-poor] had already pointed out[http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamas-casual-slander-american-christians_946360.html] by the time I got around to the subject. So I added my voice to their chorus, but I also tried to raise one possible way in which you could argue that the churches are failing poorer Americans: Not in their charitable works, but in the actual business of soul-winning itself, as evidenced by the fact that downscale Americans are both less likely than the affluent to attend church and less likely to attend, period, than in the recent past. And I noted that you don’t even have to believe in the soul to see this as a failure: Since the social benefits of religion seem to flow through participation and belonging, even from a purely secular perspective (well, if such a thing exists) America’s churches would probably be doing more for the poor than charity alone can offer if they were keeping more people in the pews.

I didn’t have room to get into one related issue, the question of international versus domestic mission work, which for provocation’s sake I’ll discuss after quoting from one of the more hated-on columns of the last few years. I speak, of course, of Ann Coulter’s brief[http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2014-08-06.html] against the Ebola-infected missionary doctor Kent Brantly. Here’s Coulter:

Why did Dr. Brantly have to go to Africa? … Can’t anyone serve Christ in America anymore?

… Your country is like your family. We’re supposed to take care of our own first. The same Bible that commands us to “go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel” also says: “For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, ‘You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.'”

Right there in Texas, near where Dr. Brantly left his wife and children to fly to Liberia and get Ebola, is one of the poorest counties in the nation, Zavala County — where he wouldn’t have risked making his wife a widow and his children fatherless.

But serving the needy in some deadbeat town in Texas wouldn’t have been “heroic.” We wouldn’t hear all the superlatives about Dr. Brantly’s “unusual drive to help the less fortunate” or his membership in the “Gold Humanism Honor Society.” Leaving his family behind in Texas to help the poor 6,000 miles away — that’s the ticket.

There’s a lot more where the above came from, and Coulter actually does a kind of reverse-Putnam in the column, accusing American Christians of being so defeatist about culture war issues that they’ve fled the country to do charitable works as far from the real struggle for their nation’s soul as possible.

Which is … not exactly a convincing argument. And neither is Coulter’s specific critique of Dr. Brantly, which rests on a scriptural exegesis — call it “Christianity in one country”[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_One_Country], maybe — that would seem to make the Great Commission impossible to fulfill so long as your own neighborhood didn’t yet meet the precise standards of the New Jerusalem. ( That Paul, always trying to be a hero: Why didn’t he stick to converting people in Tarsus? Is Galilee really so perfect, Peter, that you felt comfortable ditching it for Rome?)

Of course there are men and women who become missionaries for impure and self-aggrandizing reasons, just as there are Mrs. Jellybys[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleak_House] who support mission work because it seems easier than doing anything for the needy next door. But any religious endeavor attracts people of impure motives; the endeavor itself still needs to be judged on its own terms. And it is hard to see any authentically Christian standard by which a rich country’s citizens setting forth to work with the poorest of the poor could be judged harshly rather than honored as a true expression of the faith[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/pagans-and-christians/].

But not the only true expression. And here I think you can take the personal venom out of Coulter’s argument, reframe it as a call to action, and find a possibly-important point: Namely, that the extraordinary overseas work done by Christian (and especially evangelical, it must be said) missionaries, and the extraordinary fundraising done on their behalf at home, might be a model for a renewal of domestic mission work as well.

Not that such work isn’t already taking place! But in the years I’ve spent in both Protestant and Catholic circles, I’ve definitely heard the language of missionary work applied more often to Asia and Africa and to elite secular environments (you’ll often hear evangelical groups describe, say, the Ivy League or hipster Brooklyn as “mission territory”) than to the worlds of poor and working class Americans. Yet it’s in those worlds where the practice of Christianity is now failing faster than elsewhere in the United States, and where the quasi-secularizing process is bound up with poverty and social instability to an extent that isn’t true in Brooklyn or at Brown. So one need not join Coulter in condemning missionary work done in far-off lands to see room for more energy and effort, and honor for those efforts, in this country as well. And however one thinks American Christianity should respond to its own demographic decline[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/the-real-but-overstated-decline-of-american-christianity/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body], any “option”[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-benedict-option-antipolitical-politics/] that’s chosen or experimented with[http://theweek.com/articles/555734/benedict-option-why-religious-right-considering-allout-withdrawal-from-politics] needs to have these domestic mission fields in mind.

On the specifics of mission work, I’m not in any position to offer advice. But I can do what columnists do best and suggest a couple of writer-activists who deserve attention. One is Matthew Loftus, an evangelical physician with overseas missionary experience[http://mereorthodoxy.com/medical-missionaries-role-evidence/] who now lives and works in Baltimore’s Sandtown and writes eloquently[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/let-sandtown-speak-for-itself/] about that community; you can find a profile of his congregation here[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/6/sandtown-ccda.html]. Another is a Catholic couple whose work I’ve quoted before[http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/the-religious-penumbra-revisited/], David and Amber Lapp, who have been living and working in blue collar Ohio and writing[http://family-studies.org/why-poor-women-with-unintended-pregnancies-are-less-likely-to-get-abortions/]extensively[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/02/alone-in-the-new-america] on that social and religious landscape.

In different ways, you could describe what Loftus and the Lapps have been doing as models of the kind of “culture of encounter” that comes up again and again in Pope Francis’s vision for Catholicism[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/16364/%E2%80%98Culture-of-encounter%E2%80%99-crucial-in-aiding-poor.aspx]. As my readers know, I am just occasionally at variance with the current pontiff[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/magazine/archive/2015/05/will-pope-francis-break-the-church/389516/] on certain matters related to Catholic doctrine and the signs of the times. But on this issue his vision is unsettling in the best sense of the term, because I suspect the churches that let themselves be unsettled around issues of class and race[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/politics/archive/2015/04/southern-baptists-wrestle-with-the-sin-of-racism/389808/], poverty and mission will be the ones that save not only others, but themselves.

Ebola Cases Rise in Guinea and Sierra Leone After Steep Drop

DAKAR, Senegal — Less than a week after declaring the lowest number[http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-13-may-2015%20%20%20] of new Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] cases in Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] this year, officials at the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Tuesday that there had been a nearly fourfold increase during the most recent week of reporting,

to about 35 new cases.

With Liberia, the other West African nation at the center of the epidemic, being declared free of Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/after-ebola-outbreak-liberian-churches-confront-crisis-of-faith.html] this month, the recent drop in infections in Sierra Leone and Guinea had offered hope that the worst Ebola outbreak in history[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html] might end soon.

Officials warned against reading too much into the latest uptick, given the steep overall decline in Ebola cases. As recently as the week of March 15, there were 95 new cases in Guinea alone.

Health officials said that sharp falls and rises were normal as an epidemic approached its end. But they also said that some persistent risky practices, like unsafe burials of Ebola victims in Guinea, had contributed to the rise in new infections.

Most of the new cases, about 27, are in Guinea, and one area in particular is a problem spot: the Forecariah district southeast of the capital, Conakry. It is far from where the outbreak started, in Guinea’s Forest Region, but it is in an area where there has been resistance to the sanitary burials necessary to contain Ebola.

“We’ve been concerned about a number of cases coming from there, of people dying in the community,” said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the W.H.O., referring to the failure to turn corpses over to the authorities in Ebola hot spots, a refusal that has bedeviled health officials since the beginning of the outbreak.

“There is still some concern that there are unsafe burials going on,” she said. “The burial issue is still a very tough one.”

Dr. Harris said a team of experts had been sent to the Forecariah area to help combat the spread of the disease.

“It doesn’t surprise us that within the tail of the epidemic there are peaks and valleys,” said Brice de la Vigne, the Brussels operations director of Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/], which has led the response to the epidemic over the last 14 months.

“This is not scaring us beyond reason; it is normal,” Mr. de la Vigne said, but “we know that there are still people who are contaminating themselves at funerals.”

Adding to the cases are renewed efforts by officials to find the sick, said Sylvie Jonckheere, a Doctors Without Borders official in Conakry.

“They’ve been doing a roundup,” said Ms. Jonckheere. “They have plenty of people looking for the sick in the villages. It’s not really different from what we’ve seen with Ebola in the past.”

It is not a coincidence that the disease is lingering longest in Guinea, where the outbreak began 18 months ago.

In Guinea, resistance to the intervention of outsiders[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/world/africa/fear-of-ebola-opens-wary-villages-to-outsiders-in-guinea.html] — doctors, health officials, politicians — has been stronger[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html] than in either Sierra Leone or Liberia.

Guinea has reacted with occasional violence to efforts to contain the disease. In the Forest Region, eight officials and journalists were killed by villagers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/africa/fear-of-ebola-drives-mob-to-kill-officials-in-guinea.html] during an anti-Ebola rally in September. Before that, doctors and health officials were repeatedly attacked and ambushed, and villages were classified as “closed” or “open” by health officials, depending on whether they would allow outsiders in to combat the disease.

More than 11,000 people have died of Ebola in the three countries, and there have been over 26,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases, according to the W.H.O.’s last situation report[http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-13-may-2015] on the epidemic.

But one telling statistic in the report indicates how sharply the Ebola epidemic has dropped off: Out of 55 districts in the three countries that had reported at least one case of the disease, 43 have not reported a single one for more than six weeks.

Chinese Fleets Illegally Fish in West African Waters, Greenpeace Says

BEIJING — Chinese fishing fleets, driven by plummeting catches close to home, are flocking to distant West African waters, where they engage in ecologically ruinous bottom trawling, subterfuge and other illegal activities that threaten marine resources in a region already under pressure from overfishing, according to a report[http://www.greenpeace.org/africa/en/Press-Centre-Hub/Publications/Africas-fisheries-paradise-at-a-crossroads/] issued on Wednesday by Greenpeace[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/greenpeace/index.html?inline=nyt-org].

The study, the result of a two-year investigation, accuses hundreds of Chinese-owned or Chinese-flagged vessels of taking advantage of weak enforcement by African governments to indiscriminately net untold tons of fish off the coasts of Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone.

Among the worst offenders, Greenpeace said, is the state-owned China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] National Fisheries Corporation, whose ship operators were said to have lied about their locations, underreported the amount of fish in their holds and used damaging fishing methods that are largely banned in Chinese waters. The report said that government regulators in Beijing had been lax in enforcing regulations that govern overseas fishing.

“China is exporting to Africa the kind of destructive fishing practices that depleted local fishing grounds off the Chinese coast,” said Rashid Kang, the director of the China Ocean and Forests campaign at Greenpeace. “At a time when China talks about win-win partnerships with African governments and is concerned with improving its international image, these kinds of practices damage marine resources, threaten local livelihoods and undermine China’s soft power.”

Chinese interest in the waters off West Africa has soared in recent years, prompted by a vast expansion of the country’s industrial fishing fleet, mounting competition and declining stocks of marine life in the coastal waters off China. Many long-distance fishing companies have been encouraged to sail farther afield by generous government subsidies.

Greenpeace said there were more than 450 Chinese-owned fishing vessels operating in Africa, up from just a dozen in 1985.

The group said nearly a fifth of the country’s foreign fishing fleet now operates off the coast of West Africa.

China’s Foreign Ministry, responding to the Greenpeace report, said Chinese fishing vessels that operate in the exclusive economic zones of African countries abide by the agreements they have struck with national governments.

“These ships and companies contribute to local employment, increase tax revenue and contribute to the local economy, and are thus welcomed by local governments and people,” Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a regular news conference on Wednesday.

Much of the research was conducted by a Greenpeace vessel, the Esperanza, that observed Chinese fishing boats as they worked the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa.

Last fall, for example, it recorded illegal fishing by 12 Chinese ships operating in the territorial waters of Guinea at a time when the government was grappling with the Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/africa/fear-of-ebola-drives-mob-to-kill-officials-in-guinea.html]. The report cited boats that fished in prohibited areas, lacked licenses and used illegal nets with tiny mesh openings.

Investigators documented 74 of 92 fishing boats that had turned off the tracking devices mandated by international maritime law; others had been manipulated to give out incorrect locations, including five ships that claimed to be operating in Mexican waters.

In an apparent effort to reduce the licensing fees paid to governments, the report said, a majority of the 59 ships operated by China National Fisheries Corporation in West Africa had underreported their gross tonnage by as much as 60 percent.

Reached by phone, an employee at the state-owned company would not comment on the report’s findings. Employees of two other companies cited by the report denied that they engaged in illegal fishing.

The Greenpeace report also highlighted what it described as lax oversight by African governments, desperate for hard currency, that have eagerly entered into agreements with Chinese fishing companies.

Among the biggest losers, Greenpeace said, were local African fisherman, who complain of diminishing catches and increased costs.

“They are forced to travel further to catch fish and often have to compete for space with industrial trawlers in dangerous waters, increasing the risk of deaths at sea,” the report said.

Texas, Land of Multiple Calamities: Reporter’s Notebook

HOUSTON – The 21st century had barely started when then-Gov. Rick Perry claimed it on behalf of the State of Texas. “You might say historians will look back on this as the ‘Texas Century,’ ” Mr. Perry said at his last inaugural address in Austin in January 2011. “Americans once looked to the East Coast for opportunity and inspiration, then to the West Coast. Today they are looking to the Gulf Coast. They are looking to Texas.”

Sometimes I think Mr. Perry was over-reaching.

And there are times, such as this week, when I think he was spot-on: People are indeed looking to Texas, though often for reasons that have nothing to do with its economy or politics or influence. They are looking to its disasters, natural and man-made.

The parking lot in Waco off Interstate 35 where a gun battle between motorcycle gangs and the police left nine bikers dead Sunday — at last count, the police recovered 118 handguns, 157 knives and an AK-47 — is six miles from the downtown area that was leveled by a tornado in 1953, killing 114 people. The lot is 15 miles from the Branch Davidian compound where, in 1993, about 80 people died in a fire that ended an armed standoff with federal agents. It is 26 miles from the fertilizer plant that exploded in 2013 in the town of West, killing 14 people.

All four episodes took place in the same ordinary Texas county, McLennan County, and they share eerie space on the calendar. The Branch Davidian fire was on April 19, 1993, and the West explosion was April 17, 2013. The tornado was May 11, 1953, and the biker shootout was May 17.

Texas is the land of the multi-catastrophe.

Mass shootings, tornadoes, hurricanes and industrial explosions befall every state, but in Texas they occur so spectacularly, yet so frequently that they often become forgotten. There are too many for Texans to absorb, to observe the anniversaries of, to dwell on. From 1953 to 2011, Texas received 86 major-disaster declarations from the nation’s presidents, the most of any state in the country, according to a 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service. (The second-highest was California with 78. Oklahoma had 69, New York 65 and Florida 63.)

Texas was the site of the worst school disaster in United States history in March 1937, when a natural gas leak caused an explosion at a school building in New London, about a three-hour drive from Waco, killing about 300 students and teachers. Texas has been the scene of America’s worst mass murder on a military installation (Fort Hood in 2009), its greatest industrial disaster (Texas City in 1947), its last murder of a president (Dallas in 1963) and its third-deadliest shooting rampage (Killeen in 1991, at Luby’s cafeteria). The deadliest natural disaster in American history was in Texas — a hurricane in September 1900 that struck Galveston and killed an estimated 8,000 people.

Why Texas?

Experts and officials have no answer. It is perhaps a confluence of geography, weather, a prevalence of guns, lax regulatory oversight, fate and random acts in a big state.

“I know that Texas is roughly a 10th of the population,” said Clay Jenkins, the Dallas County judge, who helped manage the Ebola crisis in Dallas last year. “The more people you have, the more likelihood you’re going to have these things.”

Of course, a state is more than the sum of its disasters.

Late Wednesday afternoon in Waco, crime-scene tape and police vehicles blocked off the parking lot outside the Twin Peaks restaurant where the violence was centered. Yet for the most part, the shopping center was open for business. The shopping plaza, the Central Texas Marketplace, is a sprawling place, at a tangle of highways, with 526,000 rentable square feet. There was room to get as close or as far away from it as any Texan would like. It was the second time in the span of 14 days, that police officers had a fatal shootout in a Texas parking lot that drew national attention, the first being in Garland on May 3, when two men opened fire outside an art exhibit and contest depicting caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.

In Waco, people slowly drove or walked by the scene of the largest, bloodiest confrontation between biker gangs in recent memory on their way to Cavender’s Boot City and Best Buy and Office Depot. Don Carlos, the Tex-Mex restaurant next to Twin Peaks, was open for dinner. Down the parking lot, a woman getting her hair done stood outside in a salon gown, sipping a soda.

“The land, the climate, the sense of endlessness yet constant change,” the historian T.R. Fehrenbach wrote of Texas, “made all who came there hospitable, patriotic, violent and brave.”

Man in New Jersey Dies of Rare Viral Disease After Returning From Liberia

WASHINGTON — A man died of Lassa fever at a hospital in New Jersey on Monday after returning from Liberia this month, health authorities announced.

Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. It can have symptoms similar to Ebola — diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding — but is less infectious and far less likely to be fatal. About 1 percent of Lassa patients die, compared to about 70 percent of Ebola patients.

The patient, who was not identified, traveled from Liberia to Morocco and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on May 17. The patient did not have a fever on departure from Liberia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, or any symptoms such as bleeding, diarrhea or vomiting. When he arrived in the United States, his temperature was taken and again, he did not have a fever.

The next day, he went to a hospital in New Jersey with a sore throat, fever and fatigue. The hospital, which health authorities did not identify, asked about his travel and he “did not indicate travel to West Africa,” the C.D.C. said. The hospital then released him.

He returned on May 21 with worsening symptoms, according to the C.D.C. The hospital transferred him to a treatment center “prepared to treat viral hemorrhagic fevers.”

Samples submitted to the C.D.C. tested positive for Lassa fever on Monday morning. Tests for Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers were negative. The patient was in isolation when he died Monday evening, the C. D. C said.

The C.D.C. said it was working with public health officials to identify people who had contact with the patient. Those identified as close contacts will be monitored for 21 days to see if symptoms occur.

According to the C.D.C., the case in New Jersey is the sixth known occurrence of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the United States since 1969, not including convalescent patients. The last case was reported in Minnesota in 2014.

There has never been person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever documented in the United States, the C.D.C. said. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact, and patients are not believed to be infectious before the onset of symptoms. About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5,000 deaths related to the illness, occur in West Africa each year.

Lassa Virus Carries Little Risk to Public, Experts Say

The report that a man who traveled from Liberia to New Jersey had died on Monday from the viral illness Lassa fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is another sobering reminder that infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] can hop continents and elude detection by health care workers who do not know a patient’s travel history.

Lassa, like Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/ebola-hemorrhagic-fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. But Lassa is from a different family, and nowhere near as deadly or contagious as Ebola. Lassa does not spread easily from person to person, and health officials say there is little or no risk to the public.

Only a handful of Lassa cases have occurred in the United States, all in travelers from other countries. There has never been person-to-person transmission in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In West Africa, where Lassa is common, people usually catch it from rat droppings or urine. Person-to-person spread is rare and does not occur through casual contact, experts say; transmission requires direct contact with a sick person’s blood, bodily fluids or mucous membranes, or sexual contact.

About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5,000 deaths related to the illness, occur in West Africa each year.

The incubation period — the time it takes to get sick after being exposed to the virus — is one to three weeks. Most people, about 80 percent, have only a mild, flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-like illness with a slight fever, headache[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/headache/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and fatigue. But some people become severely ill, with hemorrhaging (in gums, eyes, nose and other places), breathing trouble, vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], facial swelling[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/facial-swelling/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], pain in the chest, back and abdomen, and shock. Some develop neurological problems, including hearing loss[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/hearing-loss/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], tremors and encephalitis[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/encephalitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Overall, about 1 percent of people with Lassa die from it. In pregnant women, the disease often kills the fetus. Women themselves are particularly vulnerable in the third trimester of pregnancy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/pregnancy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and have high death rates, according to the C.D.C.

Person-to-person transmission of Lassa is common in health care settings like some in West Africa, where proper personal protective equipment is lacking, the C.D.C says. The virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles.

New Jersey Lassa Fever Death Prompts C.D.C. Action

WASHINGTON — The story had the grim ring of familiarity. A man who had come from Liberia[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/us/ebola-us-thomas-eric-duncan.html] showed up at a hospital, complaining of fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and tiredness. He was examined and sent home. Several days later he was hospitalized again, in worse condition. In another few days he was dead.

After the government spent months constructing a health monitoring system for Ebola that strikes a balance between protecting public safety and preserving personal liberty, a patient in New Jersey seems to have squeezed through it.

The patient, who was not identified, died from Lassa fever[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/science/lassa-virus-carries-little-risk-to-public-experts-say.html] on Monday night. The viral disease is not nearly as deadly as Ebola, but it is endemic in several West African countries, as well as contagious, and it sent local and federal health officials scrambling to trace the man’s steps in the four days between his hospitalizations.

New Jersey’s state epidemiologist, Dr. Tina Tan, said in a statement, “Given what we know about how Lassa virus spreads to people, we think the risk to the public is extremely low.”

Even so, the series of events raised questions about just how far the country has come in its quest to construct a system to identify cases of fast-spreading infectious disease coming through its borders.

The debate began last year, when a Liberian man infected with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, walked into a Texas hospital and was mistakenly released, even though he had said he had recently come from West Africa. He eventually died, and in the process infected two nurses who had cared for him, prompting a national reckoning and challenging the assumption that American hospitals were prepared to treat such complex diseases that had little precedent in the United States. The nurses eventually recovered[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/ebola-outbreak-dallas-nurse-amber-joy-vinson.html].

The case in New Jersey was smoother in a few important ways. Health officials identified the man at Kennedy International Airport, where he arrived on May 17 from Liberia, via Morocco. He did not, at the time, have a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Federal authorities then handed off his case to local health authorities in New Jersey to begin monitoring in accordance with protocols created last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Liberia was declared Ebola-free[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/liberia-is-free-of-ebola-world-health-organization-declares.html] on May 9, but the travel protocols that were set up last year remain in place.

The man, who was 55, lived in Essex County and frequently traveled to Liberia on mining-related business, health officials said. He showed up at a hospital on May 18, complaining of a sore throat[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/sore-throat/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], fever and tiredness. He was asked about his travel history but did not tell the hospital that he had been to West Africa recently, the C.D.C. said. He was released the same day.

In New Jersey, the crossed wires seem to have been between the local health department responsible for the monitoring and the hospital that originally treated him. One looming question is whether the hospital knew that local health authorities had already been assigned to monitor the man; conversely, it was also unclear whether the local health authorities knew the man had gone to a hospital.

Typically, a recent traveler being monitored for Ebola symptoms checks in with health officials daily via phone, not in person, for 21 days.

The C.D.C. said local authorities tried unsuccessfully to reach the man on May 18, the day he first went to a hospital. The local authorities reached an emergency contact listed for the man on May 19, and spoke to the man directly on May 20 and 21. Each time, his temperature was reported as normal. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Health Department, Donna Leusner, declined to say which local health department monitored the man.

On Friday, the man went back to a hospital with worsening symptoms. Ms. Leusner did not identify which hospital he went to, or if it was the same one that had released him earlier, but health officials soon learned of his condition.

On Saturday, he was transferred to University Hospital in Newark, one of the New Jersey hospitals designated to handle Ebola patients, where he was immediately placed in isolation, according to a hospital spokeswoman. On early Monday morning, a test for Ebola came back negative, while one for Lassa fever was positive. He died that night, at 8:45 p.m.

It remains unclear whether the patient played down his symptoms, or simply did not experience any in the days between his first visit to a hospital and when he was admitted on May 22. Unlike people with Ebola, in which symptoms tend to be constant after they first appear, patients infected with Lassa fever may have symptoms that ebb and flow, for example a temperature that appears one day but not the next.

Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. It can have symptoms similar to Ebola — diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and bleeding — but is less infectious and far less likely to be fatal. About 1 percent of Lassa patients die, compared with about 70 percent of Ebola patients.

A six-member C.D.C. team arrived in New Jersey on Tuesday morning and was overseeing work at the hospitals where the man was seen, including helping hospital officials identify which, if any, health care workers should be monitored for symptoms. State and local health officials, helped by the C.D.C., are tracing the patient’s contacts outside the hospital to see if any of them had close enough contact to warrant monitoring. In Ebola cases in the United States, some people who have had close contact with a patient have been quarantined at home for up to three weeks.

Despite Liberia being declared free of Ebola, the World Health Organization continues to recommend that travelers practice “enhanced precautions” when traveling there, and those returning to the United States from Liberia are still subject to health screening, including questionnaires and temperature checks, at major international airports, including Kennedy and Newark. Nearly 17,000 travelers returning from Ebola-stricken countries have been screened since the fall, according to the C.D.C., and of these, only one, Dr. Craig Spencer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/nyregion/craig-spencer-new-york-ebola-patient-bellevue.html] of New York City, turned out to have Ebola; he recovered. (Several patients, including Mr. Duncan, were diagnosed before the screening protocols were created, while others were diagnosed while in Africa and then transported to American hospitals.)

According to the agency, the case in New Jersey is the sixth known occurrence of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the United States since 1969. Two other cases became known only after the patients had recovered. The last known case was reported in Minnesota in 2014.

Sabrina Tavernise reported from Washington, and Anemona Hartocollis from New York.

N.Y. / Region
Hospital Says Man Who Died of Lassa Fever Initially Didn’t Disclose Trip to Africa
By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

A New Jersey hospital identified itself on Wednesday as the one that released a man on May 18 who later died[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/us/new-jersey-lassa-fever-death-prompts-cdc-action.html] of a rare disease that he may have contracted in Liberia.

But the hospital, St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, said the man had not told hospital staff of his recent travels until at least three days after he first visited the emergency room — a disclosure that, if made sooner, could have allowed health officials to prevent transmission to others and potentially save him.

The man, who has not been identified, died on Monday night of Lassa fever[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/science/lassa-virus-carries-little-risk-to-public-experts-say.html], a viral disease endemic to West Africa and with symptoms similar to Ebola, but far less deadly. His death, however, exposed shortcomings of a surveillance system set up to monitor diseases like Ebola, one that relies on multiple government agencies as well as the honesty of patients.

The man, a 55-year-old from Essex County who frequently traveled to Liberia for mining-related business, landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on May 17. At the airport, he had no symptoms, but he was flagged for Ebola monitoring based on his travel history and questioning by customs officials.

Liberia was declared free of Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/world/africa/liberia-is-free-of-ebola-world-health-organization-declares.html] this month by the World Health Organization, but travelers returning from there are still subject to monitoring in the United States

He was supposed to take his temperature twice a day and report it to the Newark Health Department.

The next day, he went to the St. Barnabas emergency room, complaining of fever, fatigue and a sore throat.

The Ebola monitoring system set up across the country last fall does not require health officials to pass along a list of travelers to local hospitals. But when travelers are flagged at the airport, they are given a card that they are supposed to show to doctors and hospitals, which indicates that they are being monitored for Ebola.

“This person has recently returned from a country that has an Ebola outbreak,” the card, labeled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], says.

It instructs health care providers to put the patient in a private room with a private bathroom and to notify the local health department.

But the man apparently did not show such a card to health care workers at St. Barnabas when he first appeared there.

And although he had just returned from Liberia, St. Barnabas said in a statement, “this individual did not disclose recent international travel when asked by staff.”

The hospital released him that day, and over the next couple of days, he reported to the Newark Health Department that his temperature was normal, a possibility with Lassa fever, whose symptoms can sometimes recede and return.

But last Thursday, according to the hospital, he returned to St. Barnabas, and was admitted.

“During that admission, he disclosed recent travel to Liberia,” the hospital statement said.

Newark health officials learned of his admission the next day — not through the hospital but through a representative of the patient, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was still being investigated.

David Lippman, a spokesman for the City of Newark, declined to comment on the case, except to say the city was investigating.

On Saturday, the man was transferred to University Hospital in Newark, one of New Jersey’s facilities designated for handling Ebola cases. A blood test was performed, and it came back negative for Ebola but positive for Lassa fever, a disease that kills about 1 percent of patients, compared with 70 percent for Ebola.

The man died on Monday night.

State and federal officials said they expected to monitor a number of people who had contact with the man, including relatives and health care workers, for signs of Lassa fever. Health officials said New Jersey had been through a similar situation in 2004, when a man died of Lassa fever in a Trenton hospital. One hundred eighty-eight people were monitored, none of whom received a diagnosis of the contagion.

Cuomo and de Blasio Put Their Gloves Back On

The détente included a telephone call, one connecting the two most powerful men in New York politics, whose escalating feud just happened to threaten legislation affecting millions.

The discussion between Mayor Bill de Blasio[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/bill_de_blasio/index.html?inline=nyt-per] and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] on Monday morning was one in a series of conversations that the mayor later described as clarifying. By day’s end, both men had made gestures of conciliation, pledging to find ways to work together in the final days of the state legislative session.

But Monday’s rapprochement, temporary or not, came after an episode of conflict extraordinary even by the standards of this notably rocky relationship. It was fueled by public broadsides — Mr. de Blasio, fed up, issued his sharpest criticism to date of the governor — and private resentments, including Mr. Cuomo’s pique over the mayor’s choice for a new press secretary.

On the surface, the dispute centered on arcane state laws governing real estate tax breaks and mayoral control of the city’s public schools.

In recent days, City Hall saw the governor as unfair in tarnishing Mr. de Blasio’s support of organized labor, while Mr. Cuomo’s circle grumbled that the mayor’s legislative lobbying was more about his efforts to burnish his national profile.

And behind the scenes, there were other matters at stake, centered in part around Mr. de Blasio’s hiring of Karen Hinton as his new press secretary.

The spat began days after word leaked of the hiring of Ms. Hinton, an experienced public relations hand who has known both men since working with them in the 1990s at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She is also married to Howard Glaser, a onetime senior aide to Mr. Cuomo.

The governor, who prizes loyalty, was surprised by the appointment, and irritated that a person he had considered part of his inner circle was headed to work for a rival, according to several people briefed on the matter who were granted anonymity to describe private and sensitive conversations.

These people said the governor was upset that his office did not hear about the appointment first from either the mayor, Ms. Hinton, or Mr. Glaser.

One Cuomo administration official, who asked not to be named, would say only that the governor’s office was given notice about Ms. Hinton’s appointment.

Ms. Hinton, in a statement on Monday, said: “I have a great deal of respect for both Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, and I am fortunate that I have been allowed to work for both of them. I have no doubt that they will work together in many ways, going forward, to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.”

It was not always clear in the past few days that such cooperation could be reached.

The war of words began Wednesday, after the mayor visited Albany to push his legislative agenda. Hours after Mr. Cuomo met with Mr. de Blasio, the Cuomo administration released, to some news outlets, an unattributed statement that said Mr. de Blasio’s appearance “in the Capitol a few days before the end of a session with controversial and untested ideas” was not “how leaders get things done.”

That provoked a quick response from the mayor’s office, which in turn questioned the governor’s leadership. After that, the gloves were off, essentially ending months of Mr. de Blasio’s avoidance of direct criticism of Mr. Cuomo — who, after all, has much control over the city’s legislative agenda.

Since Mr. de Blasio took office, City Hall had grown accustomed to the governor’s wiliness, with some feeling that Mr. Cuomo has undermined the mayor’s Ebola policy, closed the city subways with little notice and stymied his priorities in Albany.

But allies of the mayor described him as stung last week when Mr. Cuomo described the city’s plan for real estate tax breaks as a “giveaway” to developers and “unfair” to organized labor, touching a raw nerve for a mayor who prides himself as a defender of the working class.

Mr. de Blasio’s plan is indeed opposed by some construction unions, who want the mayor to require higher wages in return for tax breaks. The fissure offered Mr. Cuomo, who is cool to the city’s proposal, a tantalizing opportunity to drive a wedge between the mayor and his labor support. Mr. de Blasio’s supporters, however, viewed the governor’s attacks as extreme, and noted that the governor had long been friendly with the real estate industry.

The mayor told reporters this weekend that the governor was being “disingenuous” and was “not interested in the facts.”

That uncivil tone was absent in public comments by both the mayor and the governor on Monday.

“There’s some real common ground,” Mr. de Blasio told reporters at a news conference at City Hall, where he had gathered business leaders, including Richard Parsons, the former chairman of Citigroup and Time Warner, who support an extension of mayoral control of schools.

Mr. de Blasio, who often chafes at questions about his relationship with other politicians, was largely affable at the event, emphasizing his cooperation with Mr. Cuomo. “It’s not surprising that each of us has strong views,” the mayor said. “But, you know, I also think there’s a lot we can get done.”

The mayor isn’t the only person hoping to get something from Albany this year, though some are getting a warmer reception there than others.

Mr. Cuomo on Monday hosted two events at the governor’s mansion for Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, who was in Albany to make an end-of-session push for a bill that would give tax credits to families of students at private schools, as well as to donors to nonprofit groups that award scholarships for private school students.

Mr. Cuomo has been pushing for the proposal, but it faces opposition in the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, many of whom feel it is a tax giveaway for the rich.

As for his relationship with the mayor, Mr. Cuomo on Monday played down their tussle as a robust exchange of ideas between friends.

“He is a tough advocate, and I wouldn’t respect him if he wasn’t,” the governor said of the mayor, during a radio interview on WCNY. “He does what he does very well.”

“A healthy debate is healthy,” Mr. Cuomo added. “We could use more of it in Albany.”

Matt Flegenheimer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

Do You Say ‘Kind of, Sort of’ More Than You Realize?

Have you ever sort of wondered what words have crept into your speech that you kind of like didn’t even notice? Perhaps you’ve caught yourself filling in pauses with “you know” or “ummm.” But what about words that hedge what you’re saying or water down your point?

Do you say “kind of” or “sort of” more than you realize?

In the 2014 Op-Ed essay “The ‘Kind of, Sort of’ Era[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/opinion/sunday/the-kind-of-sort-of-era.html],” Steven Kurutz writes about how these words have become common filler phrases in casual speech:

I’ve sort of noticed something about the way we speak, and I wonder if you’ve sort of noticed it, too. Let me kind of explain. It’s about sort of, and its twin, kind of, and how these adverbial downtoners, as the British grammarian Sir Randolph Quirk calls them, have totally, completely, 100 percent taken over casual speech.

Kinda, sorta.

I’m not referring to their use to describe a class of something, such as a sort of mammal, but rather as hedge words, to lessen a statement’s force or meaning. For instance, here’s the University of Cambridge ecologist Peter Walsh speaking recently about Ebola: “What’s nasty about it is it sort of melts your blood vessels.”

And here’s Edward J. Snowden describing his background to Brian Williams of NBC: “I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word.”

And here’s the comedian Amy Poehler explaining how she and Tina Fey divvy up laugh lines: “It kind of figures itself out. We just have to kind of be democratic about it.”

It’s possible I’m experiencing what linguists call the frequency illusion — my brain is primed to recognize the phrases, so I’m hearing them all the time. Or maybe I’ve stumbled into another linguistic pitfall, the recency illusion, thinking that a word or phrase is recent when it has actually existed for a long time. In 1995, William Safire noted in The New York Times Magazine the widespread use of kinda-sorta in the courtroom of the O. J. Simpson trial. And as far back as 1909, the language stickler Ambrose Bierce complained that “Kind of followed by an adjective, as ‘kind of good,’ is almost too gross for censure.”

It may be too gross for censure, but “kind of” and “sort of” have shown staying power over the decades. If you put “sort of” into Google’s Ngram viewer, a database of millions of digitized books, you find steady usage levels through the 1980s and ’90s, and a small uptick starting in 2000. And that’s only written language, not informal speech. For anecdotal proof, listen to NPR for a few hours (though not conservative talk radio, where certainty is more the rule of law).

Gabriel Doyle, who has a Ph.D. in linguistics and writes the blog Motivated Grammar, told me that “sort of”’ is a “de-precision device.” As Dr. Doyle put it: “The speaker is saying, ‘Don’t think of this as being overly accurate.’ ”

In other words, people throw “sort of” into their speech because they’re unsure. Our language is reflecting modern life.

Students: Read the entire essay, then tell us …

— Do you say “kind of” or “sort of” more than you realize?

— Have you ever recorded yourself speaking? Have you noticed anything about the words you use or the way you speak that you hadn’t noticed before? What did you notice? Did it bother you?

— Do you have any verbal tics or filler phrases that you go back to over and over? For example, do you overuse any of these words: like, you know, so, actually or right?

— Do you agree with Mr. Kurutz that overusing “kind of” and “sort of” weakens language — that it can “make for wishy-washy and obsequious speech that lacks clarity, confidence and authority”? Why?

South Korea Reports 3rd Death From MERS Virus

SEOUL, South Korea — An 82-year-old man has died of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, officials said on Thursday. His was the third confirmed death in what has become the largest outbreak of the viral disease outside the Middle East.

More than 1,160 schools and kindergartens in South Korea have been shut down temporarily, and many Koreans are wearing surgical masks in public out of fear of infection.

The government said in a statement that the man died on Wednesday, and a posthumous test showed that he was infected with the MERS virus, making his the 36th confirmed case in South Korea.

As fears of the virus spread, the government of President Park Geun-hye has been accused of endangering the public by withholding information about the outbreak; the most recent criticism came from the influential mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon.

In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Park assailed the national government for not disclosing that a doctor employed at a Seoul hospital who was quarantined with MERS symptoms on Sunday had attended a gathering of more than 1,500 people in the southern part of the city the day before.

The health ministry announced earlier on Thursday that the doctor was the country’s 35th confirmed MERS patient and that he had caught the virus from a patient he treated on May 27, but it did not mention the gathering.

“It increased the possibility that the virus spread and infected more people,” the mayor said, calling the development a “grave situation.” Mr. Park said city officials had begun phoning all those who had attended the gathering to ask them to quarantine themselves.

The government did not immediately respond to the mayor’s criticism.

Its ability to contain the virus came under more scrutiny on Thursday with news of the 82-year-old man’s death. He apparently caught the virus in a hospital, where he was being treated for asthma and pneumonia in late May. A new patient placed in his room was later found to be carrying the virus, and thee others who stayed in the room have since tested positive, but an earlier test did not find the virus in him, officials said; he was under quarantine for further observation when he died.

Most of the MERS cases reported in South Korea so far are believed to have been infected in hospitals in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul. The cases include staff members, patients and visitors. The government has refused to name the six hospitals in Gyeonggi and nearby cities where the patients were infected.

Health officials have raced to track down anyone who may have come into contact with known MERS patients, and have isolated more than 1,660 people in their homes or at state-run facilities to see if they develop symptoms.

Worries about the virus appear to have spread to North Korea as well. On Thursday, the South Korean government said that the North had asked to borrow heat-detecting cameras to help screen South Korean factory managers as they commute to an industrial park run jointly by the two countries in the North Korean border city of Kaesong [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/northkorea/kaesong/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. In the complex, 54,000 North Koreans work in 124 factories run by the South.

The industrial park is an important source of earnings for the North, and South Korean officials said there had been no indication that the North planned to close it temporarily because of the viral outbreak.

The South Korean government said it would lend three of the cameras to the North, as it did in November when North Korea tightened inspections at ports and airports and closed its borders to foreign tourists to guard against the Ebola [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus. North Korea reopened the border to tourists in early March.

Thousands of North Koreans are said to be working at building sites in the Middle East, where the virus first emerged in 2012. In all, more than 470 deaths have been linked to the virus, the vast majority of them in the Middle East.

Around 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 11 last year, Duval Arthur, director of the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness for St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, got a call from a resident who had just received a disturbing text message. ''Toxic fume hazard warning in this area until 1:30 PM,'' the message read. ''Take Shelter. Check Local Media and columbiachemical.com.''

St. Mary Parish is home to many processing plants for chemicals and natural gas, and keeping track of dangerous accidents at those plants is Arthur's job. But he hadn't heard of any chemical release that morning. In fact, he hadn't even heard of Columbia Chemical. St. Mary Parish had a Columbian Chemicals plant, which made carbon black, a petroleum product used in rubber and plastics. But he'd heard nothing from them that morning, either. Soon, two other residents called and reported the same text message. Arthur was worried: Had one of his employees sent out an alert without telling him?

If Arthur had checked Twitter, he might have become much more worried. Hundreds of Twitter accounts were documenting a disaster right down the road. ''A powerful explosion heard from miles away happened at a chemical plant in Centerville, Louisiana #ColumbianChemicals,'' a man named Jon Merritt tweeted. The #ColumbianChemicals hashtag was full of eyewitness accounts of the horror in Centerville. @AnnRussela shared an image of flames engulfing the plant. @Ksarah12 posted a video of surveillance footage from a local gas station, capturing the flash of the explosion. Others shared a video in which thick black smoke rose in the distance.

Dozens of journalists, media outlets and politicians, from Louisiana to New York City, found their Twitter accounts inundated with messages about the disaster. ''Heather, I'm sure that the explosion at the #ColumbianChemicals is really dangerous. Louisiana is really screwed now,'' a user named @EricTraPPP tweeted at the New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Heather Nolan. Another posted a screenshot of CNN's home page, showing that the story had already made national news. ISIS had claimed credit for the attack, according to one YouTube video; in it, a man showed his TV screen, tuned to an Arabic news channel, on which masked ISIS fighters delivered a speech next to looping footage of an explosion. A woman named Anna McClaren (@zpokodon9) tweeted at Karl Rove: ''Karl, Is this really ISIS who is responsible for #ColumbianChemicals? Tell @Obama that we should bomb Iraq!'' But anyone who took the trouble to check CNN.com would have found no news of a spectacular Sept. 11 attack by ISIS. It was all fake: the screenshot, the videos, the photographs.

In St. Mary Parish, Duval Arthur quickly made a few calls and found that none of his employees had sent the alert. He called Columbian Chemicals, which reported no problems at the plant. Roughly two hours after the first text message was sent, the company put out a news release, explaining that reports of an explosion were false. When I called Arthur a few months later, he dismissed the incident as a tasteless prank, timed to the anniversary of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''Personally I think it's just a real sad, sick sense of humor,'' he told me. ''It was just someone who just liked scaring the daylights out of people.'' Authorities, he said, had tried to trace the numbers that the text messages had come from, but with no luck. (The F.B.I. told me the investigation was still open.)

The Columbian Chemicals hoax was not some simple prank by a bored sadist. It was a highly coordinated disinformation campaign, involving dozens of fake accounts that posted hundreds of tweets for hours, targeting a list of figures precisely chosen to generate maximum attention. The perpetrators didn't just doctor screenshots from CNN; they also created fully functional clones of the websites of Louisiana TV stations and newspapers. The YouTube video of the man watching TV had been tailor-made for the project. A Wikipedia page was even created for the Columbian Chemicals disaster, which cited the fake YouTube video. As the virtual assault unfolded, it was complemented by text messages to actual residents in St. Mary Parish. It must have taken a team of programmers and content producers to pull off.

And the hoax was just one in a wave of similar attacks during the second half of last year. On Dec. 13, two months after a handful of Ebola cases in the United States touched off a minor media panic, many of the same Twitter accounts used to spread the Columbian Chemicals hoax began to post about an outbreak of Ebola in Atlanta. The campaign followed the same pattern of fake news reports and videos, this time under the hashtag #EbolaInAtlanta, which briefly trended in Atlanta. Again, the attention to detail was remarkable, suggesting a tremendous amount of effort. A YouTube video showed a team of hazmat-suited medical workers transporting a victim from the airport. BeyoncÃ©'s recent single ''7/11'' played in the background, an apparent attempt to establish the video's contemporaneity. A truck in the parking lot sported the logo of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

On the same day as the Ebola hoax, a totally different group of accounts began spreading a rumor that an unarmed black woman had been shot to death by police. They all used the hashtag #shockingmurderinatlanta. Here again, the hoax seemed designed to piggyback on real public anxiety; that summer and fall were marked by protests over the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. In this case, a blurry video purports to show the shooting, as an onlooker narrates. Watching it, I thought I recognized the voice -- it sounded the same as the man watching TV in the Columbian Chemicals video, the one in which ISIS supposedly claims responsibility. The accent was unmistakable, if unplaceable, and in both videos he was making a very strained attempt to sound American. Somehow the result was vaguely Australian.

Who was behind all of this? When I stumbled on it last fall, I had an idea. I was already investigating a shadowy organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that spreads false information on the Internet. It has gone by a few names, but I will refer to it by its best known: the Internet Research Agency. The agency had become known for employing hundreds of Russians to post pro-Kremlin propaganda online under fake identities, including on Twitter, in order to create the illusion of a massive army of supporters; it has often been called a ''troll farm.'' The more I investigated this group, the more links I discovered between it and the hoaxes. In April, I went to St. Petersburg to learn more about the agency and its brand of information warfare, which it has aggressively deployed against political opponents at home, Russia's perceived enemies abroad and, more recently, me.

Seven months after the Columbian Chemicals hoax, I was in a dim restaurant in St. Petersburg, peering out the window at an office building at 55 Savushkina Street, the last known home of the Internet Research Agency. It sits in St. Petersburg's northwestern Primorsky District, a quiet neighborhood of ugly Soviet apartment buildings and equally ugly new office complexes. Among the latter is 55 Savushkina; from the front, its perfect gray symmetry, framed by the rectangular pillars that flank its entrance, suggests the grim impenetrability of a medieval fortress. Behind the glass doors, a pair of metal turnstiles stand guard at the top of a short flight of stairs in the lobby. At 9 o'clock on this Friday night in April, except for the stairwell and the lobby, the building was entirely dark.

This puzzled my dining companion, a former agency employee named Ludmila Savchuk. She shook her head as she lifted the heavy floral curtain to take another look. It was a traditional Russian restaurant, with a dining room done up like a parlor from the early 1900s, complete with bentwood chairs and a vintage globe that showed Alaska as part of Russia. Savchuk's 5-year-old son sat next to her, slurping down a bowl of ukha, a traditional fish soup. For two and a half months, Savchuk told me, she had worked 12-hour shifts in the building, always beginning at 9 a.m. and finishing at 9 p.m., at which point she and her co-workers would eagerly stream out the door at once. ''At 9 p.m. sharp, there should be a crowd of people walking outside the building,'' she said. ''Nine p.m. sharp.'' One Russian newspaper put the number of employees at 400, with a budget of at least 20 million rubles (roughly $400,000) a month. During her time in the organization, there were many departments, creating content for every popular social network: LiveJournal, which remains popular in Russia; VKontakte, Russia's homegrown version of Facebook; Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; and the comment sections of Russian news outlets. One employee estimated the operation filled 40 rooms.

Every day at the Internet Research Agency was essentially the same, Savchuk told me. The first thing employees did upon arriving at their desks was to switch on an Internet proxy service, which hid their I.P. addresses from the places they posted; those digital addresses can sometimes be used to reveal the real identity of the poster. Savchuk would be given a list of the opinions she was responsible for promulgating that day. Workers received a constant stream of ''technical tasks'' -- point-by-point exegeses of the themes they were to address, all pegged to the latest news. Ukraine was always a major topic, because of the civil war there between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian Army; Savchuk and her co-workers would post comments that disparaged the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, and highlighted Ukrainian Army atrocities. Russian domestic affairs were also a major topic. Last year, after a financial crisis hit Russia and the ruble collapsed, the professional trolls left optimistic posts about the pace of recovery. Savchuk also says that in March, after the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was murdered, she and her entire team were moved to the department that left comments on the websites of Russian news outlets and ordered to suggest that the opposition itself had set up the murder.

Savchuk told me she shared an office with about a half-dozen teammates. It was smaller than most, because she worked in the elite Special Projects department. While other workers churned out blandly pro-Kremlin comments, her department created appealing online characters who were supposed to stand out from the horde. Savchuk posed as three of these creations, running a blog for each one on LiveJournal. One alter ego was a fortuneteller named Cantadora. The spirit world offered Cantadora insight into relationships, weight loss, feng shui -- and, occasionally, geopolitics. Energies she discerned in the universe invariably showed that its arc bent toward Russia. She foretold glory for Vladimir Putin, defeat for Barack Obama and Petro Poroshenko. The point was to weave propaganda seamlessly into what appeared to be the nonpolitical musings of an everyday person.

In fact, she was a troll. The word ''troll'' was popularized in the early 1990s to denounce the people who derailed conversation on Usenet discussion lists with interminable flame wars, or spammed chat rooms with streams of disgusting photos, choking users with a cloud of filth. As the Internet has grown, the problem posed by trolls has grown more salient even as their tactics have remained remarkably constant. Today an ISIS supporter might adopt a pseudonym to harass a critical journalist on Twitter, or a right-wing agitator in the United States might smear demonstrations against police brutality by posing as a thieving, violent protester. Any major conflict is accompanied by a raging online battle between trolls on both sides.

As Savchuk and other former employees describe it, the Internet Research Agency had industrialized the art of trolling. Management was obsessed with statistics -- page views, number of posts, a blog's place on LiveJournal's traffic charts -- and team leaders compelled hard work through a system of bonuses and fines. ''It was a very strong corporate feeling,'' Savchuk says. Her schedule gave her two 12-hour days in a row, followed by two days off. Over those two shifts she had to meet a quota of five political posts, 10 nonpolitical posts and 150 to 200 comments on other workers' posts. The grueling schedule wore her down. She began to feel queasy, she said, posting vitriol about opposition leaders of whom she had no actual opinion, or writing nasty words about Ukrainians when some of her closest acquaintances, including her own ex-husband, were Ukrainian.

Employees were mostly in their 20s but were drawn from a broad cross-section of Russian society. It seemed as if the agency's task was so large that it would hire almost anyone who responded to the many ads it posted on job boards, no matter how undereducated or politically ignorant they were. Posts teemed with logical and grammatical errors. ''They were so stupid,'' says Marat Burkhardt, who worked for two months in the department of forums, posting 135 comments a day on little-read message boards about remote Russian towns. ''You see these people with a lot of tattoos. They're so cool, like they're from New York; very hip clothing, very hip tattoos, like they're from Williamsburg. But they are stupid.'' In office conversation, they used gay slurs to refer to Petro Poroshenko and called Barack Obama a monkey. Management tried to rectify their ignorance with grammar classes. Others had ''politology'' classes to outline the proper Russian point of view on current events.

Yet the exact point of their work was left unclear to them. The handful of employees I spoke with did not even know the name of the company's chief executive. They had signed a nondisclosure agreement but no official contract. Salaries were surprisingly high for the work; Savchuk's was 41,000 rubles a month ($777), or as much as a tenured university professor earns. ''I can't say they clearly explain to you what your purpose there is,'' Savchuk says. ''But they created such an atmosphere that people would understand they were doing something important and secretive and very highly paid. And that they won't be able to find a job like this anywhere else.''

Savchuk is 34, but her taste in clothes runs toward the teenage: The night of our dinner she wore a plaid dress and a billowing neon yellow jacket, and her head was swaddled in a fuzzy hood with animal ears. She credits her innocent appearance for allowing her to infiltrate the Internet Research Agency without raising alarms. While employed there, she copied dozens of documents to her personal email account and also plied her co-workers for information. She made a clandestine video of the office. In February, she leaked it all to a reporter for Moi Raion, a local newspaper known for its independent reporting. The documents, together with her story, offered the most detailed look yet into the daily life of a pro-Kremlin troll. Though she quit the agency the day the exposÃ© was published, she was continuing her surveillance from the outside. She brought a camera to our dinner in hopes of documenting the changing of the shifts, which she planned to post to the VKontakte page of Information Peace, the group she founded to fight the agency. Her ultimate goal is to shut it down entirely, believing that its information warfare is contributing to an increasingly dark atmosphere in Russia. ''Information peace is the start of real peace,'' she says.

But at 10 minutes after 9 p.m., still no crowd had entered or left 55 Savushkina. Finally, around 9:30, a group of five young people approached the building and walked inside. Savchuk perked up, grabbed the camera and began to film the scene. Now more started filtering in, each of them stopping at the guard desk to check in. I counted at least 30 in all. Savchuk told me with pride that she believed the agency had changed its schedule to confound journalists, who began to stake out the place after her exposÃ©.

Savchuk is accustomed to antagonizing powerful people. She has been a longtime environmental activist in the town of Pushkin, the suburb of St. Petersburg where she lives; her main cause before the troll farm was saving forests and parks from being paved over by well-connected developers. Last year she even ran for a seat on her municipal council as an independent, which in Russia requires a level of optimism bordering on delusion. On Election Day, she told me, state employees -- health care workers, teachers, law enforcement, etc. -- came to the polls wielding lists of candidates they had been ''encouraged'' to vote for, all of them associated with United Russia, the governing party of Vladimir Putin. (She lost her race.) Savchuk has filed a lawsuit against the Internet Research Agency for violating labor rights laws, citing the lack of official contracts. She has enlisted the help of a well-known human rights lawyer named Ivan Pavlov, who has spent years fighting for transparency laws in Russia; he took on Savchuk's case in hopes that it would force the agency to answer questions about its business on the record.

Several Russian media outlets have claimed that the agency is funded by Evgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch restaurateur called ''the Kremlin's chef'' in the independent press for his lucrative government contracts and his close relationship with Putin. When a reporter from the opposition paper Novaya Gazeta infiltrated the agency posing as a job seeker, she discovered that one of the team leaders was an employee of Prigozhin's Concord holding company. (The reporter was familiar with her because the woman was famous among journalists for having been deployed by Prigozhin to spy on Novaya Gazeta.) The suspicion around Prigozhin was bolstered when emails leaked by hackers showed an accountant at Concord approving payments to the agency. If the speculation is accurate, it would not be the first time that Prigozhin has used his enormous wealth to fund quixotic schemes against his enemies: According to Novaya Gazeta, a documentary he backed, which later ran on the Kremlin-controlled NTV, claimed that the protesters who participated in the enormous anti-Putin demonstrations of 2011 were paid agents provocateurs, some of them bribed by United States government officials, who fed them cookies. ''I think of him as Dr. Evil,'' says Andrei Soshnikov, the reporter at Moi Raion to whom Savchuk leaked her documents. (My calls to Concord went unreturned.)

Savchuk's revelations about the agency have fascinated Russia not because they are shocking but because they confirm what everyone has long suspected: The Russian Internet is awash in trolls. ''This troll business becomes more popular year by year,'' says Platon Mamatov, who says that he ran his own troll farm in the Ural Mountains from 2008 to 2013. During that time he employed from 20 to 40 people, mostly students and young mothers, to carry out online tasks for Kremlin contacts and local and regional authorities from Putin's United Russia party. Mamatov says there are scores of operations like his around the country, working for government authorities at every level. Because the industry is secretive, with its funds funneled through a maze of innocuous-sounding contracts and shell businesses, it is difficult to estimate exactly how many people are at work trolling today. But Mamatov claims ''there are thousands -- I'm not sure about how many, but yes, really, thousands.''

The boom in pro-Kremlin trolling can be traced to the antigovernment protests of 2011, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets after evidence of fraud in the recent Parliamentary election emerged. The protests were organized largely over Facebook and Twitter and spearheaded by leaders, like the anticorruption crusader Alexei Navalny, who used LiveJournal blogs to mobilize support. The following year, when Vyascheslav Volodin, the new deputy head of Putin's administration and architect of his domestic policy, came into office, one of his main tasks was to rein in the Internet. Volodin, a lawyer who studied engineering in college, approached the problem as if it were a design flaw in a heating system. Forbes Russia reported that Volodin installed in his office a custom-designed computer terminal loaded with a system called Prism, which monitored public sentiment online using 60 million sources. According to the website of its manufacturer, Prism ''actively tracks the social media activities that result in increased social tension, disorderly conduct, protest sentiments and extremism.'' Or, as Forbes put it, ''Prism sees social media as a battlefield.''

The battle was conducted on multiple fronts. Laws were passed requiring bloggers to register with the state. A blacklist allowed the government to censor websites without a court order. Internet platforms like Yandex were subjected to political pressure, while others, like VKontakte, were brought under the control of Kremlin allies. Putin gave ideological cover to the crackdown by calling the entire Internet a ''C.I.A. project,'' one that Russia needed to be protected from. Restrictions online were paired with a new wave of digital propaganda. The government consulted with the same public relations firms that worked with major corporate brands on social-media strategy. It began paying fashion and fitness bloggers to place pro-Kremlin material among innocuous posts about shoes and diets, according to Yelizaveta Surnacheva, a journalist with the magazine Kommersant Vlast. Surnacheva told me over Skype that the government was even trying to place propaganda with popular gay bloggers -- a surprising choice given the notorious new law against ''gay propaganda,'' which fines anyone who promotes homosexuality to minors.

All of this has contributed to a dawning sense, among the Russian journalists and activists I spoke with, that the Internet is no longer a natural medium for political opposition. ''The myth that the Internet is controlled by the opposition is very, very old,'' says Leonid Volkov, a liberal politician and campaign manager to Alexei Navalny. ''It's not true since at least three years.'' Part of this is simple demographics: The Internet audience has expanded from its early adopters, who were more likely to be well-educated liberal intelligentsia, to the whole of Russia, which overwhelmingly supports Putin. Also, by working every day to spread Kremlin propaganda, the paid trolls have made it impossible for the normal Internet user to separate truth from fiction.

''The point is to spoil it, to create the atmosphere of hate, to make it so stinky that normal people won't want to touch it,'' Volkov said, when we met in the office of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. ''You have to remember the Internet population of Russia is just over 50 percent. The rest are yet to join, and when they join it's very important what is their first impression.'' The Internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them. During the protests, a favorite tactic of the opposition was making anti-Putin hashtags trend on Twitter. Today, waves of trolls and bots regularly promote pro-Putin hashtags. What once was an exhilarating act of popular defiance now feels empty. ''It kind of discredited the idea of political hashtags,'' says Ilya Klishin, the web editor for the independent television station TV Rain who, in 2011, created the Facebook page for the antigovernment protests.

Russia's information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history, and its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space. In the midst of such a war, the Runet (as the Russian Internet is often called) can be an unpleasant place for anyone caught in the crossfire. Soon after I met Leonid Volkov, he wrote a post on his Facebook wall about our interview, saying that he had spoken with someone from The New York Times. A former pro-Kremlin blogger later warned me about this. Kremlin allies, he explained, monitored Volkov's page, and now they would be on guard. ''That was not smart,'' he said.

The chain that links the Columbian Chemicals hoax to the Internet Research Agency begins with an act of digital subterfuge perpetrated by its online enemies. Last summer, a group called Anonymous International -- believed to be unaffiliated with the well-known hacktivist group Anonymous -- published a cache of hundreds of emails said to have been stolen from employees at the agency. It was just one hack in a long series that Anonymous International had carried out against the Kremlin in recent months. The group leaked embarrassing photos of Putin allies and incriminating emails among officials. It claimed to have hacked into Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's phone, and reportedly hacked his Twitter account, tweeting: ''I'm resigning. I am ashamed of this government's actions. Forgive me.''

The emails indicated that the Internet Research Agency had begun to troll in English. One document outlined a project called ''World Translation''; the problem, it explained, was that the foreign Internet was biased four to one against Russia, and the project aimed to change the ratio. Another email contained a spreadsheet that listed some of the troll accounts the agency was using on the English-language web. After BuzzFeed reported on the leak, I used the spreadsheet to start mapping the network of accounts on Facebook and Twitter, trying to draw connections.

One account was called ''I Am Ass.'' Ass had a Twitter account, an Instagram account, multiple Facebook accounts and his own website. In his avatars, Ass was depicted as a pair of cartoon buttocks with an ugly, smirking face. He filled his social-media presences with links to news articles, along with his own commentary. Ass had a puerile sense of humor and only a rudimentary grasp of the English language. He also really hated Barack Obama. Ass denounced Obama in posts strewn with all-caps rants and scatological puns. One characteristic post linked to a news article about an ISIS massacre in Iraq, which Ass shared on Facebook with the comment: ''I'm scared and farting! ISIS is a monster awakened by Obama when he unleashed this disastrous Iraq war!''

Despite his unpleasant disposition, Ass had a half-dozen or so fans who regularly liked and commented on his posts. These fans shared some unusual characteristics. Their Facebook accounts had all been created in the summer of 2014. They all appeared to be well-dressed young men and women who lived in large American cities, yet they seemed to have no real-life friends. Instead, they spent their free time leaving anti-Obama comments on the Facebook posts of American media outlets like CNN, Politico and Fox News. Their main Facebook interactions, especially those of the women, appeared to be with strangers who commented on their physical appearance. The women were all very attractive -- so attractive, indeed, that a search revealed that some of their profile photos had been stolen from models and actors. It became clear that the vast majority of Ass's fans were not real people. They were also trolls.

I friended as many of the trolls on Facebook as I could and began to observe their ways. Most of the content they shared was drawn from a network of other pages that, like Ass's, were clearly meant to produce entertaining and shareable social-media content. There was the patriotic Spread Your Wings, which described itself as ''a community for everyone whose heart is with America.'' Spread Your Wings posted photos of American flags and memes about how great it was to be an American, but the patriotism rang hollow once you tried to parse the frequent criticisms of Obama, an incoherent mishmash of liberal and conservative attacks that no actual American would espouse. There was also Art Gone Conscious, which posted bad art and then tenuously connected it to Obama's policy failures, and the self-explanatory Celebrities Against Obama. The posts churned out every day by this network of pages were commented on and shared by the same group of trolls, a virtual Potemkin village of disaffected Americans.

After following the accounts for a few weeks, I saw a strange notification on Facebook. One account, which claimed to be a woman from Seattle named Polly Turner, RSVPed to a real-life event. It was a talk in New York City to commemorate the opening of an art exhibit called Material Evidence. I was vaguely aware of Material Evidence, thanks to eye-catching advertisements that had appeared in subway stations and on the sides of buses throughout New York City: a black-and-white photo of masked men in camouflage, overlaid with the slogan ''Syria, Ukraine ... Who's Next?'' Material Evidence's website described it as a traveling exhibition that would reveal ''the full truth'' about the civil war in Syria, as well as about 2014's Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine, through a combination of ''unique footage, artefacts, video.'' I clicked on the Material Evidence talk and saw that a number of other trolls had been invited, including my old friend I Am Ass.

Walking into Material Evidence, mounted last September in the cavernous ArtBeam gallery in Chelsea, was like walking into a real-life version of the hall of mirrors I'd stumbled into on Facebook. A sign at the front declared that the show did not ''support a specific political goal,'' but the message became clear as soon as I began to browse the images. Large, well-composed photos testified to the barbarity of the Syrian rebels, bent on slaughtering handsome Syrian soldiers and innocent civilians alike. A grim panorama showed a gymnasium supposedly used by rebels to torture prisoners. There was a heroic, sunlit portrait of a Syrian Army officer. A room hidden behind a curtain displayed gory photos of rebel-caused civilian causalities, ''provided by the Syrian ministry of defense.''

Then there were the pictures from the Ukrainian revolution, which focused almost exclusively on the Right Sector, a small group of violent, right-wing, anti-Russian protesters with a fondness for black balaclavas. Russian authorities have seized upon Right Sector to paint the entire revolution, backed by a huge swath of Ukrainian society, as orchestrated by neo-fascist thugs. The show's decision to juxtapose the rebellions in Syria and Ukraine was never clearly explained, perhaps because the only connection possible was that both targeted leaders supported by Russia.

On the floor in front of many of the photos sat the actual items that appeared in them, displayed under glass cases. How, exactly, did organizers procure the very same battered motorcycle helmet that a Ukrainian protester wore in a photo while brawling with riot police? Who had fronted the money to purchase a mangled white van, supposedly used by Syrian rebels in a botched suicide bombing, and transport it to New York City? Few answers were forthcoming from Benjamin Hiller, the Berlin-based German-American photojournalist who was put forth as the curator of Material Evidence. He sat at a table in the front of the gallery, a heavyset bearded man dressed entirely in black. He told me that the show had been organized by an independent collective of European, Russian and Syrian war photographers who were fed up with the one-sided view of conflicts presented by Western media. He said they simply wanted to show the ''other side.'' Hiller claimed that the funds to rent the space, take out the ads, transport the material and create a $40,000 grant advertised on the Material Evidence website had been raised through ''crowdfunding.'' (Hiller has since left the organization and says that because of the show's ''misinformations'' and ''nonjournalistic approach,'' he ''does not want to be affiliated anymore with the project.'')

When I got home, I searched Twitter for signs of a campaign. Sure enough, dozens of accounts had been spamming rave reviews under the hashtag #MaterialEvidence. I clicked on one, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman. (I later discovered her avatar had been stolen.) Most of her tweets were unremarkable song lyrics and inspirational quotes. But on Sept. 11 of last year, she spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific chemical plant explosion in St. Mary Parish, La. The source field on Twitter showed that the tweets Zoe Foreman -- and the majority of other trolls -- sent about #ColumbianChemicals were posted using a tool called Masss Post, which is associated with a nonworking page on the domain Add1.ru. According to online records, Add1.ru was originally registered in January 2009 by Mikhail Burchik, whose email address remained connected to the domain until 2012. Documents leaked by Anonymous International listed a Mikhail Burchik as the executive director of the Internet Research Agency.

In early February, I called Burchik, a young tech entrepreneur in St. Petersburg, to ask him about the hoax and its connection to the Internet Research Agency. In an article for the newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, the German journalist Julian Hans had claimed that Burchik confirmed the authenticity of the leaked documents. But when I called Burchik, he denied working at the Internet Research Agency. ''I have heard of it, but I don't work in this organization,'' he said. Burchik said he had never heard of the Masss Post app; he had no specific memory of the Add1.ru domain, he said, but he noted that he had bought and sold many domains and didn't remember them all. Burchik suggested that perhaps a different Mikhail Burchik was the agency's executive director. But the email address used by the Mikhail Burchik in the leak matched the address listed at that time on the website of the Mikhail Burchik I spoke with.

In St. Petersburg, I finally had a chance to compare notes with Andrei Soshnikov, the young investigative journalist at Moi Raion to whom Ludmila Savchuk leaked her documents. Soshnikov is an indefatigable reporter: During one investigation, he had gone so far as to create a 3-D computer model of a roadway in order to calculate how much asphalt had been stolen during its construction. He was one of the first journalists to expose the Internet Research Agency when he went undercover and got a job there in 2013. Since then, he had followed the agency's Russian trolls as obsessively as I had been tracking their English counterparts.

I showed Soshnikov a YouTube video posted on Facebook by one of the trolls. The video was a slick animated infographic about the faults of the United States Secret Service. What had caught my attention was the narrator. He sounded just like the voice from the videos spread during the Columbian Chemicals and Atlanta shooting hoaxes: a man trying desperately to sound American but coming off as Australian instead.

Soshnikov instantly recognized the style of the animation. It was made, he said, by an outfit called Infosurfing, which posts pro-Kremlin infographics on Instagram and VKontakte. Soshnikov showed me how he used a service called Yomapic, which maps the locations of social-media users, to determine that photos posted to Infosurfing's Instagram account came from 55 Savushkina. He had been monitoring all of the content posted from 55 Savushkina for weeks and had assembled a huge database of troll content.

He brought up Infosurfing's YouTube channel, and as we scrolled down, I noticed several videos in the same style as the Secret Service animation. In fact, Infosurfing had posted the exact same video on its own account -- except instead of the unfortunate Australian voice-over, it was narrated in Russian. It was the most tantalizing connection yet: It seemed as if the man in the hoax videos had worked for an outfit connected to the same building that housed the Internet Research Agency.

Still, no one had heard of any department that might have orchestrated the hoax. The English-language trolling team was an elite and secretive group. Marat Burkhardt, who worked in the forums department, was asked to try out for an English-language team but didn't get the job. The only person I spoke with who worked in the English department was a woman named Katarina Aistova. A former hotel receptionist, she told me she joined the Internet Research Agency when it was in a previous, smaller office. I found her through the Anonymous International leak, which included emails she had sent to her bosses, reporting on the pro-Putin comments she left on sites like The Blaze and Politico. One of her assignments had been to write an essay from the point of view of an average American woman. ''I live in such developed society, so that people have practically ceased to walk on foot,'' she wrote. When I emailed Aistova, she wasn't eager to talk. She told me she had been harassed by critics of the Internet Research Agency after her email appeared in the leak; some men had even come to her door. She would meet me for an interview, but only if she could bring her brother for protection. I agreed, and we met at an out-of-the-way Chinese restaurant.

Aistova and her brother made an unusual pair. She was a short young woman with midlength brown hair, dressed all in black: sweater, leggings, big wedge boots. She insisted on paying for my coffee. ''You are a Russian guest,'' she said. He, by contrast, was a hulking skinhead with arms full of Nazi-themed tattoos, most prominent among them a five-inch swastika on his left biceps. ''My brother, he looks like a strongman,'' Aistova said, giggling. He wore a black T-shirt emblazoned with the skull-and-crossbones insignia of the SS Totenkopf division, which administered the Nazi concentration camps. I asked him what his T-shirt meant. ''Totenkopf,'' he grunted. During the interview he sat across the table from Aistova and me, smiling silently behind his sunglasses.

Aistova said that she worked for the Internet Research Agency for a month and a half. The majority of her work was translating news articles from English to Russian. The news articles covered everything from Ukraine to traffic accidents. On a few occasions, her bosses asked her to leave comments on American news sites about Russia, but she said that they never told her what to say. She loves Russia, she told me. She truly believes that Putin is just trying to help the people of Eastern Ukraine, and that his actions are being unfairly spun by the Western media. ''I was like, Hey, you guys, you are saying these bad things about Putin, but people are suffering.''

But she claimed to harbor no ill will toward the United States. She wants to visit New York City, she said, and see the locations from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' one of her favorite films. ''I don't feel aggressive toward America. We're the same people, we just speak different languages,'' she said. After the interview, we shook hands outside the restaurant. ''You seem like a journalist who will tell the truth,'' she said. ''I wish you luck on your story.''

On my last morning in St. Petersburg, I returned to 55 Savushkina. The clouds had lifted after a miserable week of snow and howling wind. At a few minutes before 10, my translator and I positioned ourselves on the sidewalk in front of the entrance, hoping to catch some of the trolls as they began the day shift. This was not a very well thought out strategy. Any employees arriving so close to the start of their shift didn't have time to talk to a journalist even if they wanted to. A large van lurched to a halt in front of us and deposited a half-dozen young people, who hurried in the door before we had the chance to approach them. A bus stopped halfway down the block, and another gaggle of workers emerged. They waved off my translator's inquiries with annoyed grunts or stone-faced silence. A young man smoking a cigarette said he didn't work inside the building. He finished his cigarette and promptly went inside the building.

At 10 a.m. sharp, the flow of workers stopped. I decided we might as well try walking inside. I had read of other journalists who tried to enter the building, only to be kicked out immediately, so I entered with some trepidation. Two men in suits guarded the turnstiles. My translator and I approached a receptionist behind a desk and asked if we could speak with someone from Internet Research. (It dropped the ''Agency'' on moving to 55 Savushkina.) She informed us that Internet Research was no longer a tenant. ''A couple of months ago, we had to say goodbye, because it was giving the entire building a bad reputation,'' she said, matter-of-factly.

She pointed to a board that displayed a makeshift directory of the building's current occupants. The names were printed out on small scraps of paper, and none of them were Internet Research. But I did recognize one: ''FAN,'' or Federal News Agency. I had read some news articles claiming that FAN was part of a network of pro-Kremlin news sites run out of 55 Savushkina, also funded by Evgeny Prigozhin. Former Internet Research Agency employees I had spoken to said they believed FAN was another wing of the same operation, under a different name. I asked to speak to someone from FAN. To my surprise, the receptionist picked up the phone, spoke into it for a few seconds and then informed us that Evgeny Zubarev, the editor in chief of FAN, would be right out to meet us.

Zubarev, who looked to be in his 50s, had close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair and a weary face. He greeted me with a handshake and invited me into his office. We made our way through the turnstiles and signed in with the guards, then took a brief walk down a long hallway to FAN's two-room office on the first floor. It was unusually quiet for an online news operation that, according to Zubarev, had a staff of 40 people. The newsroom was equipped for a sizable team, with about a dozen identical black desktop computers sitting on identical brown laminate desks, but only two young reporters sat at them. The shades were drawn and the furniture looked just barely unpacked.

As we sat at Zubarev's desk, I told him about the articles I'd read accusing FAN of being a Kremlin propaganda outfit. He shook his head in indignation. He turned to his computer and brought up FAN's website, pointing to the masthead and the certificate number that showed FAN was an officially registered Russian mass-media organization. ''FAN is a news agency,'' he declared. It had stringers and reporters in Ukraine, and in many former Soviet states; they did original reporting, sometimes at great personal risk. Zubarev himself was a veteran journalist who covered the annexation of Crimea for the Russian news agency Rosbalt before joining FAN. But ever since reports linked him to the Internet Research Agency, he had faced questions about his integrity.

''We understand being in this building may discredit us, but we can't afford to move at the moment,'' Zubarev said with a sigh. ''So we have to face the situation where reporters like you, Mr. Chen, come in here and ask us questions every day.''

Zubarev said he believed that he and FAN were victims of a smear campaign. I asked him who would do such a thing.

''Listen, that's my position, not a confirmed fact,'' he said. ''It's possible that there are some business interests, I don't know. Maybe it's an attack on our investors.'' But when I asked who those investors were, he declined to comment. ''I can't discuss the identities of investors,'' he said. ''That's in my contract.''

I left St. Petersburg on April 28. One day later, FAN published an article with the headline ''What Does a New York Times Journalist Have in Common With a Nazi From St. Petersburg?'' The story detailed a mysterious meeting in St. Petersburg between a New York Times journalist -- me -- and a neo-Nazi. Its lead image was a photo of a skinhead giving an enthusiastic Nazi salute. But it was not just any skinhead. It was the skinhead whom Katarina Aistova brought to our meeting and introduced to me as her brother. As I learned from reading the article, Aistova's ''brother'' was in fact a notorious neo-Nazi named Alexei Maximov.

The article explained that Maximov, who goes by the nickname Fly, is a member of Totenkopf, a prominent skinhead group in St. Petersburg. He reportedly served nine years in prison for stabbing a man to death. Just a month before I met him, Maximov again made headlines when, during an investigation into beatings of immigrants around St. Petersburg, the police found weaponry and Nazi paraphernalia in his apartment.

The story made no mention of Katarina Aistova or the Internet Research Agency. Instead, the article claimed I met with Maximov because I wanted his help in creating a provocation against Russia. Maximov told FAN that I requested to meet him because I was ''very keenly interested in sentiment among Russian nationalists.'' He continued: ''He evidently needed stories about how the murderous Kremlin regime persecutes free Russian people. It's not the first time I've come across such requests on the part of Western journalists, but I'm not going to help them with this. Many want to see in Russian nationalists a 'fifth column,' which will function on orders from the West and sweep away the Kremlin.'' Apparently I was trying to foment a mini-Euromaidan, right there in St. Petersburg.

The article was illustrated with photos of my meeting with Aistova and Maximov. One photo appears to have been shot surreptitiously through the restaurant window while we sat and talked. The point of view is such that Aistova is barely visible; indeed, at first glance, I seem to be having a friendly chat with a skinhead over a cup of coffee. Another photo, this one taken outside the restaurant, somehow makes me look deep in conversation with Maximov, even though I distinctly recall that Aistova was standing between us.

I had to admire the brazenness of the scheme. I remembered how, at the restaurant, Aistova had sat next to me so I had to twist around to talk to her, while Maximov sat silently across from us. Apparently they had arranged themselves so it could appear, from the right perspective, that I was meeting Maximov alone. I emailed Aistova to ask her to explain what happened. She responded only: ''I would also like you to explain yourself and the situation!!'' (A few weeks later, when I tried calling her by phone, she pretended I had the wrong number.)

Over the course of a few days, the sensational story circulated among a network of small pro-Kremlin blogs. In fact, the FAN story itself had been aggregated from another pro-Kremlin news site called People's News, which Andrei Soshnikov, the Moi Raion journalist, has reported also operates out of 55 Savushkina. As it spread, it mutated to become even more alarming. One website suggested I was working for the C.I.A.; another, the National Security Agency. A YouTube channel called Russia Today -- not the well-known state television channel but a knockoff -- posted a slick video about the meeting, set to a pounding dubstep soundtrack. Disconcertingly, it included a photo of me leaving my hotel. The video currently has more than 60,000 views. Many of those views were a result of a familiar pattern of social-media promotion: Dozens of trolls on Twitter began tweeting links to the video using the hashtag #Ð’ÐµÑ€Ð±Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ°Ð|(9D)Ð°Ñ†Ð¸Ñ|(81)Ñ‚Ð¾Ð² -- ''Recruitment of Nazis.'' The hashtag trended on Russian Twitter.

After recovering from the initial shock, I began to track the campaign against me. I had practice, after all, from my months spent on the trail of the Internet Research Agency. I Googled the various Russian spellings of my name every hour to catch the latest posts as soon as they surfaced on LiveJournal and VKontakte. I searched Twitter for the URL of the YouTube video to catch every post.

A few days later, Soshnikov chatted with me on Skype. ''Did you see an article about you on FAN?'' he asked. ''They know you are going to publish a loud article, so they are trying to make you look stupid in front of the Russian audience.''

I explained the setup, and as I did I began to feel a nagging paranoia. The more I explained, the more absurd my own words seemed -- the more they seemed like exactly the sort of elaborate alibi a C.I.A. agent might concoct once his cover was blown. The trolls had done the only thing they knew how to do, but this time they had done it well. They had gotten into my head.

Moscow seeks to sow division in the West; Officials say it is waging a war of disinformation to win allies on Ukraine

The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia against the West is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. Increasingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to American and European officials: money, ideology and disinformation.

Even as the Obama administration and its European allies try to counter Russia’s military intervention across its border, they have found themselves struggling at home against what they see as a concerted drive by Moscow to finance European political parties and movements, leverage its economic power and spread alternative versions of the conflict.

The Kremlin’s goal seems to be to sow division, destabilize the European Union and possibly fracture what until now has been a relatively unified, if sometimes fragile, consensus against Russian aggression. At the very least, if Russia could peel off even a single member of the European Union, it could in theory prevent the renewal later this month of economic sanctions that are due to expire without the unanimous agreement of all of its member states.

President Obama arrived in Germany on Sunday for a Group of 7 summit meeting at which he planned to rally European allies to stand firm against Russia, especially as violence flares again in eastern Ukraine despite a shaky cease-fire. In the days leading up to his trip, both American and European officials have publicly voiced concerns about President Vladimir V. Putin’s subterranean — and sometimes more overt — efforts to win over allies in the West.

‘‘As it tries to rattle the cage, the Kremlin is working hard to buy off and co-opt European political forces, funding both right-wing and left-wing anti-systemic parties throughout Europe,’’ Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a speech last month at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ‘‘President Putin sees such political forces as useful tools to be manipulated, to create cracks in the European body politic which he can then exploit.’’

That is a conclusion shared by Britain’s government.

‘‘On the question of Russian money, yes, of course, we are concerned about what is clearly a Kremlin strategy of trying to pick off, shall we say, the brethren who may be less committed or more vulnerable in the run-up to the June decision,’’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said last week. ‘‘It will not have escaped the Kremlin’s notice that this is a unanimity process and they only need one.’’

Whether the strategy will succeed remains uncertain.

American officials and European diplomats said they were confident for now that the sanctions would be renewed at a European Union summit meeting to be held in Brussels from June 25 to 26. Germany, the union’s most dominant member, supports extending sanctions until January 2016 and smaller nations may be loathe to defy Berlin. But there is no appetite for adding more sanctions as some American officials would like.

Russia’s efforts to influence the West have taken on different forms.

Russia has traditionally used its status as an energy supplier to sway customers in Europe, and it is now pressing countries in southeastern Europe, including cash-strapped Greece, to support a new natural gas pipeline project with promises of economic benefits. Russian oligarchs have long kept so much of their money in Cyprus banks that the island nation is seen as a financial outpost for Moscow.

For several years, Russia has paid for a government-sponsored insert in newspapers and web sites in 26 countries (including in The New York Times). More recently, it has proposed expanding RT, its international television network, which broadcasts in English and three other languages and delights in pointing out the foibles of the West, to French and German.

American and European officials have accused Moscow of financing green movements in Europe to encourage anti-fracking protests, a move designed to defend Russia’s gas industry. And a shadowy ‘‘troll farm’’ in St. Petersburg uses Twitter to plant hoaxes about fake chemical spills or ebola outbreaks in the West.

Since long before the Ukraine crisis, money has been a means for Mr. Putin to try to shape events in the West.

After Chancellor Gerhard Schröder stepped down in Germany, he was given a lucrative position with Gazprom, the Russian state energy giant. When President George W. Bush was in office, Mr. Putin asked ‘‘would it help you’’ if Donald L. Evans, Mr. Bush’s close friend and former commerce secretary, were given a high-paying Russian corporate job. (Mr. Bush rejected the idea.)

Russia appears to be finding some traction lately in countries like Greece, Hungary, the Czech Republic and even Italy and France. Not only is it aligning itself with the leftists traditionally affiliated with Moscow since the Cold War, but is making common cause with far-right forces rebelling against the rise of the European Union and sympathetic with Mr. Putin’s attack on what he calls the West’s moral decline.

The most prominent example has been Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France, which has confirmed taking a $11.7 million loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow, which has been tied to the Kremlin. She has denied a media report that the money represented just the first installment of an eventual $50 million in loans to help her party through presidential elections in 2017.

Austria’s far-right FPO party denied charges of dependency on the Kremlin, allegations made by its more left-wing rival, the SPO party, after the FPO leader, Heinz-Christian Strache posted pictures of himself and other party leaders at a conference in Moscow that called for an end to sanctions against Russia. Mr. Strache said in a statement that ‘‘we are convinced of our neutrality and we do not get financial donations or credits’’ from Russia.

The German tabloid Bild reported that the anti-euro Alternative for Germany party had benefited from cheap gold sales from Russia, which the party denied.

There have been investigations into the links of some members of Hungary’s far-right Jobbik party and any financial ties to Russia. And there have been similar accusations and inquiries in Bulgaria, with its far-right Attack party; in Slovakia, with its People’s party; and in the Baltic states, especially with Latvia’s pro-Russian party.

Far-right parties seen as aligned with Moscow vote against resolutions in the European Parliament critical of Russia and have sent observers to referendums and elections in separatist-held regions of Ukraine like Crimea and Donetsk, alongside members of some far-left parties like Germany’s Die Linke and Greece’s KKE.

The Political Capital Institute, a research organization based in Budapest, which first documented Russian interest in Eastern European far-right parties in 2009, reported in March that Moscow’s interest had now spread to Western European countries as well. It listed 15 far-right European parties as ‘‘committed’’ to Russia.

The institute’s report said the newfound affiliations ‘‘are not necessarily financial, as commonly assumed,’’ but may involve professional and organizational help. Either way, it said, ‘‘Russian influence in the affairs of the far right is a phenomenon seen all over Europe as a key risk for Euro-Atlantic integration.’’

Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, said the trend was a major concern for Europe. It is ‘‘very clear that the Kremlin has every interest in fracturing Europe in whatever ways possible,’’ he said by e-mail. ‘‘And it actively seeks to play on every division that it sees.’’

General Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has expressed similar worries about what he calls Russia’s ‘‘ability to employ other instruments of power’’ besides armed force.

‘‘President Putin considers NATO to be a threat and will look for opportunities to discredit and eventually undermine the alliance,’’ he said in an e-mail forwarded by a spokesman. ‘‘Putin’s ultimate objective is to fracture NATO.’’

But Fiona Hill, a former national intelligence officer on Russia and now a scholar at Brookings, said that with the exception of Ms. Le Pen’s party in France, the assertions about Russia financing European parties seem based more on speculation than facts.

‘‘The question is how much hard evidence does anyone have?’’ she asked. ‘‘And it’s useful for the Russians themselves not to refute rumors and maybe even perpetrate some of them. They want everyone to think everyone is corrupt, everyone can be influenced.’’

Either way, David Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state under Mr. Bush and now a scholar at the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Washington, said he thinks any Russian financing of European parties may backfire by alienating the governing elite in Europe.

‘‘It is a big concern,’’ he said, ‘‘but I wonder if at the end of the day they’re going to shoot themselves in the foot and waste this money.’’

Well
Ask Well: Catching Disease From a Toilet Seat
By DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.

Question:

What diseases can you really get from toilet seats?

Answer:

People really do fear toilet seats. One 1991 British survey[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/1873247] of 528 women at an ob-gyn clinic found that 85 percent said they crouched over public toilets while urinating, and 12 percent papered the seat. Only 2 percent sat all the way down.

But what diseases can you really get?

In theory, lots. Realistically, toilet seats are relatively low risk compared to many other surfaces.

The first thing to stop worrying about is sexually transmitted diseases. There is no medical evidence that anyone has ever picked up a venereal disease from a toilet seat. But there is a reason that myth has persisted for generations.

When confronted by an angry partner wanting to know how it is that he or she suddenly has symptoms of syphilis, gonorrhea, pubic lice or any other unpleasantry, it is much easier to answer “I have no idea, dear — I must have gotten it from a toilet seat” than it is to tell the truth.

People almost always get those diseases the old-fashioned way — from other people. Most require that a dose large enough to infect be deposited inside the vagina or anus, which are lined with hospitable cells. While it’s true that lice can travel on towels and clothes, they find cold hard surfaces difficult to survive on. Lice need human warmth, and their claw-like feet do not attach to smooth plastic, wood or porcelain.

On the other hand, hard surfaces can hold other bacteria and viruses, sometimes for days.

Studies — some done in hospital bathrooms — have found dangerous strains on toilet seats, including antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus (one of several “flesh-eating bacteria”), norovirus (the “cruise ship bug”), E. coli, shigella and streptococcus. In theory, even Ebola could be picked up from a toilet[http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/ask-well-can-you-get-ebola-from-a-toilet-seat/].

These microbes are excreted in feces or vomit; if that’s visible on the seat, most sensible people would choose another stall.

What’s more worrisome is that modern tankless toilets can flush violently with gurgling that creates a spray of barely visible droplets that can fly several feet.

Antiseptic wipes — easily purchased in pocket-sized packets — have been shown to reduce germs on toilet seats by 50-fold.

Even so, the danger is minimal unless the germs get into an open cut or are carried by a hand to the mouth, nose or eyes.

Intact skin is an effective germ barrier, and the skin of the buttocks and legs is relatively thick. It is also less likely to be cracked than the skin of the hands or face because it is normally sheltered from sunlight, dishwashing detergent, tools and other assaults.

Careful handwashing with soap and water is the best defense. But swab studies[http://journals.plos.org.proxy.bc.edu/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028132] have shown that many bathroom surfaces — flush handles, door latches, faucet handles, towel dispenser handles, and so on — are as dirty as, or dirtier, than the seats.

The fastidious may want to keep an antiseptic wipe in their hands, or press on the towel dispenser with an elbow or any part of a hand that won’t fit into an eye or nose, and then use the paper towel to touch other surfaces — including the exit door.

However, many other places far from toilets are colonized by microbes. The usual suspects include kitchen sponges, playground equipment, gym mats, remote controls and the keyboards of shared computers.

Less than 48 hours after a whirlwind visit to the Clinton Correctional Facility, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/andrew_m_cuomo/index.html?inline=nyt-per] was ready for a full-fledged media blitz.

In a succession of rapid-fire television interviews on Monday, the governor spoke of the daring prison break[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/nyregion/hunt-for-escaped-killers-new-york-prison-dannemora.html] in the far northeast of New York State, warning that a pair of “desperate, dangerous men” were on the loose. “They are literally killers,” he said, vowing to put the escapees behind bars.

And when asked on the “Today” show on NBC about a taunting note the fugitives left behind, Mr. Cuomo displayed a touch of swagger. “They had a little bit of the comedian in them,” he told an anchor, Savannah Guthrie. “But I plan on giving them back that note, Savannah.”

For Mr. Cuomo, the escaped men represent both a genuine law-enforcement challenge — how to chase down a pair of killers in a remote corner of the state — and an unexpected break from the deepest political doldrums of his time in office.

The two convicted murderers, Richard Matt and David Sweat, broke out of the Clinton prison in Dannemora, N.Y., with just under two weeks left in a legislative session that has been deeply frustrating for Mr. Cuomo. Many of the governor’s initiatives have stalled in the Legislature, and his poll numbers have fallen sharply amid corruption indictments against Albany’s two top legislators.

Fellow Democrats have lamented the failure to pass key liberal priorities, such as an increase in the minimum wage and a state-level version of the Dream Act that would grant tuition benefits to certain undocumented immigrants.

But all these matters were far from the political foreground as Mr. Cuomo toured the airwaves, hurling himself into a crisis generated neither by Albany nor by a federal prosecutor’s office.

Mr. Cuomo canceled a trip to the Belmont Stakes on Saturday so he could rush to the prison. In photos shared over social media, he peered into jail cells and climbed up and down metal ladders in the belly of the 19th-century penitentiary.

Television anchors invited Mr. Cuomo to narrate photographs and video of his visit to the prison and pressed him to sketch out the latest theories as to how the escape unfolded.

Mr. Cuomo has energetically obliged. He suggested that the prisoners surely had help in their escape and must have been overheard by other inmates. He has shared his suspicion that any accomplices were unlikely to be prison guards, but perhaps civilians or private contractors working at the prison.

“Maybe a civilian employee developed a relationship with one of them,” Mr. Cuomo speculated[http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4283049639001/gov-andrew-cuomo-on-the-maximum-security-prison-escape/#sp=show-clips] on Fox Business Network — a late addition on Monday to his four previously scheduled television appearances. “That happens from time to time.”

Mr. Cuomo, who has not held a scheduled news conference in Albany since February, did not face a single question on any other issue facing the state.

Beyond avoiding the Albany press corps, Mr. Cuomo, with the prison emergency, has had a respite from a dismal season in the state capital, pollsters said. Three polls from the past few weeks have shown his approval rating in a slump, with barely two in five New Yorkers giving him positive marks.

“He’s doing what a governor ought to do, and in the process getting a little bit of sexy attention: ‘Governor looks at manhole’; ‘Governor says lock your doors,’” said Maurice Carroll, an assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/nyregion/majority-of-new-york-voters-dissatisfied-with-state-government-poll-finds.html]. “It gives him a chance to act like a governor and get away from, ‘What are we going to do about the rent-control laws?’”

Seeking visibility in a crisis has long been central to Mr. Cuomo’s method of governing. In May, he raced to the Indian Point[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/indian_point_nuclear_power_plant_ny/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] nuclear plant in Westchester County after a transformer fire[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/05/09/us/09reuters-usa-nuclearplant-incident.html] there. In February, he appeared at the scene of a Metro-North Railroad crash[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/nyregion/metro-north-train-hits-vehicle-on-tracks.html], also in Westchester, and gave multiple television and radio interviews the following morning.

Last fall, in the midst of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Mr. Cuomo held a joint news conference with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to announce a mandatory quarantine[http://cms.em.nytimes.com/content/publish/preview?contentId=100000003728990&branchName=web] for travelers into the New York area, bucking federal authorities’ more cautious recommendations.

State Senator Betty Little, a Republican who represents Dannemora, said Mr. Cuomo had regularly visited her district in trying moments. “He goes to the North County in floods and disasters that we’ve had,” she said. “He’s been there often, and I think it was appropriate.”

The prison break may be an especially resonant crisis for Mr. Cuomo: In 1983, Mr. Cuomo was an aide to his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, when an uprising at the Ossining Correctional Facility[http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-assumes-a-key-role-in-the-ossining-prison-crisis.html] occurred just days after his inauguration. Tim Russert, then a senior adviser to the elder Mr. Cuomo, noted that the governor “was informed within minutes,” adding, “Andrew fortunately was with him and went to spend the night.”

Faced with his own prison emergency, Mr. Cuomo has used newer tools to project an image of hands-on involvement. His office has used the website Flickr to post more than two dozen pictures of his visit to Dannemora[https://www.flickr.com/photos/governorandrewcuomo/], and his official Twitter account has updated nearly as often, posting updates on the manhunt and on the governor’s news media appearances.

If there is a strong element of theater to the experience, Mr. Cuomo has seemed to embrace it — he repeatedly likened the prison break to the film “The Shawshank Redemption” and called the convicts’ scheme something beyond Hollywood’s imagining. (For his own part, Mr. Cuomo has seized his role in an on-camera manhunt with all the vigor of Tommy Lee Jones in “The Fugitive.”)

“If it was a movie plot,” Mr. Cuomo said on CNN, “you would say that it was overdone.”

Final Salvos Against Polio

The documentary ''Every Last Child'' begins the way ''Hill Street Blues'' used to: A police commander says a few words to his men before they roll out into a hostile city. Their job is to protect polio teams going house to house in neighborhoods where Taliban assassins cruise on motorbikes.

It is their jihad, he tells them.

Everyone in ''Every Last Child'' is fighting a holy war -- the vaccinators against the virus, the Taliban against the vaccinators, the police against the Taliban. Above them, outside the frame, is a dark tornado of greater forces: radical Islam versus those it considers Crusaders, the Central Intelligence Agency's actions versus those of the World Health Organization, Western science versus Eastern faith. Every time it touches down in the slums of Karachi and Peshawar, it leaves behind new victims: dead vaccinators and paralyzed children.

If polio has disappeared from Africa -- and on Aug. 11, it will be a full year since a case has been found on that continent -- then the Pakistan-Afghanistan strain will be the world's last.

The documentary, which opened in New York on Wednesday and will play five cities this month, surveys what appears to be the last battlefield in the fight to eliminate polio.

It conveys the splendor and terror in ways that print reportage never can: The jewelry strung across a mother's hairline jangling as she argues against giving drops to her child. The oiled snap of a clip locked into an AK-47 by a nervous cop. The flow of filthy water past the lens of a camera submerged in an open sewer. The urgent sotto voce of a W.H.O. consultant whispering facts into the ear of a Pakistani politician just before he announces a fresh campaign round.

Still, the film struggles to explain the core of the crisis.

Why would anyone decline a gift with no strings attached -- a gift that, rejected, could consign one's own children to paralysis?

Even worse: Who would ruthlessly gun down women and girls -- neighbors and clansmen, not strangers -- who are the innocent bearers of that gift?

The film offers hints. In it, Zubair Rabi, a grocer, and his friends repeat the tired but still potent rumors: That the vaccine is really birth control aimed at Muslims. That the same American skunk works brewed up the virus that causes AIDS and shipped it to Africa.

The camera follows Mr. Rabi and his children to the beach. It is empathetic: He obviously loves them. No, he says, as they play fully clothed in the surf, they are not vaccinated, but they are healthy. He loves God, so God protects his bairns.

Left unexplained is why this blind rejection stays nailed solidly into a few tiny pockets of the Islamic world while the vast majority of Muslims accept the vaccine -- along with others, and antibiotics, drugs for AIDS and hepatitis C, cancer chemotherapy and other Western formulations, all of them more toxic than polio drops.

The answer is complicated.

As polio has been driven back into its last redoubts, it has become more and more a disease of the aggrieved minority, of people so beaten down that they trust nothing offered by outsiders -- and for whom almost everyone is an outsider.

That is not uncommon. In West Africa, Ebola first broke out among the rural Kissi people who live where Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea meet. They feel despised by the elites of the capital cities, descendants of freed slaves, and were so sure that the elites had sent Ebola that they attacked medical teams venturing in to help them.

For a decade, polio has been essentially a Muslim disease. The 2005 hajj season spread a Nigerian strain to Mecca and out from there. Most Muslim countries clamped down hard. Saudi Arabia, for example, vaccinates pilgrims on arrival.

Now the virus hits almost only Pakistanis and Afghans -- and not all of them, but nearly only Pashtuns, the tribe originally from the mountainous border. And not even all Pashtuns, but mostly the Mehsuds and a few other conservative clans.

They are the people who fought the British at the Khyber Pass, the mujahedeen who fought the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the source of the Taliban.

Empires have overrun their villages and butchered them but have never subsumed their culture, or even pacified their clan fighters for long. They have or had kindred spirits around the world: in the Scottish highlands, in Appalachia, in Sicily, in the mountains of Vietnam and Myanmar.

This is not to romanticize them. The Taliban is to the Pashtuns roughly what the Cosa Nostra once was to Italian-Americans: a mix of criminal gang and self-defense group, religiously conservative and quick to violence.

(There is precedent for the attacks on vaccinators: During a 1916 polio outbreak in Brooklyn's Pigtown neighborhood, the Black Hand, the Mafia's forerunner, issued a warning to the city inspectors who were forcibly hospitalizing children and sealing homes: ''If you report any more of our babies to the Board of Health, we will kill you.'')

Taliban warlords run opium and guns; in cities, they seize land and rent it to squatters. Like the Mafia, they have feuding factions.

In the film, however, Pashtun fearlessness is exemplified not by the Taliban but by Gulnaz Sherazi and her teenage nieces: Having lost a mother and sister to the Taliban killers, they replace them as vaccinators on the same streets.

The C.I.A.'s use of vaccinators to hunt Osama bin Laden was a disaster for the polio campaign, and military drone strikes, virtually all in Pashtun territory, have increased Pashtuns' fear that the world and the Pakistani elite is against them. They have grievances: Urbane Pakistanis talk about them the way American snobs refer to ''hillbillies'' and ''trailer trash.''

Now the Pakistan vaccination campaign -- a disaster in early 2014, when the film was shot -- is slowly turning around. Polio cases are dropping.

Some Pashtun complaints -- like being offered nothing but polio vaccine -- are being answered. The campaign now holds pop-up pediatric clinics where children receive checkups, vitamins, deworming drugs, antibiotics and several vaccines.

And crude violence is working, too. Last year, Pakistan's Army invaded Waziristan, where vaccine resistance was strongest. They were re-establishing government control, not pushing the polio agenda, but vaccinators followed. Also, while on the road, the thousands fleeing the war are vaccinated at bus stops or in train stations.

Violence is part of the reason polio disappeared from Nigeria. Boko Haram, the Taliban equivalent there, sowed such terror by kidnapping girls and slaughtering villages that much of the population fled down roads and into refugee camps where vaccinators waited.

Polio has escaped before -- to Syria, to Somalia and elsewhere -- but its escapes are briefer and the number of children paralyzed fewer. The day of the last child appears to be getting closer.

Indian Woman Being Treated in U.S. for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

Infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] carried around the world by air travelers have become a fact of modern life, with imported cases in just the last year of Ebola, Lassa fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and, now, a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis.

In the latest incident, a woman with TB[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pulmonary-tuberculosis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] flew from India to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, landing on April 4. She traveled by car to visit relatives in Illinois, Tennessee and Missouri before seeking medical care sometime after May 18 at a hospital in Illinois. Tests there detected extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB. Doctors notified the state health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. The arduous task of contact tracing began in the three states.

Health officials say the risk to the public is low. TB is nowhere near as contagious as the flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or measles[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. But people who had long periods of close contact with the patient, like the relatives with whom she stayed, are at risk.

For people who were on the flight with the woman from India, the odds of catching TB are low but not zero. Cases have occurred in passengers on a long flight who sat near someone in advanced stages of the disease. In this case, the C.D.C. said, it will obtain the flight manifest for the woman’s trip from India and notify passengers who may have been exposed. An agency spokesman declined to reveal the airline or flight number.

Visitors from other countries are not screened for TB when they arrive, but those applying for legal residency are required to have TB tests, according to the C.D.C. Even if the government wanted to screen arriving passengers, it would be difficult, because there is no rapid test for tuberculosis.

On Friday, the patient from India was transferred to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. In the past two decades, the N.I.H. has treated about 20 patients with drug-resistant TB, the most recent a year or so ago, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Most came from other countries.

“Our track record has been good,” Dr. Fauci said, adding that about 80 percent were cured. That success rate is higher than the figures usually cited — 30 percent to 50 percent cured — because the lower estimates include results from poorer countries that have less access to drugs and other resources.

“This person is looking at a very long course of careful treatment and observation,” Dr. Fauci said.

Globally, nine million people contracted TB in 2013, and one and a half million died from it, according to the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. Nearly a quarter of all the cases occurred in India, which has the world’s largest epidemic.

Over all, drug-resistant bacteria cause only about 5 percent of all cases, and XDR bacteria are a small subset of that group, causing about 48,000 cases in 2013. But XDR-TB has shown up in 100 countries, and it can be deadly, particularly in countries with weak health care systems.

So far, 12 people who had contact with the woman in Illinois have been identified, according to Susan Karras, the communicable disease coordinator for McHenry County, northwest of Chicago, the part of Illinois the patient visited. They were traced in 15 to 20 hours of interviews with the patient and her family at the hospital and by phone.

Some have had TB tests, but Ms. Karras declined to reveal whether any were positive. People whose initial results were negative will be tested again in about eight to 10 weeks, because the infection does not always show up on early tests.

Spokesmen for the Tennessee and Missouri health departments said contacts were being traced in those states, but did not provide any details.

Anyone who is infected will be treated, Ms. Karras said. In many people, TB can be latent, meaning that their immune systems keep the infection in check so they are not sick or contagious. But latent disease can become active. So even people with the latent form of the disease will be treated with whatever mix of potent drugs it takes to kill this particular strain of XDR-TB, she said.

“We want to treat it before it becomes infectious,” Ms. Karras said. “That’s why we want to find them.”

The woman from India is in isolation in a hospital at the N.I.H., Dr. Fauci said. She has no contact with other patients, and doctors and nurses who treat her must wear gloves, gowns, eye protection and specially fitted masks called N-95 respirators. Even though they take every precaution, health workers who treat TB patients are usually tested for the disease once a year, Dr. Fauci said.

At the N.I.H., patients with this kind of TB are usually kept in the hospital for weeks or even months, until sputum tests no longer find the bacteria, indicating that the disease is not contagious anymore, Dr. Fauci said.

Standard TB usually requires treatment with four drugs, and can take six to nine months. Treating XDR-TB takes longer, sometimes a year or more, and requires more drugs.

The drugs have unpleasant side effects that are hard to tolerate, Dr. Fauci said. They cause nausea, weakness and other problems that make patients want to quit taking them before the full course is finished. But missing doses and quitting too soon are precisely what cause drug-resistant bacteria to develop — requiring even longer treatment with more drugs and nastier side effects.

Sometimes in severe cases, surgery is needed to remove diseased and scarred parts of the lung harboring bacteria that the drugs cannot reach.

The patient will not be charged for her treatment. Even if patients are citizens of other countries, Dr. Fauci said, their governments are not billed.

“Everything is free at the N.I.H.,” he said. “No one pays.”

Dr. Fauci said that the woman’s treatment would be expensive, given the long stay and costly drugs needed, but that he could not even begin to estimate the ultimate cost.

Chinese Ebola Drug Brings American Objections

After a nurse who contracted Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] was discharged Wednesday from a Rome hospital, a doctor there described the experimental treatments the patient had received as “absolutely miraculous.”

They included MIL77, a product from China[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] that was also given to a British Army nurse who recovered from Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] at a London hospital in March. It is a near copy of what many believed was the most promising Ebola therapy: a cocktail of antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] known as ZMapp, the result of a collaboration between the United States and Canada.

While ZMapp was mired in production delays last fall and winter and quickly became unavailable, a small private Chinese company, Beijing Mabworks, raced ahead, helping produce about 100 doses of MIL77. That means more potentially lifesaving treatments for desperate patients. But it has also led to patent infringement claims by American officials, and to disagreements over when experimental Ebola therapies should be offered to patients only in carefully controlled studies and when they should be made more available for compassionate reasons.

Feng Li, chief executive of Beijing Mabworks, said his company was motivated to fight a global emergency and had made a licensing agreement with ZMapp’s intellectual property rights holder. “People think international collaboration could easily happen between the U.S. and Canada,” he said, “but these days, China could play a role” by making emergency response drugs “better and faster in some cases.”

ZMapp is being tested in a clinical trial in the United States and Sierra Leone, where the government reported nine new cases of Ebola on Thursday, one of the highest daily totals in months.

Last summer, when Ebola was raging out of control, ZMapp raised hopes after it was given to two American aid workers with the disease. Both recovered. Scientists had already shown that ZMapp could save monkeys injected with what would have been a lethal dose of the virus.

Tobacco plants were engineered to produce ZMapp, a mixture of three antibodies designed to attach to the covering of the virus, neutralize it and attract killer immune cells. That was an unusual production method, chosen in part to meet the requirements of an American government grant that promotes innovation. However, there were no facilities capable of producing large amounts of the treatment.

Then China jumped in. The scarcity of ZMapp was “a spark, like lightning to me,” said Boyan Zhang, chief scientific officer at Beijing Mabworks. Supported by Chinese government grants, the company had developed mammalian cells capable of quickly producing antibodies targeted against cancer[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and viral diseases in humans, and its leaders decided to use the same process to develop an Ebola remedy.

China, highly attuned to infectious diseases[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/travelers-guide-to-avoiding-infectious-diseases/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in 2003, had many citizens working in West Africa. “The entire country was mobilized,” Mifang Liang of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said at the China-U.S. Relations Conference[http://china-us.tamu.edu/] in Houston last month.

The Chinese government issued a directive last summer that helped inspire the production not only of MIL77 but also of an Ebola vaccine, which is currently in human safety studies; rapid Ebola diagnostic tests; and copies of antiviral drugs made by companies in other countries. Dr. Zijian Feng, deputy general director of the China C.D.C., said involvement in emergency public health assistance served to “elevate our presence in the international stage and also elevate our capabilities.”

Within three months, using information in ZMapp’s patent, Dr. Li and his colleagues had copied the active part of ZMapp and used the company’s specialized cells to produce the antibodies. A month later, with the help of the Chinese pharmaceutical company Hisun, they had 100 doses.

But some American officials expressed concern. The United States government holds a patent on one of the antibodies in ZMapp, which was developed with support from American and Canadian military research agencies, a legacy of fears that Ebola could be used as a biological weapon by the Soviet Union or, later, by terrorists.

“If you use it, you’re supposed to get permission to do it, even for research purposes,” said Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. He said the Chinese scientists might have infringed patents if they tried to sell MIL77 outside China without an agreement with Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the small American company with intellectual property rights to ZMapp.

Larry Zeitlin, president of Mapp, said the Chinese scientists had reached out to him after creating MIL77 and had been collaborative.

Dr. Robinson said his agency had worked with Mapp and larger companies — including Regeneron in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Genentech in South San Francisco — to use methods similar to the Chinese researchers’ to increase production of ZMapp and other antibody-based treatments for Ebola.

But aid groups treating patients in West Africa had trouble getting information on those efforts, said Dr. Annick Antierens, coordinator of research partnerships for Doctors Without Borders. So they began to explore using Chinese-made MIL77.

“We said, ‘You have people dying like flies, and there’s a product that seems to be O.K.,’ ” Dr. Antierens said. But as the number of Ebola patients declined in West Africa with the waning epidemic and ZMapp finally became available, she said, American officials and scientists expressed concerns that the use of MIL77 could interfere with the clinical testing and licensing of ZMapp.

Doctors Without Borders and some other aid groups have balked at participating in the ZMapp trial because it is randomized and patients only have a 50 percent chance of receiving the treatment. That is a standard procedure in many trials so that researchers can compare patient outcomes and determine whether the treatment was effective and not harmful.

At Royal Free Hospital in London several months ago, two healthy workers with serious exposure to Ebola were given MIL77. Neither of the workers ended up developing the disease, said Dr. Michael Jacobs, who treated them.

When the British Army nurse, Cpl. Anna Cross, tested positive for Ebola in March, she also received MIL77, which had shown promising results in guinea pigs and nonhuman primates at the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The London hospital has since decided not to join the American-run clinical trial of ZMapp because of the randomizing requirement. It has opted instead to keep a supply of MIL77 for use in any Ebola patients treated in Britain or the European Union.

“We’ve challenged ourselves about whether that is the right decision or not,” Dr. Jacobs said. “In the end, I have to do my best for the patient in front of me.”

But Dr. H. Clifford Lane, clinical director at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was important to test ZMapp properly to determine whether using antibodies to treat Ebola really works.

“There are interventions that look so logical, that should be effective, that prove not to be,” he said. “Without randomization, you have no way to control for all the different variables that come into play when you’re dealing with a patient.”

Giving More Globally, and Less Locally

There was a lot of good news this week in the annual report on American philanthropy published by the Giving USA Foundation. Overall giving passed its prerecession peak[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/business/charitable-giving-rises-past-prerecession-mark.html], according to the organization’s calculations. Generosity in nearly every category was up, in some cases strongly.

But there was one bit of bad news for the people in the world who have the least: Giving to international affairs was down 3.6 percent over the last year in the catchall category that includes aid, development, relief and human rights organizations.

The news comes on the heels of the latest book by Peter Singer, a Princeton philosopher who regularly asks inconvenient questions that turn heads inside out. He has spent years making the case that individuals have a moral obligation to do much more for people in faraway places. In “The Most Good You Can Do[http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300180275],” he challenges all of us, once again, to tilt our charitable allocations heavily toward the global and less toward the local.

At the moment, however, giving to international affairs makes up just 4 percent of the $358 billion in overall giving, 72 percent of which is from individuals, though a bit more may ultimately leave the United States after people give it to organizations in other categories. So why has his message failed to take root so far? And what might persuade people to give more to those whose lives we might actually be able to save or radically improve?

The Giving USA report offers a few clues about this year’s decline. There were no major natural disasters in 2014 that often inspire contributions to international causes, and many donors felt helpless to do anything to halt the spread of Ebola.

Still, that tiny overall percentage of money going to people halfway around the world continues to puzzle Mr. Singer. “I was hoping it would change in a five- to 10-year time frame,” he said, while taking a break from a trip through Europe to meet people who have taken up the cause along with him. “It might not be happening as fast as I would have liked.”

When he began discussing the issue out loud, many people told him that they did not believe that their donations would reach the people who truly needed the money. Even in the face of recent questions raised by journalists at ProPublica[http://www.propublica.org/series/red-cross] and National Public Radio about how well organizations like the American Red Cross distribute aid, Mr. Singer is confident that donors can track down the best ones. The research operation GiveWell is a good place to start[http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities].

Mr. Singer, who is a longtime supporter of animal rights organizations, does understand that the “effective altruism[http://www.effectivealtruism.org/about-ea/]” movement he favors is in need of a large-eyed animal or its equivalent that will reach people emotionally. While he does not want people to give on the basis of pictures of smiling children, he knows that data scientists with bags under their eyes don’t get people to open their wallets, even if they are doing essential work vetting charities.

So what would move people? That question has been central to the work of Sam McFarland[http://www.wku.edu/psychology/staff/sam_mcfarland], an emeritus professor of psychology at Western Kentucky University. He and two colleagues went so far as to develop an “Identification With All Humanity Scale[http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.bc.edu/journals/psp/103/5/830/]” to try to begin figuring it out. “Psychology had focused extensively on ethnocentrism and prejudice and their roots,” he said. “But we’d not given any attention to the node of having a sense of common humanity.”

Child-rearing, it turns out, doesn’t seem to have much to do with why some people end up with high scores on the scale and give generously to organizations that help people in faraway lands. Mr. McFarland, who said that he had been repeatedly audited by the Internal Revenue Service because of his outsize donations to Doctors Without Borders and Human Rights Watch, pointed to other research suggesting that memorable experiences might begin to shift people’s views.

For those of us who want to be more like Mr. Singer but end up giving mostly locally, international travel may be one way to shift our focus. But there is plenty to do at home, too. Jen Shang[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/giving/understanding-donor-behavior-to-increase-contributions.html?_r=0], a professor of philanthropic psychology at Plymouth University in England who gives to a children’s hospice in Indonesia called Rachel House[http://www.rachel-house.org/about/], suggests that many kinds of direct action can help shift our orientations. Amnesty International’s online petitions[https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take-action/] may be one place to start.

One of the biggest objections to giving more to global organizations tends to be our desire not to turn our back on our neighbors. Here, a “Give Global, Act Local” approach may help, where you make up for any contribution declines with more hours of volunteer work in the community. When I suggested this to Mr. Singer, he grumbled a bit about the idea of a lawyer billing $500 an hour volunteering instead of giving away that money, but he allowed that the overall notion made a fair bit of sense.

My family’s local-global charitable allocation is still nowhere near Mr. Singer’s, even though we find his logic compelling. Our hang-up is this: We have a long history of being helped ourselves. My wife comes from a family of Holocaust survivors, and volunteers and donors lined up[http://www.hias.org/] to assist them when they arrived in the United States.

I got through middle and high school as well as college thanks to others who gave money so that I could be on financial aid[https://vimeo.com/127301812]. My mother was lucky and survived premenopausal breast cancer. Giving to help refugees, scholarship children and others [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-10-02/news/9810020255_1_breast-cancer-awareness-month-cancer-deaths-post-menopausal-women]grow up with their mothers after a cancer diagnosis feels like an act of gratitude that is not optional.

So what is the optimal allocation for me — and all of us — who have had the rope thrown back for us? Mr. Singer pushed back on the idea of giving a lot to breast cancer organizations, for instance. He noted that we can save many more lives far more effectively and cheaply with preventive measures and medicines that already exist.

I pressed him further to put a number on it. “I find it hard to tell you what to do,” he said. “If you feel you have a strong case for this, make it up to 25 percent or something, if you like. But I would still keep the majority of your money for use where it will be maximally effective and hope that you’ll feel comfortable repaying your debts of gratitude with the remainder.”

The right answer for my family may be a different allocation. Still, there is a lot more that all of us can do for the people who have the least in the world. And our collective 4 percent allocation toward them should give everyone with a conscience something to think about.

Clinical Trial of Experimental Ebola Drug Is Halted

In a setback for efforts to treat Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], an experimental drug that researchers had considered one of the most promising potential treatments has not worked in patients in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the drug’s developer said Friday.

The company, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, said in a news release that enrollment in a clinical trial testing its drug had been ended because the drug was “not likely to demonstrate an overall therapeutic benefit,” even if the trial had continued.

The company did not provide actual results, saying the data were being analyzed and full results would be made available later.

The drug, called TKM-Ebola-Guinea, uses a technique called RNA interference to block the action of certain genes of the Ebola virus. It was considered one of the most promising treatments because it had worked in monkeys deliberately infected with the virus.

Dr. Peter Horby of the University of Oxford, the lead investigator in the trial, said in an email that the drug “has not demonstrated an overall therapeutic benefit,” but that more time was needed to better interpret the results.

The study, which was paid for by the Wellcome Trust, a British charity, did not have a control group of patients getting a placebo or a different drug. All the patients received the drug. The effectiveness of the drug was judged by comparing the treated patients with others in Sierra Leone who did not get the drug.

American health officials have criticized the lack of a control group as a weakness that would make it harder to see if drugs were safe and effective. But other authorities, including the ones involved in this study, said it would be unethical to offer patients a placebo and that patients would be less likely to enroll in a study if there were a chance they would get a placebo.

Tekmira said the trial had reached a predefined endpoint known as a futility boundary – a point at which statistics indicated that the drug would not work even if more patients were included.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was an accomplishment to even have conducted the trial in the middle of an epidemic.

“Our goal was to find definitive answers about promising Ebola therapies and vaccines in a short space of time and in very challenging circumstances,” he said in a statement. “While it’s disappointing that TKM doesn’t appear to have demonstrated a beneficial effect, the fact that this study has reached a conclusion is a tremendous achievement and one that is testament to the hard work and dedication of the study team, health ministry and volunteers in Sierra Leone.”

Genome Studies Show How Ebola Spread Initially

After tracking tiny mutations in the genome of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], scientists from around the world are developing a fuller picture of how the virus spread and evolved genetically during the world’s worst outbreak of the disease.

The latest studies, which reported the genetic sequences of viruses from more than 400 patients in Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], suggested that early efforts to combat the epidemic in the spring of 2014 nearly stamped it out in the forested border region of Guinea where the outbreak started.

But before those efforts even began, sick people from the area had already crossed the border into Sierra Leone[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/health/frontline-tracing-the-ebola-outbreak.html]. And at least one of them infected other people, who then crossed back into Guinea and into Liberia, reigniting the epidemic.

“That second wave was a much bigger wave than the first one,” said Miles W. Carroll of Public Health England[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england], the lead author of a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, which analyzed 179 Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus sequences from Guinea.

Although officials in Guinea and with the World Health Organization[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/en/] knew that sick people had crossed into Sierra Leone by March 2014, the illness continued to spread silently in Sierra Leone for two more months before the outbreak was detected there.

“It does seem to be what has seeded the rest of the outbreak,” said Pardis Sabeti, a Harvard professor and computational biologist at the Broad Institute[https://www.broadinstitute.org/] who helped write a study published[http://www.cell.com.proxy.bc.edu/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00690-X] Thursday in the journal Cell.

The study analyzed Ebola virus genomes from 232 blood samples taken over seven months in Sierra Leone. It found that once the virus entered the country, it continued spreading, with few new introductions from outside after the borders between neighboring countries were closed.

“Most of the movement seems to be within country, not between, once the outbreak got going,” said Daniel J. Park, the study’s lead author, also with the Broad Institute.

Scientists have wondered whether the variant of the virus that spread to Sierra Leone from Guinea mutated in a way that made it more capable of propagating in humans.

But other researchers have found evidence that the earlier version of the virus in Guinea did not completely go away. Instead, it spread to the capital, Conakry. It has continued to be among the versions of the virus propagating in Guinea and later in Sierra Leone. Two dozen new cases were reported in both countries in the week ending June 14.

“That lineage, ‘A,’ does persist and is still persisting as far as we know in Conakry and that area,” said Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who helped analyze the genetic relationships between viruses.

The new studies have also calmed fears that Ebola in West Africa was mutating at a higher rate than scientists had anticipated based on past outbreaks.

“It’s evolving at the speed we’d expect of a virus of this type, which is pretty high, but not as high as flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier],” Dr. Rambaut said.

An early flurry of genetic changes appeared to have been winnowed by natural selection, as viruses that were presumably less capable of causing infection died out.

Also reassuring, the scientists said, was that all of the viruses sampled so far appeared to have descended from one another, suggesting that the entire outbreak in West Africa was caused by a single introduction of the virus from nature.

For the first time, scientists have found evidence of a few instances where Ebola genome might have been “edited” by human enzymes during its prolonged rampage through the human population.

“That hasn’t really happened with Ebola before, because it’s never really persisted in a human context for so long,” Dr. Park said.

His group and one from China, which released a paper[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14490.html] in May in Nature based on 175 sequences in Sierra Leone, detected the evidence of those mutations.

As more researchers release their sequencing results, with more to come soon from Guinea and Liberia, some scientists are attempting to put a whole picture of the epidemic together.

Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center[http://www.fredhutch.org/en.html] in Seattle, and Richard Neher, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology[http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/] in Germany, prepared a graphic[http://ebola.nextflu.org] that is something of a genetic family tree of the outbreak.

“We’re trying to connect things,” Dr. Bedford said. “We basically had no idea what was going on for a long time.”

That was because for many months samples were not easily transported across borders; the affected countries did not have the technology to sequence samples; and some scientists were reluctant to share data before publishing their results.

“It would have been great if these papers came out six months ago,” Dr. Bedford said. “You could imagine a situation where you don’t really have to publish your Nature paper; instead you make a blog post. It could have been a bit more timely.”

Backstage at Cobb’s Comedy Club on the first Saturday in May, Trevor Noah, fresh from the stage, stood sweating through a blue T-shirt, beside a refrigerator stocked with energy drinks. He guzzled from a can as well-wishers popped into his dressing room, before Mr. Noah’s second set of the evening. Mr. Noah is a 31-year-old comedian from South Africa, and in September, he is scheduled to take over for Jon Stewart as host of ‘‘The Daily Show.’’ For this reason, Mr. Noah gave an especially warm welcome to one backstage visitor: Kent Alterman, the president of content and original programming at Comedy Central, the network Mr. Noah had just joined. He helped lead the search for Mr. Stewart’s replacement, but tonight would be his first time seeing Mr. Noah work a crowd in person. ‘‘I’ve known Trevor a few years now, and he’s someone we’ve had our eyes on,’’ Mr. Alterman said. ‘‘But I’ve never actually seen him do stand-up before.’’

It is Mr. Alterman’s job to keep his eyes on funny people and to ensure, once they come under his wing, that a sizable audience will find them funny, too. He worked briefly for Comedy Central in the ’90s and rejoined the network in 2010. During his current tenure, he has presided over a creative boom time for the channel, grooming young, offbeat stars whose shows manage to appeal to the network’s core demographic — men 18 to 34 — while aiming past it. The network’s current roster includes longstanding franchises (‘‘The Daily Show,’’ ‘‘South Park’’); new critical favorites (‘‘Key & Peele,’’ ‘‘Broad City,’’ ‘‘Inside Amy Schumer,’’ ‘‘The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore’’); demographic-courting hits (‘‘Tosh.0,’’ ‘‘Workaholics’’) and comedy-geek darlings (‘‘Nathan for You,’’ ‘‘Review’’).

Mr. Alterman has a habit of gambling on relative unknowns, which he stuck to even when it came to filling one of American comedy’s best-known job openings. Mr. Noah is a largely unfamiliar name in the United States, as his booking at Cobb’s, a 400-person venue in San Francisco, helped to illustrate. ‘‘I play much bigger rooms internationally,’’ he said. ‘‘I do proper tours, with titles, in theaters.’’ Comedy Central contemplated hiring several bigger stars. The network made a call to Amy Poehler, for instance. (As someone outside the company with knowledge of the exchange put it, ‘‘They were pretty much expecting her to say no, and it was the quickest no in history.’’) Chris Rock considered signing on, but not past Nov. 8, 2016: He wanted to cede the desk to a more permanent replacement after the next election. Mr. Alterman acknowledged that Comedy Central ‘‘had a lot of conversations with different people,’’ but Mr. Noah, who had appeared several times on ‘‘The Daily Show,’’ was a favorite of Mr. Stewart’s, and he won the network over. ‘‘Trevor’s the only person we made an offer to,’’ Mr. Alterman said.

The reinvention of ‘‘The Daily Show’’ looms as an important trial not only for Mr. Noah — who became the target of online controversy when several old, impolitic tweets of his were exhumed after his hiring was publicized — but also for Mr. Alterman and for Comedy Central itself. The network, owned by the media conglomerate Viacom, is trying to adapt to trends that have changed the television business irrevocably since Mr. Stewart began hosting ‘‘The Daily Show’’ in 1999. Contemporary news cycles can seem to comprise nanoseconds and to unfold as much on social media as anywhere else. And viewers slip elusively among smartphone apps, Xbox consoles, YouTube windows, Apple TVs, bootleg streaming portals, Roku units, Hulu pages, Netflix accounts, Amazon interfaces, torrent clients and cable boxes. Any traditional media institution faces a version of this challenge, but Comedy Central’s quandary is almost paradoxically acute: What does a television network do when its bread-and-butter demographic — young, piracy-fluent, glued to phones — stops watching television?

The network’s higher-ups argue that people are still tuning in, but doing so in ways that traditional — or, to use the industry term, ‘‘linear’’ — ratings don’t capture. The problem is that when it comes to selling ads, ‘‘The dollars are still, for the most part, in the linear world,’’ says Doug Herzog, who oversees several of Viacom’s television properties. In recent quarters, Comedy Central’s ratings have declined by double-digit percentages — among its target audience, they were down 30 percent, year over year, in the first quarter of 2015 — and advertising income has declined along with them. In April, Viacom announced a major ‘‘strategic realignment’’ involving layoffs and asset write-downs.

Yet frustration about the hard-to-monetize new ways in which people are watching shows is ultimately an enviable position, because at least it means that people want to watch your shows. Even as Mr. Alterman addresses new modes of viewing (by betting big on web-born talent, devising shows with digital platforms in mind and bringing greater diversity to the network’s programming), he has restored Comedy Central’s reputation as a launching pad for major comedic stars, and for humor that thrums, delightfully, with a sense of purpose — a place where jokes can be insightful, argumentative and daffy all at once. Somehow, Mr. Alterman has helped to usher in a network renaissance — improbably but definitively — against the backdrop of a network crisis.

Deborah Liebling, a prominent producer and former Comedy Central development executive who brought ‘‘South Park’’ to the network in 1997, says: ‘‘I think they’re at an apex, creatively, right now. There don’t seem to be any rules there besides ‘Is it smart?’ and ‘Is it funny?’’’

Many of the shows Mr. Alterman, 58, has brought to Comedy Central traffic are social and political satire. In this way, he has honored the spirit of the network — the lone-voice-of-reason aesthetics of ‘‘The Daily Show,’’ the anarchic racial soothsaying of ‘‘Chappelle’s Show,’’ the profane libertarian prophetism of ‘‘South Park’’ — while incorporating new twists. ‘‘Broad City’’ and ‘‘Inside Amy Schumer’’ have added sly feminist voices to the mix, attracting viewers from outside the dude-heavy bulwark.

Beyond sketch and stand-up, Mr. Alterman is particularly intent on increasing the network’s number of episodic scripted series, like ‘‘Workaholics’’ and ‘‘Broad City.’’ He believes that viewers are more likely to watch full episodes of such programming. ‘‘It’s easy for people to just think, ‘Oh, I’ll just watch the funniest stuff on YouTube — I don’t need to see the show,’’’ he said. Mr. Alterman has also developed shows that encourage people to watch linear broadcasts, where advertising revenue for the network is stronger. The participatory elements of the nightly game show ‘‘@midnight’’ — viewers can concoct jokes on Twitter and play along with comedians — create the sense that if you don’t watch when the network wants you to watch, you’re missing out.

Nielsen, the industry-standard audience-measurement service, has become a bugbear at Comedy Central. When it comes to setting prices for ad time, Nielsen’s ratings are the ruling currency, and yet, the network’s leadership contends, those ratings don’t adequately reflect multiplatform viewing habits. (‘‘We can in fact measure viewing that takes place across multiple platforms,’’ a Nielsen spokesman said, adding that the company has proposed a comprehensive ‘‘measurement framework’’ to account for such viewing. But he noted that the industry has not yet agreed on a standard.)

The linear broadcast of ‘‘Key & Peele,’’ for instance, attracts an average viewership of around two million people, but the show has received hundreds of millions more views on YouTube. Across two seasons of ‘‘Broad City,’’ linear ratings remained flat, but ‘‘multiplatform streams’’ at places like YouTube, Hulu and the Comedy Central site grew to 25 million from 2 million.

Mr. Alterman first showed his strengths scouting talent in the late ’90s, when he worked at Comedy Central developing and producing idiosyncratic series like ‘‘Upright Citizens Brigade’’ and ‘‘Strangers With Candy.’’ The former program featured a young Amy Poehler, the latter a young Stephen Colbert. In 2001, Mr. Alterman accepted a top development role at New Line Cinema, where he oversaw ‘‘A History of Violence’’ and the Will Ferrell vehicle ‘‘Elf.’’ He left New Line for Fox, but he chafed at the slow pace of film development. ‘‘So little of your time at a movie studio is spent actually making movies,’’ he says.

This is not an issue for him now. When I first visited Comedy Central’s offices in Los Angeles, in March, the network had 73 different series and stand-alone specials in various stages of development.

To find new shows, Comedy Central identifies bright talents, invites them to pitch and, if that pitch doesn’t work, asks them to pitch some more. On Fridays, the network holds what’s known as a pitch-grid meeting, where members of the talent and development departments gather, ‘‘from the executives down to the assistants’’ Mr. Alterman said, ‘‘and we just go through what shows people have seen, what talent meetings have come in, what pitches are on the books.’’ Mr. Alterman, Mr. Herzog and Michele Ganeless, Comedy Central’s president, retain decision-making power.

When it comes to working with comedians, Mr. Alterman’s approach — and the one he encourages among members of his team — is to frame his notes as questions. This technique, performed deftly, can function something like a mind trick: ‘‘They may come to the same conclusion you did,’’ Mr. Alterman said.

Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer of ‘‘Broad City’’ said that Mr. Alterman encourages even their most outré creative impulses. ‘‘Sometimes the things in a script that we’re most nervous about sending to the network, the things we think are too weird, are the things Kent likes most,’’ Ms. Jacobson said. ‘‘He reassures our weirdness.’’ Ms. Glazer cited a moment in the show’s second-season premiere ‘‘when my character’s inspecting her vagina in a dressing-room mirror.’’ The network treated this image to some strategically placed pixelation but allowed Ms. Glazer and Ms. Jacobson to punch a hole through the fig leaf: ‘‘They let us put color in the pixels, to imply pubic hair,’’ Ms. Glazer said.

Networks like Comedy Central make most of their money in three ways. One is affiliate fees, which distributors like Comcast or Verizon pay out for each subscriber who receives a given network. For Comedy Central, these fees average 22 cents per subscriber, according to the research firm SNL Kagan; about 94 million households receive the channel, which translates to roughly $248 million in fees annually. When Mr. Stewart announced his retirement from ‘‘The Daily Show’’ early this year, Viacom’s stock dipped 1.5 percent — $350 million in market value — largely because of the perception that, without the reliable ratings that Mr. Stewart provided, Comedy Central would lose a powerful weapon when it came time to negotiate affiliate fees.

The other two main revenue sources are advertising and licensing fees. YouTube, for instance, gives Comedy Central a portion of the money from ads that it plays alongside the network’s videos. Hulu keeps ad revenue and ‘‘in effect pays us a flat licensing fee,’’ Erik Flannigan, a Viacom executive, said. Such digital platforms help Comedy Central put programs before a wider array of viewers than is possible on cable alone and help make money from those views.

The network’s ideal digital-viewing plan is the one in which you watch shows on its official site or app. These views are sold to advertisers at an average rate of between $20 and $25 for every thousand views, which is higher than what Comedy Central charges during first-run linear broadcasts, for which the rate per thousand views is about $16. This reflects the thinking that viewers who seek out a digital stream demonstrate a greater engagement with what they are watching.

Viacom executives, Mr. Flannigan said, ‘‘believed we were somehow leading the audience off the television. The phrase was, ‘We’re training them to watch a different way.’ I said, ‘We’re not training people — we’re responding to what they’re already doing.’’’ This insight is not Mr. Flannigan’s alone, and its ramifications are increasingly apparent in the ways entertainment is distributed, from video-on-demand releases for feature films to NBC’s recent decision to post online the first season of ‘‘Aquarius,’’ a new David Duchovny crime drama. Making entire seasons available allows for the sort of series-binging that Netflix pioneered with shows like ‘‘House of Cards’’ and ‘‘Orange Is the New Black.’’

‘‘You can put a ton of effort into trying to get people to tune in at 11 p.m.,’’ Mr. Flannigan said, ‘‘but the moment DVR broke the linear schedule, all bets were off, because not everyone wanted to watch at 11 p.m. — that’s just what the platform dictated.’’ By the same token, ‘‘If you’re not on YouTube and they want to watch YouTube, they’ll just watch something else on YouTube! It’s very hard to force people to consume the way you want them to consume.’’

One way that Mr. Alterman and his team responded to how people currently consume comedy was CC Studios, inaugurated in late 2013 and charged with developing digital-only series that fans can watch online or on mobile apps. Several recent Comedy Central shows — ‘‘Broad City,’’ ‘‘Workaholics’’ and ‘‘Drunk History’’ among them — stemmed from independent web projects. CC Studios was a move toward vertical integration: Why bring such established properties into the fold when they could be incubated and birthed within the company?

This is a sharp departure from traditional TV-making philosophy, where pilots are keystones. Discussing ‘‘Idiotsitter,’’ a forthcoming Comedy Central series that began life as a CC Studios title, Mr. Alterman said that ‘‘doing a half-dozen episodes’’ for the web ‘‘was significantly cheaper than doing a traditional, stand-alone pilot, and in a way we got more out of it: They got to evolve the characters, which they couldn’t have done in a one-off episode, and we got to know them better. And had it not gone any further, it would have still done exactly what it was designed to do.’’

As for Mr. Noah, the question is whether he can commandeer the perpetual-motion machine already humming along at ‘‘The Daily Show’’ without causing it to jam up. When he took the stage at Cobb’s, it was clear why he had made a strong candidate. In one extended bit about air travel, he combined expert physical comedy, virtuoso accent changes and Seinfeldian minutiae dissection before taking a bold political turn: A string of jokes about terrorism and outbreak scares culminated in a knotty line about how, before the recent Ebola epidemic, ‘‘Muslims used to be the blacks of the skies.’’

Several weeks before Mr. Noah’s gig at Cobb’s, he began clocking in regularly at the ‘‘Daily Show’’ offices in Manhattan, pitching in during writers’ room meetings and watching Mr. Stewart at work. ‘‘It’s the apprentice training with the master,’’ Mr. Noah said. He cautioned me not to extrapolate what he would be like as a host from his performance that night. ‘‘Doing stand-up and hosting a show are two very different things.’’

Figuring out the right way forward for ‘‘The Daily Show,’’ and for the network, would take time, and it would take error. ‘‘That’s been the biggest thing every single media outlet has been facing,’’ Mr. Noah said. ‘‘How do you tap into this new world that seems to have no rules and no structure?’’

Pondering this question later, Mr. Flannigan put it another way: ‘‘We’re prepared to do a lot of flailing.’’

Theater
Penn and Teller, Reconjured on Broadway

The man known simply as Teller, or often, “the silent one,” paused during a walk through Times Square, thinking about change, about the old and the new, and said, “We’re going to pull a rabbit out of a hat.”

He was not speaking metaphorically. He was talking about the coming Broadway show[http://www.nytimes.com/theater/venues/broadway.html?inline=nyt-classifier] of the duo to which he belongs, Penn and Teller, and their new magic trick. It involves the extraction of a small mammal with large ears from a fashion accessory worn on a man’s head.

“No one does that,” Teller said, and there’s a reason: “It’s really hard.”

Penn and Teller’s six-week run at the Marquis Theater[http://pennandtelleronbroadway.com/] begins July 7. It will contain greatest hits from their New York shows of the 1980s and 1990s and material made popular during their longtime run in Las Vegas, the two men said in recent interviews in Manhattan.

“For 15 years, we’ve been talking about getting another New York run going,” said Penn Jillette, 60, the loud one.

“Penn and Teller, as we are now, really started in New York when they brought us out in 1985,” Teller, 67, said.

“That was before Disney bought Times Square,” said Mr. Jillette, as the pair strolled past the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Broadway, remembering the strippers and drug dealers they each used to pass on their way home after an act.

On a recent Friday afternoon, they fondly recalled the grimy past while gamely pausing to take photos with tourists. The men are instantly recognizable together, less so individually, especially Mr. Jillette, who has dropped a full third of his body weight in the last several months.

High blood pressure led him to drastically change his diet in December, and he lost 105 pounds. A woman stopped and asked him how he had done it.

“I’ve got a little bit of Ebola,” he said.

They will stay in apartments near the theater, as they used to in the 1980s. Back then, Mr. Jillette would watch the three-card monte guys dupe their victims, and sometimes interrupt, showing how it’s all a trick. He was not popular with the three-card monte guys.

Now, the walk through Times Square will be far more likely to include selfies than scam artists. Looking around at the Olive Garden and Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Mr. Jillette shared a note of regret about this shift. Yet both men admitted that they fully expected to loathe the cleaned-up version of their old stamping grounds, only to surprise themselves.

“I like it clean,” said Mr. Jillette, who will be joined in New York by his two children, ages 9 and 10. “I thought I’d really miss the funk, but I don’t.”

Teller remembered the bad old days. “I would often come home to find people asleep in my doorway,” he said. On a recent walk through nearby Bryant Park, once a drug hangout, “I looked and saw guys on their laptops at 1 in the morning.”

Their return to New York as a name brand brings back memories of their up-and-coming years. In a production office on West 54th Street, Teller pointed to a poster promoting “Penn & Teller,” an Off Broadway show[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/19/theater/stage-penn-teller.html] staged at the Westside Arts Theater in 1985.

“The hippest, strangest, funniest act New York will ever see!” it reads, quoting Rolling Stone.

“Notice something about that poster,” Teller said. “The complete absence of the word ‘magic.’ When we first came to New York, because what people thought of as magic was Harry Blackstone, David Copperfield and Doug Henning,” the producer Richard Frankel “wanted to somehow differentiate us from all of it.”

They’ve spent most of the years since on the strip in Las Vegas, performing five nights a week at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. They have appeared in almost too many television shows to count and have individually produced and directed movies, including “The Aristocrats,”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxGD0rk547Y] a 2005 documentary about a notoriously raunchy joke, and “Tim’s Vermeer,”[http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/teller-on-penns-idea-tims-hypothesis-and-vermeers-painting/] a 2013 documentary about an inventor, Tim Jenison, and his exploration of the techniques of the 17th-century Dutch painter.

There have been plays and books and podcasts and, last but not least, an appearance in next month’s Syfy movie “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!”[http://screenrant.com/sharknado-3-trailer/].

The act has proved very durable. Penn and Teller stood fast in the 1990s as a new wave of illusionists — a label that makes them bristle — performed extreme feats. “It really looked like David Blaine and Criss Angel were going to take over,” Teller said.

“To me, it was a great step backward, intellectually,” Mr. Jillette said. “ ‘I can hold my breath forever. I have special powers.’ You either say, well, he’s a liar, or you believe it. With our stuff, you don’t need to make that decision. We are telling you we are doing tricks.”

People frequently approach them and mention a trick — Shadows, say, or Needles — the way fans tell musicians their favorite song. In Needles, Teller eats a handful of sewing needles and some thread, then pulls the thread back out of his mouth, only now the needles are all neatly threaded. It’s a trick Harry Houdini used to perform.

“I really like the fact that Teller is going to do Needles in our show here,” Mr. Jillette said. It was “the first trick I saw him do,” before they were a team. “Still doing it 40 years later, and I think still getting better at it.”

“Two nights ago we made a change in Needles,” Teller said. “It’s in a different position in the show.” He said the trick feels different and new. “There’s still discovery possible,” he said.

Then there is the new trick — seemingly the oldest one in the book.

“I was having a conversation backstage in England with a magician who just said to me, ‘People have no idea how hard it is to do the rabbit in the hat,’ ” Teller said. He bounced the idea off Mr. Jillette, who had never seen it done. They decided it was time to bring it back — something old, done anew.

But times have changed.

“In the old days,” Teller said, “it was done without much consideration for the animal,” which may very well have ended up at the supper table after a performance. And a major element was borrowing a hat from a man in the audience. “Hats big enough for rabbits,” Teller said. “People would go to the theater with a top hat on.”

Months ago, the duo, with other magician friends, retreated to a workshop space they use in Las Vegas to create new tricks, and they got to work, using something approximating the bulk of a rabbit.

In the end, the trick took about six months to nail down. “We talk about pulling a rabbit out of a hat first, which I think may be one of the bravest things we do in that trick,” Mr. Jillette said. “The people who used to do that trick didn’t use to say, ‘Let’s talk about pulling a rabbit out of a hat’ first, because then you have all the heat on the hat.”

The actual rabbit arrived early in the trick’s creation — “second week,” Mr. Jillette said — after a sort of audition. “Millimeters matter,” he said. “Ounces matter.”

“You need to know what a rabbit needs to be comfortable,” Teller said. “And also, the rabbit needs to learn its job.”

Comedy Central in the Post-TV Era

Backstage at Cobb’s Comedy Club on the first Saturday in May, Trevor Noah, fresh from the stage, stood sweating through a blue T-shirt, beside a refrigerator stocked with energy drinks. He guzzled from a can as well-wishers popped into his dressing room, getting in their hellos and handshakes before Noah’s second set of the evening. Noah is a 31-year-old comedian from South Africa, and in September, he is scheduled to take over for Jon Stewart as host of “The Daily Show.” For this reason, Noah gave an especially warm welcome to one backstage visitor: Kent Alterman, the president of content and original programming at Comedy Central, the network Noah had just joined. Alterman had flown from Los Angeles, where he lives and works, to San Francisco, where Cobb’s is located, to watch Noah perform. He helped lead the search for Stewart’s replacement, but tonight would be his first time seeing Noah work a crowd in person.

“I’ve known Trevor a few years now, and he’s someone we’ve had our eyes on,” Alterman said. “But I’ve never actually seen him do stand-up before.”

It is Alterman’s job to keep his eyes on funny people and to ensure, once they come under his wing, that a sizable audience will find them funny, too. He worked briefly for Comedy Central in the ’90s and rejoined the network in 2010. During his current tenure, he has presided over a creative boom time for the channel, grooming young, offbeat stars whose shows manage to appeal to the network’s core demographic — men 18 to 34 — while aiming past it. The network’s current roster includes longstanding franchises (“The Daily Show,” “South Park”); new critical favorites (“Key & Peele,” “Broad City,” “Inside Amy Schumer,” “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore”); demographic-courting hits (“Tosh.0,” “Workaholics”); and comedy-geek darlings (“Nathan for You,” “Review”).

Alterman has a habit of gambling on relative unknowns, which he stuck to even when it came to filling one of American comedy’s best-known job openings. Noah, who draws crowds abroad, is a largely unfamiliar name in the United States, as his booking at Cobb’s, a 400-person venue, helped to illustrate. “I play much bigger rooms internationally,” he said. “I do proper tours, with titles, in theaters.” Comedy Central contemplated hiring several bigger stars. The network made a call to Amy Poehler, for instance, to gauge her interest. (As someone outside the company with knowledge of the exchange put it, “They were pretty much expecting her to say no, and it was the quickest no in history.”) Chris Rock considered signing on, but not past Nov. 8, 2016: He wanted to cede the desk to a more permanent replacement after the next election. Alterman acknowledged that Comedy Central “had a lot of conversations with different people,” but Noah, who had appeared several times on “The Daily Show,” was a favorite of Stewart’s, and he won the network over. “Trevor’s the only person we made an offer to,” Alterman said.

The reinvention of “The Daily Show” looms as an important trial not only for Noah — who became the target of online controversy when several old, impolitic tweets of his were exhumed[http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/31/trevor-noah-backlash-highlights-jokes-jews-women] after his hiring was publicized — but also for Alterman and for Comedy Central itself. The network, owned by the media conglomerate Viacom, is trying to adapt to trends that have changed the television business irrevocably since Stewart began hosting “The Daily Show” in 1999, and the program sits at the center of thorny questions about how best to face the future. Contemporary news cycles can seem to comprise nanoseconds and to unfold as much on social media as anywhere else. And viewers — especially the younger ones Comedy Central wants in its cross hairs — slip elusively among smartphone apps, Xbox consoles, YouTube windows, Apple TVs, bootleg streaming portals, Roku units, Hulu pages, Netflix accounts, Amazon interfaces, torrent clients and, if they even own them, cable boxes. Any traditional media institution faces a version of this challenge, but Comedy Central’s quandary is almost paradoxically acute: What does a television network do when its bread-and-butter demographic — young, piracy-fluent, glued to phones — stops watching television?

The network’s higher-ups argue that people are still tuning in, but doing so in ways that traditional — or, to use the industry term, “linear” — ratings don’t capture. The problem is that when it comes to selling ads, “The dollars are still, for the most part, in the linear world,” says Doug Herzog, who oversees several of Viacom’s television properties. In recent quarters, Comedy Central’s ratings have declined by double-digit percentages — among its target audience, they were down 30 percent, year over year, in the first quarter of 2015 — and advertising income has declined along with them. In April, Viacom announced a major “strategic realignment” involving layoffs and asset write-downs.

Yet frustration about the hard-to-monetize new ways in which people are watching shows is ultimately an enviable position, because at least it means that people want to watch your shows. Alterman seems keenly aware of this. Even as he addresses new modes of viewing (by betting big on web-born talent, devising shows with digital platforms in mind and bringing greater diversity to the network’s programming), he has restored Comedy Central’s reputation as a launching pad for major comedic stars, and for humor that thrums, delightfully, with a sense of purpose — a place where jokes can be insightful, argumentative and daffy all at once. Somehow, Alterman has helped to usher in a network renaissance — improbably but definitively — against the backdrop of a network crisis.

People inside and outside Comedy Central tend to dismiss the five years that followed Dave Chappelle’s decision to quit the pathbreaking, enormously popular “Chappelle’s Show,” in 2005, as a low period. During that time, the network largely relied on its flagships, creating few new hits beyond “The Colbert Report” and “Tosh.0.” One Comedy Central executive invoked “a kind of post-Chappelle nadir in terms of what we were pumping out.” A former talent agent recalled that “there was a little bit of an eye roll for how people were handled over there, because they were running stuff the comedy community couldn’t get excited about, like ‘Mind of Mencia’ ” — a vehicle for the comic Carlos Mencia, who was widely accused of stealing jokes[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/11/30/carlos_mencia_joke_thief_makes_a_controversial_comeback.html] — “and they were paying him up the wazoo, but not doing any cool development!” Alterman is generally diplomatic on this subject, but he told me of his intention, when he arrived at Comedy Central, to change its prevailing voice, which felt, as he put it, like “a guy yelling at you.”

Alterman is 58, with close-cropped hair and a laid-back fashion sense that leans toward untucked button-downs and slip-on North Face loafers. He has a background in graphic design that’s evident in the half-frame eyeglasses he wears and in the sleek logo he insisted Comedy Central adopt upon his arrival, scrapping the retro one it had used for ages. Deborah Liebling, a prominent producer and former Comedy Central development executive who brought “South Park” to the network in 1997, says: “I think they’re at an apex, creatively, right now. There don’t seem to be any rules there besides ‘Is it smart?’ and ‘Is it funny?’ ”

Many of the shows Alterman has brought to Comedy Central traffic in social and political satire. In this way, he has honored the spirit of the network — the lone-voice-of-reason aesthetics of “The Daily Show,” the anarchic racial soothsaying of “Chappelle’s Show,” the profane libertarian prophetism of “South Park” — while incorporating new twists. “Broad City” and “Inside Amy Schumer” have added sly feminist voices to the mix and, as a result, attracted viewers from outside the dude-heavy bulwark. Sam Saifer, an executive producer of “Broad City,” put this transformation in personal terms: “I’m a woman who smokes pot, but I’m not a pothead. I’m married, but that’s not the end-all, be-all for me. Kent saw an opportunity to include women like me.”

In expanding Comedy Central’s slate, Alterman has encouraged show creators to bid for the kind of zeitgeist-riding relevance that Chappelle once enjoyed. Early in the development of “Key & Peele,” Alterman sat down with its creators, Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, to sharpen their show’s identity. “One thing that guys like me and Keegan, who have a sketch pedigree, lack,” Peele said, “is the thing that stand-ups excel at: They’ve got their voices nailed down, whereas we’re chameleons. I remember Kent saying, ‘We know you guys are great sketch performers, but what is the voice of the show?’ ”

This question “raised the ante,” Peele said. Trying to answer it, “we began talking about the president and our own similar upbringing” — the co-creators each had white and black parents — “and how pop culture didn’t really have a predetermined slot for us. But now, because of Obama, people are realizing that there’s this mixed community that has a very interesting perspective. Kent’s eyes lit up, and he said: ‘That’s it.’ He went from, ‘O.K., this is another sketch show,’ to, ‘This is something that needs to happen, and could only happen, right now.’ ”

Beyond sketch and stand-up — forms that Comedy Central has long focused on — Alterman is particularly intent on increasing the network’s number of episodic scripted series, like “Workaholics” and “Broad City.” This desire connects directly, he says, to digital-era industry upheavals. He believes, for one thing, that viewers are more likely to watch full episodes of such programming: “It’s easy for people to just think, Oh, I’ll just watch the funniest stuff on YouTube — I don’t need to see the show,” he said. One result is the recent Comedy Central series “Big Time in Hollywood, FL,” which, as the network’s first serialized narrative, worked to hook viewers with an array of twists and cliffhangers. (The show, averaging a paltry 350,000 viewers an episode, didn’t catch fire, suggesting that the network has yet to perfect this strategy.) Alterman has also developed shows that encourage people to watch linear broadcasts, where advertising revenue for the network is stronger. The participatory elements of the nightly game show “@midnight” — viewers can concoct jokes on Twitter and play along with comedians — create the sense that if you don’t watch when the network wants you to watch, you’re missing out.

And as HBO, AMC and, more recently, Netflix have shown, original scripted programming can help a network establish a durable bond with increasingly fickle viewers. Comedy Central’s executives are watching the performance of HBO Now — a stand-alone subscription service that bypasses cable providers outright — with close interest, but that undertaking wouldn’t be nearly as viable if HBO hadn’t consistently associated itself, over the decades, with so much revered and eventful television. As Herzog put it, “One of the things we’ve been trying to do over the last few years is not think of ourselves as a TV network anymore — we’re a brand.”

In building that brand, Alterman has been given license to experiment; though he says he is, to a degree, “accountable to the ratings,” the numbers do not seem to weigh heavily on his decisions. He explained that “what we sell is called C3 ratings: how many people watched a show in the first three days, without fast-forwarding through the commercials,” but argued that this metric has become increasingly meaningless, because “in this era, playback that happens days after the first airing is much more of a signifier than it used to be.” People watch on their own time, in other words, but ardor builds all the same.

Nielsen, the industry-standard audience-measurement service, has become a bugbear at Comedy Central. When it comes to setting prices for ad time, Nielsen’s ratings are the ruling currency, and yet, the network’s leadership contends, those ratings don’t adequately reflect multiplatform viewing habits. In a conference call with reporters last November, Viacom’s chief executive, Philippe Dauman, made this complaint public, calling Nielsen outdated in how it measured new viewing habits and saying that the service had “not caught up to the marketplace.” (“We can in fact measure viewing that takes place across multiple platforms,” a Nielsen spokesman said, adding that the company has proposed a comprehensive “measurement framework” to account for such viewing. But he noted that the industry has not yet agreed on a standard.) According to Michele Ganeless, Comedy Central’s president, the network — along with its sibling Viacom networks MTV and Nickelodeon — is especially vulnerable in this regard, given its technologically adept audience. “We’re disproportionately affected because of Nielsen’s methodology,” she said.

The linear broadcast of “Key & Peele,” for instance, attracts an average viewership of around two million people, but the show has received hundreds of millions more views on YouTube. Across two seasons of “Broad City,” linear ratings remained flat, but “multiplatform streams” at places like YouTube, Hulu and the Comedy Central site grew to 25 million from two million.

“The success of a show can go beyond the pure rating number,” Alterman said. “I rarely encounter anyone who hasn’t heard of ‘Broad City’ and isn’t a fan of it — just anecdotally, it transcends age and gender. If you just looked at the ratings on the day of airing, it would suggest it’s not a wildly popular show. But I know otherwise.”

Alterman first showed his strengths scouting talent in the late ’90s, when he worked at Comedy Central developing and producing idiosyncratic series like “Upright Citizens Brigade” and “Strangers With Candy.” The former program featured a young Amy Poehler, the latter a young Stephen Colbert. In 2001, amid a change in management at Comedy Central, Alterman accepted a top development role at New Line Cinema, where he oversaw “A History of Violence” and, at the other end of the tonal spectrum, the Will Ferrell vehicle “Elf.” Alterman left New Line for Fox, but he began to chafe at the slow pace of film development. “So little of your time at a movie studio is spent actually making movies,” he says.

This is not an issue for him now. When I first visited Comedy Central’s L.A. offices, in March, the network had 73 different series and stand-alone specials in various stages of development. These consisted of 28 projects with “script or paper development commitments” (essentially, tell us what you’ve got); 15 with “pilot or presentation commitments” (show us what you’ve got); and 30 with production commitments (make what you’ve got because we’re putting it on).

To find new shows, Comedy Central identifies bright talents, invites them to pitch and, if that pitch doesn’t work, asks them to pitch some more. On Fridays, the network holds what’s known as a pitch-grid meeting, where members of the talent and development departments gather, “from the executives down to the assistants,” Alterman said, “and we just go through what shows people have seen, what talent meetings have come in, what pitches are on the books.” Discussions unfurl about which projects to pursue, based both on a sense of the balance across the network’s slate — Are we leaning too niche? Could we use another reality show?— and on each idea’s individual strengths. To this end, Alterman instituted a network policy by which pilots are screened internally not only for executives, as was customary, but also for assistants and interns. Their feedback is reported to Alterman, Herzog and Ganeless, who retain decision-making power.

Comedy Central has a distinct advantage when it comes to helping fledgling stars break out: It can use its own airwaves. In 2011, when the network was plotting its “Roast of Charlie Sheen,” a surefire ratings bonanza, Alterman told Sheen’s people that the dais should include the comedian Amy Schumer — little known, at the time, beyond the New York club scene and the viewership of “Last Comic Standing,” a reality series on which she was a contestant. “They didn’t know Amy, so they kept saying no, and I kept saying yeah, and I went to the mat,” Alterman said. “They finally said O.K. And at the after-party, they were asking Amy if she wanted to be in Charlie’s next project” — “Anger Management” — “because they were so taken by her.” Schumer’s show-stealing performance[http://video.vulture.com/video/Amy-Schumer-Roasts-Charlie-Shee] that night built awareness of her in advance of her sketch series, which was nearly two years off. “We knew we were going to shoot a pilot, but we were still developing the idea,” Schumer said. This was a function of both strategy and economy on the network’s part. “We’re basically filling content as we’re developing talent,” Alterman said. “The development pipeline becomes a content pipeline.”

In rare cases, when Comedy Central has an especially high level of interest in a performer, it will offer an umbrella development deal, encompassing various projects and commitments, in exchange for an exclusive on that performer’s television work. It struck one of these in 2012 with the buzzed-about Brooklyn-based comic Hannibal Buress, providing him with a stand-up special, a pilot and a recurring role on “Broad City.” Last year, Buress delivered his pilot. The proposed show was called “Unemployable” and would feature Buress working different real-life jobs; in the first episode, he labored on a goat farm. “It wasn’t quite working, but there was one bit, where Hannibal wonders why farmers need to get up so early, that we loved,” Alterman said. The network passed but encouraged Buress and his showrunner, Jeff Stilson, to develop a new series driven by that wryly inquisitive spirit. “The idea now is that I’ll tackle different subjects with monologues, man-on-the-street interviews, sketches,” Buress said. “So I can do some of the field stuff we were going to do on ‘Unemployable,’ but we’re not constricted — we have more flexibility.” The series — titled: “Why? With Hannibal Buress” — will make its debut in July.

Alterman develops and produces with a budget somewhere between $250 million and $350 million, significantly smaller than the development budgets at broadcast networks or, for that matter, HBO. “A first-year Comedy Central show is going to pay you less than a first-year network show,” Buress told me. But he said that the network makes good financially if a show “becomes established,” and offers hard-to-rival creative freedoms from the jump: “Comedy Central bought eight episodes from me off a pitch alone. We get to shape the show as we go, and really find it in the writers’ room. That’s exciting and risky, and it’s not common.”

When it comes to working with comedians, Alterman’s approach — and the one he encourages among members of his team — is to frame his notes as questions. He’ll tell you if something doesn’t work, Schumer said, using a coarser term, “but he’s open to the possibility he could be wrong about it.” Alterman says he favors the interrogative because “if you say, ‘Here’s a problem and here’s a solution,’ you’re just building resistance. But it’s quite common to work that way. I’ve seen it in TV and film. It’s so much better to share it as, ‘Here’s a question,’ because if that resonates with them, they’re invested in addressing it in their own voice, and it’s going to work better.” This technique, performed deftly, can function something like a mind trick: “They may come to the same conclusion you did,” Alterman said.

Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer of “Broad City” said that Alterman encourages even their most outré creative impulses. “Sometimes the things in a script that we’re most nervous about sending to the network, the things we think are too weird, are the things Kent likes most,” Jacobson said. “He reassures our weirdness.” Glazer cited a moment in the show’s second-season premiere “when my character’s inspecting her vagina in a dressing-room mirror.” The network treated this image to some strategically placed pixelation but allowed Glazer and Jacobson to punch a hole through the fig leaf: “They let us put color in the pixels, to imply pubic hair,” Glazer said.

Alterman’s Socratic note-giving, paired with his mellow demeanor and string of successes, contributes to something of a yogi-ish aura. He meditates regularly and bicycles to work daily, affixing Bluetooth speakers to his helmet so he can listen to podcasts while remaining mindful of traffic. He has presided over at least one morning meeting in Lululemon bicycle shorts. He has a soft speaking voice, and he routinely dispenses dry one-liners that are funny, if not as uproarious as is suggested by the explosions they elicit from comedians hopeful that Alterman will commission their pilot, say, or give their show a second season.

One day in March, Alterman — wearing pants — put his bedside manner into practice in a Comedy Central conference room. The network had paid the young stand-up comedian Barry Rothbart to write a pilot script; upon reading it, Alterman decided not to move forward. But he wanted to meet with Rothbart anyway, he told me, “to see if there’s something else there that we can build on — whether he has a point of view that, maybe, he isn’t quite aware of himself.” Rothbart came to the network’s attention the way many people do: He made a name for himself on the festival-and-club circuit, which Comedy Central actively scouts. Several of the network’s current programs are stand-up showcases, which create low-risk, low-cost opportunities to work with up-and-coming comedians. “We follow and track pretty much every known and unknown stand-up out there,” said Jonas Larsen, who heads the network’s talent team. “We’re really good at getting in at the very beginning.”

Rothbart, a burly guy in his 30s, showed up with a writing partner, Danny Solomon, and rocked nervously in a swivel chair, fidgeting with a pants cuff. Alterman said, “O.K., so, you’re funny, you’ve got a great personality and we’re not going to make your pilot.” Rothbart, whose team notified him about this decision beforehand, had proposed a series that would satirize faux altruism in the Twitter age, when making a big to-do of seeming to care about the world’s ills, he said, had become confused with action. The show’s lead character, whom Rothbart intended to portray, would embody such egotism.

Alterman talks often about deferring to strong comedic voices, but he is not above invoking conventional TV thinking when he finds it useful. Indicating his reasons for passing on Rothbart’s show, he expressed reluctance about a series that would feature an actively unlikable protagonist: “What you’re describing is tricky to pull off,” he said.

“I was thinking of Danny McBride on ‘Eastbound & Down,’ where he does horrible stuff, but you know he’s misguided and you still somehow root for him,” Rothbart replied.

“Danny McBride is a pretty tough target to hit,” Alterman said, unswayed. He asked what else the partners were working on, and Solomon described an idea for a show in which a karate master is abruptly transplanted into hipster Brooklyn. Alterman smiled at this ludicrous premise. “They told us it was too crazy,” Solomon added.

“Your agents?” Alterman asked. The pair nodded. “I trust you got new agents.”

Networks like Comedy Central make most of their money in three ways. One is affiliate fees, which distributors like Comcast or Verizon pay out for each subscriber who receives a given network. For Comedy Central, these fees average 22 cents per subscriber, according to the research firm SNL Kagan; about 94 million households receive the channel, which translates to roughly $248 million in fees annually. “The beauty of that model is, you get paid on a bajillion people who aren’t watching you,” says Erik Flannigan, a Viacom executive who is charged with answering some of the toughest questions about how Comedy Central can remain viable in the postlinear world. When Jon Stewart announced his retirement from “The Daily Show” early this year, Viacom’s stock dipped 1.5 percent — $350 million in market value — largely because of the perception that, without the reliable ratings that Stewart provided, Comedy Central would lose a powerful weapon when it came time to negotiate affiliate fees. Ganeless called Stewart’s resignation “one of the biggest challenges the network has faced, creatively and economically — there are revenue implications, distribution implications, and all those factors certainly fly through our heads.” But, she added, “even with a hit like Jon, more and more people were finding him on other platforms. So affiliate renewals are a major factor in our business today, but will they be as big a factor 10 years from now?”

The other two main revenue sources are advertising and licensing fees. YouTube, for instance, gives Comedy Central a portion of the money from ads that it plays alongside the network’s videos. Hulu, by contrast, keeps ad revenue and “in effect pays us a flat licensing fee,” Flannigan says. Such digital platforms help Comedy Central put its programs before a wider array of viewers than is possible on cable alone and help it make money from those views. Viacom also has a department that works on product integration — finding opportunities to incorporate plugs for sponsors’ products into the shows themselves — and banks on its channels’ cachet with the young. When Daniel Tosh raves about his beloved Subaru on his show, he does so within the auspices of a promotional deal between the car company and Comedy Central; other integrations have been far more elaborate. In 2012, Unilever paid to have its Choco Taco frozen dessert not only appear on-screen during Season 3 of “Workaholics” but also praised in that episode’s dialogue, mentioned on official Twitter accounts associated with the show and featured prominently in a web-only “Workaholics” spinoff series. Describing this “all-screens promotion” to a trade publication last year, Dario Spina, a Viacom marketing executive, said that Unilever came to Comedy Central in hopes of making “the Choco Taco, I would say, the dessert for millennials.”

The network’s ideal digital-viewing plan is the one in which you watch shows on its official site or app. These views are sold to advertisers at an average rate of between $20 and $25 for every thousand views, which is actually higher than what Comedy Central charges during first-run linear broadcasts, for which the rate per thousand views is about $16. This reflects the thinking that a viewer who seeks out a digital stream demonstrates a greater engagement with what he’s watching.

“Millions turn on ‘The Today Show’ out of pure habit and let it play for three hours in the background,” Flannigan said. “Are they watching every ad? Are they engaged? No. But they’re counted in Nielsen.” Talking about what he called “this kind of passive viewing,” he observed that “most young people don’t do that anymore — they have a queue of shows they want to watch.”

That’s if they have queues at all. On a spring evening in Culver City, Calif., Comedy Central held a premiere party for “Big Time in Hollywood, FL.” The evening felt like a throwback to a different media era. Waitstaff circulated within an industrial-chic event space, carrying wine, cocktails and hors d’oeuvres; a sleek Ping-Pong table sat unused out front, near guests waiting for valets to park their cars. When the lights dimmed inside, however, and the first episode began to play, I knew what was coming because, several days before, Comedy Central had posted it to Snapchat, the video-sharing app popular with teenagers. I had already watched the premiere, swipe by swipe, on my phone.

Flannigan first came to Viacom from a position at AOL almost a decade ago, after fielding near-simultaneous headhunter calls from four television networks. “All of them were effectively describing the same job, which was to figure out digital strategy,” Flannigan said. He added, “The reason is that YouTube was born in 2005, and it freaked everyone out.”

Flannigan has salt-and-pepper hair and prominent eyebrows. In conversation with me, he kept saying “Yep” after every other clause I uttered — a signal, perhaps, that he spends so much time envisioning theoretical futures that he seldom hears an idea capable of surprising him. The present value of putting Comedy Central’s programming on Snapchat, he said, is almost entirely promotional, but he has long agitated at the network for such loss-leading moves, in the hope of carving out market share in hotly contested new digital spaces. An early coup for Flannigan was persuading Viacom to make “South Park” available in full online. The show’s “DVD sales were very successful, it sold extremely well on iTunes and it was in local-market syndication,” he says, “but piracy started to go crazy post-YouTube.” Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the “South Park” creators, “were very conscious of the piracy and conscious of the lack of an alternative to the piracy, so we got together and proposed unlocking the entire catalog, putting it up as an ad-supported site.” To do otherwise, Flannigan argued, would have meant “leaving money on the table, because there’s a consumer behavior that’s happening anyway, and if they go to pirate sites, we’re missing out.”

Viacom executives, Flannigan said, “believed we were somehow leading the audience off the television. The phrase was, ‘We’re training them to watch a different way.’ I said, ‘We’re not training people — we’re responding to what they’re already doing.’ ” This insight is not Flannigan’s alone, and its ramifications are increasingly apparent in the ways entertainment is distributed, from video-on-demand releases for feature films to NBC’s recent decision to post online the first season of “Aquarius,” a new David Duchovny crime drama, after its premiere. Making entire seasons available in one go is a way to allow for the sort of series-binging that Netflix pioneered with shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black” — and also, ostensibly, a way for NBC to learn more about the relationship between linear and nonlinear viewership.

When I asked Herzog if Comedy Central’s digital revenue was increasing at a satisfactory rate, he sighed, hesitating, and gave his answer off the record. Digital revenue makes up about “10 to 15 percent” of Comedy Central’s current business, according to Flannigan, which to him constitutes a promising increase — “fourfold, maybe” — from when he started at the network. His attitude is that the money will arrive eventually, and the network needs to be in position when it does. “You can put a ton of effort into trying to get people to tune in at 11 p.m.,” Flannigan said, “but the moment DVR broke the linear schedule, all bets were off, because not everyone wanted to watch at 11 p.m. — that’s just what the platform dictated.” By the same token, “If you’re not on YouTube and they want to watch YouTube, they’ll just watch something else on YouTube! It’s very hard to force people to consume the way you want them to consume.”

One way that Alterman and his team responded to how people currently consume comedy was CC Studios, a division of the network inaugurated in late 2013 and charged with developing digital-only series that fans can watch online or on mobile apps. Several recent Comedy Central shows — “Broad City,” “Workaholics” and “Drunk History” among them — stemmed from independent web projects. CC Studios was a move toward vertical integration: Why bring such established properties into the fold when they could be incubated and birthed within the company? David Jargowsky, head of Comedy Bang! Bang! Productions, which has multiple projects in the works at Comedy Central, said: “Someone telling you, ‘We’ll do your show on a digital platform,’ used to be a steak-knives concession.” But, he added, “there’s a good chance the next ‘South Park’ comes out of digital development.”

This is a sharp departure from traditional TV-making philosophy, where pilots are keystones. Discussing “Idiotsitter,” a forthcoming Comedy Central series that began life as a CC Studios title, Alterman said that “doing a half-dozen episodes” for the web “was significantly cheaper than doing a traditional, stand-alone pilot, and in a way we got more out of it: They got to evolve the characters, which they couldn’t have done in a one-off episode, and we got to know them better. And had it not gone any further, it would have still done exactly what it was designed to do.” According to Jason Nadler, a co-creator of “@midnight,” “The idea that you can get a better sense of how something works with a 22-minute pilot that you’re focus-group testing at a Vegas casino, versus putting it online and seeing an actually engaged audience respond to it, is ridiculous.”

A similar insight was at play at Amazon, which began producing streaming shows in 2013 and decided to post the pilots, to see how viewers responded, before committing to picking shows up. And it goes back to Channel 101, an influential live event and online “network” built around web series, where viewers’ votes drive programming choices. “That’s what part of what working in the multiplatform, digital world affords us,” Alterman said. “Being able to take more shots with people.”

For comedians, Nadler acknowledged, “the economics” of CC Studios deals “weren’t great, but the creative payoff was.” The numbers certainly make sense for Comedy Central, where the price tag for a typical pilot can range from about $500,000 to about $1,000,000, depending on production and talent costs. According to one producer I spoke to, a six-episode web series, by contrast, could be shot “in two days for, like, $200,000.”

One recent morning, Alterman left his bicycle at home and drove 30-odd miles north, into the San Fernando Valley, to attend a table read for “Idiotsitter.” He makes it a point to drop in on table reads, writers’ rooms and show tapings, offering guidance and solidarity. At the “Idiotsitter” production headquarters, in a city called Chatsworth, Alterman sat beside the show’s stars and creators, Jillian Bell and Charlotte Newhouse. Photocopied scripts for Episode 107 lined a long table, encircling 18 bottles of Arrowhead water — “Do we have enough?” Newhouse deadpanned.

“Idiotsitter” is about a desperately broke woman (Newhouse) who is hired to tutor a filthy-mouthed and filthy-rich adult delinquent under house arrest (Bell). As the actors read through the episode, Alterman followed along with a look of delight — arched eyebrows, big grin. He cuts a disarming figure, but his position can be intimidating all the same. When he responded to a line from Bell about “babies in Dumpsters” with a laugh, it lessened the pressure his presence created, and the rest of the room laughed a beat behind him. After the reading, he said, simply: “That was really funny — great job. No notes.” Bell and Newhouse beamed.

“Idiotsitter” is one of two CC Studios shows to ascend to full-series orders thus far, although ascension might eventually prove an outdated metaphor. Recently, Comedy Central eliminated the “CC Studios” mantle altogether. The thinking, these days, is that “it’s not about Comedy Central’s TV shows,” Doug Herzog said. “It’s about Comedy Central, which can exist in many different places.”

But the creative demands of a short-form web series are different from those of a traditional show. “We had to work through a lot of questions of how to best turn the idea into a full series,” Alterman told me. “Jillian and Charlotte come from the world of improv, and that doesn’t always lend itself to structured and disciplined scriptwriting.” He likened the process of developing their show, in this regard, to those of “Broad City” and “Workaholics”: “There was a lot of back and forth, not about the issue of whether they’re funny, because we know they’re funny, but of how we can push it to a higher place in terms of story.”

Gifted comedians might excel at creating tone and finding novel laughs, but they often need a hand reconciling these skills with the mechanical and structural demands of a traditional series. This is in part how Comedy Central lures comedians into its fold and away from upstart competitors like the Turner-owned network Adult Swim or the video-hosting website Funny or Die, which are home to ingenious programming but put less emphasis on narrative architecture. To supply such expertise, Comedy Central will usually add a more experienced showrunner to a project. On the first season of “Broad City,” this role was filled by Tami Sagher, a writer with credits on “30 Rock” and “Mad TV.” “We had never written anything” for television, Abbi Jacobson said, “so Comedy Central needed someone there with us in the writers’ room.” She added, “They wanted us to focus more on the characters’ drives, and to learn how to work within the structure of act breaks.” (Come Season 2, the co-creators persuaded Comedy Central to let them steer the ship.)

Jokes land most satisfyingly when they’re supported by narrative and emotional undergirding, Alterman says. This principle extends from a show like “Nathan for You,” in which the loneliness of the host, Nathan Fielder, is a recurring conceit across otherwise disparate gags, to those like “Inside Amy Schumer,” “Kroll Show” and “Key & Peele,” in which sketches are interwoven with interludes of stand-up, man-on-the-street interviews and other comedic bits in which the stars appear as themselves, rather than as characters in funny costumes. All are intended, in large part, to help the audience develop an attachment to the performers. “Sketch is very tough,” Alterman explained. “It’s hard for a show to live or die by how funny each individual sketch is.”

Jargowsky, characterizing Comedy Central’s priorities and proclivities from the producer’s end, explained that “when I go to pitch them on a workplace comedy, they’ll ask really specific questions, like, What is the characters’ relationship to their work? Are they successful? Why do they hang out with each other?” There’s good reason for this, he said: “When you pitch a movie, you’re telling a story, but when you pitch a TV show, you’re kind of describing a game like chess, where the characters are the pieces. Let’s have a rook that moves this way and a bishop who moves that way — but what if a knight showed up? You’re creating this interlocked network of gears that you can wind up and, if you’ve done it right, you have a comedic perpetual-motion machine.”

As for Trevor Noah, the question is whether he can commandeer the perpetual-motion machine already humming along at “The Daily Show” without causing it to jam up. At Cobb’s, after some more small talk backstage, Alterman headed to a reserved table downstairs, ordered a drink and waited for Noah to appear. When he took the stage, it was clear why he’d made a strong candidate. In one extended bit about air travel, he combined expert physical comedy, virtuoso accent changes and Seinfeldian minutiae dissection before taking a bold political turn: A string of jokes about terrorism and outbreak scares culminated in a knotty line about how, before the recent Ebola epidemic, “Muslims used to be the blacks of the skies.”

Soon afterward, Noah managed to wring painful laughs from the killing of Walter Scott, the unarmed black motorist whom a police officer fired at eight times in South Carolina. Noah rejected any suggestion that the officer feared for his life, emphasizing how Scott had been running away: “Did the cop have a fear of abandonment?” It was easy to imagine the bit going viral, with scant modification, as a “Daily Show” segment. Alterman leaned over to me and said, “I’m glad he went there.”

Other aspects of the revamped “Daily Show” are harder to picture, because Noah, and Comedy Central, have yet to invent them. “We have to get into a higher-frequency relationship with ‘The Daily Show’ than we have,” Flannigan said. “The audience, and their phones, demand it. When the show was created, it was a reflection of a 24-hour cable-news cycle. Now the reaction to news is near real-time,” so “we’ll have to be producing content for those platforms when it happens, engaging throughout the day, and night, and weekend. It has to be a multiplatform property, and that’s going to look very different from a 22-minute TV show that we just chop up and redistribute online.”

Several weeks before Noah’s gig at Cobb’s, he began clocking in regularly at the “Daily Show” offices in Manhattan, pitching in during writers’ room meetings and watching Stewart at work. “It’s the apprentice training with the master,” Noah said. He cautioned me not to extrapolate what he’d be like as a host from his performance that night. “Doing stand-up and hosting a show are two very different things.”

Figuring out the right way forward for “The Daily Show,” and for the network, would take time, and it would take error. “That’s been the biggest thing every single media outlet has been facing,” Noah said. “How do you tap into this new world that seems to have no rules and no structure?”

Pondering this question later, Flannigan put it another way: “We’re prepared to do a lot of flailing.”

Starvation Timetable in a Pandemic

Starvation is a real threat during an extended pandemic, but it is very hard to predict when and where it will start, researchers report in an unusual new study.

A severe outbreak could lead to widespread starvation as food distribution breaks down. A pandemic could leave too few farmhands, truck drivers and warehouse workers healthy enough to work, along with dwindling numbers of people available to maintain the electric grid, water supplies, and phone and computer networks.

Researchers at EcoHealth Alliance[http://www.ecohealthalliance.org/], a New York research group, used mathematical models[http://link.springer.com.proxy.bc.edu/article/10.1007/s13412-015-0275-3] to gauge the effects under various scenarios. Their study was published this month in The Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences.

Assuming a pandemic hit the United States in seasonal waves over at least two years and caused work absenteeism averaging 20 percent, rather than substantial deaths, almost no one would starve after three months, the researchers concluded.

In a little over a year, however, half the country would be starving, said Andrew G. Huff, a specialist in food supply protection and co-author of the new study.

The 1918 Spanish flu[http://www.britannica.com.proxy.bc.edu/event/influenza-pandemic-of-1918-1919] is the closest historical parallel, and death by starvation was not widespread in the United States then, Dr. Huff said. But he noted that it did occur in a few remote areas, was common in Alaskan Inuit villages, and was part of a broad crisis in parts of Europe torn by World War I.

Although starvation resulting from Ebola was widely predicted in West Africa last year, especially in quarantined rural areas, it was averted by aid agencies distributing food.

But in a worldwide pandemic, Dr. Huff noted, “there is no one to bail other countries out.”

Ben Carson Assails Foes for Playing Down Race in Charleston Shooting

Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is running for president, accused his Republican rivals on Tuesday of tap-dancing around the issue of race in the wake of the Charleston, S.C., shooting.

In the week since nine black churchgoers were killed in a church there, the Republican presidential candidates have struggled to find the appropriate language to describe the attack.

Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas described it as an accident. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania suggested it was an assault on religion. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said that spirituality was the salve for racism. And Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who has not yet officially announced his candidacy, said the motives behind the attack were a police matter.

In some of the most provocative remarks about race made by a presidential hopeful so far, Mr. Carson said Tuesday that a more direct approach was needed.

“Let’s call this sickness what it is, so we can get on with the healing,” Mr. Carson said in a statement released by his campaign. “There are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who dare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of offending a particular segment of the electorate.”

Comparing racism to Ebola, Mr. Carson argued that the epidemic of racism could not be cured if the problem was not identified early enough.

“Let’s not delude ourselves here,” Mr. Carson said, noting that young people take their cues from political leaders. “If we teach them it is O.K. to deny racism exists, even when it’s plainly staring them in the face, then we will perpetuate this sickness into the next generation and the next.”

Mr. Carson suggested that his political opponents were seeking to score points by averting their eyes from racism and that it was time to abandon “political expediency” and face the facts.

Seven weeks after the World Health Organization declared Liberia to be free of the Ebola virus, the country's deputy health minister said the body of a 17-year-old man had tested positive for the disease. The deputy minister, Tolbert Nyenswah, who also heads Liberia's Ebola response, said Monday that the teenager had died Wednesday in Nedowein, a town close to Liberia's international airport, and was given a safe burial the next day. He said the man was not tested until after he died. It was not known how he had contracted the disease. Mr. Nyenswah said the case was being investigated, but that people should not panic because there were no other known cases in Liberia. The W.H.O. declared Liberia to be Ebola-free on May 9 after the country went 42 days without reporting a case. The virus, which has killed more than 11,100 people in the current outbreak, has lingered in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Despite talks that went down to the wire, Greece defaulted on a major debt payment [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/europe/greece-alex-tsipras-debt-emergency-bailout.html]. And divisions in the country were intense over a coming referendum on whether to accept more painful reforms or leave the euro.

2. An Indonesian military plane transporting relatives of service members crashed in a residential neighborhood [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/asia/indonesian-military-plane-crashes-into-medan.html] on the island of Sumatra. All 113 aboard were killed, and casualties on the ground seemed likely.

3. The Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, joined President Obama in announcing agreements to address climate change [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/americas/us-and-brazil-agree-on-climate-change-actions.html]. Separately, China pledged to halt the growth in its carbon emissions [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/asia/china-carbon-emissions-climate-change.html].

4. Good news: Misty Copeland [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/arts/dance/misty-copeland-is-promoted-to-principal-dancer-at-american-ballet-theater.html] became the first African-American ballerina to be named principal dancer by American Ballet Theater, one of the most prestigious companies in the U.S.

5. The international B.D.S. campaign against Israel (boycott, divest and sanction) gained a powerful supporter. The United Church of Christ, [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/united-church-of-christ-to-divest-israel-to-aid-palestinians.html] one of the largest Protestant denominations in the U.S., embraced the effort with a synod vote of 508 to 125.

6. Chris Christie [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/us/politics/chris-christie-presidential-campaign.html], the brash N.J. governor, announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. “There is one thing you will know for sure,” he said. “I say what I mean and I mean what I say.”

7. The Women’s World Cup semifinal [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/sports/soccer/at-womens-world-cup-us-scouts-germany-with-an-inside-source.html] pits the No. 2-ranked U.S. team against top-ranked Germany (7 p.m. Eastern, Fox). The winner will face Japan or England in Sunday’s final.

8. Liberia went back on Ebola alert [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/africa/liberia-ebola-epidemic.html], after a teenager who died over the weekend was found to have had the disease. “The Ebola fight is not over but we must not lose hope,” said the country’s minister of health.

9. In Tehran, students unfurled scrolls [http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=71990] with what they said were millions of signatures from opponents of international inspections of Iran’s military sites. In Vienna, negotiators trying to navigate such complexities in a nuclear deal extended talks to July 7 [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks.html].

10. The Vatican released Pope Francis’ itinerary [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/nyregion/pope-francis-united-states-visit.html] for his visit to the U.S. in late September. Highlights: meeting President Obama and speaking to Congress, saying Mass at Madison Square Garden and addressing the United Nations General Assembly, and wrapping up in Philadelphia.

11. Recreational marijuana [http://time.com/money/3938535/free-marijuana-oregon-portland/] is legal in Oregon as of midnight, local time. Celebrations include at least two pot giveaways. “This is more than free weed,” one announcement says, adding, “This is history in the making!”

12. NASA released these images of recent solar activity, created using a wavelenth of extreme ultraviolet light. It shows a powerful eruption called a coronal mass ejection, and the reorganization of the area afterward.

Each Friday through Aug. 14 we are posing a simple question to teenagers: What interested you most in The Times this week?

Answering it enters students in our Sixth Annual Summer Reading Contest[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/the-sixth-annual-new-york-times-summer-reading-contest/], for which we choose weekly favorites.

Below, Bryson Wiese’s[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/summer-reading-contest-week-1-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-2/?comments#permid=15229606] winning essay from our first week[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/summer-reading-contest-week-1-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-2/], on Caitlyn Jenner, Rachel Dolezal and attempts to label identities in “airtight boxes.”

We’ve also posted a list of runners-up and honorable mentions, which we’ll continue to do all summer long.

Students impressed us with their thoughtfulness and with the variety of pieces they selected — from science fiction to student loans and smoking in China. But without a doubt, Caitlyn Jenner and transgender rights stood out as the most popular topics.

Thank you for participating, and, remember, any teenager anywhere in the world can enter any week by writing about anything that appeared in The Times in 2015.

The Misguided-ness Inherent in Every Attempt to Establish Airtight Boxes of Self, by Bryson Wiese[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/summer-reading-contest-week-1-what-interested-you-most-in-the-times-this-week-2/?comments#permid=15229606]

As a progressive millennial, I recently celebrated Caitlyn Jenner’s transition from Bruce Jenner to transgender icon.

Yet reading about Rachel Dolezal this week, I have found myself struggling to answer a question posed by the conservative blogosphere: If a man can feel female on the inside, why can’t a white and Native American woman such as Ms. Dolezal identify as black because she feels that way?

Although the question’s intent was snarky, intended to highlight the hypocrisy of the Left and the folly of transgender individuals, it did give me pause. Like gender, race is both a biological and social construct. Isn’t it possible that Ms. Dolezal, who has an adopted black brother, identifies with a race that is not her biological one?

While Ms. Dolezal should not have lied about her race, she is in the end a victim of the same society that has made Caitlyn Jenner an anomaly. As we wade deeper into the murkiness surrounding affirmative action, transgender rights, and a myriad identity issues, it becomes clearer that we must acknowledge the misguidedness inherent in every attempt to establish airtight boxes of self. Characterizations that leave no room for ambiguity will inevitably leave some out – whether it is Ms. Jenner or Ms. Donezal or even Miley Cyrus, who said in May that she views herself as genderqueer. Until we shift our perceptions of identity, Ms. Jenner and Ms. Dolezal will not be the last to fall victim to labels.

New Cases of Ebola Put an End to Liberia's Status as Virus-Free

MONROVIA, Liberia -- More than a month after Liberia was declared free of Ebola, at least two new cases have emerged, the first discovered when the body of a 17-year-old boy tested positive for the virus, officials said Tuesday.

The World Health Organization declared Liberia Ebola-free on May 9, a landmark moment in the country, which has suffered more deaths from the epidemic than any other.

But on Tuesday, Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy minister for health, announced at a news conference here in the capital that a new case had emerged.

It occurred in a small town just outside Monrovia. The family of Abraham Memaigar, 17, who died over the weekend, called a burial team that took swabs of the body and sent them to a laboratory. It confirmed that the boy had been infected by the virus.

On Tuesday, an Ebola response team exhumed the body and had blood drawn for a more precise swab test. That test also came back positive.

Dr. Moses Massaquoi, the case manager for the response team, said the blood test was necessary because investigators could not find the source of the infection and were trying to determine whether it was an ''isolated outbreak or new strain of the virus.''

Late Tuesday, a person connected to Abraham tested positive for Ebola, and tests of two other people were inconclusive, Dr. Massaquoi said.

Thirty-three people who had contact with the teenager were isolated in their homes and were being monitored, he said. Three people will be sent to a treatment unit here Wednesday, he said.

''The Ebola fight is not over, but we must not lose hope,'' said Dr. Bernice Dahn, Liberia's newly appointed minister of health. She contended that the quick response to Abraham's case, including the rapid testing and confirmation that the boy had the virus, demonstrated Liberia's preparedness to deal with another outbreak.

Liberia has recorded close to 5,000 lives lost to the virus.

The country reactivated an Ebola treatment unit at a time when the facilities, built with the help of the United States military, had stood empty and Liberia was beginning to close them.

Mr. Nyenswah said it was not yet known whether the infection came from Guinea or Sierra Leone, West African neighbors that still have small numbers of new Ebola cases.

Abraham, who sold used clothes at a local market, fell ill at his mother's house a week before his death, experiencing fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

Abraham's father, James S. Memaigar, 49, a shoe salesman, said a local clinic had told him just three days before his son's death that Abraham had malaria. The clinic had sent him home with a handful of tablets, Mr. Memaigar said.

Abraham died Sunday in his father's home in a community known as Smell No Taste, a few miles from his mother's home and a short distance from Liberia's international airport and the Firestone rubber plantation.

Mr. Memaigar had contacted the burial team and dragged his son's body out of his room on a mattress. Abraham was buried the same day by an Ebola burial team in an overgrown cemetery a short distance from the house.

Dr. Dahn said investigators were trying to determine how the boy had become infected.

MONROVIA, Liberia — Three new cases of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] have emerged in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] since the country was declared free of the virus on May 9, highlighting the continuing threat of viral outbreaks in West Africa. The Liberian government said it was tracing scores of people who had recent contact with the three patients.

Officials have yet to determine the source of the infections, whether they are related, or whether they involve a new strain of the virus or a re-emergence of a known strain.

“We’re looking at all possibilities,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said his agency was assisting the Liberian government.

The government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/ellen_johnson_sirleaf/index.html?inline=nyt-per] took several precautionary steps on Thursday to help head off any further spread of the virus. The Health Ministry said it expected to have thermal cameras set up at the main international airport by the end of the day, to spot travelers who are running fevers.

The first of the three new cases was not identified until the patient, a 17-year-old boy from Margibi County, had died. Tests of samples taken from his corpse confirmed on Sunday that he was infected with the virus.

The Liberian government is treating the second and third cases as confirmed, but Dr. Frieden said that laboratory results for those cases were indeterminate or only very weakly positive for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

The deputy minister of health, Tolbert Nyenswah, said at a news conference here Thursday that the new outbreak was “localized” and “contained in the community of Needowein.” He said that residents were cooperating with the authorities, and that prevention and control measures were being strengthened across the country.

But the third case came from a different area: Paynesville, on the edge of the capital.

Mr. Nyenswah said the second and third new Ebola patients, and six other possible cases, were isolation in a government-run Ebola treatment center that was previously operated by Doctors Without Borders, an international medical charity.

“The comeback of Ebola in Liberia was not unexpected, with the virus still active in the region,” Peter Graaff, the head of the United Nations emergency response team for Ebola, wrote in a statement. With the onset of the rainy season, when illnesses with similar initial symptoms to Ebola are common, Mr. Graaff said, “the real test of how well the system still works will be in the next few weeks.”

Experts said constant vigilance would be needed. “There is growing evidence that Ebola is and will be endemic in West Africa, and that the system is vulnerable to other catastrophes,” said Aitor Sanchez-Lacomba, the International Rescue Committee country director for Liberia. “The health system doesn’t need an eradication approach; it needs to be prepared. We need to ensure that all health facilities and communities in West Africa have long-term prevention and rapid response capability for a wide range of hazards.”

Mr. Nyenswah insisted at the news conference that the government had a handle on the latest cases. “Things are basically under our control,” he said, “and we are taking charge of this.”

Sheri Fink contributed reporting from New York.

In an assessment[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/03-july-2015-liberia/en/] posted on its website, the W.H.O.

said that all of the contacts of the teenager were being closely monitored and that two of them had already tested positive for the virus, confirming what the Liberian health authorities had reported last week. The organization also said it was dispatching epidemiologists and other specialists to ensure that the victim’s hometown “is fully involved in identifying contacts and preventing any further disease spread.”

Contrary to what was previously believed, the bacterium responsible for the Black Death probably caused small outbreaks of lung disease for thousands of years before it evolved its better-known bubonic form, according to a new genetic study[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/ncomms/2015/150630/ncomms8487/full/ncomms8487.html].

Also, only one added gene was needed to turn the Yersinia pestis bacterium into a killer, and only one tiny mutation in that gene was needed to give it two ways of spreading — by cough or by flea bite[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/injury/insect-bites-and-stings/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], said Wyndham W. Lathem, a microbiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine who oversaw a team inserting genes into ancestral versions of Y. pestis in mice.

During last year’s Ebola outbreak in West Africa, some feared that the disease, which spread through blood, vomit and feces, could become airborne.

Plague[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/plague/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] bacteria are very different from Ebola virus, Dr. Lathem said, “but this shows that new modes of transmission can occur through very small changes, so you need to keep an eye out.”

The study was published last week by Nature Communications.

Y. pestis evolved from an ancestor, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, that still circulates in European rodents but causes only mild intestinal illness in humans. Y. pestis emerged only 5,000 to 20,000 years ago, and developing twin modes of transmission helped it explode into the sixth-century Plague of Justinian[http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/01/29/267598868/ancient-plagues-dna-revived-from-a-1-500-year-old-tooth], the 14th-century Black Death[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml] and epidemics in China[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/plague/history/] well into the early 20th century.

The important new gene, Dr. Lathem said, helped the bacteria make an enzyme that broke up the fibrous blood clots that the body’s defenses formed around them — in much the same way that enzyme injections[https://www.heart.org/idc/groups/ahaecc-public/@wcm/@hcm/@gwtg/documents/downloadable/ucm_431151.pdf] break up blood clots in stroke victims.

The New York Times announced on Tuesday a broad revamping of its video operation and said it would seek new leadership for what it described as an increasingly vital part of the newsroom.

The video department’s current chief, Bruce Headlam, will take on another senior role in the newsroom, the newspaper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, said in a memo to the staff. Rebecca Howard, who led the business side of the operation, will leave the company “to focus on emerging media platforms,” Kinsey Wilson, who leads the Times’s companywide digital product and technology operations, said in another memo.

Under Mr. Headlam, Mr. Baquet said, the video unit became an integral component of the paper’s coverage on topics including the North Charleston, S.C., police shooting and the Ebola crisis. The latter was part of the coverage that earned The Times a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting this year.

That success, Mr. Baquet said, “has prompted us to become even more ambitious and undertake a broad rethinking of our video operation, including what we produce and how we distribute it.” The paper will search for “new leadership with deep experience in video, who can help us design a broad editorial and business strategy for a video operation that can be even bigger and richer,” he said.

In the interim, Steve Duenes, a masthead editor who has overseen graphics, will run the video department. Zander Baron, director of video operations, will run the business side of the operation. At the same time, Alex MacCallum, an assistant managing editor for audience development, will examine the structure of the video organization.

W.H.O. Is Not Equipped to Handle a Crisis Like Ebola, Report Says

UNITED NATIONS — More than a year after the Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/world/africa/ebola-coverage-pulitzer.html] began tearing through three of the world’s most fragile countries, the World Health Organization[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/world/africa/cuts-at-who-hurt-response-to-ebola-crisis.html] remains unfit to handle a public health emergency, an independent panel concluded in a blistering report released on Tuesday.

“W.H.O. does not currently possess the capacity or organizational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response,” the panel said in its report.

While the agency itself has acknowledged the need for change, the panel added, “It will need to be held accountable to ensure that this transformation is achieved.”

The panel faulted the agency for being sluggish, financially unprepared and overly reliant on “good diplomacy.” It pointed to a lack of “independent and courageous decision making by the director general,” Dr. Margaret Chan, in the early days[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/world/leader-of-world-health-organization-defends-ebola-response.html] of the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] epidemic.

The report urged the agency’s regional and country representatives to be independent and ready to speak out against recalcitrant governments that do not take sufficient action on their own. And it faulted donor countries for stripping the agency’s funding, urging them to contribute immediately to a “contingency fund” designed to respond to disease outbreaks.

The panel, led by Dame Barbara Stocking, the former head of the aid organization Oxfam, did not call for personnel changes. But it said a rapid overhaul of the organization was needed.

It said that W.H.O. leaders should have declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency much sooner than they did, and that the delay stemmed in part from not wanting to challenge governments worried about negative economic and trade consequences. The W.H.O. declared Ebola a global health emergency only in August 2014, after it had already killed 1,000 people.

“There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action,” the 28-page report said.

Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. To rebuild the health systems of the three countries over the next two years, the W.H.O. estimates that it needs more than $2 billion. A donor conference is scheduled for Friday.

The W.H.O. said that it welcomed the report and had already begun to make some of the recommended changes, including the creation of “a global health emergency work force and the contingency fund to ensure the necessary resources are available to mount an initial response.”

Dr. Chan has previously conceded that she waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern.

Dr. Joanne Liu, president of the international arm of Doctors without Borders, the medical aid group that rang the alarm on Ebola far earlier than the W.H.O., wondered aloud about the tangible impact of the panel’s report.

“The question is how will this translate into real action on the ground in future outbreaks?” she posted[https://twitter.com/JoanneLiu_MSF/status/618452234540589056] on Twitter.
