Question:

As a survivor of viral hemorrhagic fever myself, I would like to know why no one seems to consider the future outbreaks that will be caused by the policy of burial rather than cremation? I know cremation is not traditional, but burial virtually ensures future outbreaks.

A

Burial, especially in a body bag or coffin, is just as effective at ending transmission as cremation. The danger with Ebola is in handling the corpse of a person who died recently. Once it is buried, the danger is largely over, unless someone digs it up quickly. The virus attacks living cells and does not go on reproducing indefinitely. It has never been shown to get into drinking water.

Once a body is buried, bacteria, which are able to digest dead flesh, quickly overwhelm the corpse and cause it to rot. It is a common myth that dead bodies from floods or tsunamis are dangerous. They are disgusting, and you wouldn’t want to rub bacteria from a rotting corpse in an open cut, but the odors they give off are not infectious — just stinky.

It is extremely difficult to get people to change their burial practices, which are rooted in tradition and religion. In various African countries for which statistics were compiled by the Cremation Society of Great Britain, only 3 to 7 percent of the dead are cremated. In much of Africa, traditional beliefs include burial. In colonial times, the chief missionary religions were Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism, all of which opposed cremation for centuries in the belief that bodies should be as intact as possible for the afterlife.

In Asia, cremation is very common. It is the norm for Buddhists, Hindus, Jains, Shintoists and Sikhs. In Japan, more than 99 percent of bodies are cremated, and rates are over 80 percent in India, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere. In China, almost 50 percent are cremated.

In the United States, customs have changed. The cremation rate was about 4 percent in 1960; it is now about 40 percent, according to the Cremation Association of North America.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Collateral benefit, collateral damage.

Will the U.S.-led airstrikes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/middleeast/us-isis-syria.html] to take out Islamic State targets aid Syrian civilians?

Our correspondent Ben Hubbard says that’s possible, particularly for those who are under direct assault from Islamic State fighters.

“For a week now, they have been attacking Kurdish villages near the Turkish border, causing a huge refugee exodus,” Mr. Hubbard says.

“If the U.S. hits them there, that will help Kurdish forces.”

The strikes might work against civilians in other areas, like the eastern city of Raqqa, where the Islamic State has been the de facto government for about a year.

“If the U.S. strikes also disrupt trade routes and damage infrastructure, it is unclear who will fix them,” Mr. Hubbard says. “The strikes could well create a new vacuum.”

“And, of course,” he says, “there is the possibility that U.S. strikes could kill civilians.”

• Outside help.

Scientists at the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention say the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is worsening,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/health/ebola-cases-could-reach-14-million-in-4-months-cdc-estimates.html] with the potential for a sharp increase in cases over the coming months.

Averting that will largely be up to international organizations, says Adam Nossiter, our West Africa bureau chief.

“That is because there is almost no viable institutional structures in the West African countries where the epidemic is flourishing,” he says.

Health care facilities in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea either don’t exist or are dysfunctional, Mr. Nossiter says.

“All three nations,” he adds, “have been hollowed out by years of high-level corruption, civil war and autocracy.”

In Sierra Leone, the authorities were reduced to trying a three-day lockdown[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-reaches-final-day-of-ebola-lockdown/2014/09/21/bda83dec-4198-11e4-8042-aaff1640082e_story.html] to contain the disease — “evidence of the desperation of these governments,” Mr. Nossiter says.

“They feel they have to do something,” he says, “but in practice the means at their disposal are ineffectual.”

• A creative solution.

It might seem that the vision of fashion designers and the profit motive of investors would be incompatible.

But the accessories company Jimmy Choo Ltd., aiming to become the first stand-alone luxury footwear brand to trade publicly[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/luxury-shoe-brand-jimmy-choo-to-list-shares-in-london], has a time-tested strategy.

It has a “tiered offering,” says Vanessa Friedman, The Times’s fashion director.

The creative director is able to indulge a desire for fashion-forward runway-type looks — “the extreme heels and very decorated shoes,” she says.

And the brand — largely owned by private equity firms for the past decade — also has offerings with a broader appeal, Ms. Friedman says.

There are “trend-driven basics such as espadrilles or ornate sneakers,” as well as a line of signature midheeled pumps, biker boots and ballet flats, which “are always available and give customers security,” Ms. Friedman says.

With that range, she says, “you satisfy as many needs as possible on both sides.”

Question:

I’ve been an ardent supporter of the United Nations but as the WORLD descends deeper into chaos, i.e., the reconstitution of the Soviet Union, Israel and Hamas destroying each other, with unrest and war growing on the African continent and as America begins ANOTHER endless war in the Middle East, as China and Japan increase the rhetoric against each other, as North Korea increasingly threatens the U.S. and South Korea, I wonder if the U.N. is still relevant.

A.

The United States ambassador to the United Nations said containing the Islamic State and containing the Ebola outbreak “illustrate ​the founding purpose of​ the United​ Nation​s” in that they both require transnational cooperation and burden-sharing among nations. The proof is in the pudding. Certainly the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has identified Ebola as a priority for the organization. He has established an emergency mission[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/security-council-unanimously-passes-ebola-resolution.html], to be based in West Africa. Today he appointed the mission chief: Anthony Banbury.

Fresh Graves Point to Undercount of Ebola Toll

CORRECTION APPENDEDFREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- The gravedigger hacked at the cemetery's dense undergrowth, clearing space for the day's Ebola victims. A burial team, in protective suits torn with gaping holes, arrived with fresh bodies.

The backs of the battered secondhand vans carrying the dead were closed with twisted, rusting wire. Bodies were dumped in new graves, and a worker in a short-sleeve shirt carried away the stretcher, wearing only plastic bags over his hands as protection. The outlook for the day at King Tom Cemetery was busy.

''We will need much more space,'' said James C. O. Hamilton, the chief gravedigger, as a colleague cleared the bush with his machete.

The Ebola epidemic is spreading rapidly in Sierra Leone's densely packed capital -- and it may already be far worse than the authorities acknowledge.

Since the beginning of the outbreak more than six months ago, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry reported only 10 confirmed Ebola deaths here in Freetown, the capital of more than one million people, and its suburbs as of Sunday -- a hopeful sign that this city, unlike the capital of neighboring Liberia, had been relatively spared the ravages of the outbreak.

But the bodies pouring in to the graveyard tell a different story. In the last eight days alone, 110 Ebola victims have been buried at King Tom Cemetery, according to the supervisor, Abdul Rahman Parker, suggesting an outbreak that is much more deadly than either the government or international health officials have announced.

''I'm working with the burial team, and the first question I ask them is, 'Are they Ebola-positive?' '' said Mr. Parker, adding that the figures were based on medical certificates that he had seen himself. The deaths are carefully recorded by name and date in a notebook headed ''Ebola Burials.''

A burial team supervisor who drove up with fresh bodies echoed Mr. Parker's assertion. ''Any body we collect is a positive case,'' said Sorie Kessebeh. ''All the bodies that we are bringing in are positive.''

Beyond the many worrisome trends in the Ebola epidemic seizing parts of West Africa -- the overflowing hospitals, the presence of the disease in crowded cities, the deaths of scores of health workers trying to help -- another basic problem has stymied attempts to contain the disease: No one seems to know how bad the outbreak really is.

The World Health Organization acknowledged weeks ago that despite its efforts to tally the thousands of cases in the region, the official statistics probably ''vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak.''

Here in Sierra Leone, the government just finished an aggressive national lockdown to get a handle on the epidemic, ordering the entire country to stay indoors for three days as an army of volunteers went door to door, explaining the dangers of the virus and trying to root out hidden pockets of illness.

Still, the Health Ministry spokesman insisted that the epidemic was not as bad as the flow of bodies at the cemetery suggested.

''It is not possible that all of them are Ebola-related deaths,'' said Sidie Yahya Tunis, the Health Ministry spokesman, saying the corpses included people who died of other causes.

But as the cemetery records show, the challenge facing the government might be of a different magnitude than previously thought.

The majority of the recent deaths recorded at the cemetery were young people -- young adults, people in early middle age, or children -- with very few elderly people on the list. Several of the deaths also occurred in a concentrated area, sometimes in the same house, suggesting that a virulent infection had struck.

At the house of Marion Seisay -- the third name on the list -- her son acknowledged she was a secretary at Wilberforce Hospital, had died of Ebola and was buried on Sept. 14. The house was now under quarantine, with some of its eight residents lingering on the cinder-block porch.

''The way my Mummy died was pathetic,'' said the son, Michael Foday, clearly frustrated by the quarantine. ''How do you expect us to get food?''

Other houses in Wilberforce Barracks, the village-like compound surrounding the hospital, were on the list of the dead and placed under quarantine, marked off from the surrounding jumble of shacks and cinder-block houses by a thin line of red or blue string.

In one of them, the house of Momoh Lomeh, the residents said that a total of five people who lived there had died of Ebola -- yet four of them did not even appear on the cemetery list. At another, the house of Andrew Mansoray, a family member said that the disease had been ruthless and unrelenting.

''It wouldn't stop,'' Abdul R. Kallon said of the diarrhea that Mr. Mansoray, his brother-in-law, had endured before dying. ''They took him to the hospital, and they wouldn't let him out.''

At another six households on the cemetery supervisor's list of the dead, residents gave similar accounts. One family said the victim had definitely died of Ebola, while five others described Ebola-like symptoms -- vomiting, diarrhea, fever -- though none had been given an official cause of death.

International health experts here had no explanation for the striking discrepancy between the government's tally of the dead in the capital and the cemetery crew's statistics. Several of them noted the general confusion surrounding official statistics here from the beginning, with one leading international health official saying: ''We don't know exactly what is going on.''

But nobody disputed that things appear to be getting worse. The W.H.O. has shown a sharp increase in new cases in Freetown in recent weeks, rising from almost none early in the summer to more than 50 during the week of Sept. 14.

Various models of the growth of the epidemic here ''all show an exponential increase,'' said Peter H. Kilmarx, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team in Sierra Leone. ''The conditions are amenable to Ebola spread.''

The goal of the government's national lockdown was to reach every household in the country, and officials claimed success in doing so on Monday, saying that progress had been made in the fight against the disease.

But the exhaustion of the Ebola gravediggers at King Tom Cemetery, who dig as many as 16 graves a day, indicated that the disease was far from being contained.

''It's a herculean task,'' said Mr. Hamilton, the chief gravedigger. ''It's only out of patriotism that we are doing it.''

The Ebola victims were buried in an expanding stretch of fresh muddy graves under a giant cotton tree, and the makeshift arrangements are seen as a looming threat by the residents of the slum next to it. No barrier stops the pigs rooting in the adjoining trash field from digging in the fresh Ebola graves, which residents say they often do.

''We have creatures in the community, and they dig in the graves,'' said Henry S. Momoh, who lives in the adjoining slum, which residents call Kolleh Town. ''They are burying the Ebola patients in there, but not in the proper manner.''

Five yards from where the new graves begin, a well-used path connects the slum to the main road. Residents all use it, passing close to the freshly dug graves, and are frightened by the intensifying activity in the cemetery.

''Since last month, it's every day, any minute and hour, and often, they are coming'' to bury the Ebola dead, said Desmond Kamara, a police officer.

A cloudy stream drains from the area of the new graves into the slum, further frightening the residents.

''We are at risk, big risk,'' said Ousman Kamara, a resident. ''We have made many complaints.''

But the bodies, he said, keep coming.

''Even at night,'' he said. ''You stand here, and you see them coming.''

Correction: September 25, 2014, Thursday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about the strong possibility that the number of Ebola victims has been undercounted in Sierra Leone referred incorrectly, in some editions, to a possible victim of Ebola whose body is shown being removed from a house in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The body is that of a man, not a woman.

James Hamilton, a gravedigger burying Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, had this prediction: ''We will need much more space.''

U.N. Food Program Warns of Cuts to Its Relief Efforts

UNITED NATIONS — Just months after a United Nations Security Council resolution pressed Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/middleeast/un-security-council-authorizes-strengthened-syria-aid.html] to open several of its border crossings to humanitarian aid convoys, money has dried up and allotments of grain and lentils are set to shrink significantly next month, the head of the World Food Program said Monday.

“We have increased access, but because of a lack of resources it’s going to force us to cut rations in October and again in November,” Ertharin Cousin, the head of the agency, said in an interview on the eve of an annual meeting of world leaders at the General Assembly. The ration packets for Syrians living inside the country will be cut by 40 percent, she said, and what they get is bound to be less nutritious.

The cuts are equally severe for Syrians who have fled the country. Refugees in Jordan and Lebanon will receive smaller food vouchers to use in local markets in October, and fewer than half of the 100,000 Syrian refugees who now get food aid in Egypt will be served. The agency faces a roughly $350 million shortfall in its programs for Syria by the end of the year.

The cuts mirror already drastic reductions in food aid for refugees worldwide. Funding shortfalls — combined with ballooning needs — have forced the agency to cut rations to displaced people in Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Ms. Cousin said the agency relies on donor funding, which she said had decreased across the board. (The one exception is a $500 million tranche from Saudi Arabia for aid to newly displaced Iraqis, including for food.)

Demand worldwide continues to grow with new crises. The rapid spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa stands to increase food needs sharply in the three worst affected countries. Ms. Cousin estimated that over the next three months, the World Food Program would have to feed an additional one million people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including those who lived in communities where markets had closed because of the outbreak.

The funding shortfall in Syria is particularly stark because efforts to reach needy people there were a pitched battle in the Security Council for months. The United Nations repeatedly raised the alarm about the millions of people who were beyond the reach of humanitarian agencies because the government in Damascus refused to let aid convoys into rebel-held areas. In July, the Council adopted a resolution[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/middleeast/un-security-council-authorizes-strengthened-syria-aid.html] that authorized aid convoys to cross into Syrian territory without prior approval by the authorities.

Only three of the four border crossings authorized by the Council measure have been used; the fourth, on the Iraq-Syria border, is impassable because of fighting nearby.

Still, since the resolution, Ms. Cousin said, access has widened significantly, with her agency poised to reach 4.3 million Syrians in September. The money has not kept pace.

In 2013, the World Food Program collected $4.4 billion[http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/research/wfp232961.pdf] to reach 80 million people, the vast majority of them women and children; about 13 million of those were civilians displaced in their own countries or abroad.

Correction: September 22, 2014, Monday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money collected by the World Food Program in 2013. It was $4.4 billion, not $4.4 million.

Ebola Cases Could Reach 1.4 Million in 4 Months, C.D.C. Estimates

Yet another set of ominous projections about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was released Tuesday, in a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that gave worst- and best-case estimates for Liberia and Sierra Leone based on computer modeling.

In the worst-case scenario, Liberia and Sierra Leone could have 21,000 cases of Ebola by Sept. 30 and 1.4 million cases by Jan. 20 if the disease keeps following its current trajectory, without effective methods to contain it. These figures take into account the fact that many cases go undetected, and estimate that there are actually 2.5 times as many as reported.

The report does not include figures for Guinea because case counts there have gone up and down in ways that cannot be reliably modeled.

In the best-case model — which assumes that the dead are buried safely and that 70 percent of patients are treated in settings that reduce the risk of transmission — the epidemic in both countries would be “almost ended” by Jan. 20, the report said. It showed the proportion of patients now in such settings as about 18 percent in Liberia and 40 percent in Sierra Leone.

“My gut feeling is, the actions we’re taking now are going to make that worst-case scenario not come to pass,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, said in a telephone interview. “But it’s important to understand that it could happen.”

The World Health Organization published its own revised estimates of the outbreak on Monday, predicting more than 20,000 cases by Nov. 2 if control does not improve. That figure is more conservative than the one from the C.D.C., but the W.H.O. report noted that many cases were unreported and said that without effective help, the three most affected countries would soon be reporting thousands of cases and deaths per week. It said its projections were similar to those from the C.D.C.

The W.H.O. report also, for the first time, raised the possibility that the disease would not be stopped but would become endemic in West Africa, meaning that it could become a constant presence there. The report from the C.D.C. did not discuss that possibility, but it is something that health officials have feared all along, and the reason they say help is needed so quickly.

President Obama’s promise last week to send 3,000 military personnel to Liberia and to build 17 hospitals there, each with 100 beds, were part of the solution, Dr. Frieden said. He said the Defense Department had already delivered parts of a 25-bed unit that will soon be set up to treat health workers who become infected, a safety measure he said was important to help encourage health professionals to volunteer. He added that aid groups were also flooding into the region and setting up treatment centers.

The W.H.O. reported on Wednesday that a new treatment center had just opened in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, with 120 beds for treatment and 30 for triage. Patients were already lined up at the door.

The report from the C.D.C. acknowledged that case counts were rising faster than hospital beds could be provided. It said that in the meantime, different types of treatment would be used, based in homes or community centers, with relatives and others being given protective gear to help keep the disease from spreading.

The United States government is also sending 400,000 kits containing gloves and disinfectant to Liberia to help families take care of patients at home. The kits reflect the recognition that even the most ambitious new program will not be able to add hospital beds fast enough to keep up with the disease.

At least one aid group working in Liberia is already shifting its focus to teaching people about home care and providing materials to help. Ken Isaacs, a vice president of the aid group Samaritan’s Purse, said, “I believe inevitably this is going to move into people’s houses, and the notion of home-based care has to play a more prominent role.” He said there could be 100,000 or more cases by the end of 2014.

“Where are they going to go?” Mr. Isaacs asked. “It’s too late. Nobody’s going to build 100,000 beds.”

Though providing home-care kits may seem like a pragmatic approach, some public health authorities said they were no substitute for beds in isolation or containment wards.

But Dr. Frieden said that home care had been used to help stamp out smallpox in Africa during the 1960s. The caregivers were often people who had survived smallpox themselves and were immune to it. Some experts have suggested that Ebola survivors might also be employed to care for the sick.

New reports show Ebola crisis could grow worse

New figures published by the World Health Organization reveal a far worse outlook than it had previously anticipated for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

In addition to predicting many more cases and deaths, the new report, released on Monday, raises for the first time the possibility that the epidemic will not be brought under control and that the disease will become endemic in West Africa, meaning that it could reach a steady state and become a constant presence there. ‘‘The epidemiologic outlook is bleak,’’ the report said.

If control does not improve now, there will be more than 20,000 cases by Nov. 2, and the numbers of cases and deaths will continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week for months to come, according to the report. The death rate is about 70 percent in each of the heavily affected countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The new estimates were published online in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of more than 50 scientists. An earlier prediction by the W.H.O. was far less dire, saying there might be 20,000 cases in nine months.

So far, there have been 5,843 cases, including 2,803 deaths, with the most cases, 3,022, reported by Liberia. But the scientists say it is likely that many cases have not been detected.

Another set of ominous projections about the epidemic was released on Tuesday, in a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that gave worst- and best-case estimates for Liberia and Sierra Leone based on computer modeling.

In the worst case, Liberia and Sierra Leone could have 21,000 cases of Ebola by Sept. 30 and 1.4 million cases by Jan. 20 if the disease follows its current trajectory, without effective methods to contain it. These figures take into account the fact that many cases go undetected and estimate that there are 2.5 times as many as reported.

‘‘My gut feeling is, the actions we’re taking now are going to make that worst-case scenario not come to pass,’’ said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director. ‘‘But it’s important to understand that it could happen.’’

Although researchers are rushing to produce and test drugs and vaccines, Tuesday’s report says they are unlikely to be available for months — and have not yet been fully tested in humans.

Ebola cases could swell to 1.4 million by January; Worst-case estimates coincide with evidence of many unreported deaths

New projections on the spread of Ebola by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimate that, in the worst case, the disease could strike more than a million people by January if the virus follows its current trajectory with no effective methods to contain it.

In the latest set of ominous projections, a report on Tuesday from the C.D.C. said that Liberia and Sierra Leone could have as many as 21,000 cases of Ebola by Sept. 30 and 1.4 million cases by Jan. 20. These figures take into account the fact that many cases go undetected, and estimate that there are actually 2.5 times as many as reported.

Separately, anecdotal reporting from the region — such as a death list kept by a cemetery supervisor in Sierra Leone — underscores the evidence that large numbers of cases are not being officially recorded. The World Health Organization acknowledged weeks ago that official statistics probably ‘‘vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak.’’

Nor does the C.D.C. report include figures for Guinea, the third country most affected, because case counts there have gone up and down in ways that cannot be reliably modeled.

In the best-case model, which assumes that the dead are buried safely and that 70 percent of patients are treated in settings that reduce the risk of transmission, the epidemic in both countries would be ‘‘almost ended’’ by Jan. 20, the report said. It showed the proportion of patients now in such settings as about 18 percent in Liberia and 40 percent in Sierra Leone.

The current official case count is 5,843, including 2,803 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

The W.H.O. published its own revised estimates of the outbreak on Monday, predicting more than 20,000 cases by Nov. 2 if control did not improve. That figure is more conservative than the one from the C.D.C., but the W.H.O. report noted that many cases were unreported and said that without effective help, the three most affected countries would soon be reporting thousands of cases and deaths per week. It said its projections were similar to those from the C.D.C.

The W.H.O. report also, for the first time, raised the possibility that the disease would not be stopped but would become endemic in West Africa, meaning that it could become a constant presence there. The report from the C.D.C. did not discuss that possibility, but it is something that health officials have feared all along.

President Obama’s promises last week to send 3,000 military personnel to Liberia and to build 17 hospitals there, each with 100 beds, were part of the solution, Dr. Frieden said. He said that the Defense Department had already delivered parts of a 25-bed unit to treat health workers who become infected, and that aid groups were also flooding into the region and setting up treatment centers.

The W.H.O. reported on Wednesday that a new treatment center had just opened in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, with 120 beds for treatment and 30 for triage. Patients were already lined up at the door.

The report from the C.D.C. acknowledged that case counts were rising faster than hospital beds could be provided. It said that in the meantime, different types of treatment would be used, based in homes or community centers, with relatives and others being given protective gear to help keep the disease from spreading.

The United States government is also sending 400,000 kits containing gloves and disinfectant to Liberia to help families take care of patients at home. The kits reflect the recognition that even the most ambitious new program will not be able to add hospital beds fast enough.

In Freetown, the densely packed capital of Sierra Leone, the Ebola epidemic is spreading rapidly, and it may already be far worse than the authorities acknowledge.

Since the beginning of the outbreak more than six months ago, the Sierra Leone Health Ministry had reported only 10 confirmed Ebola deaths in Freetown as of Sunday.

But the bodies pouring in to one Freetown graveyard, the King Tom Cemetery, tell a different story. In the last eight days alone, 110 Ebola victims have been buried there, according to the supervisor, Abdul Rahman Parker.

On a recent day, one gravedigger hacked at the cemetery’s dense undergrowth to clear space for the day’s Ebola victims. A burial team, in protective suits torn with gaping holes, arrived with fresh bodies.

‘‘We will need much more space,’’ said James C.O. Hamilton, the chief gravedigger.

Mr. Parker, who has been working with the burial team, said the first question he asks is, ‘‘Are they Ebola-positive?’’ He said his figures were based on medical certificates that he had seen himself. The deaths are carefully recorded in a notebook headed ‘‘Ebola Burials.’’

Yet no one seems to know how bad the outbreak really is.

In Sierra Leone, the government just finished an aggressive national lockdown to try to get a handle on the epidemic, ordering the entire country to stay indoors for three days as an army of volunteers went door to door, explaining the dangers of the virus and trying to root out hidden pockets of illness.

Still, the Health Ministry spokesman insisted that the epidemic was not as bad as the flow of bodies at the cemetery suggested.

‘‘It is not possible that all of them are Ebola-related deaths,’’ said Sidie Yahya Tunis, the spokesman.

But as the cemetery records show, the challenge facing the government might be of a different magnitude than previously thought. The majority of the recent deaths recorded at the cemetery were younger people, with very few elderly people on the list. Several of the deaths also occurred in a concentrated area, sometimes in the same house.

In one of them, the house of Momoh Lomeh, residents said that a total of five people who lived there had died of Ebola — yet four of them did not even appear on the cemetery list.

At another six households on the list, residents gave similar accounts. One family said the victim had definitely died of Ebola, while five others described Ebola-like symptoms — vomiting, diarrhea, fever — though none had been given an official cause of death.

International health experts here had no explanation for the striking discrepancy between the government’s tally of the dead and the cemetery crew’s statistics, but nobody disputed that things appear to be getting worse. And the exhaustion of the Ebola gravediggers at King Tom Cemetery, who dig as many as 16 graves a day, indicated that the disease was far from being contained.

‘‘It’s a herculean task,’’ said Mr. Hamilton, the gravedigger. ‘‘It’s only out of patriotism that we are doing it.’’

The Ebola victims were buried in an expanding stretch of fresh muddy graves under a giant cotton tree. No barrier stops the pigs rooting in the adjoining trash field from digging in the fresh Ebola graves, which residents say they often do. A cloudy stream drains from the area into the nearby slum.

‘‘We are at risk, big risk,’’ said Ousman Kamara, a resident. ‘‘We have made many complaints.’’

But the bodies, he said, keep coming, day and night.

United Nations General Assembly
Ban Ki-Moon Says U.N. ‘Must Answer the Call’ to Fight Climate Change, Ebola and Extremism

Scolding the powerful and the power-hungry, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, opened the 69th annual session of the General Assembly on Wednesday morning, in a 13-minute speech that rued the state of the world, from the conflict in Ukraine to the bombing of United Nations schools in Gaza to beheadings in Iraq and Syria — all before warning of the Ebola outbreak.

“It has been a terrible year for the principles of the United Nations Charter,” he said. “From barrel bombs to beheadings, from the deliberate starvation of civilians to the assault on hospitals, U.N. shelters and aid convoys, human rights and the rule of law are under attack.”

The annual gathering, expected to draw 140 heads of state and government over the course of the next six days, convenes in the shadow of U.S.-led airstrikes on Syria and Iraq[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/middleeast/us-isis-syria.html] and a swiftly widening disease outbreak in West Africa[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/health/ebola-cases-could-reach-14-million-in-4-months-cdc-estimates.html], one of the most fragile corners of the world.

Mr. Ban was followed by Dilma Rousseff, the president of Brazil, which is customarily the first state to address the hall. She will be followed by President Obama[http://www.nytimes.com/news/un-general-assembly/2014/09/23/president-obama-to-enlist-u-n-in-fight-against-isis/].

The General Assembly Hall reopened this year after a yearlong face-lift [http://www.nytimes.com/news/un-general-assembly/2014/09/24/a-safer-cleaner-united-nations-hall/]to get rid of the grime and smoke that had accumulated since 1952, the year it was built, and to make it more energy efficient.

“This year the horizon of hope is darkened,” Mr. Ban said. “Our hearts and minds are made heavy by unspeakable acts and the deaths of innocents. Cold War ghosts have returned to haunt our times. We have seen so much of the Arab Spring go violently wrong.”

Mr. Ban’s speech was delivered in a mix of English and French.

He made a passionate pitch for women’s rights, which is one of his signature issues. “We cannot fulfill 100 percent of the world’s potential by excluding 50 percent of the world’s people,” he said.

His address referred to the new chasm between Israel and Palestinians, instability in Ukraine, new conflicts in Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the threat of terrorist groups in Mali, Somalia and Nigeria. The extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, he said, have sunk to “new depths of barbarity with each passing day.”

His speech echoed his remarks from Tuesday, when he offered an implicit nod to the United States-led airstrikes on Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/us/politics/us-invokes-defense-of-iraq-in-saying-strikes-on-syria-are-legal.html]. “These extremist groups are a clear threat to international peace and security that requires a multifaceted international response,” he said. “We need decisive action to stop atrocity crimes and frank discussion on what created the threat in the first place.”

He rebuked the world powers that control the Security Council, the most influential organ in the United Nations system, which has been deadlocked on some of the most crucial peace and security issues. Syria has been the most glaring example.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/middleeast/un-security-council-authorizes-strengthened-syria-aid.html] The gulf between Russia — a staunch ally of the government in Damascus — and the West has made consensus impossible. “Continued disunity over Syria has resulted in grave human suffering and loss of credibility for the Council and our institutions.”

He tried to make the case for why the United Nations can be relevant — even necessary. He reminded the assembly that the world was on track to meet ambitious targets to cut poverty and child deaths. He nudged them to come to “meaningful, universal” agreement on climate change[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/asia/obama-at-un-climate-summit-calls-for-vast-international-effort.html].

Mr. Ban saved the issue of fighting Ebola for last. He said the outbreak in West Africa needs a “20-fold surge in care, tracking, transport and equipment.”

He has established an emergency mission to contain the outbreak.

“Today we face a profusion of mounting challenges,” he said. “People are crying out for protection from greed and inequality. The United Nations must answer the call.”

Times Insider
Changes in Newsroom Leadership
INSIDER STAFF

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
Executive Editor Dean Baquet announced changes to the masthead today. Here is his memo to the staff.

As I thought about the kind of leadership The New York Times will need in these next crucial two or three years — as we grow our digital muscles while maintaining our commitment to the majesty of print — it became clear that our traditional masthead structure no longer works. We have too much work to do to have all the decisions made by a couple of editors in a corner office. Our goals are to get more readers, to continue to stretch the boundaries of story-telling in a mobile world that allows us to do things we never imagined, to take on ever larger targets with our investigative reporting, and to expand our ability to cover a world in turmoil.

To lead that effort I’ve decided to appoint five editors who have already proven they can run stories that take on big institutions, who have covered a world of war, and proven they can lead with humanity. I’m retiring the Managing Editor title in favor of four deputy executive editors who are as excited about the future as I am, and I’m giving Tom Bodkin the title of Creative Director to acknowledge the broad role he plays in the newsroom and the whole company. Together this team will draw on what we have that none of our competitors can match —- the depth and quality of our journalism, from on-the-ground reporting in the middle of the Ebola crisis, to the most sophisticated analysis from Wall Street, to brilliant insight into the world of art.

SUSAN CHIRA will lead the news report on all platforms. Alissa Rubin said there was no one better on the phone in a time of crisis. Susan was a historic foreign editor, who led coverage of two wars, the Arab Spring, the Japanese nuclear catastrophe and a host of other upheavals. She has proven herself a relentless competitor. She has worked on virtually every desk. And she is a tireless advocate for ambitious news coverage that distinguishes The Times. Susan’s primary job will be to think about the daily report, on the web and in print, and along with the other deputies, to work with me on the kind of longer-term strategic news decisions that will guide coverage into the future.

JANET ELDER will manage the talent, operations and budget of the newsroom. Speaking of Alissa Rubin, Janet Elder led a military-style campaign that swept her off a mountaintop in Iraq. That’s one good example of just how Janet has created a central role in all aspects of the newsroom, always with honesty and always with an eye on the values of The Times. She has taken on the hardest jobs, working closely with the business side while serving as an advisory member of the executive committee that oversees the whole company. Janet ran our polling unit for many years, making it the best in the business.

MATT PURDY will run investigations and enterprise coverage. What has distinguished The Times is its ability to do the biggest public-service journalism, and no editor has pushed that agenda with more force and imagination than Matt. Matt has always compelled us to think big, to seek out the largest subjects worthy of the might of The Times. His staff has dug into Walmart’s corrupt activities in Mexico, food safety, terrorism, and the machinations of local and national politicians. His job will be to shepherd our most ambitious work. Big enterprise should go through Matt’s office. But he will also stay on top of the news report, looking for ways to help shape larger off-the-news enterprise.

IAN FISHER will oversee digital operations. Ian is the essence of The Times journalist. He started as a clerk under the tutelage of Bob McFadden and John Kifner, and ended up in Iraq before and after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Before throwing himself into the digital world he was under fire in African wars. He is the best person to make sure the news ambitions and creativity of our digital offerings match those of our print edition.

That is a giant job for one person. And our digital operation remains a work in progress. But there is tremendous talent in our ranks, and I’m not averse to looking elsewhere if we need to. Expect many more changes in this area soonest.

In the meantime I’m promoting some strong editors to work with Ian to increase our digital intelligence. STEVE DUENES, our finest digital storyteller, will join the masthead as an Assistant Editor. Steve’s fingerprints have been on our most ambitious projects, and he has transformed that most traditional print department — graphics — into something else entirely.

CLIFFORD LEVY, a two-time Pulitzer winner and one of our most creative editors, will also be part of Ian’s team, as an Associate Editor, helping to craft a mobile strategy building off the journalistic success of NYTNow. He will also play a major role in thinking through The Times’s digital strategy in the years to come. With the addition of ALEXANDRA MacCALLUM, the first digital native to join our masthead, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger’s strategy group, and Sam Dolnick’s mobile group, we have the makings of a powerful digital editing team that can lead us into the future.

TOM BODKIN will be equal to the deputy editors, and will take the more appropriate title of Creative Director. He continues to play a large role on the business side as well, but I’ve also asked him to be a bigger part of the strategic life of the newsroom, to help us think hard about what a print Times should be in the digital age even as we all reimagine our digital report.

As we welcome some new names to the senior levels of the newsroom, we will be saying farewell to one of our finest leaders. LAWRENCE INGRASSIA, who led the business desk through the great financial crisis of 2008 while producing strong investigative reporting, has told me he would like to retire at the end of the year. I will say much more about Larry in a later note. But a couple of thoughts to get the ball rolling. Besides leading some of our best coverage, he brought a generation of young reporters to The Times who have made significant contributions to every aspect of our report. Most recently, he led the transformation of The International New York Times.

Beyond these changes, I am adding one more editor to the masthead. JOE KAHN will become an Assistant Editor for International. This is partly an acknowledgement that the traditional role of foreign editor has expanded dramatically. Joe oversees a vast foreign reporting staff, as well as The International New York Times and a large Chinese-language newsroom. He is also one of our finest editors, with a deep interest in the paper’s digital figure. But building an international audience is vital to our mission. While he will continue to run the desk, he will play a leading role in shaping that strategy.

So what am I trying to accomplish here?

The newsroom’s main job — and mine — is and always will be to cover the world and break big stories. But senior editors will have to be something more — strategic leaders in shaping the future of The New York Times. We have to play a bigger role in steering The Times through the forces that are reshaping our world. We need a masthead that allows good ideas and good stories to get a fast and decisive hearing, an operation that encourages big risks, and one where the route to my office will never be blocked.

In constructing this masthead I aimed to have it reflect the newsroom-wide values and functions that are important at this moment. Just as our business has been rapidly changing, our newsroom must be more nimble. Therefore I anticipate the masthead will be more fluid than in the past. This will be true for my term and, I expect, for that of future executive editors. Some people will be given masthead jobs so they can grow and get a broader view of The Times. I anticipate people moving on and off the masthead as our needs evolve, and it is important that these moves not be seen as measures of who is up and who is down, but rather as appointments aimed at keeping our journalism and our entire operation as vibrant as possible.

First Draft
At Clintons’ Event, a Really Close Watch on Reporters

Charitable commitments have been made. Important topics like Ebola and elephant poaching have been discussed. World leaders from President Obama to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan have convened.

But, for me, perhaps the person who stands out is the friendly 20-something press aide who the Clinton Global Initiative tasked with escorting me to the restroom. She waited outside the stall in the ladies’ room at the Sheraton Hotel, where the conference is held each year.

Security, foundation aides told me, dictates that the hordes of journalists, many of them from overseas news outlets, be cloistered in a basement at the Sheraton. An elaborate maze of security barricades separates where reporters enter and roam (though not freely) from the lobby of the hotel, where actual guests enter.

An escort is required wherever we go, lest one of us with our yellow press badges wind up somewhere where attendants with an esteemed blue badge are milling around. When asked about the practice, Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the initiative, directed me to a press release about American Standard’s Flush for Good campaign to improve sanitation for three million people in the developing world. “Since you are so interested in bathrooms and C.G.I,” Mr. Minassian said.

On Wednesday morning, ahead of a panel discussion at which Hillary Rodham Clinton introduced the event’s biggest commitment, to get Nigerian girls and some 14 million more in Africa and Asia access to secondary education (called Charge, short for the Collaborative for Harnessing Ambition and Resources for Girls’ Education), several dozen reporters lined up to pass through metal detectors when several people jumped the queue. “They’re with Katie Couric!” a press aide explained when a journalist (O.K., me) complained. (Ms. Couric, they later explained, would be moderating a panel later that morning with Chelsea Clinton.)

It wasn’t always like this. While there were always metal detectors and heightened security at the conference, which typically takes place during the United Nations General Assembly and includes speeches by Mr. Obama, Bill Clinton and others, reporters could roam relatively freely until last year, when interest in and scrutiny of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation spiked amid speculation that Mrs. Clinton would run for president in 2016.

Liberia’s Ebola Victims Dying at Home Amid Shortage of Clinics

MONROVIA, Liberia — The family of the dead man, who had been sick for six days with Ebola’s telltale symptoms, took him twice by taxi to treatment centers here in the capital, only to be turned back at the gate for lack of beds. He died at home, his arms thrashing violently and blood spewing out of his mouth, in front of his sons.

“We had to carry him home two times because they could do nothing for us,” said Eric Gweah, 25, as a team of body collectors came to retrieve his father's corpse. “The only thing the government can do is come for bodies. They are killing us.”

So many Ebola victims are dying at home because of the severe shortage of treatment centers here in Monrovia, Liberia‘s capital, that they are infecting family members, neighbors and others in a ballooning circle of contagion.

Only 18 percent of Ebola patients in Liberia are being cared for in hospitals, holding centers or other settings that reduce the risk of transmission by isolating them from the rest of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unless that rate reaches 70 percent, the center predicted[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su63e0923a1.htm#Appendix-tab1] this week, Ebola cases will keep soaring.

In its worst-case estimate, Liberia and Sierra Leone, two of the three West African nations hit hardest by the outbreak, could face 1.4 million infections by Jan. 20 — more than 10 percent of their combined populations of about 10.3 million.

In the coming weeks, the United States military will try to overhaul the fight against Ebola in Liberia, home to 1,580 of the 2,800 Ebola deaths so far recorded [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134449/1/roadmapupdate22sept14_eng.pdf?ua=1]in West Africa[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134449/1/roadmapupdate22sept14_eng.pdf?ua=1]. The 3,000-strong American mission will not treat Ebola patients, but will build as many as 17 treatment centers, with a total of 1,700 beds, and try to train 500 health workers a week.

But building the centers is expected to take weeks and it is unclear who will run them, especially since the disease has decimated Liberia’s already weak health care system and the fear of Ebola has long kept many international aid workers away.

“I’ve worked in many crises for more than 20 years, and it’s the first time I can see a situation that nobody wants to come,” said Jean-Pierre Veyrenche, who is heading the World Health Organization’s efforts to build treatment centers here. “There’s plenty of money, so that’s not the issue. If you look at Haiti, there were about 800 N.G.O.s there.”

“People are afraid to come — that’s it,” he added.

With treatment beds overflowing, the government is often left to simply pick up the bodies of the dead. As its six teams of body collectors crisscross this capital of 1.5 million people, navigating cratered streets left over from the 14-year civil war that ended in 2003, they encounter a city that is likely to remain at the mercy of Ebola for weeks, perhaps months.

Every day, each team retrieves half a dozen to a couple of dozen bodies, which it delivers to a crematorium.

The body collectors who came to pick up Mr. Gweah had descended to the compound where he lived four times in the past four weeks, down a steep cliff to a riverside area called Rockspring Valley. Each week, they had picked up a body that passed on the Ebola virus to the next person, and now Mr. Gweah’s was the fifth body. The crowd, seething beneath a sky of low clouds, erupted in anger.

“If the government can’t work it out, let them give it up,” said Marvin Gweah, 28, another son. “Let the international community handle this.”

Five body collectors in full protective suits clambered up the cliff in the rain, carrying his father’s body in a black plastic bag, resting to readjust their grip, and steadying themselves on the slippery path. Eric Gweah, his face twisted in anguish, led the way, shrieking “Papa” and throwing his hands up in the air, nearly losing his footing.

“Stand up! Stand up!” a woman following the body collectors shouted at another woman who had fainted. A cacophony of wailing and sobbing rose as all of Rockspring Valley below seemed to sway in grief.

A new 120-bed treatment center, Island Clinic, operated by Liberian health workers under the W.H.O., opened here on Sunday, bringing Liberia’s total beds to 450. The agency is hoping to open two additional centers with a total of 400 beds here in the capital over the next month, but is unable to find international workers to operate them, said Mr. Veyrenche, who is heading the W.H.O.’s efforts to build treatment centers here.

Last week in Bong County, in central Liberia, the International Medical Corps began operating a treatment center built by Save the Children. The Medical Corps and Doctors Without Borders are the only international organizations operating treatment centers in Liberia.

Sean Casey, the leader of the Medical Corps in Liberia, said he hoped to increase the center’s current capacity of 10 beds to 70 beds over the next six weeks. But because of the fear of Ebola and the time commitment required of foreign volunteers, the organization has been unable to draw doctors and nurses from its usual pool, he said. The organization is recruiting health workers for the first time in the Philippines, Jordan and Ethiopia.

Like most experts here, Mr. Casey was skeptical of the American military’s plans to find and train 500 health workers a week.

“It took us a few weeks to just open 10 beds,” he said. “It worries me that some of their facilities will be open before they’re ready.”

Here in Monrovia, the first city to face Ebola’s full onslaught since the virus was discovered in 1976, entire families are dying at home, unable to get a ride in one of the city’s few ambulances or gain admission to overcrowded treatment or holding centers.

“We came here for the husband last week, we’re back today for the wife, and maybe next week we’ll be back for the children,” said Alexander Nyanti, 23, a body collector who was picking up the corpse of Lorpu David, 30, in a central Monrovia neighborhood off Gurley Street.

A week earlier, his team had visited the same house to retrieve the body of her husband, Sam David, the first Ebola death in that community. The couple shared one room with their two children and the wife’s younger sister.

“The little boy is not feeling all right,” John Sackie, the community’s chairman, said as four collectors pulled Ms. David out of a dark room in the back of the house, each grasping a limb.

Others from the community may have been exposed. Teddy Momo, 36, the husband’s nephew, said he had taken the ailing Ms. David to an Ebola treatment center, riding in the front passenger seat of a taxi as Ms. David shared the back with her two children and sister.

Turned away because of a lack of beds, they took the taxi back to Gurley Street. But Ms. David slipped and hit her chin on a rocky path leading to her house; a neighbor carried her home, where she died immediately, Mr. Momo said.

Even if there were enough treatment centers, not all families would send their sick relatives to them. Deeply distrustful of the government and fearful of becoming social outcasts, families often lie about the cause of death, furthering the contagion throughout their communities.

In front of the gate at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center’s maternity ward, a pregnant woman lay dead in the back seat of a taxi. She had died during labor and did not suffer from Ebola, her family insisted. But a hospital worker said the woman had been bleeding from her mouth, so she had been turned away from the maternity ward. When the body collectors finally opened the taxi door, they found that she had vomited blood.

In the Matadi neighborhood, community leaders, including a member of the local Ebola task force, said emphatically that another death, of a 24-year-old man, had resulted from epilepsy. But again, the body collectors found blood coming from his mouth, more evidence of the virus.

In a neighborhood called PHP, community leaders who had gathered in a mosque explained that a 75-year-old woman had died of a stroke. Absolutely no Ebola, they said, as Mark Korvayan, 37, the leader of a team of body collectors, nodded.

But as his team went to pick up the body from a dank room, Mr. Korvayan said that he had picked up the woman’s daughter and nephew from the same room in the past month.

“They’re trying to cover it up,” he said. “It’s our third time here.”

As he had often seen, this community, caught up in its own denials, continued to engage in funeral practices that helped spread Ebola, he said.

“They told me that somebody even bathed the old woman’s body.”

PRESIDENT, AT U.N., VOWS TO COUNTER EXTREMIST THREAT

UNITED NATIONS — President Obama on Wednesday charted a muscular new course for the United States in a turbulent world, telling the United Nations General Assembly in a bluntly worded speech that the American military would work with allies to dismantle the Islamic State’s “network of death” and warning Russia that it would pay for its bullying of Ukraine.

Two days after ordering airstrikes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/middleeast/us-isis-syria.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] on dozens of militant targets in Syria, Mr. Obama issued a fervent call to arms against the Islamic State[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/isis/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] — the once-reluctant warrior now apparently resolved to waging a twilight struggle against Islamic extremism for the remainder of his presidency.

“Today, I ask the world to join in this effort,” Mr. Obama said, seeking to buttress a global coalition that he said would train and equip troops to fight the group, also known ISIL, starve it of financial resources, and halt the flow of foreign recruits to its ranks.

“Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can,” Mr. Obama said, foreshadowing the blows to come. “For we will not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build, not those who destroy.” The brutality of the militants, he said, “forces us to look into the heart of darkness.”

Even so, Mr. Obama said, the threat from the Islamic State was only the most urgent of an onslaught of global challenges that have given the United States no choice but to take the lead: from resisting Russia’s aggression against Ukraine[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/ukraine/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] to coordinating a response to the Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html?ref=world] in West Africa; from brokering a new unity government[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/world/asia/afghan-presidential-election.html] in Afghanistan to organizing a new campaign to confront climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}].

It was a starkly different president than the one who addressed skeptical world leaders at the General Assembly last year, two weeks after calling off a missile strike on Syria over its use of chemical weapons. In that speech, Mr. Obama offered a shrunken list of American priorities in the Middle East and showed little appetite for the charged rhetoric or interventionist policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush.

Mr. Obama on Wednesday spoke more like a wartime leader, reaffirming his determination to work with other countries but leaving little doubt that the United States would act as the ultimate guarantor of an international order that he said was under acute stress.

As if to underscore his new role, Mr. Obama chaired a rare leaders session of the United Nations Security Council[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/security_council/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}], which unanimously passed a resolution requiring countries to pass laws against traveling abroad to join terrorist groups or financing those efforts.

“If there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that cannot be met by one nation alone, it is this,” he said, “terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence.”

For all the hardening of Mr. Obama’s tone, though, it remained unclear whether the speech represented a fundamental rethinking of his policy or a reluctant response to the threat posed by the Islamic State, brought home for many Americans after the militants posted Internet videos of American hostages[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/world/middleeast/steven-sotloff-isis-execution.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias&] who were beheaded.

The strategy he outlined would protect the United States from terrorist threats by crippling the Islamic State and other militants like the Khorasan group[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/middleeast/us-isis-syria.html], which was also targeted this week by American airstrikes, and not by trying to transform the societies in which they took root, as did the architects of the Iraq War.

Still, his remarks clearly seemed designed to get past months in which the president appeared visibly conflicted about the proper use of American military force in the Middle East — an ambivalence that opened him to criticism that he was feckless and irresolute.

In addressing the Ukraine crisis, Mr. Obama used his strongest language yet, portraying Russia’s incursions as an affront to the principles of the United Nations and promising to levy a cost on President Vladimir V. Putin. He accused Russia of conspiring with Ukrainian separatists to obstruct an investigation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-plane-ukraine.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] into a downed Malaysian jetliner.

“This is a vision of the world in which might makes right,” he said, “a world in which one nation’s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/world/europe/soldiers-graves-bear-witness-to-russias-role-in-ukraine.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}].”

The 39-minute speech was also notable for what Mr. Obama did not say. Last year, he singled out nuclear negotiations with Iran and Syria’s civil war as two of his top priorities in the Middle East. On Wednesday, he mentioned them in only a cursory manner.

Iran, he said, should not let the chance for a nuclear agreement slip by. But he made no reference to Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who has made clear he does not want to shake hands[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/world/handshake-with-iran-might-say-much-more.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] with Mr. Obama this week, a gesture long-awaited as a symbol of thawed relations between Iran and the United States. Privately, American officials have expressed deep skepticism about the status of the negotiations with Tehran, and Mr. Obama’s subdued remarks suggested he shares that pessimism.

The president also did not single out President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for criticism, as he did last year, over the use of chemical weapons, though he spoke of the brutality of the Assad regime. Mr. Assad has voiced support for the American-led strikes in Syria, and his air force has not interfered with American warplanes entering Syrian air space.

In a sign of how the fight against the Islamic State has reordered priorities, Mr. Obama pledged to train and equip moderate rebels in Syria — something he long resisted and labeled a fantasy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/opinion/president-obama-thomas-l-friedman-iraq-and-world-affairs.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}]. He repeated calls for a political settlement to end the civil war, acknowledging that “cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass.”

Mr. Obama only fleetingly addressed another of last year’s priorities, the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, delivering a mild rebuke to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/benjamin_netanyahu/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}]. “The violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace,” he said. “That’s something worthy of reflection within Israel,” he added, in a line that was not in his prepared text.

With much of the day’s focus on the threat from foreign fighters, Mr. Obama took pains to address it. In an echo of the 2009 speech in Cairo that was aimed at the Islamic world, he issued a direct appeal to young Muslims, urging them to resist the blandishments of violent jihadism.

“You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder,” Mr. Obama said. “Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it.”

Also in keeping with past practice, he acknowledged that the United States is wrestling its own demons. “In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe,” he said, “I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Mo.[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}], where a young man was killed, and a community was divided.”

The speech was the centerpiece of a hectic three days of diplomacy for Mr. Obama, and he appeared to make strides in broadening the coalition against the Islamic State. On Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain recalled Parliament[http://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000003136017/cameron-says-it-is-right-for-uk-to-join-fight-against-islamic-st.html] to meet Friday to vote on joining American-led airstrikes in Iraq.

Mr. Cameron lost a vote[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/world/middleeast/syria.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}] in Parliament last year when he sought approval for bombing Syria, alongside the United States, after Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons. But he told the BBC that these airstrikes were the right thing to do, and he was confident Parliament would support them. “As ever with our country,” he said, “when we are threatened in this way, we should not turn away from what needs to be done.”

Mr. Obama also met with Iraq’s new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/world/middleeast/iraq.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22}]. He praised Mr. Abadi as the right person to heal Iraq’s sectarian rifts, and said he “recognizes this is not something that is going to be easy, and it is not going to happen overnight.”

The Ebola Fiasco

The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a tragedy. But, more than that, the response to it has been a gross failure.

It’s a classic case where early action could have saved lives and money. Yet the world dithered, and with Ebola cases in Liberia now doubling[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/qa-mmwr-estimating-future-cases.html] every two to three weeks, the latest worst-case estimate[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/health/ebola-cases-could-reach-14-million-in-4-months-cdc-estimates.html] from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that there could be 1.4 million cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone by late January.

We would never tolerate such shortsightedness in private behavior. If a roof leaks, we fix it before a home is ruined. If we buy a car, we add oil to keep the engine going. Yet in public policy — from education to global health — we routinely refuse to invest at the front end and have to pay far more at the back end.

We know how to confront the Ebola virus. In Uganda, an excellent American-backed prevention initiative trained local health workers to recognize the virus and stop it from spreading, so, in 2011, an Ebola outbreak there stopped after just a single case[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/9/11-1536_article].

We also know from our catastrophic mishandling of AIDS a generation ago — or the mishandling of cholera in Haiti more recently — that it’s imperative to stop infectious diseases early. Yet the reaction to the Ebola outbreak after it began in December in Guinea was a global shrug: It was mishandled by local countries and by the rest of the world, so, instead of a tiny cost in money and lives, we will now all pay hugely.

If the worst-case scenario comes to pass in West Africa, it may become endemic[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-health-ebola-endemic-idUSKCN0HI1OX20140923] in the region and reach the West. Ebola is quite lethal but not particularly contagious, so it presumably wouldn’t cause an epidemic in countries with modern health systems. This entire tragedy is a failure of humanity.

As donor countries scramble to respond (which may cost $1 billion in the next six months[https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/CAP/Ebola_outbreak_Sep_2014.pdf], according to the United Nations, although nobody really knows), the risk is that they will raid other pots of money intended for other vital purposes to assist the world’s needy. Jamie Drummond of the One campaign[http://www.one.org/us/person/jamie-drummond/] says he worries that governments may try to finance Ebola countermeasures with money that otherwise would buy childhood vaccines or ease emerging famines in Somalia and South Sudan.

Vaccines are a bargain. Since 1990, vaccines and other simple interventions (such as treatments for diarrhea) have saved nearly 100 million children’s lives, according to Unicef[http://www.unicefusa.org/stories/new-unicef-report-child-deaths-cut-half-1990/19446]. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance[http://www.gavi.org/], is now in the middle of trying to raise an additional $7.5 billion to subsidize vaccinations of 300 million additional children around the world. On top of the $2 billion it has, Gavi says this would save 5 million to 6 million lives and produce economic benefits of $80 billion to $100 billion.

Such an investment should be a no-brainer. In the 21st century, we have the resources to fight more than one fire at a time.

“I am worried,” said Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi. “You wouldn’t want to reduce immunizing children around the world to deal with an emergency even as severe as Ebola.”

We invest vast sums to address national security risks that have a military dimension, hence President Obama’s decision to renovate the American nuclear arsenal[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/us-ramping-up-major-renewal-in-nuclear-arms.html] at a cost that could reach $1 trillion over three decades. So let’s remember that infectious diseases can also constitute a national security threat.

Our shortsightedness afflicts so many areas of public policy. We spend billions of dollars fighting extremists today, but don’t invest tiny sums educating children or empowering women, even though that’s the strategy with a solid record of success at reducing extremism in the medium term — and even though we can finance at least 20 schools for the cost of deploying one soldier abroad for one year.

At home, we don’t invest adequately in family-planning programs even though pregnancy prevention initiatives for at-risk teenagers pay for themselves many times over. We don’t invest in early education programs that have a robust record in reducing later criminal behavior, preferring instead to pay for prisons.

Indeed, this is such a market failure that new financial instruments — social impact bonds[http://online.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/articles/john-c-williams-letting-investors-take-a-shot-at-curing-social-ills-1411515133] — address it. The bonds pay for job training or early education programs and then earn a financial return for investors when the government saves money.

Yet the worst consequence of our myopia isn’t financial waste. It’s that people are dying unnecessarily of Ebola. It’s that some children in the United States grow up semiliterate. And it’s the risk that the cost of leaders’ mismanagement of Ebola will be borne by children going without vaccines.

White House Issues New Regulations for Dangerous Biological Research

The Obama administration on Wednesday issued new guidelines intended to strengthen the oversight of federally funded biology research that could inadvertently produce bioweapons.

The new policy shifts the burden of finding and disclosing the dangerous aspects of research from the funding agency — usually the National Institutes of Health — to the scientists who receive the grants and the universities or other institutions where they work.

The director of the N.I.H., Dr. Francis S. Collins, said the rules would “preserve the benefits of life-science research while minimizing the risk of misuse.”

Critics who oppose dangerous research dismissed the new rules as weak.

The policy, a codification of draft rules issued in early 2013, does not take effect for another year — an aspect that was also ridiculed by critics, who argue that dangerous work, such as making flu viruses more lethal, has been allowed to proceed while federal officials debate how to regulate it.

The critics also complained that the rules applied only to federally funded research, and that the harshest penalty, loss of funding, was not very harsh and was rarely applied.

Dr. Amy P. Patterson, the institutes’ associate director for biosecurity, who presented the policy, called loss of funding “a fairly large stick.”

Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers and a critic of experiments that make flu viruses more lethal[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/science/debate-persists-on-deadly-flu-made-airborne.html], retorted that the agency had “a sorry track record of nonenforcement.”

The new rules[http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Documents/durc-policy.pdf], known as the United States Government Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern, were issued jointly by the N.I.H. and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

“Dual use” refers to research that has clear benefits but might be inherently dangerous or even tempting to terrorists. For example, a new weed killer might be used to kill food plants, too.

Under the new rules, scientists doing such work must inform their institution, which must convene a review board to look into the risks and inform the federal funding agency.

The scientists and institutions must then submit a plan for lowering the risks. For example, they might build a lab with a higher biosafety rating.

The rules cover a list of agents that cause 15 diseases, including Ebola, plague, smallpox, botulism and anthrax poisoning. They also cover seven research targets, such as making a virus more lethal, more transmissible or harder to detect.

Less than 1 percent of all federally funded research outside of military labs falls under the rules, Dr. Ebright said.

The list does not include the coronaviruses that cause respiratory diseases like SARS and MERS, and it was not obvious whether newly emergent or newly created pathogens would be covered.

Peter Hale, the executive director of the Foundation for Vaccine Research[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/03/scientists-seek-ethics-review-h5n1-gain-function-research], which opposes potentially dangerous research, said he was frustrated by the announcement.

“We had been told to expect tough new rules, tighter regulation and increased oversight,” he said. “There was very little that was new or substantive to latch onto.”

Good Thursday morning from Washington.

With American airstrikes in Syria continuing, Speaker John A. Boehner is increasingly convinced that Congress must hold a full debate on granting President Obama the authority to use military force against terrorists.

“I have made it clear that I think the House and the Congress itself should speak,” the speaker said in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with First Draft.

But Mr. Boehner believes a post-election, lame-duck session is the wrong time for such a weighty decision.

“Doing this with a whole group of members who are on their way out the door, I don’t think that is the right way to handle this,” he said.

Mr. Boehner, who is open to a more expansive military campaign to destroy the Islamic State[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/16/world/middleeast/how-isis-works.html?action=click&contentCollection=Middle%20East&module=RelatedCoverage®ion=Marginalia&pgtype=article], thinks lawmakers should take up the issue after the new Congress convenes in January.

At that time, he said, President Obama should come forward with a proposal for consideration.

Some critics have called on Congress to assert itself more forcefully as the country goes to war, though Mr. Obama has said he does not need lawmakers’ approval[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/us/politics/congresss-inaction-could-be-legal-basis-for-stronger-executive-war-powers.html] for the operation.

“I would suggest to you that early next year, assuming that we continue in this effort, there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the president,” he said.

More news from the interview with Mr. Boehner, who spoke to us as he campaigned for Republicans in New England, will be available Thursday on First Draft. One thing was clear: The speaker is unhappy with the Secret Service, which will be the subject of a House hearing on Tuesday, after an incident last week in which an intruder scaled a fence and made it through a front door of the White House.

“Normally when you build a fence, you have to guard the fence. How could you not be guarding the fence?” asked the astonished speaker, whose security is provided by the Capitol Police. “These guys were asleep on the job. It’s as simple as that.”

Another Round in the Ring for Palin, This Time in KansasFresh from her family brawl[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/us/politics/sarah-palin-family-alaska-brawl.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22%7D] outside an Anchorage party, Sarah Palin is wading into another messy fight: the Senate race in Kansas.

Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor, will try to lift enthusiasm among conservatives at a pancake breakfast on Thursday for the imperiled Senator Pat Roberts, who is in an unexpectedly tight race against an independent candidate.

They make for an unusual pairing: Mr. Roberts, a 33-year veteran of Congress, could not be more different from the anti-establishment conservatives Ms. Palin typically endorses. The 78-year-old Kansas senator was one of the Tea Party’s top targets for defeat this year.

Ms. Palin, of course, has a way of generating headlines wherever she travels. Earlier this month, in an interview on Fox News, she raised eyebrows when she appeared to shoulder the blame for John McCain’s 2008 loss, saying, “I owe America a global apology because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.”

– Jeremy W. Peters

On the Record With Kirsten GillibrandSenator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York offers a way to fix what’s wrong in Washington: Put a woman in the White House, and more of them in Congress.”I’d make Congress 51 percent women,” she tells First Draft as part of its video series on how to change the broken political system. “I would have it reflect the population.”Look for the video on First Draft later Thursday.–Carl HulseCredit

Democrats Direct Their Message to Hispanic VotersThe Democratic effort to turn out Hispanic voters on Election Day speaks with one voice: “No pierda la oportunidad de votar.”

In English: “Don’t miss the opportunity to vote.”

That message will be delivered across the nation in radio ads starting Thursday in six states: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas.

The Spanish-language ads are part of the Democratic National Committee’s million-dollar-plus effort to reach out to voters in critical constituencies who often stay home for off-year elections. A similar effort aimed at African-American voters is underway, and campaigns targeting Asian-Americans, women and young voters are in the works.

The Spanish ad begins on an optimistic note before warning that Republicans “don’t understand that our families still believe in the American dream.”

“Democrats are committed to expanding the vote,” said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the committee’s chairwoman, “and we want to ensure that this November Latinos come out to vote and make their voices heard.”

What We’re Watching TodayPresident Obama’s busy week in New York wraps up with a speech and two meetings before he heads back to Washington. At 11 a.m., he will offer remarks on the Ebola epidemic. That comes between bilateral talks with Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.

And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has one last meeting in New York before he heads home to Delaware. At 3 p.m., he will huddle with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey at the Peninsula Hotel. Dismantling the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, will surely be on the agenda.

Politics? This Star Would Rather ‘Get Things Done’Jeremy Renner plays the investigative reporter Gary Webb in “Kill the Messenger.”Credit Focus Features

The actor Jeremy Renner has played a bomb-defusing soldier (“The Hurt Locker”), a superhero (“The Avengers”) and now a journalist, Gary Webb, whose stories linking the C.I.A. to the crack epidemic in the 1980s led to his professional ruin.

Mr. Renner is busily promoting that movie, “Kill the Messenger,” which is based on a book that seeks to vindicate Mr. Webb’s work. (Mr. Webb died in 2004 in what was ruled a suicide.)

Many celebrities heap insincere praise on the city they are visiting. But not Mr. Renner. Asked how he likes Washington, Mr. Renner drew parallels — and not favorable ones — to Hollywood.

In both cities, he said, “There are a lot of climbers, social climbers, people that are scratching and clawing their way up.”

He has no plans to move to the nation’s capital, he said, because he is “not a political guy” and “likes to get things done.”

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Oil targets in Syria are hit.

The U.S.-led coalition has struck refineries[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/25/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html] in the third day of airstrikes on Islamic State militants.

ISIS captured most of Syria’s largest oil fields, and is believed to be partly financing its operations by selling the oil on the black market.

• Showing a new attitude.

The United Nations General Debate continues today[http://webtv.un.org.proxy.bc.edu/], with addresses by many world leaders, including President Hassan Rouhani[http://mobile.nytimes.com/news/un-general-assembly/2014/09/21/president-hassan-rouhani-of-iran-u-n-general-assembly-speech/] of Iran.

In recent days[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/world/middleeast/iranian-president-praises-cooperation-in-new-york.html], Mr. Rouhani has gone to some lengths to sound much like President Obama in describing the need to defeat the Islamic State, and to show a cooperative spirit.

• Stopping the contagion.

Also at the U.N., Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will urge presidents and prime ministers to focus on a greater global response to the Ebola epidemic when he meets with them today.

President Obama will also address the audience.

• How to save the fish — and fishing.

Secretary of State John Kerry hosts a discussion this morning with diplomats and leaders on sustainable fishing and marine-protected areas.

President Obama announced this week[http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/09/24/obama-expand-ocean-preserve-times-size/or32dJV6kMfwRFtEG18VOL/story.html] that he would expand by six times the size of the Pacific Ocean marine preserve.

• Ukraine’s future.

The country’s president is unveiling today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/25/world/europe/25reuters-ukraine-crisis-president.html] his plan for social and economic reforms, which would allow Ukraine to apply for membership in the European Union in six years.

• Abduction suspect is held.

The search for a University of Virginia student is continuing today, but a suspect was arrested[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/jesse-leroy-matthew-charged-university-of-virginia-hannah-graham.html] in the case on Wednesday in Texas.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are down. European shares are declining, and Asian markets closed mixed.

• The Federal Aviation Administrationis likely to grant permits[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/25/business/ap-us-movie-drones.html] today to seven movie and TV production companies, allowing them to fly drones.

• Ford Motor Companywill announce today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/25/business/ap-us-ford-van-hiring-missouri.html] that it is adding 1,200 workers and another shift to a Missouri plant that makes its new Transit van.

• Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is in Lithuania[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/business/international/lithuania-feels-squeeze-in-sanctions-war-with-moscow.html] today at a conference about the country’s plans to join the eurozone on Jan. 1.

• TwitPic, a website that allows users to put pictures on Twitter, is not shutting down[http://www.pcmag.com.proxy.bc.edu/article2/0,2817,2468895,00.asp] after a trademark dispute, as we stated earlier.

NOTEWORTHY

• Last time in pinstripes.

Derek Jeter is playing his final game[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/sports/baseball/an-ouster-on-derek-jeters-way-out.html] at Yankee Stadium tonight.

It is also his first and only home game with the Yankees eliminated from the postseason. (They were eliminated[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/sports/baseball/yankees-officially-eliminated-for-the-second-straight-year.html] with a loss on Wednesday.) In 20 seasons, Jeter won five World Series championships.

Also Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Dodgerswon a division title[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/25/sports/baseball/ap-bbn-giants-dodgers.html], and the Detroit Tigersclinched[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/24/sports/baseball/ap-bba-white-sox-tigers.html] a playoff spot.

• Barbra Streisand is back on top.

It is Ms. Streisand’s 10th No. 1 album, and she is the first artist to reach the top spot in each of the last six decades.

• Leading lady.

The Oscar nominee Viola Davis stars in the TV drama “How to Get Away With Murder[http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder],” in which she plays a defense lawyer and Ivy League law professor who employs top students to help win cases.

One of her charges then becomes entangled in a murder plot on campus.

Shonda Rhimes is an executive producer of the ABC show (pilot is on at 10 p.m. Eastern), which will be broadcast after two new episodes from her other hit series, “Grey’s Anatomy” at 8 p.m. and “Scandal” at 9 p.m.

• Lots of candles at their house.

Michael Douglas turns 70 today, while his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, turns 45.

BACK STORY

Can a diplomat get away with murder? Or drug-dealing? Or rape?

Such cases have been the stuff of novels, TV episodes and movies.

But in reality? It depends.

What is known as diplomatic immunity was codified by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a pact to which some 190 countries subscribe. The treaty shields[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/02/15/can_you_get_away_with_any_crime_if_you_have_diplomatic_immunity] high-ranking diplomats and their families from prosecution[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/04/cant_touch_this.html].

The infractions are often on the minor end of the spectrum. A perennial frustration in New York (likely to flare up again with the United Nations General Assembly convened this month) is the millions of dollars[http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/07/17/fixing-the-chinks-in-diplomatic-immunitys-armor/an-honor-system-thats-not-always-reliable] in unpaid traffic citations.

But when a more serious crime occurs, and they do[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/raymond-davis-pakistan.html?pagewanted=all], the diplomat’s country can give the accused up to local authorities for prosecution; otherwise, the host country can boot the suspect, declaring him or her “persona non grata.”

Last year, an Indian diplomat was arrested in New York on charges that stemmed from accusations of mistreating a domestic worker.

India was outraged over the treatment of the diplomat, and, ultimately, she left the United States[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/nyregion/indian-diplomat-indicted-in-employment-case.html?action=click&contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&module=RelatedCoverage®ion=Marginalia&pgtype=article] without being prosecuted, all under the cover of diplomatic immunity.

Obama asks for unity to fight ‘those who destroy’; Militants behead tourist in Algeria, highlighting spread of terror threat

President Obama laid out a forceful new blueprint on Wednesday for deeper American engagement in the Middle East, telling the United Nations General Assembly that the Islamic State militants understood only ‘‘the language of force’’ and that the United States would ‘‘work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.’’

In a much-anticipated address two days after he expanded the American-led military campaign against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, into Syria, Mr. Obama said, ‘‘Today, I ask the world to join in this effort,’’ declaring, ‘‘We will not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build, not those who destroy.’’

Soon after he spoke, a group aligned with Islamic State circulated a video showing the beheading of a French tourist it had captured in North Africa, according to SITE Intelligence, which tracks jihadist groups.

The Frenchman — Hervé Gourdel, a 55-year-old mountaineering guide from Nice — was abducted in Algeria on Sunday by the group, Jund al-Khilafah. Mr. Gourdel had arrived only a day earlier on a trip to go hiking in Algeria’s northern mountains. The terrorist group issued a statement after his abduction, saying that it was following the guidance of the Islamic State, which has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq and has called on its sympathizers to strike Westerners wherever they can.

The killing of Mr. Gourdel signals that the Islamic State’s practice of beheading Western captives for propaganda purposes has spread beyond the area it controls in Syria. Numerous smaller factions in the Middle East and elsewhere have pledged allegiance to the group.

Separately, a militant group in the Philippines, Abu Sayyaf, announced that it was holding two German citizens and threatened to kill them if Germany did not back out of the intervention in Syria, according to a transcript provided by SITE.

The United States military said on Tuesday that it anticipated a long campaign, working in a coalition with Arab allies, to reduce the threat from the Islamic State. Early on Wednesday, another wave of airstrikes hit Islamic State military sites, targeting eight Kurdish villages that the militants had seized in recent days in northern Syria near the Turkish border, residents reported.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the strikes, but the Syrian government has not previously conducted operations in the area. Residents said they believed the air attacks were carried out by the American-led coalition.

The strikes took place overnight; at daybreak Islamic State fighters resumed their offensive on the Kurdish villages, residents reported.

The advance of the Islamic State group has spread fear among Kurds, who have been harassed by the extremist militants in both Iraq and Syria. The assault has driven at least 150,000 Syrian Kurdish villagers into Turkey, one of the most intense flows of refugees in the three years of the Syrian conflict, and has fueled a mushrooming humanitarian crisis on the border as some refugees are turned away by the Turkish authorities.

At the United Nations, Mr. Obama sought to rally more international support behind the campaign against the Islamic State, building on the support he has already won from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. And he affirmed his intent to pursue an aggressive military strategy against the group and its supporters.

‘‘Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can,’’ Mr. Obama said in a blunt declaration of his intentions. ‘‘We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power. We will take action against threats to our security, and our allies, while building an architecture of counterterrorism cooperation.’’

The military campaign against the Islamic State, Mr. Obama said, is only the most urgent of a raft of global challenges in which the United States has had no choice but to play a leadership role. These include resisting Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, coordinating a response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, brokering a new unity government in Afghanistan and marshaling a new push to confront climate change.

Mr. Obama delivered a searing critique of Russia’s incursions into Ukraine and promised to impose a rising cost on the government of President Vladimir V. Putin for what he called its aggression. He was particularly critical in describing the downing of a Malaysian commercial airliner over eastern Ukraine in July by what the United States and its allies have said was a Russian-made missile system, and he denounced the subsequent efforts to block recovery teams from investigating. All 298 people aboard were killed.

‘‘This is a vision of the world in which might makes right,’’ he said, ‘‘a world in which one nation’s borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed.’’

While Mr. Obama emphasized the new threat from the Islamic State, he also touched on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has faltered badly, despite the energetic diplomacy of Secretary of State John Kerry. The 50-day war in Gaza this summer hardened the differences even further.

‘‘The violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace,’’ the president said. ‘‘That’s something worthy of reflection within Israel. Because let’s be clear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable.’’

Mr. Obama also said the United States would train and equip moderate opposition forces in Syria to counter the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and he repeated calls for a political settlement to end a civil war in Syria that has killed more than 200,000 people.

‘‘Cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass,’’ he said. ‘‘But there is no other way for this madness to end — whether one year from now or 10. I can promise you America will remain engaged in the region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort.’’

The chaotic scene on the Turkish-Syrian border underscored the complexity of the conflict into which the United States is now inserting itself, with far more force than during the three years of the Syrian civil war.

Turkey, a NATO member, has said it will participate in the coalition against the Islamic State but is wary that the fight against the group is empowering separatist Kurdish militants on both sides of the border.

Kurds as well as the Syrian government view Turkey’s involvement with some skepticism. Turkey’s open border with Syria has long facilitated the movements of Islamic State recruits from foreign countries into Syria.

Humanitarian groups say that more people are trying to flee the Kurdish area of Kobani but that thousands are trapped in Syria because the Turkish authorities are blocking the border. That has made the Kurdish population even more restive.

Turkish police officers and soldiers stand guard across dusty fields with riot shields and armored vehicles, having already set up metal gates to control the refugee flow from Syria. Nearby, knots of women sat in brightly colored long dresses on the ground as the hot wind whipped dirt onto their faces, unsure of where to head to after having made it across the border.

Those allowed in, mostly women and children, said that people on the Syrian side were in need of food and water and that livestock were dying of thirst. After having arrived in Turkey, refugees were sleeping in streets and storefronts for lack of shelter, the people said.

Ebola Death Toll Is More Than 2,900, W.H.O. Says

GENEVA — The number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has reached at least 2,917, driven by the continuing rapid spread of the disease in Liberia and Sierra Leone, though in Guinea the number of new cases appears to have stabilized, the World Health Organization reported Thursday.

At least 2,909 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with 6,242 reported Ebola cases over all, according to the latest report of the United Nations health body. Nigeria and Senegal have recorded a total of eight deaths and 21 cases of infection.

More than half the total deaths and infections have occurred in Liberia, which reported more than 1,700 new cases in the last 21 days, the W.H.O. said. In Sierra Leone, two districts at the heart of its Ebola outbreak have recorded declining numbers of people infected, but the organization said further investigation was needed to establish whether this was a clear trend and whether there was at the same time a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the capital, Freetown, as has been reported.

“The situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilized,” the United Nations organization said, observing that the number of new cases in the capital, Conakry was moderate and stable.

The outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal were “pretty much contained,” the health organization’s Africa office reported this week, noting that Senegal had only recorded one case of infection at the end of August, and that Nigeria had not found any new cases since Sept. 8.

The latest estimates of the spread of the disease follow a somber projection by the health organization that the number of people infected by Ebola could hit 20,000 by early November, and another forecast, by the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the number of infections could reach 1.4 million by January.

Both projections presented worst-case scenarios, and officials of both organizations thought it probable that the scaling up of the international response would avert these outcomes.

But seven weeks after the W.H.O. declared the outbreak a global health emergency, its latest report shows the capacity of treatment centers in the worst-affected countries still falling short of requirements.

Liberia’s treatment centers have a total of 315 beds, the health organization reported, putting the number of additional beds needed at 1,990, of which only 440 have so far been pledged. Sierra Leone now has 323 beds, barely a quarter of what is needed, but identified partners have offered nearly 300 of the 829 additional beds needed, the health organization said.

Ebola Epidemic Worsening, Sierra Leone Increases Quarantine Restrictions

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Acknowledging that the Ebola epidemic sweeping Sierra Leone was worsening, officials here put hundreds of thousands more citizens under quarantine on Thursday, sealing off more than a quarter of the country and warning travelers not to get out of their vehicles in the districts under isolation.

Nearly all of the country’s 14 districts are now under either total or partial quarantine, with over one million people affected, as the disease advances into areas that have previously not been affected. Infection rates have been rising in the capital, Freetown, a dangerous development because of the city’s density.

In an address to citizens late Wednesday night, President Ernest Bai Koroma acknowledged that the new quarantine orders would “definitely pose great difficulties for our people,” but he suggested that officials had little choice. Makeni, the largest city in the country’s Northern Province, is in one of the newly quarantined districts, and foreign health care workers are particularly worried about a surge in infections there.

In what appeared to be an acknowledgment that official statistics had so far been misleading, the government said the country’s plight was “worse than what was being reflected in reports,” adding that there was a “desperate need to step up our response.”

A Western diplomat here called Mr. Koroma’s newest restrictive order, coming after a three-day national lockdown that required every citizen to stay inside, “a mitigating measure reacting to a worsening situation.” The diplomat added, “The numbers are not getting better.”

The World Health Organization, echoing the government’s increasingly worried tone, said Thursday that the “situation in Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate,” noting a “sharp increase” in new Ebola cases in Freetown, rising to more than 80 for the week ending Sept. 21.

The W.H.O. said Thursday that there had been 597 deaths in the country and 1,940 Ebola cases, nearly a third of the total for the three West African countries most affected; the other two are Guinea and Liberia.

Over all, the W.H.O. reported, there have been 2,917 deaths from Ebola. At least 2,909 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with 6,242 reported Ebola cases over all, according to its latest report. Nigeria and Senegal have recorded a total of eight deaths and 21 cases of infection.

The numbers for Sierra Leone come from the Ministry of Health, and diplomats and international health officials say they are largely inaccurate, substantially underplaying the gravity of the situation on the ground. “Even a 2-year-old child can look at them and see they don’t add up,” the Western diplomat here said.

The W.H.O. added a veiled caveat to the statistics in its latest report as in the preceding one, saying that they were “subject to change” because of “ongoing reclassification.” Indeed cemetery workers here in the capital report that Ebola deaths far exceed what the government has so far acknowledged.

In contrast, in Guinea, the W.H.O. reported, the number of new cases appears to be rising more slowly.

“The situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilized,” the W.H.O. said, observing that the number of new cases in the capital, Conakry, was moderate and stable.

The outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal were “pretty much contained,” the health organization’s Africa office reported this week, noting that Senegal had recorded only one case of infection at the end of August, and that Nigeria had not found any new cases since Sept. 8.

The streets of Sierra Leone remained uncharacteristically quiet and uncongested Thursday, three days after the government completed the national lockdown intended to “sensitize” citizens on Ebola’s dangers and to root out hidden cases. Officials acknowledge that the economic slowdown because of Ebola continues to bite hard.

Mr. Koroma pronounced the lockdown a success, saying it had “achieved its objectives.” But with the latest measures, it seemed clear that the government was determined to go further, adding new restrictions to citizens’ movements.

With hospital beds well below what are needed for the number of cases, a national health care system that is “invisible,” as one leading foreign medical worker here put it, and the international response only now gearing up, the government here is left to pursue the only means at its disposal: coercion.

Travel through the districts under isolation to those that are not is now restricted to the hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. In individual infected chiefdoms — traditional administrative units — within the newly quarantined districts, Mr. Koroma took the extraordinary step of warning citizens not to “travel to any other chiefdom until further notice.”

The president, sounding grim, said in his speech that “the life of everyone and the survival of our country take precedence” over whatever hardships the latest measures might impose. He vowed to “overcome and free our land from this evil virus.”

Tourists are urged to avoid Ebola zone; International Traveler

The Ebola outbreak has gripped broad swaths of West Africa, reaching Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal.

As of Sept. 18, according to the World Health Organization, nearly 6,000 cases and more than 2,800 deaths had resulted from the disease, and a separate outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused at least 35 deaths.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Watch Level 3 warning (‘‘avoid nonessential travel’’) for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a Level 2 warning (‘‘practice enhanced precautions’’) for Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Tourists should not visit these areas. The C.D.C. has recommended that foreign exchange, research and other education-related travel be postponed until further notice. Although the situation can change rapidly, there is now no risk of contracting Ebola in countries in West Africa without reported cases.

Ebola is a viral illness, spread by direct contact with the blood, urine, saliva, feces, vomit or semen of an infected person. It is also spread by direct contact with infected fruit bats, monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees or their meat, and by contaminated objects like needles or soiled bed linen and clothing.

The virus is not transmitted by coughing or sneezing or otherwise through the air, so avoiding direct contact prevents spreading the disease. Objects and surfaces can easily be disinfected with household bleach.

The reported fatality rate in West Africa is about 70 percent, but Dr. Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading in England, said that may change. ‘‘There’s a surge of new cases now and we’ll see whether they survive or die,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re underestimating the death rate now.’’

It can take as long as three weeks after initial infection for symptoms to appear, but being near an infected but asymptomatic person, on an airplane for example, is not a problem. ‘‘The virus comes out in the last days before a person dies,’’ Dr. Neuman said. ‘‘They have horrible diarrhea, they’re vomiting. Sitting next to someone who has Ebola but no symptoms is not dangerous.’’

Anyone in the affected countries who gets a fever and symptoms like headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain or unexplained bleeding or bruising should avoid all contact with others and travel immediately to a doctor’s office or hospital.

Travelers to these regions should be aware that any country has the right to restrict exit and entry of apparently infected people, impose quarantines, and take measures that some may view as infringements on individual rights.

Vaccines are under development, but the soonest they will be available is in about two months, and it may take years. Some antiviral medicines have been used, but none has proved effective. In the meantime, prevention and palliative care are the only effective approaches.

The C.D.C. suggests that travelers returning from West Africa, even those without symptoms, visit a doctor when they get home. The doctor will evaluate the traveler and consult with public health authorities to decide what further actions to take. Those who were in an area with an outbreak should monitor their health for 21 days after their return, taking their temperature daily and watching for other symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should stay away from others and call a doctor immediately.

The danger should not be exaggerated, said Dr. Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. ‘‘The risk of infection even if you go there, unless you visit a family where there is an Ebola patient or visit a patient in a hospital, is very small. On the other hand,’’ he said, ‘‘if you don’t have to go there, don’t.’’

Global Response to Ebola Is Too Slow, Obama Warns

UNITED NATIONS — Seeking to speed the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, President Obama delivered a blunt warning on Thursday at a high-level United Nations meeting devoted to the health crisis: the world was doing too little and moving too slowly.

Mr. Obama cited his announcement last week that the Pentagon would build a field hospital and treatment units in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone – along with the establishment of a United Nations emergency mission to respond to the Ebola outbreak – as positive steps.

“But I want us to be clear: We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough,” the president said. “There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be.”

Mr. Obama called on countries to supply air transportation and medical evacuation services, as well as doctors and medical equipment. The United States, he said, could build a network of treatment centers but did not have enough doctors by itself to contain the outbreak.

The initial American response to the outbreak also came under criticism for being slow-footed and inadequate. But after visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta last week, where he announced a new military command in Liberia – with about 3,000 doctors and other personnel – and plans to build 17 Ebola treatment centers, Mr. Obama clearly felt emboldened to prod others to do more.

On Wednesday, Mr. Obama cast the American response to Ebola as one of a series of global challenges in which the United States was taking the lead. A day later, he modified his prepared remarks to take less credit for the American relief effort and to put more pressure on other countries not to use that response as an excuse not to act.

“We will not stop, we will not relent until we halt this epidemic, once and for all,” Mr. Obama said. “But I hope I’m properly communicating the sense of urgency here. Do not stand by thinking that somehow because of what we’ve done, it’s taken care of. It’s not.”

“If we move fast, even if imperfectly,” he added, “that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.”

Mr. Obama and his fellow leaders heard a stark message from doctors on the front lines of the outbreak. They described wholesale panic, with desperate patients, angry family members, infection rates doubling every three weeks, and the collapse of public health systems, which has led to outbreaks of other deadly diseases like malaria.

Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said her organization’s hospital in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, opens for only 30 minutes each morning, rapidly filling the few beds that became free overnight because of the deaths.

“The sick continue to be turned away, only to return home and spread the virus among loved ones and neighbors,” she said. “The isolation centers you have promised must be established now.”

Doctors Without Borders is calling for a centralized system that can be tapped when an aid worker from abroad falls sick, so they can be evacuated safely no matter their nationality.

Sierra Leone’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, addressing the meeting by video-conference from his country, appealed for the lifting of bans by airlines on commercial flights to and from the region. He also asked for more treatment centers, labs, and equipment, as well as training for the overwhelmed health workers in his country.

Mr. Koroma explained how his government had locked down the entire country for three days – forbidding people from leaving their houses – so it could send out thousands of volunteers to assess the spread of the disease. The survey found the situation was worse than expected.

The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, who convened the meeting, said that contributions of member states “are falling significantly short of the twenty-fold surge that is required.”

One of the key shortfalls, United Nations officials and aid workers have said, is the urgent need for countries to agree to transport and treat aid workers who are infected. The United Nations emergency mission, which is based in Accra, Ghana, and is headed by Anthony Banbury, is preparing to deploy personnel to the region this weekend.

Beyond the immediate challenge, Mr. Ban said, the United Nations should consider creating a corps of health workers, modeled on the United Nations peacekeeping forces, who could be deployed to countries on short notice to combat such outbreaks.

“Just as our troops in blue helmets help keep people safe,” Mr. Ban said, “a corps in white coats could help keep people safe.”

The World Bank announced that it would double its funding for fighting the disease, to $400 million. The International Crisis Group, an independent nonprofit organization, has called for an urgent donor meeting, warning that failing to contain Ebola could send already fragile West Africa into renewed instability.

“The question is really how fast things are put in place,” said Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist and the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, who attended the meeting.

“This is an epidemic that can be brought under control quickly if facilities and health workers and protocols are in place,” Mr. Sachs said. “These numbers of one million and two million – those are if the epidemic just runs out of control.”

The biggest message out of the meeting, he said, was that the deployment of resources, including health workers, and the construction of treatment centers, need to be done quickly.

Margaret Chan, a Hong Kong physician who is the director-general of the World Health Organization, said that because the response had lagged so far behind the spread of the disease, “we should expect things to get worse before getting better.”

The United Nations warned that without stronger efforts to contain the disease, more than 20,000 people could be infected with Ebola by early November. On Thursday, in its latest update, the World Health Organization reported 6,242 cases of the disease, and 2,917 deaths, in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

The report, jointly compiled by the W.H.O. and Imperial College in London, called for better management of clinics, more effective isolation of those infected, more thorough tracing of where patients contract the disease, and more support from other countries.

Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

Obama Could Push for Lame-Duck Approval of Attorney General

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times

Good morning from Washington at the end of a very newsy week.

With Eric H. Holder Jr. departing the attorney general’s office[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/us/politics/a-champion-of-civil-rights-if-not-of-civil-liberties-just-like-his-hero.html?ref=politics&_r=0], a question is now captivating Washington: How big a fight is the president willing to wage over his replacement?

President Obama’s selection of a nominee – and his decision on how quickly to push the Senate for approval – will reveal much about how he envisions his relationship with Republicans in his final two years in office.

Democratic leaders seem open to pushing a new attorney general through the Senate in the coming lame-duck session, a provocative move that would anger Republicans[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/us/politics/eric-holder-resigning-as-attorney-general.html?rref=politics&module=Ribbon&version=context®ion=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&pgtype=article] and potentially undermine the new head of the Justice Department.

While no timetable has been set or a candidate even named, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said on Thursday that any nominee deserved “swift and fair” consideration — a statement that could be read as laying the groundwork for a quick confirmation fight.

Republicans warned Democrats to slow down, with Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, cautioning Democrats against trying to rush a nominee through. Other Republicans said such an effort would be seen as a hostile strong-arm tactic that the party would not take lightly.

They said it would be more poisonous if the Democrats acted after losing the Senate in the midterms, as is quite possible. They would essentially be using their few remaining weeks of power and a change in Senate rules to install one of the most important figures in the cabinet, with oversight of some of the most polarizing issues separating the two parties, like immigration, guns and voter identification laws.

The White House declined to say on Thursday whether the president would make a choice in time for consideration in the lame-duck session that begins Nov. 12. But the administration appears to be preparing to do so.

The confirmation process is not short: It requires that the nominee complete an extensive questionnaire and undergo an F.B.I. background check. Then there are hearings, written questions, and answers. And, of course, Republicans retain the ability to delay committee and floor consideration.

Both sides said that, even on an accelerated timetable, it would probably take well into December before a vote.

A decision by Mr. Obama to wait until the new Congress is seated in January to seek confirmation could signal the president’s eagerness to have a consensus attorney general, embraced – or at least accepted – by both parties. A decision to rush would show that the president and Senate Democrats have decided that they want the president to have his pick, despite the anger it would set off among Republicans.

After Holder: The Guessing Game Begins

Administration officials were firm that President Obama was only beginning to think about a new attorney general, but many in Washington are already focusing on Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel, who recently returned to private practice.

Ms. Ruemmler, 43, is known to be highly trusted by the president, and she helped guide his thinking on gay rights, the health care law and the reach of executive authority.

She is one of only three women to serve as White House counsel.

Ms. Ruemmler, who grew up in Washington State and studied law at Georgetown, also has a history of winning over skeptical Republicans. “You never had to question where she was coming from, and she never volunteered something she didn’t know,” said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia. “She is very precise but very firm also, and held her own well.”

She also won admirers as a lead prosecutor on the Enron task force. But if Ms. Ruemmler is nominated, the advice she dispensed to the White House about the I.R.S. scandal and the attacks on Benghazi, Libya, will certainly draw scrutiny.

What I Did on My Summer Vacation, Supreme Court Edition

Back when he was a young lawyer in the Reagan White House, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was tartly dismissive of the Supreme Court’s long summer break.

“Only Supreme Court justices and schoolchildren,” he wrote[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context=historical], “are expected to and do take the entire summer off.”

There are emergency matters, of course, and petitions for review keep piling up. But the justices themselves are seldom seen in Washington from the end of June to the first Monday in October, when the new term begins.

Chief Justice Roberts leaves town as soon as the court finishes its work to teach a course in Europe.

Justice Antonin Scaliaalso taught abroad[http://www.nesl.edu.proxy.bc.edu/students/international_galway.cfm] this summer, in Galway, Ireland. He was so eager to get started that he missed the last day of the term[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2014/scotus_roundup/supreme_court_hobby_lobby_decision_where_was_antonin_scalia.html], when the court announced its decision in the Hobby Lobby case[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf].

As he has for 25 years now, Justice Anthony M. Kennedytaught in Salzburg, Austria[http://www.mcgeorge.edu/Future_Students/Global_Impact/Summer_Abroad_Programs/Summer_Program_in_Salzburg.htm]. Conservative critics say he has picked up dangerous ideas in the Alps, and they have criticized his tendency to cite foreign law in his opinions, including on gay rights[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context=historical] and the death penalty[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZO.html].

The other justices kept busy “with writers’ conferences, state bar luncheons, award ceremonies and more,” according to an interactive map[http://www.scotusmap.com/] prepared by Victoria Kwan[http://jaypinho.com/author/victoriakwan/] and Jay Pinho[http://jaypinho.com/about/], two Supreme Court obsessives.

That includes Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who attended the Glimmerglass Festival[http://glimmerglass.org/festival/2014-special-events/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg/] in Cooperstown, N.Y., and spoke to the Women’s International Study Center[http://wisc-amh.org/announcements/view/10-save-the-date-wisc-inaugural-symposium-featuring-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg] in Santa Fe, N.M.

Ther[http://web.wmitchell.edu/international/mitchell-in-london/]e is an upside to all of th[https://www.stcl.edu/study-abroad/prague2013red2forWW2red.pdf]is activity, the young Mr. Roberts wrote in 1983[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context=historical]. With the justices off teaching and speaking, he said, “we know that the Constitution is safe for the summer.”

The Upshot: G.O.P. Retains Upper Hand in Senate Races

With 39 days until the election, the Upshot Senate model[http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/] gives the Republicans a 61 percent chance of retaking the Senate. Thursday’s polls improved the party’s chances in Colorado and Alaska, two states Democrats will probably need to hold to retain control of the chamber.

What We’re Watching Today

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. may be moving on, but he is not leaving town just yet. At 7 p.m. he will speak at the Voting Rights Brain Trust, the annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Stars of the Republican Party are in Washington for the Values Voter Summit[http://www.valuesvotersummit.org/schedule] this weekend. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will be headlining sessions Friday morning, while Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Sarah Palin will be speaking Friday afternoon.

President Obama is back from the United Nations General Assembly, and the spread of Ebola remains top of mind. At 11:40 a.m. he will be speaking at the Global Health Security Agenda Summit at the White House.He’ll also be sitting down with CBS’s Steve Kroft for an interview that will air on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night.

A Wikipedia Vandal With an Address on Capitol Hill

There’s a Wikipedia vandal in the House of Representatives.

Someone with access to the House’s internal network has been making anonymous changes to the online encyclopedia that violate its guidelines. The user was blocked on Monday from making any changes for three months.

The edits themselves, which include adding a line to the page on Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, about his arm-wrestling match with Vladimir V. Putin[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=626647153&oldid=625006615], are mostly forgettable. But the discussion among Wikipedians is not.

A Wikipedia community member, JohnValeron[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JohnValeron], wrote that the anonymous user’s work “(a) reinforces the public perception of the U.S. House of Representatives as a laughing stock and (b) cements Wikipedia’s reputation as a playground for fools masquerading as editors.”

The edits, which normally don’t get much attention, have won notice through the Twitter account @congressedits[https://twitter.com/congressedits], which tracks Wikipedia changes that originate from computers within the House and Senate networks.

The edits aren’t even the first go-round for the IP address involved this time: It was first temporarily banned from making changes to Wikipedia in 2008[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=User%3A143.231.249.138&type=block].

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Grounded.

It is unclear when flights will resume out of Chicago, where a fire at an FAA radar center caused the cancellation[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/26/us/ap-us-chicago-airports-ground-stop.html] of hundreds of flights there and across the country.

• The day after.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. delivered[http://www.c-span.org/video/?321674-2/discussion-voting-rights-attorney-general-eric-holder] opening remarks at a Washington event on voting rights.

President Obama’s announcement on Thursday that Mr. Holder would leave the administration has set up[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/us/politics/eric-holder-resigning-as-attorney-general.html] a scramble for a replacement.

• Adding to a coalition.

British Parliament members are debating[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/world/europe/british-parliament-vote-isis-airstrikes.html] the prime minister’s request for military action against the Islamic State in northern Iraq (but not in Syria). They’re expected to vote within hours.

And the Danish today committed seven fighter jets to the fight against ISIS, The A.P. reported.

• From outcast to red carpet.

India’s prime minister begins a high-profile five-day visit[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/asia/narendra-modi-defies-expectations-with-mix-of-soft-and-severe-in-india.html] today to New York and Washington.

On Thursday, a federal court issued a summons[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/world/asia/us-court-issues-summons-to-modi-in-lawsuit-over-2002-riots.html] for him to respond to a lawsuit in that case.

• At the United Nations.

President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authorityaddresses[http://mobile.nytimes.com/news/un-general-assembly/2014/09/21/president-mahmoud-abbas-of-the-palestinian-authority-u-n-general-assembly-speech/] the General Assembly today, a day after leaders of rival Palestinian factions agreed to resolve[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/middleeast/palestinian-factions-agree-to-resolve-differences-leaders-say.html] their differences.

That paves the way for the authority to return to the Gaza Strip so reconstruction can begin.

• International focus.

Mr. Obama, after speaking at a high-level U.N. meeting on Thursday devoted to Ebola, addresses a meeting on global health security at the White House today.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in New York for a conference on U.N. peacekeeping, and Secretary of State John Kerry continues high-level meetings on the sidelines of the General Assembly.

• Facing a new prison term.

A teacher who spent one month in prison for the rape of a 14-year-old student is back in court today to be resentenced[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/26/us/ap-us-teacher-rape-case.html].

BACK STORY

Every other year, 12 American golfers and 12 European players meet in either the United States or Europe for a three-day tournament known as the Ryder Cup.

The 40th matchup began today in Gleneagles, Scotland, where the Ryder Cup has its origins.

In the early 20th century, American golf was shadowed by a painful failure. No U.S. player had ever won the prestigious British Open.

So in 1921, American benefactors sponsored a team of American players for an informal U.S.-Britain competition at Gleneagles[http://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/top-stories/gleneagles-is-the-spiritual-home-of-ryder-cup-1-3105930], hoping to give the Americans greater exposure and additional practice.

The U.S. team lost[http://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/top-stories/gleneagles-is-the-spiritual-home-of-ryder-cup-1-3105930]. But one player, Jock Hutchison, an American born in Scotland, won the British Open a few weeks later.

The competition at Gleneagles was considered a success.

Samuel Ryder, an English businessman, agreed to sponsor the first formal edition of the tournament, held in 1927 in Worcester, Mass.

Joseph Burgess and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.

When you think of military intervention in 2014, the presumed purpose is to combat some form of insurgency, or to help topple a dictator: the French in northern Mali[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/world/africa/mali-islamist-rebels-france.html] and the Central African Republic[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/france-adds-troops-in-central-african-republic.html?_r=0], NATO in Libya[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/31iht-eddaalder31.html] or, of course, the United States in Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/middleeast/us-and-allies-hit-isis-targets-in-syria.html].

But another kind of global crisis may warrant outside military assistance: the potential pandemic.

Nearly half of those infected by a particularly virulent strain of Ebola currently burning through West Africa have died, according to the World Health Organization. The official count is 2,803 fatalities as of Sept. 23, with observers predicting 20,000 new cases by November if a containment strategy isn’t quickly formulated and implemented. As Denise Grady writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/health/ebola-cases-could-reach-14-million-in-4-months-cdc-estimates.html] for The New York Times, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts a “worst-case scenario” increase to 1.4 million cases by early 2015.

President Obama announced last week that the United States would deploy 3,000 military personnel to West Africa, concentrating in Liberia, to assist local forces in stanching the disease’s spread. They will be accompanied by $750 million in aid, according to a White House news release[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/16/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa].

“The scale of the U.S. response to Ebola, primarily focused on Liberia’s staggering outbreak, dwarfs that of all other nations and to date is the only external support that will involve uniformed military engagement,” says[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/16/can_the_us_army_degrade_and_destroy_ebola] Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health with the Council on Foreign Relations, writing for Foreign Policy. “The world’s newfound sense of immediacy in the Ebola fight is coming late, and the response will succeed — or fail — based on the pace of execution in getting these much-needed resources on the ground.”

Some might wonder what, specifically, the United States military can do to combat the spread of a virus — a foe not as neatly quantified as ISIS or Al Qaeda. First, it’s worth noting that, in America, the military has a history of vested interest in disease containment. According to Howard Markel, speaking with[http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119488/us-military-combats-ebola] The New Republic’s Rebecca Leber, the United States military has engaged more effectively in epidemic prevention “than almost any other organization outside of the C.D.C.”

It’s a defense issue, he says, as agencies must determine the best methods for keeping soldiers disease-free while deployed abroad — not just for their own health, but to eliminate the possibility that a serviceman or woman might bring deadly pathogens back to the United States from afield.

In practical terms, doctors and nurses alone simply aren’t trained or psychologically prepared to operate in the world’s more volatile regions. “The health community has faced resistance (sometimes violent resistance) in trying to spread awareness” about Ebola, Ms. Leber remarks — particularly in areas of West Africa, where a vocal minorities adamantly believes the virus is a myth[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-myths-help-spread-deadly-disease-9617518.html] concocted by corrupt local governments and Western imperialists. “A month ago, Guinea saw riots,” Ms. Leber reports. “On Tuesday, six journalists and medics were attacked and disappeared,” according to a report[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443] from the BBC.

Despite the doggedness of local deniers, the situation on the ground is clearly growing worse. In Liberia, “hospitals have become quarantine zones for the dead and soon-to-be dead,” report[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-09-16/why-the-ebola-crisis-wont-end-without-military-intervention] Steve Brozak and Anne Marie Noronha for Bloomberg Businessweek. “Medicine is no longer even being used on people infected with Ebola. It is especially clear that Liberia’s government is incapable of managing a response; even elected officials have fled the nation. Doctors and nurses have either perished from Ebola or have left the country due to a lack of support and concern for their safety.”

“Amid the collapse of health-care infrastructure, it is only a matter of time before total chaos descends,” they predict. And the crisis won’t end without a coordinated, international military response: “Even if Ebola doesn’t mutate to become more infectious, we must accept that this virus is no longer an African problem — so far away geographically that it’s hard to imagine it touching our own lives,” they write. But “a single passenger on a ship or an airplane could spread the virus to another continent.”

As Western governments focus relief efforts on former colonies, perhaps the United States has realized a special obligation to Liberia, a country it helped found in the 19th century under the advisement of President James Monroe. Writing for The New York Times, Helene Cooper explains[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/africa/liberian-president-pleads-with-obama-for-assistance-in-combating-ebola.html], “In an echo of the colonialism that characterized West Africa in the 19th century, Britain has focused its assistance efforts on its former colony Sierra Leone,” while “France has sent medical experts to its former colony Guinea. That leaves Liberia, with its historic ties to America’s antebellum era, in the United States’ hands.”

This is apparently how the rest of the world sees the relationship, too. According to Ms. Cooper, the Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, told the press that “a health expert with the French group Doctors Without Borders told her recently: ‘We’re French. You’ve got America behind you; why should we have to do this for you?’”

The relationship between Washington and Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, may be frayed, but the country’s problems — H.I.V./AIDs, civil war and rife governmental corruption — have all left indelible marks on its society and, some say[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/16/ebola-impact-publichealth.html], are to blame for the rapid spread of Ebola there. “Now,” Ishaan Tharoor writes for The Washington Post, “it needs its founding nation’s help to withstand its latest trial.”

Will 3,000 American soldiers and $750 million in aid prove sufficient? A few conservative commentators have their doubts[http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/09/17/conservatives-find-a-way-to-attack-obama-for-fi/200790] (“I didn’t know you could shoot a virus. Did you?” Rush Limbaugh said), though a few have thrown their weight behind the White House’s plan. The Fox News contributor and Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said, during an airing of Fox News’s “Special Report” last week: “I applaud what the president is doing. This is America at its best. Our armed forces are essentially the biggest N.G.O. on the planet for helping people, the way we did in the tsunami, the way we do in Haiti. It is organized to go and to establish institutions and structures, and that’s what it’s going to do.”

Still, others worry a more substantial Western military presence in the region will inflame colonial-era tensions. In an interview [http://news.yahoo.com/ebola-denial-revolt-against-colonial-mindset-expert-054418266.html]with Malick Rokhy Ba for Agence France-Presse, the Senegalese social anthropologist Cheikh Ibrahima Niang said, “When people say that Ebola does not exist, they are rebelling against something. They are in situations where they were not consulted and feel that they are treated with a lot of paternalism.”

“Niang believes that talk of the African reluctance to accept modern clinical practices comes from a ‘reductive medial vision,’” Mr. Ba writes. “The problem is not that locals don’t accept medicine can work, it’s that they are mistrustful of an invading culture coming into their homeland telling them how they should behave.”

But with 1.4 million potential Ebola infections on the horizon, Liberians (and West Africans in general) may need to take help where they can get it.

We recently introduced a new feature [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/], NYTLNreads, and are inviting teachers and students everywhere to participate by simply telling us [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/] what you’ve been reading in The Times recently, and why you’d recommend it to others.

This week we gathered some recommendations from the students of Jan Bone, an 83-year-old New York Times fan who has been teaching for 42 years.

For the last two years Ms. Bone has taught exclusively online because the onset of Parkinson’s disease has affected her mobility too much to be in the classroom. But, she writes, she loves teaching so much that she is planning to get speech recognition software so she can continue working when she can no longer type. To see a photo of Ms. Bone, and learn more about how she teaches with The Times, scroll to the bottom of this post.

But first, some of the students from her online English Composition course at Roosevelt University [http://www.roosevelt.edu/] share a few of the articles they would recommend this week.

Times Recommendations From Students

Charles on ‘What Is the Right Way to Travel?’ [http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/what-is-the-right-way-to-travel/]

Traveling is not always about completing a bucket list just for the sake of doing it. Instead, the writer suggests that peoplewho are traveling take on challenges and do things that will make them feel more fulfilled and actually have meaning in their lives. I like to travel and I agree with the article. It’s important to find new things in life that have meaning, not just to do things to say you did.

Aleksandra on ‘Lockdown Begins in Sierra Leone to Battle Ebola’ [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html]

This article is an eye-opener for readers because it describes a typical day in West Africa since the Ebola outbreak.

The government issued a lockdown in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading. One part talks about a woman curled in a fetal position on cardboard sheets and the five hours’ wait time for an ambulance to show up. It took a second ambulance and the president of a moped club to pick up the sick woman because the first attendants refused to take her because they had no chlorine spray and said it was not their job.

It is our responsibility to help the less fortunate. This is one war that we should be fighting.

Emma V. on ‘Too Young to Die, Too Old to Worry’ [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/opinion/sunday/too-young-to-die-too-old-to-worry.html]

My great-aunt is 85 years old, and I consider her to be superwoman. She gets up every morning, walks during the sunrise, and every summer travels all over the country to visit her nine children and her 15 grandchildren. At 85 years old, she is the healthiest and happiest person I know. Sure, she has some health problems, but she is living her life, doing what she loves to do.

As a young adult, I am at a place in my life where all I am doing is thinking about the future. As a graduate student, first-year teacher, and small-business owner, I am just trying to get my feet on the ground. I get so caught up in my career, school work, and trying to make sure I live a healthy lifestyle to prevent future complications, I am seeing myself forgetting about and letting down my own friends and family. I question myself: Am I living in the present? Or am I just another person blinded by the future?

Nathan on ‘Do You Need a Worse Phone?’ [http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/do-you-need-a-worse-phone/]

This article talks about how smartphones consume people, and how people might be more free just going back to a flip phone. I feel going back to flip phones might not be a bad thing since sometimes having a smartphone is more of a burden than anything else. You meet up with friends, a majority of them are on their phones; social events now are turning into social events on phones more than they are with the people that are at the event. If you ask a group of people to give up their smartphones for a week, most wouldn’t be able to last past 24 hours.

Flip phones are basic, but they get the job done. The amount of time people spent on a smartphone checking social media could be spent doing more productive things.

Juliana on ‘In the Emergency Room, a Hidden Ailment’ [http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/in-the-emergency-room-a-hidden-ailment/]

This article was about elderly patients arriving at the emergency room malnourished. The article gave statistics, and I was not at all surprised. When I was working in a morgue, I found elderly patients that were clearly poorly taken care of. I was reminded of one patient who had bedsores all over her back but was receiving care at a very well-respected facility.

Everyone should take time to take a close look and ensure that their elderly loved ones are being taken care of properly.

Matthew M. on ‘How Insurers Are Finding Ways to Shift Costs to the Sick’ [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/upshot/how-insurers-are-finding-ways-to-shift-costs-to-the-sick.html]

Insurance companies are trying to shift the cost to the sick by making the people pay more for their drugs, according to this article. This happened to me with a generic medicine I use for my psoriasis. I am afraid if I ever need serious surgery that even after the insurance covers their share I will not be able to afford the huge bill. Insurance companies are, like any other business, in it to make money and work around regulations. This puts the burden on families like mine.

Jan Bone on How She Used The Times in Her Teaching This Week

Each week this semester, students in my online course, English Composition II, Introduction to Academic Research, are required to choose a Times article that is open to online comment.

They need to read the article thoroughly, download and save it on their computers, then write a spell-checked and proofread comment and post it on the Times site. They then send me a link to it, and it becomes part of their grade for the class. Their final portfolio will include a self-selection of five comments that have been published and will be shared with the group.

I teach with the New York Times because the breadth and depth of Times coverage extend student learning and encourage their subsequent engagement beyond where learners too often stop.

A note to me this week from Aleksandra: “My comment was approved! It’s very short, but I will make the next one better.”

What would your class recommend? Tell us below, on Twitter with the hashtag #NYTLNreads [https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23NYTLNreads&src=typd], or via the form in our introductory post [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/introducing-a-new-crowdsourced-feature-nytlnreads/].

Health
Ebola Doctor Shortage Eases as Volunteers Begin to Step Forward

Doctors and nurses are finally volunteering to fight the Ebola virus in West Africa after a long period of paralyzing fear in which almost none stepped forward.

But, experts say, even though money is now pouring in from the World Bank, the Gates Foundation and elsewhere, and the United States Army is to start erecting field hospitals soon, there is likely to be a long gap before those hospitals can be fully staffed to care for the growing numbers of people sick with Ebola.

“As a result, thousands of people will die,” said Dr. Joanne Liu, president of Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/], which treats more patients than any other entity. “I can’t say the exact figure because we don’t know how many unreported cases there are. But thousands for sure.”

Because months went by this summer in which almost no volunteers could be found, and because it takes time to train them and get them to Africa, there remains a yawning gap between the number of medical professionals needed and those in place to do the work. Each 100-bed hospital needs a staff of 400, about 40 of whom are foreign doctors or nurses. Meanwhile, about 600 Ebola cases are being recorded every week, according to the World Health Organization, and that number doubles every three weeks.

“If we had 1,700 staffed beds right now, we could maybe turn the tide,” Dr. Liu said. “When we hear the pledges, we ask for timelines. Some say eight to 10 weeks. They’re going to wake up to a much bigger problem at Christmas.”

The first American troops with orders to build 17 100-bed hospitals are arriving in Liberia now. Other countries, particularly Britain and France, are under pressure to do the same in Sierra Leone and Guinea.

But the American military now plans to staff only one 25-bed hospital for infected health workers with members of the quasi-military Public Health Service[http://www.usphs.gov/].

“Who will staff the rest?” asked Dr. Liu, whose agency is known by its French initials, M.S.F. “It needs to be hands-on. You have to chip in and expose yourself.”

Ebola field hospitals ideally contain three separate tents for confirmed, probable and suspected cases; separate toilet and washing facilities for each; and a double fence outside so relatives can talk without touching. They also contain separate dressing and undressing rooms for staff members wearing protective gear, and possibly laboratory and kitchen tents.

The few medical charities that do the risky work of treating patients have scoured their rosters of veterans and asked them to recommend colleagues.

A month ago, those agencies — including Doctors Without Borders and the International Medical Corps[https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/2014_08_04_ebola-hub-page#.VCWMyxbiswI] — had almost no volunteers. The corps had only seven responses to its first appeal. Four years ago, after the earthquake in Haiti, it got 2,000.

Now they — with the recent addition of Partners in Health[http://act.pih.org/page/content/ebola-recruitment], the medical charity run by Dr. Paul Farmer at Harvard Medical School — each have more than 100 professionals expressing interest. More than 1,600 others have signed up through the United States Agency for International Development.

“It really turned around in the last two weeks,” said Dr. Ariel Pablos-Méndez, the development agency’s assistant administrator for global health. More media coverage, appeals by President Obama, and radio and TV appearances by the U.S.A.I.D. administrator, Dr. Rajiv Shah, mentioning the website for volunteers[http://www.usaid.gov/ebola/volunteers] all helped, he said.

But the agency is still granting access to its list slowly, through a subcontractor, and the charities are carefully winnowing their own lists, looking first for those who have worked in disaster areas or now work in hospital wards with the meticulous protection measures needed to prevent Ebola transmission.

There is no time to teach beginners the basics or worry about newcomers who might have panic attacks, the agencies said.

“Once the first group comes back safe and sound, we hope that will encourage recruitment,” said Rabih Torbay, head of international operations for the International Medical Corps.

In the meantime, there are delays. People who are accepted must get permission to take six weeks off work and need visas and specialized training.

For the corps and for Doctors Without Borders, that training involves at least three days in Brussels. Then they get five to seven days in West Africa, working on patients under supervision.

The American military said it would train 500 health workers a week in Africa. But like other experts working there, Dr. Liu is skeptical, saying her agency, which has trained over 2,000 local people since March, was having trouble recruiting more.

A big problem, she said, it that many local hires cannot go home at night because their families are afraid. They will eventually need housing.

Doctors Without Bordersnow has 239 international volunteers[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-with-us], with enough veterans in the pipeline to fill its next round of six-week commitments. It operates six facilities with a total of 532 beds in the three countries, and plans to add only 35 more beds.

The corps has 25 confirmed American volunteers and recently got access to the U.S.A.I.D. list. It has also recruited about 250 doctors and nurses from India, the Philippines, Jordan, Kenya and Ethiopia. It pays $4,500 a month.

“That’s pretty good money for people from some countries,” Mr. Torbay said.

Doctors Without Borders, in contrast, pays about $1,700 to first-time volunteers, said Kate Mort, head of field operations for its American branch.

Thus far, Partners in Health has heard from 107 volunteers since it put out its first appeal on Sept. 11, said Jeff Marvin, a spokesman.

Dr. Hernando Garzon, a 50-year-old physician who just signed up to go to Sierra Leone with the corps, is the ideal volunteer.

He has previously taken time off from his job in a Kaiser Permanente hospital in California to work in Jordan, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Haiti and Pakistan during earthquakes, war and political violence. Two of his children, ages 19 and 23, joined him in Haiti and Kenya.

“The people in my life understand that I’ve been doing this for 20 years,” he said in a telephone interview, “and it’s part of what I am.”

Before he volunteered, he analyzed why so many health workers got infected, and decided they had made mistakes he would not. They did not realize their patients had Ebola, or they lacked protective gear, or were not trained to use it.

“Fear of the unknown is a big factor,” he said.

After Ebola Outbreak, Obama Calls for Global Effort to Help Prevent Epidemics

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Friday called on nations around the world to develop more effective health care systems to prevent deadly outbreaks like the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus that is rapidly spreading across West Africa.

“Each time the world scrambles to coordinate a response, each time it’s been harder than it should be to share information and contain the outbreak,” Mr. Obama told health ministers from more than 40 nations who had gathered at the White House for a global health security summit meeting. “It is unacceptable if, because of lack of preparedness and planning and global preparation, people are dying.”

Mr. Obama’s remarks were the centerpiece of a daylong meeting the White House organized in February, before the current Ebola outbreak. Mr. Obama’s aides said the goal was to persuade other countries to treat biological threats — whether manufactured or natural — as national security issues that need to be prevented or contained.

American officials announced that participants in the summit meeting had agreed to work collaboratively during the next five years to improve the capacity to detect diseases early, diagnose them quickly and respond to their spread. Countries that have more advanced health systems will work with countries that need assistance in building up more capacity, Mr. Obama said.

“No nation can meet these challenges on its own,” Mr. Obama said. “Nobody is that isolated anymore. Oceans don’t protect you. Walls don’t protect you.”

Mr. Obama used the opportunity of the health summit meeting to renew his call for a global response to the Ebola crisis in Africa. He said that experts predicted that hundreds of thousands of people could die from the disease within months if more was not done to confront its spread.

He said the United States had increased aid to the region, and he thanked the Japanese government for the purchase of 500,000 pieces of ventilated suits for health care workers to use as they treat people infected with Ebola in Africa.

But he implored countries to do more and said that because of the virus, health systems were overwhelmed, “leaving people dying on the streets." Public health systems, he said, are near collapse.

American officials at the health summit meeting said the Ebola outbreak was a warning sign for the world about how fragile many health systems were. Lisa Monaco, the president’s chief counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, said Friday that the government must protect Americans from deadly pathogens just as they seek to protect against terrorists and other threats.

“What they all have in common is they all require a unified approach and a unified response,” Ms. Monaco said. “To meet these threats, every part of our government must work together.”

As evidence of the need to see global health as a security matter, the Obama administration’s top national security officials attended the summit meeting, including Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel; the secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell; and Susan Rice, the national security adviser.

The race to control the expanding Ebola epidemic in West Africa looks increasingly dire. Official projections of how fast the virus will spread have soared while pledges of help from advanced nations and global organizations have failed to keep pace.

On Sept. 22, the World Health Organizationpublished estimates [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/health-agencys-new-assessment-of-the-epidemic-is-more-dire-still.html] indicating that the epidemic could infect more than 20,000 people in the three hardest hit countries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — by early November, months before earlier estimates. Unless new measures can turn the tide, the number of cases and deaths could increase by thousands per week for months to come. It is possible that the virus will become permanently lodged in the West African population, posing a continuing threat of dispersal to the rest of Africa and other parts of the world.

On Sept 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta issued in a worst-case projection [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/health/ebola-cases-could-reach-14-million-in-4-months-cdc-estimates.html], based on computer models, showing that Sierra Leone and Liberia may have 1.4 million cases by Jan. 20 if the disease keeps spreading without effective containment. A best-case scenario showed that the epidemic could be brought to an end if 70 percent of the patients were treated in settings like isolation wards that reduce the risk of disease transmission and if burials were performed safely. Currently, only about 18 percent of the patients in Liberia and 40 percent in Sierra Leone are in such settings.

There is an urgent need to provide more health workers to track down every patient’s contacts for testing, and more workers to bury victims safely. Home health kits are needed to protect people from infection when family members become sick, and local leaders must persuade an often hostile public to take precautions. Health care systems that have disintegrated must be rebuilt so that people don’t die from other afflictions while treatment facilities are clogged with Ebola patients. It is a task of mind-boggling complexity, requiring international assistance on a massive scale.

Many countries and organizations have pledged to contribute money or health resources, although the speed of delivery is uncertain. President Obama told the United Nations on Thursday that there was “ still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be [http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/25/president-obama-international-community-we-must-do-more-fight-ebola].” Faster action is desperately needed to prevent hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.

In the Homestretch, Obama Comes on Strong

“The enemy of my enemy is my friend,” says the ancient proverb. But don’t tell that to President Obama, who is furiously bombing Bashar al-Assad’s enemies in Syria while insisting that Mr. Assad’s regime is also the enemy. Best also not to remind Mr. Obama about leading from behind, or of his arguments against being drawn into the Syrian civil war or getting embroiled in any Middle Eastern conflicts.

This was the week the president went before the United Nations General Assembly and proclaimed, in effect, that the United States was back out front again — not only against the brutality of Islamic terrorists, which “forces us to look into the heart of darkness,” but also against Russia’s vision that “might makes right,” against the spread of Ebola, against global warming.

“Too often, we have failed to enforce international norms when it’s inconvenient to do so,” Mr. Obama told the General Assembly, a phrase that seemed almost apologetic in the context. “And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe.”

Mr. Obama’s words and actions heartened those who had equated his reticence in foreign affairs with a decline in American global leadership.

But his assertive stance also roused fears that America was being drawn into another open-ended war without a coherent plan, and without the public scrutiny that a proper congressional debate would have provided.

After Holder, What?

The Obama administration’s domestic record also came under sharp scrutiny in the past week with the announcement that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was leaving. In many ways. Mr. Holder, the first African-American in his office just as Mr. Obama was the first in his, shared much of the ambivalence with which the administration is viewed nearly three-quarters of the way through its two terms.

He battled fervently to correct what he perceived as major civil-rights wrongs on same-sex marriage, voting rights and racial discrimination in the justice system. Yet he also earned the scorn of civil liberties advocates when his Justice Department approved the targeted killing of civilians, including Americans, without judicial review, and aggressively tried to stop leaks of government information.

The timing of Mr. Holder’s resignation was certain to provoke a vicious struggle between Republican and Democratic legislators over his successor. The homestretch is shaping up to be a brutal one for Mr. Obama.

Separatism

In a striking counterpoint to the calm Scottish referendum on independence the week earlier, China on Tuesday sentenced a Uighur academic to life in prison on charges of separatism. Though the prosecutors never demonstrated that Ilham Tohti, an economics professor, advocated independence or violence for China’s Uighurs, the court ruled that his criticism of the government’s treatment of the minority in his classroom, on his online forum and in conversations with foreign journalists “bewitched” his students and “exploited foreign forces to create pressure to make Xinjiang an international matter.”

The extraordinarily harsh sentence, which included the confiscation of Mr. Tohti’s assets, reflected the Chinese Communist establishment’s extreme sensitivity to any dissent, and especially to the Uighur insurgency in the Xinjiang region of western China. On Thursday, Chinese state media reported that a series of bomb blasts and violent clashes on the previous weekend left 50 dead and many injured in the region.

The Uighurs are Turkic-speaking Muslims who identify culturally and ethnically with the Central Asian nations that border Xinjiang. The region came under Chinese rule in the 18th century and was incorporated into Communist China in 1949; since then, vast numbers of Han Chinese have moved in, creating strong frictions with the local population.

Mr. Tohti, 44, was a strong critic of Chinese assimilation policies, but also a voice of moderation. He cited figures to show that investment in the region was going mainly to newly arrived Han, and he criticized restrictions on religious practice, but he never advocated secession or violence.

In an interview shortly before he was detained in January, he suggested that he was being punished less for his championship of the Uighurs than for revealing the failure of government policies. “Sometimes I feel like the government is more afraid of people telling the truth than they are of the protests and violence,” he said.

To Bomb or Not to Bomb

History will have the last word on whether Mr. Obama’s decision to bomb terrorist bases inside Syria was right. But once the Islamic State barbarians threatened to overrun Iraq and began publicly decapitating American and British hostages, the president’s hand was forced.

The question was whether by identifying the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, as the premier “network of death” in the region, Mr. Obama was in effect bolstering some of the competing villains. It was not clear, for example, how American fighters could operate in Syria without at least tacit consent from the Syrian government. One Syrian diplomat boasted in a pro-government newspaper that “the U.S. military leadership is now fighting in the same trenches with the Syrian generals, in a war on terrorism inside Syria.”

This being the Middle East, the complications did not stop there. America’s Arab allies in the campaign against the Islamic State — Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — are all monarchies that survived the Arab Spring. Then, Washington had appeared to be moving away from traditional alliances with autocratic Middle Eastern leaders, but now they were again being called essential partners in an existential struggle.

Perhaps to demonstrate that they were not the same old emirs, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States noted that leading the country’s jets in the raids on Monday night was Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, the country’s first female fighter pilot.

Appearing on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe,” Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba said that while women did face barriers in the country’s Islamic society, Major Mansouri’s role demonstrated an essential difference between moderate Muslims and the fanatics of the Islamic State.

Perhaps next time, Major Mansouri can drop leaflets on the group saying, “You’ve been bombed by a woman.”

Liberia Health Chief Is Under Quarantine

MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberia’s chief medical officer is placing herself under quarantine for 21 days after her office assistant died of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].

Bernice Dahn, a deputy health minister who has represented Liberia at regional conferences intended to combat the ongoing epidemic, said Saturday that she did not have any Ebola symptoms but wanted to make sure that she was not infected.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] says 21 days is the maximum incubation period for Ebola, which has killed more than 3,000 people across West Africa and is hitting Liberia especially hard. The W.H.O. figures released Friday said 150 people died in the country in just two days.

Liberia’s government has asked people to keep themselves isolated for 21 days if they think they have been exposed. The unprecedented scale of the outbreak, however, has made it difficult to trace the contacts of victims and quarantine those who might be at risk.

“Of course we made the rule, so I am home for 21 days,” Ms. Dahn said. “I did it on my own. I told my office staff to stay at home for the 21 days. That’s what we need to do.”

Health officials, especially front-line doctors and nurses, are particularly vulnerable to Ebola, which is spread via the bodily fluids of infected patients. This month, the W.H.O. said more than 300 health workers had contracted Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three worst-affected countries. Nearly half of them have died.

Making sure health care workers have the necessary supplies, including personal protective equipment, has been a challenge especially given that many flights in and out of countries affected by Ebola have been canceled.

At an emergency meeting of the African Union on Sept. 8, Senegal, which serves as a regional travel hub, said it would open a “humanitarian corridor” to the affected countries.

Senegal was expected on Saturday to receive a flight carrying humanitarian staff from Guinea — the first time aid workers from one of the three worst-hit countries were allowed in Senegal since the corridor was opened, said Alexis Masciarelli, a spokesman for the World Food Program.

Across the United States, laboratory chimps are being sprung from their cages. Last year, the National Institutes of Health announced[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/science/us-to-retire-most-chimps-from-research.html] that it would be retiring most of its chimpanzees and sending hundreds of its hairy, knuckle-walking charges to live out their lives in sanctuaries.

Many news organizations, including this one, chronicled this remarkable turnaround[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/unlikely-partners-freeing-chimps-from-the-lab.html], as one of the world’s premier research agencies acknowledged that chimpanzees are not necessary for most biomedical experiments. But even as the captive chimps made headlines, the plight of their endangered wild cousins largely escaped media attention.

Wild chimpanzees are “facing catastrophe,” Dr. Nancy J. Merrick writes in this sobering and cleareyed new book. Dr. Merrick, a physician, briefly studied wild chimps in the 1970s, and when she returned to Africa four decades later, she was horrified to discover that ape populations had plummeted. “Among Chimpanzees” is part memoir, part travelogue and part clarion call to action. “At times, it has been overwhelming to see how imminently threatened chimpanzees are in today’s world,” Dr. Merrick writes. “But to allow a world without chimps is unconscionable — so you and I must get involved or risk losing them forever.”

In 1970, when she was a senior in high school, Dr. Merrick saw a film about Jane Goodall[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/jane_goodall/index.html], a young woman who had gone into the forests of Tanzania — without sophisticated equipment or even a college degree — and promptly began making significant discoveries about our closest living relatives. The young student was enchanted. “As I sat watching,” she recalls, “I was filled with the desire to be in this woman’s place, studying wild chimpanzees.”

And soon after, she was — one of a handful of Stanford students selected to work as a field assistant on Dr. Goodall’s team. For seven months, she trailed chimps through Gombe Stream National Park[http://www.tanzaniaparks.com/gombe.html] in Tanzania, taking meticulous notes on their behavior. The animals were clever and beguiling; the author once watched as a chimp named Mustard used a banana box to trap a pet mongoose that had been terrorizing all of Gombe’s primates — humans and apes alike.

“As I witnessed the tremendous intelligence and complexity of the chimps, my human-centered worldview was thrown into disarray,” she writes. It was “the beginning of a lifelong fascination with chimps.”

After her term at Gombe came to a close, she returned to Stanford and worked with captive chimps before ultimately deciding on a career in medicine. She continued to feel a connection to the animals, however, and in 2008, she took her family on an ape-centered African vacation.

But during a week they spent volunteering at a chimpanzee sanctuary in Uganda, Dr. Merrick began to wonder about the rise of such wildlife refuges. In the 1970s, there had been just a single chimp sanctuary in all of equatorial Africa. Now there were lots of them, each one teeming with apes. Why had such sanctuaries become necessary, and why were so many chimps ending up there?

As she traveled around East Africa in search of answers, she discovered that wild chimps, along with many other great apes, were under assault from all sides: hunted for meat, killed for raiding farmers’ fields, trafficked as exotic pets. Their DNA is similar enough to ours that they are vulnerable to many of the same diseases; Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html], which is currently making a frightening resurgence in West Africa, has devastated ape populations. Chimps can also get diseases — including tuberculosis, polio[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/poliomyelitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], scabies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/scabies/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and dysentery — from us, especially as humans and apes have more frequent encounters.

But the greatest threat to chimpanzees is the rapid destruction of their habitat. The forests where they live are being rapidly cleared for timber, farming, and mining, particularly for coltan, an ore used in cellphones and other electronics. “Wilderness areas are disappearing at a rate that most of us simply cannot imagine,” Dr. Merrick writes.

The losses squeeze chimps into smaller and smaller territories and fragment their habitats, stranding different chimp communities in islands of forests. Cut off from one another, they are susceptible to inbreeding and at risk of being wiped out by a single accident or outbreak.

The news is bleak, but Dr. Merrick believes that it is still possible to build a better future for wild apes. To do so, she argues, we’ll need to recognize that the lives of humans and chimpanzees are intertwined and to implement programs that make life better for members of both species. “Great ape conservation is doomed to failure if it doesn’t also address human need,” she writes, “particularly if locals are living in extreme poverty.”

For instance, training farmers in sustainable agricultural techniques — and providing them with funding and support — could keep soils fertile longer, boost crop yields, and increase food security, alleviating the need to transform more forest into farmland. Teaching wildlife poachers new kinds of skills, like beekeeping and carpentry, may give them alternative ways to earn a living. And programs that improve human health also lower the odds that we will pass diseases along to great apes. Dr. Merrick can be overly worshipful of the ape advocates she meets, who are, by turn, “gifted,” “inspirational” and “among the planet’s greatest heroes.” But she cares deeply, and she writes with a justified urgency. “It is not too late to save the great apes,” she writes. But soon, it could be.

Germany winces at the state of its military

In a spectacle that a leading weekly here likened to a slapstick movie, Germany’s military, especially its air force, the Luftwaffe, has repeatedly stumbled as it tried to ratchet up Berlin’s international involvement by delivering troops and materiel to forces battling Islamic extremists in Iraq and aid supplies to West Africa to ease the Ebola crisis.

By Monday, when the latest failure of Germany’s limited air capabilities became known, politicians were demanding explanations from Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and pondering aloud the possible revision of what has long been a political no-go: raising the budget for military spending.

Ms. von der Leyen is among the German leaders who have championed a more active role in international security and emergency aid. One striking example was the decision this month to send weapons to Kurdish and Iraqi forces, breaking a taboo on Germany’s dispatching weapons to a conflict zone.

But weaknesses emerged last week when the plane bringing six German paratroopers to Iraq to train Kurds to use $900 million worth of weaponry was stuck in Bulgaria for two days without the authorization to enter Iraq.

A day after that foul-up became public, a Dutch plane set to deliver the first weapons from Germany — 50 bazookas, 520 rifles and 20 machine guns — was grounded, prompting a scramble to find alternative transportation. That drew extra attention to the dozens of military planes and helicopters that have been grounded for repairs or the lack of spare parts.

On Monday, it emerged that a German military plane that had transported aid to West Africa had to make an emergency landing in the Canary Islands.

Just as those limitations were exposed, the Defense Ministry last week delivered a report on battle readiness to the Defense Committee of Parliament, where the panel’s members charged that ministry officials had misled them about how quickly or well Germany could meet NATO and other commitments.

The Defense Ministry has traditionally been a tricky portfolio in Germany, where most people — born and raised after the Nazi dictatorship — shy away from the use of military force. For decades, Germany has also been reuniting its east and west, more preoccupied at home than abroad.

But Germans have felt insecurities mounting, particularly over Russia’s moves in Ukraine and over the Middle East. Those crises and the state of the military have prompted discussions about military spending, said Thomas Wiegold, who writes about security.

This year, Germany has a defense budget of 32.8 billion euros, about $42 million. That represents 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, far below the NATO target of 2 percent. The United States has long complained that many European countries, notably Germany, fall short on defense spending.

Until recently, those complaints were ignored, ‘‘but it now seems to be becoming a debate,’’ Mr. Wiegold said.

‘‘I do a lot of radio interviews, particularly in the last week,’’ he added. ‘‘Now I am being asked whether we should spend more money. That has never happened before.’’

Mr. Wiegold and other experts traced many of today’s problems to a 2010 change that encouraged the military to keep as many systems deployed as possible but also had it cut back on ordering spare parts. That has left the Luftwaffe relying on Transall transport planes that entered service 50 years ago. The first new transport planes are scheduled to enter service this fall.

In addition, Mr. Wiegold noted, Ms. von der Leyen has seen air transport to assist in the fight against Ebola in West Africa as a politically more acceptable contribution to international efforts than, say, sending paratroopers to Iraq. ‘‘It has something to do with the basic political mood in Germany, that if we have to take part internationally, then better a ‘peaceful’ participation,’’ Mr. Wiegold added.

A Texas hospital said on Monday it has admitted a patient into “strict isolation” to be evaluated for possible infection with Ebola. The virus is epidemic in West Africa, where it has killed thousands of people. In a statement, the hospital, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, cited the unnamed patient’s symptoms and recent travel history as reasons for the isolation. It said it was “following all federal Centers for Disease Control and Texas Department of Heath recommendations to ensure the safety of patients, hospital staff, volunteers, physicians and visitors.” The C.D.C. expected preliminary results of tests on the patient to be ready on Tuesday, the hospital said.

For Secret Service Chief, Revelations Could Threaten Job Security

Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images

The question following several blockbuster revelations about the Secret Service’s handling of a White House intruder[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/us/white-house-intruder-got-farther-than-first-reported-official-says.html] is this: Will President Obama eventually fire Julia Pierson, the agency’s director?

That is likely to be the subtext of a hearing Tuesday morning where members of Congress from both parties are expected to grill Ms. Pierson about security breaches at the White House. She will testify alongside a former Secret Service director and a former State Department official in charge of “hardening” buildings against attacks, according to an official with knowledge of the committee’s plans for the hearing.

The official line — at least for now — on the possibility that Ms. Pierson will go is “No.” The White House spokesman says the president retains “full confidence” in Ms. Pierson and the agency’s ability to protect him and his family.

But the latest revelations about a fence-jumper who made it deep inside the White House before being stopped, and a separate report about security fumbles around a 2011 shooting episode[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-stumbled-after-gunman-hit-white-house-residence-in-2011/2014/09/27/d176b6ac-442a-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html], follow closely on a series of controversies at the agency — including issues of drinking and cavorting with prostitutes — that go straight to the question of competence of the agency’s leadership.

In particular, members of Congress say they will raise concerns about morale and staffing levels at the agency, and about whether agents and officers have become too complacent in the face of ongoing threats against the president.

“Why is it someone can jump over the fence and run into the White House? What’s that all about? I want to know that,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. “Whether new leadership is needed, I want to determine that.”

Mr. Obama has dismissed members of his team before. He fired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal after disparaging remarks were attributed to the commander of American troops in Afghanistan. And Mr. Obama accepted the resignation of Eric Shinseki, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, after reports of delays in care at the agency’s hospitals. But Mr. Obama is also sometimes loyal to a fault, preferring to give his staff members the benefit of the doubt following crises. He accepted the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, months after a disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov[http://healthcare.gov/] website.

And the Secret Service case may be different than the others anyway. In the case of the health care website, the mistakes affected millions of people. In the case of the Secret Service, the one person most imperiled is the president himself. That could lessen the impact of public pressure on Mr. Obama to make a decision, one way or the other.

– Michael D. Shear

Table for Two, Dinner for One

The revelations about White House security did not stop President Obama from hosting an invited guest Monday night. But the president’s first face-to-face meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India got off to an awkward start when the two met over a cozy private dinner – but only Mr. Obama actually ate.

The president feasted on an Indian-themed menu including avocados and goat cheese, crisped halibut with basmati rice and mango crème brûlée. Mr. Modi, observing a nine-day fast for the Hindu festival of Navratri, sat before an empty plate, consuming only warm water at his own request.

It was the world leader version of “No, go ahead – you eat.”

Mr. Modi “mentioned that he didn’t want to embarrass anybody,” Syed Akbaruddin, the spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, said afterward. “He requested that they continue with their normal practice of having the dinner while he would have his warm water.”

About 20 people attended the meal, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Secretary of State John Kerry, and Susan Rice, the national security adviser, as well as several other American and Indian officials. There was broad discussion of shared priorities, including addressing the Ebola outbreak and the situation in Afghanistan. But substance was largely left to Tuesday’s official talks in the Oval Office, in favor of what Mr. Akbaruddin called a “get-to-know-each-other approach.”

It was a far cry from the the lavish affair Mr. Obama hosted for Mr. Modi’s precedessor, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in November 2009, when more than 300 guests dined on arugula salad, curried prawns and pumpkin pie tart at an event whose bill came to more than $570,000. The formal state dinner, Mr. Obama’s first as president, gained infamy later, after it was learned that it had been crashed by Michaele and Tareq Salahi, Virginians auditioning for a part on the “The Real Housewives of D.C.”

But at the time, there was little drama surrounding the dinner itself; by all accounts, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Singh ate.

Expecting Congress to Debate Military Force This Year? Don’t.

While America’s ties with India are in good shape, members of Congress are focused this week on other pressing national security matters. Speaker John A. Boehner and other lawmakers, responding to criticism that they have failed to fully debate American strikes against the Islamic State, say they could still do so before the Nov. 4 elections.

Don’t count on it.

Senate Democratic leaders have expressed no enthusiasm for the idea, partly because they don’t want a politically charged vote before the election, and also because they need their embattled candidates to focus on campaigning back home.

More important, the White House argues that it has the authority it needs for the current military operation, and that the president has no need to recall Congress to vote at this point.

Right now, given Mr. Boehner’s reluctance to take up the issue during a lame-duck session, it appears a full debate on military force will not come before early 2015.

Desperately Seeking Donations Ahead of Midterms

Tuesday is the last day of the last full fund-raising quarter of the midterm election cycle, and the air of panic is evident — at least in the email subject lines of the last-minute barrage of appeals.

“I’m pleading (again),” acknowledged Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader; “begging…BEGGING” admitted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

“Time is running out,” reported a worried Mia Love, a Republican House candidate from Utah. “Less than 30 hours to reach our goal,” said John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations.

They apparently know they are testing the limits. “I’m sorry,” said another from Ms. Pelosi, apologizing for the drumbeat of emails before pressing for cash.

According to The Daily Independent[http://www.dailyindependent.com/news/article_96a35b06-45bb-11e4-9d88-2f42c7baf82b.html], Senator Mitch McConnell hinted at a gathering in Lexington, Ky., that if he becomes majority leader, he would allow a vote on raising the minimum wage.

Health
Ebola Is Found In U.S. Visitor From Liberia

A man who took a commercial flight from Liberia that landed in Dallas on Sept. 20 has been found to have the Ebola virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Tuesday. He is the first traveler to have brought the virus to the United States on a passenger plane and the first in whom Ebola has been diagnosed outside of Africa.

As the disease has swept across West Africa, many health experts said it would be only a matter of time before it reached the United States. Hospitals and health departments around the country have been preparing for it, and a number of false alarms have occurred. But this time, the case is real.

The man, who was visiting relatives in the United States, was not ill during the flight, health officials said at a news conference Tuesday evening. Indeed, he was screened before he boarded the flight and had no fever. Because Ebola is not contagious until symptoms develop, there is “zero chance” that the patient infected anyone else on the flight, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the disease centers. Ebola is spread only by direct contact with body fluids from someone who is ill.

A team from the C.D.C. is being dispatched to Dallas to help trace any contacts who may have been infected, including family members, health care workers and others with whom the patient spent time in Dallas. Health officials in Texas said they had already begun that process. Dr. Frieden said the family and community contacts were few, no more than a handful. But he said it was possible that family members who were with the man while he was ill would turn out to be infected.

Contact tracing involves identifying people who might have been exposed to the patient during the time he was infectious, and then monitoring them for symptoms every day for 21 days — the full incubation period of the disease. Most people develop symptoms within eight to 10 days of being exposed. Anyone who starts running a fever or having symptoms is then isolated and tested for Ebola. If the test is positive, that person is kept in isolation and treated, and his or her contacts are then traced for 21 days. The process is repeated until there are no new cases.

Describing these methods as “tried and true,” Dr. Frieden said, “I have no doubt that we’ll stop this in its tracks in the U.S.”

Dr. Frieden declined to disclose flight information or to say whether the patient is an American citizen. He said the man was not a health worker, and officials had no idea how he had become infected.

The man did not get sick until about Sept. 24, several days after he arrived. He is being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and is critically ill, Dr. Frieden said. He said there was no reason to move the patient to another hospital, noting that any hospital in the United States capable of isolating patients for other infectious diseases could safely handle an Ebola case. Doctors and the patient’s family are discussing whether to try experimental treatments, Dr. Frieden said.

The hospital’s epidemiologist, Dr. Edward Goodman, said: “We have had a plan in place for some time now for a patient presenting with possible Ebola. Ironically, we had a meeting the week before of all the stakeholders who might be involved. We were well prepared to care for this patient.”

Feeling ill, the man first sought medical help on Friday, and was treated and sent home. Ebola was not recognized. Officials did not say where that initial visit took place. Dr. Frieden said the early symptoms of Ebola, like fever and nausea, can easily be mistaken for other illnesses. But he added that public health experts have for months been urging doctors and nurses to take a travel history on anyone who shows up with such symptoms and to be on the alert for Ebola in anyone who has been to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone.

With worsening symptoms, the man sought care again on Sunday, and was then admitted to the hospital in Dallas and placed in isolation. Blood samples arrived at the disease centers on Tuesday, and tested positive for Ebola. A state lab in Texas also tested samples, and got positive results.

Dr. Frieden briefed President Obama by telephone on Tuesday afternoon about the case, explaining what the White House described as the “stringent isolation protocols” being used to treat the patient and efforts to trace the patient’s contacts to mitigate the risk of the virus spreading.

Dr. Frieden told the president that the C.D.C. had been prepared for an Ebola case in the United States, according to an account of the call distributed by the White House, “and that we have the infrastructure in place to respond safely and effectively.”

Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.

A rare success in Ebola fight as outbreak subsides in Nigeria

With quick and coordinated action by some of its top doctors, Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, appears to have contained its first Ebola outbreak, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.

As the epidemic rages in three nations a few hundred miles away, Nigeria is the only country to have a major urban outbreak with hundreds of potentially infected people and yet beat it back.

‘‘For those who say it’s hopeless, this is an antidote — you can control Ebola,’’ said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C.

‘‘But it’s also instructive,’’ he added. ‘‘It won’t blow over — you have to make a rapid, intense effort.’’

Since the first patient — a dying Liberian-American — flew into Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, on July 20, the disease spread to 20 other people in two cities, who had contact with nearly 900 others.

Every known patient has now died or recovered, and the cure rate — 60 percent — was unusually high for an African outbreak.

In a measure of how difficult it is to control an Ebola outbreak, Nigerian health workers known as contact tracers made 18,500 face-to-face visits to people who had contact with Ebola patients. Virtually all have passed the incubation period without falling ill.

The success was in part due to an emergency command center financed in 2012 by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to fight polio, which was turned into the Ebola Emergency Operations Center.

The C.D.C. had 10 experts in Nigeria working on polio and H.I.V., who had already trained 100 Nigerian doctors in epidemiology, including contact tracing; 40 of them were immediately reassigned to Ebola. The chief of the command center, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, cited a coordinated effort by the health ministry, the C.D.C, the World Health Organization, Unicef, Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee for the Red Cross. He also noted Nigeria’s significant advantages over the continent’s poorest countries where the outbreak is out of control.

• It has many more doctors per capita than Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, some educated abroad at top medical schools.

• It has standing teams of medical investigators, with vehicles and telephones, who normally trace outbreaks of diseases like cholera or Lassa fever.

• Lagos University Teaching Hospital was able to get Ebola test results in six hours.

• The hospitals where the patients were treated — in isolation wards normally used for tuberculosis patients — had air-conditioning, making it more comfortable for doctors and nurses wearing stifling protective gear.

• Laboratories were equipped for testing electrolytes and blood proteins, which must be kept in balance as patients are fed orally or intravenously to replace fluids lost to diarrhea and vomiting.

Nigeria also had some luck. Although that first patient, known as the index patient, was vomiting on his flight, none of about 200 others on the plane fell ill, though some people did after helping him into a taxi to a hospital.

And a patient in a second Nigerian city, Port Harcourt, went to her church for a ceremony in which the whole congregation laid hands on her. But apparently none became infected.

The index patient was a Liberian-American businessman, Patrick Sawyer, who was under observation in Liberia after his sister had died of Ebola.

He refused medical advice and left a Liberian hospital on July 17, flying to Ghana, Togo and, ultimately, Lagos. Nigerian news reports said Liberian government contacts gave him permission to leave.

He denied having had contact with Ebola victims and so was treated for malaria at a private hospital. He died Aug. 5.

‘‘That hospital had zero infection control,’’ Dr. Frieden said. One nurse who helped restore an IV line when Mr. Sawyer was delirious and bleeding wore no gloves, had a cut on her hand and did not wash it, he said. She later died.

After malaria treatment failed, Ebola was ‘‘high on the index of suspicion,’’ Dr. Shuaib said. ’’’

Though the emergency center swiftly swung into action and contact tracing was helped by the good records kept by the airport authority, there were still problems.

It took 14 days for the isolation ward in a large hospital to open. ‘‘Health workers initially wouldn’t go in,’’ Dr. Frieden said. ‘‘They were afraid.’’

For Obama and Indian Leader, a Friendly Stroll if Not a Full Embrace

WASHINGTON — In a get-to-know-you visit fraught with awkward undertones, President Obama[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per] and Prime Minister Narendra Modi[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/narendra_modi/index.html?inline=nyt-per] of India sought to repair a strained relationship between their nations on Tuesday, emerging with expressions of good will but little in the way of concrete deals.

At an Oval Office meeting and during a stroll around the Martin Luther King Jr.[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/martin_luther_jr_king/index.html?inline=nyt-per] Memorial, Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi emphasized what they had in common as democratic leaders who overcame personal obstacles, campaigned as outsiders and embraced technology as a vital tool in politics and governing.

But their talks yielded no resolutions to thorny disputes over taxes, trade and civilian nuclear energy cooperation that have divided the United States and India in recent years. And there was little sign that human rights — a particularly sensitive topic for Mr. Modi, who has been accused of being complicit in deadly anti-Muslim riots — was a major item on the agenda.

“Human rights and the importance of inclusive governance were part of the discussions between the president and the prime minister today,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary told reporters. But a statement issued jointly by the United States and India after the talks made no mention of the issue.

The White House has grappled with the perceptions of a visit meant to spotlight the president’s high hopes for working with Mr. Modi while not lavishing the full measure of White House pageantry on a leader who until recently was barred from entering the United States because of the allegations of human rights abuses more than a decade ago.

Still, in a striking gesture that Mr. Modi later said gave their relationship a “new dimension,” the president left the White House on Tuesday to give the prime minister a personal tour of the King Memorial, recalling Mr. Obama’s own visit in 2010 to the onetime home in Mumbai of Mohandas K. Gandhi[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/mohandas_k_gandhi/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the Indian champion of democracy and nonviolence who was a model for the American civil rights leader.

At a luncheon at the State Department not long after, Mr. Modi was effusive in thanking Mr. Obama “from the core of my heart” for leading him around the memorial. “He took out a lot of time,” Mr. Modi said. “We were together yesterday and today for quite some time, and today in fact he took me around, and with such ease and such humility.”

Mr. Modi had been denied a visa to visit the United States because of accusations that he failed to stop religious violence in Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister there, which took the lives of more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. On Thursday, while Mr. Modi was in New York for the United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] General Assembly, the human rights group American Justice Center filed a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan against him on behalf of two survivors of the rioting, seeking a judgment that his conduct was tantamount to genocide.

American officials have declined to comment on the case, except to say that sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from lawsuits in American courts. But human rights activists had pressed the Obama administration to get the president to raise the issue with Mr. Modi while he was in Washington.

If he did, it was in private.

“The purpose of these meetings was to improve U.S.-India relations, so we weren’t expecting Obama to give him the cold shoulder, but we were hoping there would be a little bit of measure in the red-carpet treatment, so we were surprised by the Martin Luther King side visit,” said John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Delivering a message about human rights is always awkward.”

It was hardly the only tricky element of Mr. Modi’s visit. Their get-together began on Monday night with a small dinner in the White House Blue Room that was a protocol nightmare: Mr. Modi was in the middle of a nine-day fast to observe the Hindu festival of Navratri, but insisted his hosts go ahead and eat. Mr. Modi sat in front of an empty plate and had warm water for dinner while Mr. Obama and the two leaders’ entourages ate avocados and goat cheese, crisped halibut and basmati rice, a pumpkin crème brûlée and a California chardonnay.

The 20-person dinner was a stark contrast to the lavish affair Mr. Obama threw for Mr. Modi’s predecessor, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in November 2009, when more than 300 guests dined on arugula salad, curried prawns and pumpkin pie tart at an event whose bill came to more than $570,000.

This two-day meeting did produce some agreements, including the renewal of a 10-year defense cooperation framework, a pact to cooperate on maritime security and several clean-energy initiatives. And as Mr. Obama intensifies the American campaign against the Sunni militant group known as the Islamic State, the two agreed to improve their counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing.

“We discussed the issues of trade, issues of making sure that maritime rules are observed, and we discussed how we can continue to work together on a whole host of issues from space exploration, scientific endeavor, to dealing with humanitarian crises like Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in West Africa,” Mr. Obama said after a two-hour meeting with Mr. Modi in the Oval Office.

Mr. Modi, for his part, said he wanted to resolve disputes that had stalled the implementation of the American-India civilian nuclear agreement and stymied progress on trade. He said the two leaders had a “candid discussion” on trade.

“We already have the foundation of a strong partnership,” Mr. Modi said. “We now have to revive the momentum and ensure that we get the best out of it for our people and for the world.”

U.S.
Debate in Texas Governor’s Race Turns Heated Over Incentive Fund
By MANNY FERNANDEZ

DALLAS — Wendy Davis and Greg Abbott — both vying to become governor of Texas — sparred Tuesday in their second and final televised debate over the state’s mismanagement of an economic-incentive fund that has put Mr. Abbott on the defensive and given Ms. Davis new momentum.

Ms. Davis, a Democrat and a state senator, accused Mr. Abbott, a Republican and the Texas attorney general, of concealing the lax oversight of the fund to help contributors to his campaign. Mr. Abbott responded by accusing Ms. Davis of profiting from a company that received money from the fund when she served on the Fort Worth City Council.

In the most heated exchange of the night, Ms. Davis denied the accusation and told Mr. Abbott that he knew he was being dishonest.

“Mr. Abbott, this is about your failure,” she said, “your failure as the chief law enforcement officer of this state to review and make sure that these funds weren’t being used as slush funds for your donors.”

Five weeks before the November election, the first open-seat race for governor in more than 20 years has intensified, with Ms. Davis and Mr. Abbott waging a multimillion-dollar advertising war. Mr. Abbott has been the front-runner and Ms. Davis the underdog. Republicans control both houses of the Legislature and every statewide elected position; the last time Texas elected a Democratic governor was in 1990, when Ann W. Richards narrowly won a four-year term.

Mr. Abbott and Ms. Davis first addressed a question on the minds of many Texans: the announcement on Tuesday that a patient in a Dallas hospital had tested positive for the Ebola virus.

Mr. Abbott, asked how he would respond to the situation as governor, said he had spoken with the head of the state’s Health and Human Services Commission and noted that the ambulance that had transported the patient to the hospital had been quarantined.

Ms. Davis said she had spoken with Dallas County’s top elected official and had been assured that the proper protocols were being followed to ensure that hospital workers were safe.

But during the debate at the KERA-TV studios in Dallas, the economic-incentive fund was a focal point.

On Thursday, a state auditor’s report found that an economic development fund, which was promoted by Gov. Rick Perry and awarded taxpayer money to businesses and universities to spur job creation, had given more than $200 million to recipients without requiring them to apply formally or to create a set number of jobs. The program, which is known as the Texas Enterprise Fund and administered by Mr. Perry’s office, awarded $222 million to 11 projects that did not submit applications and did not make specific promises to create jobs.

As attorney general, Mr. Abbott is responsible for prosecuting misuses of state money. The Dallas Morning News reported that it had requested a copy of the application of a company seeking to tap the fund in 2004, but that Mr. Abbott’s office had refused because the application might have contained confidential corporate information. The leaders of some companies that received the money have contributed more than $1 million to his campaign.

Mr. Abbott said he was pleased with the state audit, noting that it was not critical of him or his office. “From the beginning of my campaign, I have been questioning this very fund,” he said.

Ms. Davis, who sponsored the bill calling for the audit, asked Mr. Abbott if he would release any documents concerning his rulings turning down requests for information. She and other Democrats say his refusal to release information about nonexistent applications helped conceal problems for years.

Mr. Abbott mentioned another recipient of the fund, the retail company Cabela’s. The audit found that Cabela’s had not submitted a formal application for $400,000 it received in 2004 to build a store in Fort Worth, a project Ms. Davis supported while on the City Council.

“When you used those incentive funds to attract Cabela’s, and then closed the deal, it was your title company that benefited by closing that deal, so you personally profited,” Mr. Abbott said.

“You know you are not telling the truth,” she responded. “I did not personally profit from that.” Ms. Davis added that it was not her title company and that she was an employee of the company, earning a salary that was not dependent on any business deals.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• At the White House.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meets[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/01/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-israel.html] President Obama to discuss the situation in Gaza and the operation against extremists in Syria and Iraq.

But they’ll also focus on the U.S.-led nuclear talks with Iran. The deadline for reaching a deal is less than two months away, with no real sign of movement.

• Accused intruder in court.

The man indicted Tuesday on charges of entering the White House with a weapon is due[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/30/us/politics/ap-us-secret-service-indictment.html] in U.S. District Court in Washington this morning.

Officials cited[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/us/armed-man-boarded-elevator-with-obama-official-reports.html] another lapse in security by the Secret Service last month, when a private security guard shared an elevator with the president in Atlanta. Agents did not know the man was armed.

• The polite protest.

Crowds of peaceful demonstrators swelled today in Hong Kong[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1605202/live-tensions-rising-wan-chai-occupy-protesters-gather-ahead-national] on Chinese National Day, but there were no signs of China’s flag.

After calling out riot police and tear gas on Sunday, Hong Kong’s chief executive and his advisers have now decided not to use force[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html] to disperse the protesters.

• “We will control this case of Ebola.”

That’s the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after a traveler from Liberia became the first to bring the deadly virus[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/airline-passenger-with-ebola-is-under-treatment-in-dallas.html] to the U.S.

He says there is “zero chance” that the man infected anyone else on the flight. The patient, whose nationality was not disclosed, is in isolation at a Dallas hospital[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/01/us/ap-ebola.html] today.

In Nigeria, the outbreak has been contained,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/ebola-outbreak-in-nigeria-appears-to-be-over.html] but it is still ravaging several other countries in West Africa.

• War crimes trial closes.

The former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic began reading his 800-page closing statement today[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29438460] at a U.N. tribunal in the Netherlands. He has been given 10 hours to speak, and will continue on Thursday.

He faces 11 genocide charges linked to the 1992-95 Bosnian war that left 100,000 dead. If found guilty, he could get a life sentence.

• Signing up.

Australia agreed[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/01/world/middleeast/01reuters-mideast-crisis-australia.html] today to carry out support flights against Islamic State extremists in Iraq.

• Rising death toll in Japan.

Twelve more victims were discovered today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/30/world/asia/30reuters-japan-volcano.html] on the ash-covered summit of Mount Ontake, bringing the toll from Saturday’s volcanic eruption to 48.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are down sharply, with the Dow off more than 200 points in early afternoon. European shares closed off about 1 percent, and Asian markets ended widely varied.

Major U.S. indexes opened the fourth quarter today with small three-month gains: 1.3 percent for the Dow, 0.6 percent for the S.&P. 500 and 1.9 percent for the Nasdaq.

• Mary T. Barra, chief executive of G.M., laid out a plan today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/gm-outlines-plan-to-increase-profit-margins.html] that focuses on increasing profit margins and growth in China to improve the carmaker’s financial performance.

Separately, G.M. and Chrysler each reported a 19 percent gain in North American car sales for September[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/gm-sales-rebound-in-september.html], while Ford posted a 3 percent decline.

• Pershing Square Holdings, a fund owned by the activist investor William A. Ackman, raised $2.73 billion[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/ackman-fund-raises-more-than-3-billion-in-amsterdam-i-p-o/] in its initial public offering in Amsterdam.

The stock, offered at $25 a share and valuing the fund at $6.2 billion, begins trading later this month.

• The F.A.A. begins a 30-day review[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/us/faa-to-focus-on-contractors-after-damage-to-cables.html] of the air traffic control system’s communications infrastructure after a contractor cut cables at an airport tower in Chicago last week.

NOTEWORTHY

• Heart-pounding wild-card game.

The Kansas City Royals overcame deficits of 2-0, 7-3 and 8-7, before gaining a 9-8 victory[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/sports/baseball/royals-athletics-wild-card-mlb-playoffs.html] over the Oakland A’s in 12 innings. They meet the Los Angeles Angels in an American League division series starting Thursday.

The winner of tonight’s National League wild-card game, between the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates (8 o’clock Eastern, ESPN), faces the Washington Nationals in a series that begins Friday.

• The first Thor-ess.

“Thor #1[http://marvel.com/comics/issue/50970/thor_2014_1],” a comic book featuring a goddess of Thunder for the first time, is published today.

• Former White House resident celebrates.

It’s the 90th birthday of Jimmy Carter, who served as the 39th American president from 1977-1981.

BACK STORY

An octopus has eight arms. An octagon has eight sides. But what’s eight got to do with the month that starts today?

It made sense in ancient Rome, when the calendar had only 10 months.

A few months seemed to have been named for gods or heroic figures (March for Mars, April possibly for Aphrodite, May perhaps for Maia and June for Juno).

But the rest were numbered, and some are still with us. September was the seventh month; October the eighth; November the ninth; and December the 10th.

Around 713 B.C., a calendar reform introduced two new months to account for the 60 or so extra winter days. They were January, for the god Janus, and February, for the purification celebration known as Februa.

In later reforms, the original fifth and sixth months (which now fell seventh and eighth) were renamed for Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus: July and August.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• A missed connection.

American health officials had worried for months that someone infected with Ebola might enter the United States undetected.

“There have been a bunch of false alarms, where people have done their due diligence and checked everything out,” says Denise Grady, one of our science reporters.

But when a man who had recently arrived from Liberia went to a hospital in Dallas on Friday, he was sent back home — only to return on Sunday, far sicker.

Thomas Eric Duncan is now the first case of Ebola diagnosed[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html] in the U.S., and more than a dozen people he came into contact with while ill are being traced and monitored.

A spokesman for the hospital, Texas Health Presbyterian, said Mr. Duncan told a nurse that he had just arrived from Liberia, but the information wasn’t passed to those examining him.

“I don’t think there’s any doubt that that was a mistake,” Ms. Grady says.

• Truth from fiction.

Mostly, Hollywood has sensationalized epidemics, starting with a diagnosis and ending in civilization on the brink of demise.

But some films — like Steven Soderbergh’s “Contagion” [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/movies/contagion-steven-soderberghs-plague-paranoia-review.html] — have also reflected on the consequences of fanning unbridled fear in the face of such a crisis, says Brooks Barnes, our entertainment industry reporter.

That 2011 film was “fiction for what is essentially now fact with Ebola,” he says, “an epidemic spread by world travelers."

“But while the movie entertained with terror — it’s everywhere! — it also tried to say something serious about the media environment,” Mr. Barnes says, “and how poorly some humans can behave when they are afraid.”

“The marketing slogan,” he points out, “was ‘Nothing spreads like fear.’”

• Not entirely muzzled.

The Chinese government has done its best to mute the message of protesters in Hong Kong[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html] demanding greater democracy.

Government censors have cut images of the well-behaved protesters from social media and published articles attacking them, says Andrew Jacobs, our correspondent in Beijing.

That has left many on the mainland “in the dark about the scale and the purpose of the demonstrations unfolding in the former British colony,” he says.

Yet a small but vocal group is still trying to show solidarity (many shaving their heads) and spread the message, Mr. Jacobs says.

Nearly two dozen people have reportedly been detained and at least 60 have been summoned for questioning, but one man — a seasoned activist with a new buzz cut — told Mr. Jacobs that he was willing to go to jail.

“Freedom is earned,” the activist told him. “You need to pay the price.”

• Back to baseball.

The regular season is giving way to the playoffs for the World Series, with coastal clusters that are helping build excitement for a sport recently overshadowed by the N.F.L. and its troubles.

“There’s four games involving Los Angeles teams over three days, and there’s four games involving the Washington-Baltimore teams over three days,” says Jay Schreiber, one of our sports editors.

“That’s kind of cool.”

The Kansas City Royals[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/sports/baseball/royals-athletics-wild-card-mlb-playoffs.html], who hadn’t been in the playoffs in three decades, had an “unbelievable game” against the Oakland A’s on Tuesday, winning 9-8 in extra innings, Mr. Schreiber says.

“They get this game that looks hopeless for them, but every time it looks like it's over, they rally, score, keep it going, and they finally won.”

“It’s an epic kind of game, a perfect opening act.”

The last of the wild-card slots will be decided tonight, when the San Francisco Giants face the Pittsburgh Pirates. (8 p.m. Eastern, ESPN)

Note: We have created two lessons on the Ebola epidemic: a) the one below to cover the ongoing outbreak in West Africa, and b) a separate lesson about preventing the spread of Ebola in the United States. [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/detection-prevention-and-treatment-researching-issues-around-ebola-in-the-united-states/]

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been struggling since March to stop what has become the largest Ebola [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html] outbreak ever recorded. The disease has killed thousands, and is causing widespread fear and disruption in West Africa.

How can teachers help students to understand a situation that is overwhelming even to the experts?

Below, quick ideas for teaching about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in one or two class periods, all grounded in The Times’s continuously-updated Ebola Q & A. [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] Then, we offer two ideas for going further by writing point-of-view pieces and by undertaking additional research.

Note: The images and descriptions contained in the Ebola resources below may not be suitable for all ages. Teachers should use their discretion.

* Lesson Plan: If You Only Have One Class Period…

* Going Further Idea #1: Point-of-View Narratives

* Going Further Idea #2: Additional Research

Lesson Plan: If You Only Have One Class Period…

1. Start With What Students Already Know: Have students work alone or in pairs to jot down in a journal or on a graphic organizer like one of these concept maps [http://www.gpat.org/Georgia-Project-for-Assistive-Technology/Pages/WS-Printed-Graphic-Organizers.aspx] what they have read or heard about Ebola. Then, create a class list on the board as they share. On one side of the board keep an additional list of questions students ask.

2. Watch a Short Video: Then, watch one of the videos we have embedded in this post, including the one above, or any other Times video you can find on the outbreak [http://query.nytimes.com.proxy.bc.edu/search/sitesearch/?vertical=video/#/Ebola/].

One we recommend: this video, “Burial Boys of Ebola,” [http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/africa/100000003071418/burial-boys-of-ebola.html] about a group of young men in Sierra Leone who have taken on the dirtiest work of the Ebola outbreak: finding and burying the dead. Teachers should preview the short film first to make sure it is appropriate for your students. After students watch the video, students can answer the following questions through writing and discussion:

* Who are the “burial boys”?

* What precautions do these young men take to make sure they don’t get sick?

* Why are the people in the village angry at the “burial boys”?

* Why is the job of burying the dead so important to controlling this outbreak?

* Who trains and supports these young men with their jobs?

* What are some of the obstacles the burial teams face in doing their jobs?

* What sacrifices are these men making by taking this job?

* Why do you think these young men do this difficult work?

3. Read and Answer Questions: Next, have students use The Times’s regularly updated page, Ebola Q. and A. [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html], which includes text as well as graphs, charts and maps, to answer the following basic questions about the Ebola outbreak. If you are short on time, students can work individually or in pairs to answer one or two questions, and then jigsaw or have the whole class share what they learned. Here are a selection of Q. and A. questions The Times has asked and answered:

* Where are the most new cases being reported?

* How many people have been infected in Africa?

* How many health care workers have contracted Ebola?

* How contagious is the virus?

* Are there drugs to treat or prevent Ebola?

* How does the disease progress?

* Where is the outbreak?

* How many people could become infected?

* How does this compare to past outbreaks?

* Where does the disease come from?

4. Discuss: After students have gained a better understanding of the Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa, the class can discuss two larger questions:

Invite your students to post answers to the question How Should We React to the Ebola Epidemic? [http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/how-should-we-react-to-the-ebola-epidemic/] to our blog.

To go further, ask your students: What responsibility does the United States and the world community have to help these West African nations control the Ebola outbreak? Why?

To conclude the discussion, as either an exit ticket [http://www.theteachertoolkit.com/index.php/tool/exit-ticket] or homework assignment, have students respond to the same question in writing, using evidence from the lesson plan.

5. Go Further: Students can delve deeper into the Ebola outbreak in West Africa by writing a point-of-view piece or by undertaking additional research, both of which we explain in more detail below.

Going Further Idea #1: Point-of-View Writing

It’s easy to miss the human stories amid the big numbers [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-26/ebola-s-magic-number-and-the-cost-of-coming-up-short.html] of the Ebola outbreak. But only by searching for individual perspectives can you gain a true appreciation for the challenges of surviving or containing such an epidemic.

Read the selections below, or any others you can find on the Ebola Times Topics page [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html], listening for voices and perspectives that move or inspire you in some way. Then select one point of view (e.g., victims’ families or health care workers) and gather evidence using this graphic organizer [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/learning/pdf/2014/PointofViewEbola2LN.pdf] (PDF) to document what people in this group think, see, feel and hear relating to the Ebola crisis.

Then, choose a written format to tell a piece of the story of the Ebola outbreak from the point of view of a person or people in this group. For example, you can write a diary entry, a letter, a poem, an obituary, a scientific report, a newspaper article or anything else you can think of.

For example, one student might choose to write a letter from someone in Liberia explaining to a friend in the United States what life was like during the lockdown [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html]. Another might choose to write as if he or she were a scientist issuing a report on the latest details of the epidemic’s spread in a particular region. Students may choose to weave in quotations and descriptions from the articles. Finally, invite the class to share their writing.

Here are some groups you can choose from:

The Victims and Their Families and Neighbors

How does life change when your country is beset by a deadly epidemic? A lot depends on whether you come into direct contact with victims or live in an unaffected part of the country. But even for people who haven’t seen a victim, life feels different. Even manners — the ritual of a handshake or hug with friends — are transformed.

The Health Workers

What kind of person risks infection to save others? In these stories you can hear what it’s like to work in an Ebola ward, see colleagues become infected and die — or occasionally survive.

The Reporters

How much of a risk should journalists take to report the facts to the outside world, and what do you learn when you report from the midst of a crisis? The New York Times reporter Adam Nossiter ventured right into a graveyard to discover the truth about Ebola deaths, and worried about getting the virus on his boots. After months in the affected zone, he worries that the outside world still doesn’t quite get it.

The Burial Workers

Someone needs to bury the dead during an Ebola outbreak, or additional people will be affected. But the volunteers for this duty put themselves at terrible risk, and they are often ostracized by their communities and even relatives.

Going Further Idea #2: Additional Research

For this activity, we take some of the questions from the Q. and A. above and suggest relevant resources for students to conduct additional research about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The resources from the point-of-view narrative activity above can also be useful in answering these questions as well.

1. How many people have been infected? Where is the outbreak? How big can the outbreak become?

World Promises More Help Against Ebola, but Disease Is Faster

MAKENI, Sierra Leone — “Where's the corpse?” the burial-team worker shouted, kicking open the door of the isolation ward at the government hospital here. The body was right in front of him, a solidly built young man sprawled out on the floor all night, his right hand twisted in an awkward clench.

The other patients, normally padlocked inside, were too sick to look up as the body was hauled away. Nurses, some not wearing gloves and others in street clothes, clustered by the door as pools of the patients’ bodily fluids spread to the threshold. A worker kicked another man on the floor to see if he was still alive. The man’s foot moved and the team kept going. It was 1:30 in the afternoon.

In the next ward, a 4-year-old girl lay motionless on the floor, bleeding from her mouth and lying in urine, her eyes open. A corpse lay in the corner — a young woman, legs akimbo, who had died overnight. A small child stood on a cot watching as the team took the body away, stepping around a little boy lying immobile next to black buckets of vomit. They sprayed the body, and the little girl on the floor, with chlorine as they left.

As the Ebola epidemic intensifies across parts of West Africa, nations and aid agencies are pledging to respond with increasing force. But the disease has already raced far ahead of the promises, sweeping into areas that had been largely spared the onslaught and are not in the least prepared for it.

The consequences in places like Makeni, one of Sierra Leone’s largest cities, have been devastating.

"The whole country has been hit by something for which it was not ready,” said Dr. Amara Jambai, director of prevention and control at Sierra Leone’s health ministry.

Bombali, the district that includes this city, went from one confirmed case on the 15th of August to over 190 this weekend, with dozens more suspected. In a sign of how quickly the disease has spread, at least six dozen new cases have been confirmed in the district in the last few days alone, local health officials said.

The government put this district 120 miles north of the capital under quarantine late last week, making official what was already established on the ground. Ebola patients are dying under trees at holding centers or in stinking hospital wards surrounded by pools of infectious waste, cared for as best they can by lightly trained and minimally protected nurses, some wearing merely bluejeans.

“There’s no training for the staff here,” said Dr. Mohammed Bah, the director of the government hospital here. “The training is just PowerPoint. It is very difficult to manage Ebola here.”

In recent weeks, the world has vowed to step up its response to the epidemic, which has been spreading for more than six months. The United States military has arrived in neighboring Liberia with plans to build 18 treatment centers to prop up the broken health system. The British have promised to build field hospitals in four urban areas in Sierra Leone, including this one. The French are establishing a treatment center and a laboratory in Guinea. The Chinese have sent scores of medical personnel to the region and have converted a hospital they built outside Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, into a holding center for Ebola patients. The Cubans have pledged to send more than 400 doctors to help battle the disease in the region.

But little of that help has reached this city. The dead, the gravely ill, those who are vomiting or defecating, are placed among patients who have not yet been confirmed as Ebola victims — there is not even a laboratory here to test them. At one of the three holding centers in Makeni, dazed Ebola patients linger outside, close to health workers and soldiers guarding them. The risk of infection is high; the precautions, minimal.

“We encourage them not to have contact with body fluids,” said the district medical officer, Dr. Tom Sesay.

There is no Ebola treatment center here and the patients, some of them critically ill, must be taken eight hours over bad dirt roads to the one operated by Doctors Without Borders in Kailahun — that is, when space is available there. Some die on the way. At least 90 people already have died in the district, local health officials say — a figure far in excess of what the government in the capital has reported for Bombali. Yet the World Health Organization and others are still relying on Sierra Leone government statistics that appear to seriously undercount the number of victims.

Outside the district medical officer’s headquarters at the edge of Makeni — a mining hub in better days — ambulances race off at all moments for new bodies. Reports of new cases poured in all weekend.

“We’re fighting to see how we can control it,” said Dr. Sesay. “But we’re not being helped by the fact that we have nowhere to take our patients.”

The survival rate in Bombali district is “low,” Dr. Sesay noted.

Indeed, the holding centers appear to be little more than stiflingly hot places to die. At one of the three in Makeni, known as the “Arab Hospital” because it was built with money from Gulf states, five had died overnight and into the morning one day last week; four more were expected to go by that night.

One of them, a small boy, lay curled up under a wooden bed frame, and a nurse explained that he was “in the last stage, vomiting blood.” Outside the building, a boy of around 10 propped himself up as best he could against a wall, blood around his eyes, defecating.

“A lot of babies are dying here,” said Mohammed Kamara, a soldier guarding the facility.

Three patients lay prostrate under a mango tree in the dirt courtyard, one of them immobile with his arms and legs fully extended, crosslike.

“When they start bleeding, they go inside, and they will not come back out,” said Sister Evelyn Bangura, the nurse running the holding center. Close to 30 have died since the center opened on Sept. 20.

“I don’t want them to be outside,” Ms. Bangura complained. “We want to minimize the spread.” But some of the healthier patients are aggressive and have tried to break out of the facility; Mr. Kamara, the soldier guarding it, had to cock his gun, he said. Indeed, three men shouted from one end of the courtyard, demanding to be released: “So healthy for us!”

Some patients who ultimately tested negative for Ebola have been let out of the holding centers, prompting a large crowd to pour into the streets to celebrate this week, thinking it meant that Ebola had been defeated. The government quickly issued a statement saying that, to the contrary, the disease "is still with us and spreading fast.”

For many patients, the prognosis is bleak. “They are deteriorating day by day; even to swallow for them is a problem,” Ms. Bangura said, adding that the constant flow of bodies, and their inability to stem it, was taking its toll on the beleaguered staff.

“To watch people like this deteriorating, deteriorating, it is like a psychological trauma for us,” she said. “Very painful for us.”

The nurses do what they can, dispensing anti-malarial medication, deworming the patients, giving them analgesics. But virtually all of those not already comatose appeared glassy-eyed and listless.

Down the road, an ambulance pulled up, delivering eight new patients to the third holding center; two of the patients were too far advanced to walk into the low-rise concrete facility at the edge of Makeni.

“The problem we are having is the little children,” said the chief health officer there, Unisa Kanu.

Unicef said Tuesday that the Ebola epidemic had orphaned at least 3,700 children in the region.

“Their mothers are already dead; we have seven orphans now,” said Mr. Kanu. “That is the problem we are having now.”

With quick and coordinated action by some of its top doctors, Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, appears to have contained its first Ebola outbreak, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.

As the epidemic rages out of control in three nations only a few hundred miles away, Nigeria is the only country to have beaten back an outbreak with the potential to harm many victims in a city with vast, teeming slums.

‘‘For those who say it’s hopeless, this is an antidote — you can control Ebola,’’ Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., said Tuesday.

Although officials are pleased that success was achieved in a country of 177 million that is a major transport and business hub — and whose largest city, Lagos, has 21 million people — the lessons here are not easily applicable to the countries at the epicenter: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Public health officials in those countries remain overwhelmed by the scale of the outbreak and are desperate for additional international assistance.

Nigeria’s outbreak grew from a single airport case, while in the three other countries the disease smoldered for months in remote rain-forest provinces and spread widely before a serious response was mounted.

Ebola, Dr. Frieden said, ‘‘won’t blow over — you have to make a rapid, intense effort.’’

While the danger in Nigeria is not over, the health minister, Dr. Onyebuchi Chukwu, said in a telephone interview that his country was now better prepared, with six laboratories able to make diagnoses and response teams and isolation wards ready in every major state.

After the first patient — a dying Liberian-American — flew into Lagos on July 20, Ebola spread to 20 other people there and in a smaller city, Port Harcourt.

They have all now died or recovered, and the cure rate — 60 percent — was unusually high for an African outbreak.

Meanwhile, local health workers paid 18,500 face-to-face visits to repeatedly take the temperatures of nearly 900 people who had contact with them. The last confirmed case was detected on Aug. 31, and virtually all contacts have passed the 21-day incubation period without falling ill.

The success was in part the result of an emergency command center financed in 2012 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fight polio. As soon as the outbreak began, it was turned into the Ebola Emergency Operations Center.

Also, the C.D.C. had 10 experts in Nigeria working on polio and H.I.V. who had already trained 100 local doctors in epidemiology; 40 of them were immediately reassigned to Ebola and oversaw the contact tracing.

The chief of the command center, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, gave credit to a coordinated effort by the Health Ministry, the C.D.C., the World Health Organization, Unicef, Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee for the Red Cross.

Nigeria also had some luck. Although the first patient, a businessman named Patrick Sawyer, was vomiting on his flight in, none of the roughly 200 others on the plane fell ill. Others did after helping him into a taxi to a hospital.

And a patient in Port Harcourt went to her church and became violently ill during a ceremony in which the congregation laid hands on her. But none became infected.

Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, the Gates Foundation’s chief executive, said she was ‘‘heartened to see this positive result of the efforts of so many in Nigeria.’’

On July 17, Mr. Sawyer defied medical advice and left a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, where he was being held for observation after caring for his sister, who died of Ebola, although it was unclear whether he knew what she had.

Nigerian news reports said he used Liberian government contacts for permission to leave, flying to Lagos by way of Ghana and Togo. He planned to go to an economic development conference there and then fly back to Coon Rapids, Minn., for his children’s birthdays, according to news interviews with his widow.

Taken to a small private hospital after he collapsed, he denied any contact with Ebola victims and was initially treated for malaria. He died on July 25.

‘‘That hospital had zero infection control,’’ Dr. Frieden said.

A nurse who helped reinsert an IV line when Mr. Sawyer was delirious and bleeding wore no gloves, had a cut on her hand and did not wash it, he said. She later died.

After malaria treatment failed, Ebola was ‘‘high on the index of suspicion,’’ Dr. Shuaib said.

He learned about Mr. Sawyer’s diagnosis as he sat chatting in his office with a colleague.

‘‘I thought: ‘Oh, my God, not Nigeria. Not Lagos.’ I knew the potential for it to spread in a densely populated place.’’

Even though the emergency center swung into action quickly and aggressive contact tracing was possible because Nigeria’s Port Health Services obtained records of Mr. Sawyer’s travel, there were still problems.

It took 14 days, Dr. Frieden said, for the first isolation ward to open in a former tuberculosis ward.

‘‘Health workers initially wouldn’t go in,’’ he said. ‘‘They were afraid. We ultimately trained 1,800 staff.’’

Wards were reconfigured to add space between beds, put in washing stations with chlorinated water and create rooms where doctors and nurses could carefully don and remove protective gear. The worked in teams of two so they could watch each other and prevent mistakes.

Nigeria’s success shows how important preparation is, Dr. Frieden said, adding, ‘‘Some countries that could well be the next Lagos still don’t have a clue about how to deal with this.’’

Living With the Terror of Ebola

LAGOS, Nigeria — A FEW weeks ago, I flew from Atlanta to Murtala Muhammed International Airport here. Everything about the flight was routine, until I saw a flight attendant, a face mask flattening her blond hair, tentatively approach an older woman sitting several rows behind me. Upon landing, the flight attendants informed us that there would be a delay in disembarking because the woman was ill.

The passengers began gossiping: It couldn’t be Ebola, could it? We were going the wrong way — toward the hot zone, not away from it. The man next to me, who had dismissively told me earlier that Ebola was no big deal in Nigeria, fretted over whether he had walked past her seat and touched anything. Someone else wondered whether we would be all quarantined. Two men in protective clothing entered the plane and tended to the woman; to our surprise, after some minutes, we were allowed to leave.

Nigeria is in a web of countries, mostly in West Africa but stretching down to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the current outbreak of Ebola has spread. According to the World Health Organization, the virus has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 7,000. Last week, the W.H.O. announced that Ebola could become endemic to West Africa. Nevertheless, after a Liberian-American brought the virus from Monrovia to Lagos, Nigerian authorities managed to keep the number of cases down. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that Nigeria is now nearly Ebola-free[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/health/ebola-outbreak-in-nigeria-appears-to-be-over.html?_r=0].

That declaration hasn’t changed how Lagosians think about our new reality, though. We are all on edge, and becoming accustomed to the realization that we are dangerously vulnerable to other people, both close to us and over our borders. It is the slow-burning shock of realizing that Ebola is not going away anytime soon.

From Lagos to Freetown, Sierra Leone, and even in Monrovia, Liberia, a majority of people are carrying on with life as usual — albeit with some modifications. Most people I know now carry hand sanitizer around and religiously cleanse several times a day; they know that, in contaminated areas, chlorine can be used to kill the virus; and, before being allowed to enter public buildings, they submit to checks by security guards armed with “temperature guns” that detect a fever. On a recent excursion to a nightclub, a guard put one of these devices to my head and then told me I had “passed”; at the entrance we were required to take hand sanitizer from a dispenser just to be sure. And in a crowded city of 21 million, we try to touch each other as little as possible (try, anyway). A low level of paranoia is contagious: After a few days of little sleep, I felt slightly sick. Despite the unlikelihood, I immediately wondered if I had caught the virus.

Still, we have our weddings, our celebrations and our gatherings of grief, in the same spirit of mutual joy and pain. Americans and Europeans, following the crisis from afar, don’t seem to understand this. To many of them, Africans seem to be little more than vessels of disease, things to be feared and pitied. After a man plunged a syringe filled with an unknown but seemingly harmless substance into a United States air marshal at the Lagos airport — an apparently random crime by someone who may be mentally ill — the American news media breathlessly speculated about an African terrorist infecting himself with Ebola and spreading the disease abroad.

From my base in Lagos, it is also difficult for me to imagine the horrors that families have experienced, in the villages and city quarters where Ebola has wrought the most havoc. I can only try to feel their confusion and hurt, emotions I would feel had, by a twist of fate, their home been mine. Now that the first Ebola case has been confirmed in the United States, in Dallas, there’s a growing sense that Ebola is not just Africa’s problem.

Last week, I flew to London for a few days, and then on to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, across the continent from the heart of the Ebola crisis. After hours in various immigration lines, I triumphantly claimed my transit visa when two airport staff members in white coats stopped me and said they needed to check my temperature. One held the gun to my head and then, a few moments later, frowned at the machine. He said I had an elevated temperature. I felt panic mixed with dread. “I’ve been in line for two hours with a crowd of people in a hot room!” I explained. They asked if I had been vomiting. I told them I hadn’t, and they let me leave.

Not for the first time, I had to face the fact that Ebola has become an ever-present part of life.

U.S.
Scrutiny in Texas to Detect Whether Ebola Spread

DALLAS — The man who has become the first Ebola patient to develop symptoms in the United States told officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 26 that he had just arrived from West Africa but was not admitted that day because that information was not passed along at the hospital, officials acknowledged Wednesday.

The man, Thomas E. Duncan, was sent home under the mistaken belief that he had only a mild fever, a hospital administrator said; the information that he had traveled from Liberia, one of the nations at the heart of the Ebola epidemic, was overlooked. Mr. Duncan came back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 28 and was admitted for treatment, but in those two days in between, his contacts with a number of people — including five schoolchildren and the medics who helped transport him to the hospital — potentially exposed them to Ebola, forcing officials to monitor and isolate them in their homes and to begin a thorough cleaning of the schools the students attended. Mr. Duncan is now in serious but stable condition.

Mr. Duncan’s case began with him playing the part of good Samaritan on another continent. Mr. Duncan — a Liberian national in his mid-40s who had come to America to visit relatives in Dallas — had direct contact with a woman stricken by Ebola in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Sept. 15, days before he left Liberia for the United States, the woman’s parents and Mr. Duncan’s neighbors said.

The family of the woman, Marthalene Williams, 19, took her by taxi to a hospital with Mr. Duncan’s help after failing to get an ambulance. Ms. Williams was turned away for lack of space in the hospital’s Ebola treatment ward, the family said, and they took her back home in the evening, hours before she died: Mr. Duncan helped carry her because she was no longer able to walk. In the taxi, Ms. Williams, who was seven months pregnant, had been convulsing.

Mr. Duncan flew on Sept. 19 from Monrovia to Brussels, where, according to United Airlines, he took Flight 951 to Washington Dulles Airport and continued to Dallas/Fort Worth on Flight 822, arriving Sept. 20. Here in Dallas, the case was being handled with extraordinary caution and raised widespread concern. There was no indication of panic among residents in the largely Hispanic and African neighborhood where Mr. Duncan was staying in the Fair Oaks section of the city. But misinformation about how the disease spreads was everywhere, even as local, state and federal health officials continued to make clear that Ebola is not an airborne illness and is not spread through casual contact but through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person.

“We’re confident that it’s isolated and it’s being contained, but everyone is working tirelessly to double- and triple- and quadruple-check their work, to make sure that we’ve done an absolutely thorough job of identifying anyone who might be at any risk,” said the top elected official of Dallas County, County Judge Clay Jenkins.

Some members of the Liberian community in the Dallas area said that given the spread of the disease in their home country, they were skeptical of the health information being released publicly, adding that public gatherings were being canceled out of fear of possible contagion.

At an African cafe down the street from the apartment complex where Mr. Duncan had been staying with relatives and a middle school attended by one or two of the students being monitored, a group of Ethiopian men and women sat talking at a table outside. No one knew Mr. Duncan or his family, and one woman was unfamiliar with Ebola and its effects.

“I touch you like this,” a man told her, tapping her on the knee, “and you get Ebola.”

Officials said Wednesday that they believed Mr. Duncan came into contact with 12 to 18 people when he was experiencing active symptoms and when the disease was contagious, and the daily monitoring of those people had not yet shown them to be infected.

When Mr. Duncan first arrived at the hospital on Sept. 26, six days after he had arrived in America, he told a nurse that he had come from West Africa. Public health officials have been urging doctors and nurses to be on the alert for Ebola in anyone who has been in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. But information about Mr. Duncan’s travel was not “fully communicated” to the full medical team, said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Resources, the parent organization that oversees Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

As a result, that information was not used in the clinical diagnosis and Mr. Duncan was sent home, with the diagnostic team believing he simply had a low-grade fever from a viral infection, Dr. Lester said.

The five students who came into contact with Mr. Duncan attend four Dallas area public schools. They have been advised to stay home from school. The students — at a high school, a middle school and two elementary schools — are under observation by county health officials. “The students don’t have symptoms, so the odds of passing on the virus is very low,” said Mike Miles, the Dallas district’s superintendent.

The schools will remain open, but will undergo an extensive cleaning. Additionally, at least three Dallas Fire and Rescue emergency medical technicians were being monitored and were in isolation at home, although they, as well as the other adults under observation, were free to leave their homes because they were not being quarantined. The medics helped transport Mr. Duncan to the hospital on Sept. 28. Even the emergency vehicle that was used — Ambulance No. 37 — is in isolation and not in service, officials said.

“This case is serious,” Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said at a news conference at the hospital on Wednesday. “This is all hands on deck.”

Some of the children and adults under observation are from Liberia, but it was unclear how many. There are an estimated 10,000 Liberians living in four counties in North Texas, including Dallas and Tarrant counties. One active group, the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, was founded more than 30 years ago.

In Kannapolis, N.C., a man who only gave his name as Joe said he was Thomas Duncan’s brother and that Mr. Duncan’s mother was inside a house there. “His mom is in there crying for her son,” he said. “I’m worried about my brother. And I’m over here trying to figure out what to do.”

In Monrovia, Mr. Duncan had lived in a neighborhood called 72nd SKD Boulevard, for two years, living by himself in a small room that he rented from the parents of the ill young woman he helped carry, Emmanuel and Amie Williams. Mr. Duncan had told them and his neighbors that his son lived in the United States, played baseball, and was trying to get him to come to America.

For the past year, Mr. Duncan had worked as a driver at Safeway Cargo, the Liberian customs clearance agent for FedEx, said Henry Brunson, the company’s manager. Mr. Duncan quit abruptly on Sept. 4, giving no reason. But Mr. Brunson said he knew that Mr. Duncan had family members in the United States.

“His sister came from the United States and he asked for a day off so that he could go meet her at the Mamba Point Hotel,” Mr. Brunson said, mentioning a hotel popular among foreigners. “He quit a few weeks after that.”

The way Mr. Duncan appears to have been infected with Ebola is typical in Monrovia, where the epidemic is spreading rapidly and most people are dying at home because of a lack of ambulances and Ebola treatment centers. At home, they spread the virus to family and friends who are taking care of them.

The family of Ms. Williams said they had no choice but to take her back home after being turned away from John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, first at its maternity ward and then at its Ebola center. While she was sick at home, she appeared to have also infected a neighbor, Sarah Smith, whose corpse was picked up Wednesday.

Neighbors said that an ailing Ms. Williams used to visit Ms. Smith, who lived in a pink house next door. After Ms. Smith fell ill, a friend of hers living nearby started coming over to take care of her. That friend, Marie Wread, did chores for Ms. Smith, including washing her clothes.

On Wednesday, a visibly ill Ms. Wread was taken by ambulance to a hospital; her daughter, Mercy, 9, joined her in the ambulance, though she was not showing symptoms herself. Other neighbors, fearful of the growing contagion, had insisted angrily that Mercy be taken away.

Ms. Williams appears to have been the first patient in her area of the Monrovia neighborhood. On Sept. 15, Mr. Duncan rode in the taxi in the front passenger seat while Ms. Williams, her father and her brother, Sonny Boy, shared the back seat, her parents said. Later, after being turned away at the hospital, Mr. Duncan helped carry Ms. Williams back to the family home that evening.

“He was holding her by the legs, the pa was holding her arms and Sonny Boy was holding her back,” said Arren Seyou, 31, who witnessed the scene and occupies the room next to Mr. Duncan’s.

Sonny Boy, 21, also started getting sick about a week ago, his family said. In a sign of how furiously the disease can spread, an ambulance had come to their house on Wednesday to pick up Sonny Boy. Another ambulance picked up a woman and her daughter from the same area, and a team of body collectors came to retrieve the body of yet another woman — all four appeared to have been infected in a chain reaction started by Marthalene Williams.

A few minutes after the ambulance left, Ms. Williams’ and Sonny Boy’s parents got a call. It was about Sonny Boy. He had died on the way to the hospital.

Exclusive: Koch Group Drops Its Guard in New Attacks

Good Thursday morning from Washington, where the Secret Service is trying to move beyond scandal and the president has left for his old hometown to talk up the economy.

Polls and statistical models may show Republicans with a decisive edge in the fight for control of the Senate. But privately, many Republicans worry that the race is still far too close — and they are moving to change that.

A group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers is shifting tactics in several of the most competitive Senate races and will begin more direct and aggressive attacks on Democratic candidates.

The group, Americans for Prosperity, plans to put millions of dollars into the offensive — through digital advertising, direct mail pitches and door-to-door-campaigning — in states like Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina.

It is a significant development that will require greater financial disclosure from one of the biggest and most secretive players in Republican politics. Americans for Prosperity has been deft at using its nonprofit status and avoiding making public how it spends its money.

The change means the Kochs can shift from making generic attacks on Democratic candidates that, for example, urged voters to call a politician’s office on a specific issue like education, to more direct negative attack ads.

Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, said the group was making the change “reluctantly.”

“Over the past 10 years, our focus has always been on free-market issues, and urging lawmakers to be responsive to the public,” Mr. Phillips said. “But many Democrat politicians have made it abundantly clear that they are working for Harry Reid and President Obama – not the people they represent. Their policies are wreaking havoc on the lives of millions, and it’s time for them to go.”

The organization is also pouring money into a field operation to help defeat Democratic candidates, and has hired about 500 workers.

Feeling Unappreciated on Economy, Obama Looks Home for Support

President Obama is in Chicago today seeking some hometown love on a topic where he feels especially unappreciated: the economy.

The president and his allies believe his administration does not get the credit it deserves for bringing the economy back from the brink of collapse and for slowly and steadily reviving it. They point to 54 consecutive months of job growth, a domestic energy boom and slower increases in health care costs, among other developments.

Still, many Americans feel economically anxious, and the White House has struggled to sell positive economic news to a public unsettled by terrorism, war and Ebola.

“There is a schism between the economic data and the political sentiment,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff.

Mr. Emanuel, who is scheduled to attend his former boss’s speech at Northwestern University, said one reason for the disconnect was that economic gains were not being shared among income groups. The president is expected to argue that Democratic initiatives, such as raising the minimum wage and ensuring pay equity, will better spread the wealth.

‘I Got My Life Back,’ Tom DeLay Says After Court Victory

Tom DeLay, once one of Washington’s most formidable figures, triumphed Wednesday in his nine-year criminal case, as Texas’ highest court threw out the money laundering and conspiracy charges that helped topple the former House majority leader.

“I got my life back, and I can now go forward to whatever that is,” Mr. DeLay said in an exclusive interview with First Draft, noting he spent about $1 million fending off a three-year jail term. “Hopefully I can get a job. I am not a rich man.”

Mr. DeLay said he was the victim of a Democratic vendetta and the “criminalization of politics” that he says is now being replayed in the prosecution of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas in the same Austin jurisdiction. But he isn’t whining.

“I am a big boy, and I know what it is all about,” he said. “The best part of today is we finally defeated them.”

Mr. DeLay, now 67 and a grandfather, would not rule out a future run for office.

“I think a few people are worried about that,” he said giddily.

Chris McDaniel, the Tea Party-backed Mississippi Senate candidate, is back in court, continuing his battle to overturn the primary election he lost to Senator Thad Cochran.

Secret Service as Movie Punch Line, but Not on Purpose

It was a distinctly Washington moment at a screening of the new movie “Gone Girl” this week.

At one point in the film, Ben Affleck, playing a husband whose wife has gone missing, urges his lawyer, played by Tyler Perry, to help him find her.

Mr. Perry’s character assures Mr. Affleck’s character that he has his best men on it: “Two ex-Secret Service agents.”

A knowing chuckle went through the crowd gathered at the Motion Picture Association of America, just two blocks from the fence recently scaled by a knife-wielding intruder who raced through the White House.

Call it the Cliff’s Notes version of President Obama’s economic record.

As Mr. Obama travels to his hometown of Chicago on Thursday in an election-season effort to shift the public’s attention to bright spots in the economy, the White House has released a new set of infographics[http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/economic-update-where-we-are-and-where-were-going] highlighting the administration’s economic record in easily digestible visuals.

The visuals, which the White House hopes will gain traction through social media, are an attempt to capture “where we are, and where we’re going,” in the words stripped across the top of the series of charts and graphs being pushed by the White House. They are intended to grab the eyeballs of voters who may not tune in to Mr. Obama’s speech — and to drive home his message to those who do.

More than any indicators Mr. Obama can point to or dense fact sheets his senior aides can compile, the infographics use simple metrics to depict the fundamentals of what the White House argues has been a robust economic recovery. One bar chart shows how the employment picture has turned around since Mr. Obama took office, culminating in the creation of more than 10 million jobs over the past 54 months. Others show the degree to which the deficit has fallen and high school graduation rates have risen. A line chart illustrates a slowing in the growth of health care costs.

There’s no new information here; it’s just a different way of presenting it. Presidents have always grasped for ways to dodge the filter of the news media and take their messages straight to the public, and Mr. Obama’s team has been particularly aggressive in recent years about using social media to do so.

The task is especially vital now, with the news cycle dominated by terrorism and war, Ebola, and Secret Service lapses — none of which do anything to lift Democrats’ hopes with fewer than 40 days left before the midterm congressional elections.

Business Day
Markets Buckle, Hit by Weak Economic News

The stock market got off to a rough start to October on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 240 points as investors reacted to a round of negative economic news.

At first stocks declined after a report that German manufacturing slowed last month. The selling accelerated after a separate survey indicated that American manufacturing slowed as well.

“A lot of people thought this economic data was going to be robust, so when it was weak, everyone moved to reposition,” said Thomas L. di Galoma, head of rates and credit trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets.

The Dow industrials lost 238.19 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,804.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 26.13 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,946.16. The Nasdaq composite index lost 71.31 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,422.09.

The closely watched manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management fell to 56.6 in September[http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=24380] from 59 in August, well below the 58.5 reading that economists had expected.

The decline in the I.S.M. index came after the financial data firm Markit reported that German manufacturing contracted[http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/500b6b4240084dd085c344857edb3549] in September, the latest sign that Europe was being hurt by the economic sanctions on Russia. It was the first slowdown in 15 months.

“We’re in a global economy these days, and U.S. companies get a lot of their revenue and earnings from outside the U.S.,” said Matthew Rubin, director of investment strategy at Neuberger Berman. “Investors have valid concerns that the European slowdown could hit companies’ bottom line.”

In another sign of an economic slowdown, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell[http://www.census.gov.proxy.bc.edu/construction/c30/pdf/release.pdf] a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in August, the second decline in the last three months, with housing, nonresidential and government projects all showing weakness.

Traders moved quickly into government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 2.39 percent, from 2.50 percent late Tuesday, while its price jumped 29/32, to 99 28/32.

Utility stocks, which are favored by investors in times of volatility for their higher-than-average dividends, were among the few that rose on Wednesday. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 utility companies, increased 0.5 percent.

There was one positive report Wednesday. The payroll processor ADP said private employers added 213,000 jobs[http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/2014/September/NER/NER-September-2014.aspx] in September, the sixth straight month of gains above 200,000. That survey came ahead of the Labor Department’s report Friday on the job market in September. Economists are forecasting that employers added 215,000 workers last month and the unemployment rate will remain at 6.1 percent.

Despite October’s shaky start, analysts say the next three months may be better.

In recent years, the stock market has risen sharply in the year’s last quarter. The S.&P. 500 rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter last year and 11 percent in the same period in 2011. In 2012, the S.&P. 500 fell in the fourth quarter, but only 1 percent.

News that the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States reverberated through several industries. Airlines were among the hardest hit as investors feared people would travel less. American Airlines fell $1.09, or 3 percent, to $34.39, and Delta by $1.25, or 3.5 percent, to $34.90. Southwest Airlines by $1.22, or 3.6 percent, to $32.55.

Drug makers developing treatments for Ebola rose. Tekmira Pharmaceuticals jumped $3.85, or 18 percent, to $24.99 after it said it might start clinical trials for an Ebola drug this year. NewLink Genetics, another company looking into Ebola treatments, rose $1.53, or 7 percent, to $22.95.

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org] lost its first staff member from what a spokesman for the organization on Wednesday called a “probable” case of Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The victim, a Liberian woman, had worked for the peacekeeping mission in Liberia for nearly a decade, almost from the time the United Nations arrived in the country to help it rebuild after years of crippling civil war. She fell ill on Sept. 20 and died Monday, the United Nations said. A spokesman declined to give further details.

The death comes as the United Nations is increasing its efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html], including by sending specialists to the region. Anthony Banbury, the head of a new emergency mission to contain Ebola, arrived in the region this week. He vowed to make progress in containing the outbreak within 60 days, including by making treatment available to the majority of the sick.

Ebola has killed some 3,000 people out of more than 6,000 cases. Liberia has been the worst hit, followed by Sierra Leone and Guinea. It is the only one of the three affected countries with a United Nations peacekeeping mission. There are nearly 6,000 soldiers and police officers in the country, along with about 850 local staff members. The Philippines pulled out its troops in August over Ebola fears.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Talks in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong’s chief executive will hold talks with student protesters via a government official, but he won’t resign, he said in a TV address late today.

Crowds massed around the city’s main government offices[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html] after police officers were seen with containers of rubber bullets, tear gas and other riot control gear.

• Looking for help.

The governments of Britain and Sierra Leone host a conference in London today, aiming for new donations[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29453755] to fight Ebola.

In Dallas, officials said today about 100 people are at risk[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html] of Ebola exposure from a patient diagnosed in the United States, while drug companies may get federal approval to sharply increase production[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/us-to-increase-production-of-experimental-drug-but-may-not-meet-demand.html] of an experimental drug.

• Captured.

The leader of a drug cartel was arrested[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/americas/mexico-leader-of-cartel-is-captured.html] in a town in central Mexico that’s popular with American retirees, San Miguel de Allende.

The U.S. Treasury Department, which had offered a reward[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/20131114_villa.pdf] of up to $5 million, says his gang is responsible for “countless murders.”

• The Secret Service’s new director.

Joseph Clancy, a retired agency veteran[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/retired-veteran-of-presidents-detail-will-temporarily-lead-secret-service.html] who spent the last three years in charge of security at Comcast, takes over as interim leader after the director, Julia Pierson, resigned[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/julia-pierson-secret-service.html] on Wednesday.

• Signing up.

Turkey’s Parliament today gave[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/02/world/europe/ap-eu-turkey-islamic-state.html] the government new powers to proceed with military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

• Limits on voting rejected.

Lawyers for North Carolina plan to appeal[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/2-new-limits-on-voting-in-north-carolina-are-rejected-by-us-court.html] to the U.S. Supreme Court today a federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday that forced the state to restore two provisions for ballot access.

Civil rights groups say the law would disproportionately harm black voters.

• Blackwater jurors closing in.

A verdict is expected today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/blackwater-iraq-shooting-trial-manslaughter.html] in the murder and manslaughter case against four former Blackwater Worldwide security contractors charged in a shooting that left 17 unarmed civilians dead[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/world/middleeast/18iraq.html] in Baghdad, in 2007.

• Twitter leak?

The St. Louis County prosecutor is investigating a possible leak by a grand juror[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/possible-leak-by-ferguson-grand-juror-is-investigated.html] in the case of the Ferguson, Mo., police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.

A post to Twitter that was later deleted said: “I know someone sitting on the grand jury. There isn’t enough at this point to warrant an arrest.” Grand jury proceedings are legally secret.

• Back home.

President Obama wakes up in Chicago this morning. He’ll give an address on the economy at Northwestern University’s business school this afternoon.

At night, he’ll attend the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual awards gala[http://hhm.chci.org/awards-gala/] in Washington.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are down sharply again. European shares closed with a loss of around 2 percent, and Asia markets ended down moderately.

• New orders for U.S. factory goods fell the most on record in August, 10.1 percent, the government said today. But stripping out transportation orders resulted in a modest 0.1 percent decline.

• Vladimir V. Putin told an investment forum[http://www.cnbc.com/id/102052304#.] in Moscow today that he would help companies hurt by Western sanctions and move ahead with privatizing energy companies.

More than 5,700 beers from over 700 domestic breweries will be judged at the Great American Beer Festival[http://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/], beginning today in Denver.

• The birth of student activism.

His arrest for distributing information about the civil rights movement 50 years ago sparked a student protest there and spurred the beginning of widespread student activism.

BACK STORY

Despite the official U.S. separation of church and state, God and government still go hand in hand in many instances.

This year is the 150th anniversary of the use of “In God We Trust”[http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx] on American money.

Congress authorized it in 1864 for a new two-cent piece (one losing suggestion was “Our God and Our Country”). The next year, it was approved for silver and gold coins.

In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed off on it as the official national motto, bumping off the unofficial “E pluribus unum.”

“So help me God,” the phrase used in many U.S. oaths of office, dates to the Judiciary Act of 1789.

Although there is no law requiring it for presidents, every one since Franklin D. Roosevelt has chosen to say “so help me God” with a hand on a Bible.

It has become optional in many other oaths. Last month, after the threat of a legal challenge[http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/09/17/the-air-force-will-now-allow-airmen-to-omit-so-help-me-god-from-enlistment-oaths/], the Air Force stopped requiring the phrase for enlisting airmen.

U.S.
Dear Parent: A Student May Have Been Exposed to the Ebola Virus
By KJ DELL'ANTONIA

The Dallas papers are reporting that after school officials notified parents that five students at four schools[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/us/retracing-the-steps-of-the-dallas-ebola-patient.html] may have been in contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the man in Dallas in whom Ebola has been diagnosed, parents rushed[http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/10/01/6165611/officials-say-only-one-ebola-case.html] to remove their children from the schools in question.

That’s hardly surprising. In spite of reassurances from officials[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/30/cdc-confirms-first-case-ebola-diagnosed-us] and the news media[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-phobia-5-reasons-why-you-should-not-panic-over-n216246], there is a pervasive sense that this Ebola story is evolving, and not yet improving. Less reassuring news media reports that the number of people who were potentially in contact with the patient has increased from “12 to 18″ to 80, and headlines reading that the man was “throwing up all over the place,”[http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/chi-ebola-patient-america-20141002-story.html] combined with the hospital’s failure to diagnose the illness on the patient’s first visit in spite of his recent arrival from Liberia (which even the most casually paranoid among us could consider a blatant red flag), have created a sense of uncertainty. When an atmosphere of uncertainty meets fear, an excess of caution can feel perfectly reasonable.

So who can blame the parents who dropped everything to pick up their children? While the risk appears minimal, the possible consequence is dire, and the cost of keeping a child at home for a few days small — if one parent is at home, or child care is available. Once you factor in time off from work or child care expenses, the equation changes — and then it’s time to look at that risk more closely.

Ebola can be transmitted only through body fluids, and is only contagious once symptoms have developed. If you can presume the children who have had contact with the patient will stay home, the only risk to the other children in the school would be if one of those first five children (the ones already in contact with the patient) had already developed symptoms of Ebola to be passed on in the form of body fluids, and another child had contracted Ebola, and that child became symptomatic while at school.

On the one hand, that’s a lot of ifs. On the other hand, there’s no reassuring impossibility in that scenario. According to the C.D.C.[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/index.html], Ebola virus symptoms can appear from two to 21 days after exposure. There has been enough time for a child to have been exposed (unlikely though that seems), but not enough time has yet elapsed to rule it out.

What does the responsible parent do? Personally, I suspect that while I might condemn the parental over-reaction in Dallas, I might (equipped as I am with a flexible work schedule ) respond the same way. In the absence of that flexibility (or without access to paid leave) I might be more inclined to rely on those odds.

That’s not my professional assessment, it’s my parental gut. Fear isn’t logical. But we, as parents, may need to find a way to become logical about this. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness[http://ncdp.columbia.edu] at Columbia University, recently told WCBS 880 in New York that an Ebola case in the city is “inevitable.”[https://twitter.com/peterhaskell880/status/517698995523960832] (He added that the health system is equipped to handle it.) If that’s the case, it’s also inevitable that families in other parts of the country will soon be making the same calculations parents in Dallas are making right now.

Man in U.S. With Ebola Had Been Screened to Fly, but System Is Spotty

As he was preparing to leave Liberia for Dallas two weeks ago, Thomas E. Duncan, the man confirmed to be the first Ebola case in the United States, was checked at the airport for signs of the disease. He was determined to have no fever and allowed to board his flight, American officials say. 

Since the deadly Ebola virus began spreading rapidly through West Africa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] has been pushing the authorities in the worst-hit countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, to implement just that type of screening for departing passengers.  

In early August, the C.D.C. sent medical workers to the region to train local government officials and airport workers in Ebola screening, according to Dr. Nicole Cohen, an infectious disease specialist with the agency’s Division of Migration and Quarantine. As part of that process, the agency advises that airport workers ask travelers if they have been exposed to Ebola in the last 21 days, have had a fever, and have had any symptoms including severe headache, muscle ache, abdominal pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. The screener is expected to use a hand-held non-contact temperature monitor, a few inches from the travelers’ forehead, to check for fever.

But the system has its limits, relying on the traveler to reveal whether he or she has been exposed. And it leaves it to local officials to conduct the screening as they see fit, Dr. Cohen said. It is unclear how consistently or effectively those screenings are conducted across West Africa, and Dr. Cohen said she did not know how many potential travelers had been caught by screeners — if any. 

“Our expectation is that people who are sick or people who are exposed should be getting the message they shouldn’t be traveling.” 

Airlines have not taken any specific steps to deal with Ebola, representatives from several carriers said. They follow general guidelines issues by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization. They have also informed their flight attendants about the hazards of Ebola, its symptoms and how the disease is spread. Delta has increased the supplies of gloves and sanitizers on board. But beyond taking simple precautions, airlines said they were not responsible for screening passengers.

The number of those passengers from West Africa is large. According to Airlines for America, the trade association of American carriers, more than 10,000 people flew to the United States from Sierra Leone from April 2013 to March 2014, and more than 17,000 flew from Liberia in the same period. Those figures include only passengers who flew on itineraries involving an American carrier.

The Dallas patient, Mr. Duncan, flew from Brussels to Dulles International Airport near Washington on Sept. 20 on United 951, and then on to Dallas-Fort Worth on Flight 822, the airline confirmed. It appears likely he got to Brussels from Liberia on Brussels Airways, a United code-share partner in the Star alliance.

United, in a statement, said it had been informed by the C.D.C. that its passenger was the one now hospitalized in Dallas. The airline repeated a statement from the director of the C.D.C. that there was “zero risk of transmission” to other passengers on the flight, because the man was not symptomatic at the time and thus could not have been contagious. But as a precaution, the airline said, it was “providing information about the flights United believes the patient took.”

Historically, the airlines have been most concerned with passengers who are so sick that they might force a flight to divert. Airlines are authorized to stop sick passengers from getting on planes, but are not required to do so. Under Department of Transportation rules, United States and foreign carriers flying to this country cannot exclude a passenger simply because the traveler has a communicable disease, but can do so if the disease poses “a direct threat.” Guidance issued by the department says that if the disease is serious and easily communicable, that constitutes such a threat. It cites SARS and active tuberculosis as examples.

The C.D.C. also offers advice to airline cabin crews in dealing with sick passengers. For gastrointestinal diseases like Ebola, it recommends seating the traveler close to a lavatory and restricting the use of that lavatory only to ill travelers; providing a plastic bag to dispose of used airsickness bags; and encouraging sick travelers to wash their hands and use alcohol-based hand cleaners.

If a passenger gets sick on board, the cockpit crew is supposed to radio ahead so the plane can be met by emergency medical service personnel and someone who can evaluate the passenger. The center asks Customs and Border Protection, which stamps passports, to watch for ill travelers and notify the C.D.C. if it finds them.

“They are our eyes and ears,” said Christine Pearson, a spokeswoman at the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta.

A spokeswoman for Airlines for America said that carriers that flew to West Africa “remain in steady contact with government agencies and health officials, and have procedures in place to monitor and quickly respond to potential health concerns.” The spokeswoman, Victoria Day, said the group’s members “are being provided regular development updates from the Centers for Disease Control on worldwide health precautions.”

The World Health Organization does not ban travel to countries with Ebola outbreaks, and there are no travel restrictions or closures of border entry points.

Delta stopped flying to Liberia on Aug. 31. The airline used to fly from there three times a week to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York with a stop in Accra, Ghana. The airline said that ending service had nothing to do with Ebola and was the result of low ridership. Delta still has a daily flight to Accra, and another to Dakar, Senegal, from Kennedy. From Atlanta, Delta has a daily flight to Lagos, Nigeria. American Airlines does not fly to West Africa. United has a flight between Houston and Lagos.

Federal officials are planning to sharply increase production of ZMapp, which is viewed by many experts as the most promising experimental drug for treating people infected with Ebola in West Africa.

The Department of Health and Human Services is in advanced discussions to enlist Caliber Biotherapeutics[http://www.caliberbio.com/], a Texas company that can produce the drug in millions of tobacco plants, according to federal officials and pharmaceutical industry executives.

Federal officials, along with two of the world’s biggest charities — the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/] and the Wellcome Trust[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/] — are also looking at arranging for production of ZMapp in animal cells, the more conventional method used by the biotechnology industry. Although that would take longer, it would allow for greater output by tapping into the biotechnology industry’s huge production capacity.

“We’re going with multiple manufacturers,” a federal official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because contracts have not yet been signed. “Caliber is certainly one we’re considering.”

Despite the new efforts, supplies of the drug are expected to be limited to hundreds or thousands of treatment courses by early next year, which would not be nearly enough if the epidemic continues to spiral out of control.

“The biology just doesn’t allow you to do it tomorrow,” said Alan Magill[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/general-information/leadership/global-health/alan-magill], who heads the malaria program at the Gates Foundation and is trying to arrange for more ZMapp production.

ZMapp was able to protect monkeys from Ebola even when administered five days after infection. And it may have helped a few people infected during the current outbreak, including two American aid workers who got Ebola in Liberia and recovered at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Still, there was only enough ZMapp for seven patients, two of whom subsequently died.

Experts say it is impossible to tell from such limited experience how well ZMapp works. And there are other experimental drugs that have shown promise in animal testing, and production of those might also be increased.

But for now, ZMapp may offer the best shot because it consists of proteins called monoclonal antibodies, widely used as drugs in the biotechnology industry, which latch onto the virus and neutralize it. “It’s extremely rational that an antibody against Ebola would be effective,” said Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Sue-Desmond-Hellman], chief executive of the Gates Foundation and a former biotechnology industry executive. “It is extremely rational that it would be safe.”

ZMapp, which is actually a cocktail of three different antibodies, is being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/business/an-obscure-biotech-firm-hurries-ebola-treatment.html] a tiny San Diego company, with funding from the United States and Canadian governments.

The doses used to treat the American aid workers were produced in tobacco leaves at a facility in Owensboro, Ky., that is owned by Reynolds American, the tobacco company.

That facility has now resumed production, but the federal official said it was expected to produce only about 10 to 20 treatment courses by the end of the year, and the same amount every month going forward.

So the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority[http://www.phe.gov/about/barda/Pages/default.aspx], a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, is considering additional production from Caliber, which is based in Bryan, Tex., and co-operates on projects with Texas A&M University.

Caliber also produces proteins, including antibodies, in hydroponically grown tobacco plants but has a larger production capacity than the Kentucky facility.

No official contract has been signed, so plans could still change. But federal officials have visited Caliber regularly.

“They are actively engaged, pretty much on a daily basis, working with Caliber and A&M,” Dr. Brett P. Giroir[http://www.tamhsc.edu/about/giroir.html], the chief executive of the Texas A&M Health Science Center, said Wednesday. Executives at Caliber and Mapp declined to comment for this article.

Both Caliber and the Kentucky facility sprang from a project sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was looking for a way to quickly produce vaccines or therapeutic proteins in the event of an emergency like a flu pandemic.

Now these facilities are likely to get their first big test.

“It’s not been tested, live-fire,” the federal official said. “And now we’re doing it.”

The system involves infecting tobacco with a genetically engineered virus that contains the instructions to make the antibody.

“Every time the virus tries to replicate, it spins out a copy of a monoclonal antibody,” said Charles J. Arntzen[http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/people/charles-arntzen], a professor at Arizona State University who has long worked on such systems. The leaves are ground up to extract the antibody.

The federal official said that Caliber and other facilities that will be brought on line could produce 40 to 100 treatment courses per month.

But Dr. Giroir of Texas A&M and a biotechnology industry executive familiar with Caliber said Caliber could potentially produce hundreds of treatment courses a month.

Researchers say the dose used in the monkey experiments, which was also used to treat the patients in Africa, is probably more than needed. If monkey testing can confirm that a lower dose is sufficient, then many more human treatment courses can be made.

There are also efforts underway to increase the amount of protein produced by each plant. Mapp is said to be working with another small company, Novici Biotech, which has a method of tweaking the genetic instructions for the antibodies in a way that could boost production.

Monoclonal antibodies used for drugs — like Herceptin and Avastin for cancer, and Humira and Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis — are typically produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells, which are grown in giant stainless steel vats.

While production in tobacco is said to be faster and cheaper to get started, there is only limited tobacco capacity, while there is a huge capacity in the biotechnology industry to produce antibodies in CHO cells.

The Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, as well as federal officials, are helping to scout some of this capacity for ZMapp production. However, it would take months to genetically engineer CHO cells to produce the antibodies and to scale up production. Meaningful production would not come until next year.

And officials say new monkey testing might be needed to show the antibodies produced in CHO cells are as effective as those produced in tobacco. At least one earlier study suggested this was not the case.

Federal officials said some of the early doses of ZMapp will be tested for safety in healthy volunteers. That is controversial because it means the scarce drug would be diverted from patients in Africa.

Dr. Jeremy Farrar[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052380.htm], director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was necessary to establish basic safety, particularly in light of mistrust of Western medicine by some people in the outbreak area. “The reality is,” he added, that such safety testing “will happen quicker in the U.S. or the U.K.” But the Wellcome Trust has given a grant of about $5.2 million to a consortium that will move quickly to test ZMapp and other drugs in sick patients in Africa.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Marching in history’s shadow.

Protesters in Hong Kong have a fairly narrow set of demands[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html]: the resignation of the territory’s top official and more freedom in choosing the next one.

But the mere existence of mass protests makes Beijing anxious.

“The party equates protests with political instability and a threat to its absolute power,” says our correspondent Andrew Jacobs.

“Looking at Chinese history since the 19th century, peaceful protests have often been a prelude to more aggressive popular demands for a change in leadership.”

The demands in the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square were against corruption, censorship and social restrictions, Mr. Jacobs says.

“But they were perceived as an existential threat to the party, which is why Chinese leaders crushed them with such brutality.”

• No precedent.

Liberian authorities say that the man quarantined in Dallas with Ebola lied on an exit form[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/africa/dallas-ebola-patient-thomas-duncan-airport-screening.html] asking whether he’d been exposed, and now they want to prosecute him.

But more complex legal issues are easy to envision under U.S. law, says our reporter John Schwartz.

When AIDS was rampant, Mr. Schwartz notes, “many states experimented with laws that made knowingly exposing someone to illness a crime.”

Ebola cases could be complicated by the fact that it can take up to 20 days for symptoms to show up. Only then is a person infectious.

“Are you going to say if you’re exposed, you’re going to be held liable?” Mr. Schwartz asks.

“If you were exposed to someone who was exposed, you’re going to be held liable? If you were in Liberia, then you’re liable?”

• Sadism in prime time.

An anonymous woman is pursued by a masked, hooded figure who throws a flammable liquid on her and then her car and sets the vehicle ablaze.

That scene was from the opening of the new CBS drama “Stalker,”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/arts/stalker-stars-dylan-mcdermott-and-maggie-q.html?_r=0] which premiered this week, but it could have been on any number of crime procedurals built on story lines of victimizing women, says our TV critic Neil Genzlinger.

“The overindulgence in violence against women that you see in a lot of TV series these days has some ugly attributes — it’s voyeuristic; it’s sadistic — but above all it’s a sign of laziness,” he says.

“Not to be flip, but this kind of television is the dark side of the cat video: a guaranteed viewer reaction that requires no thought or creativity or exertion.

“The only difference is, cat videos are harmless. I don’t think gruesome, exploitative television is.”

U.S. Patient Aided Pregnant Liberian, Then Took Ill

MONROVIA, Liberia — A man who flew to Dallas and was later found to have the Ebola virus was identified by senior Liberian government officials on Wednesday as Thomas Eric Duncan, a resident of Monrovia in his mid-40s.

Mr. Duncan, the first person to develop symptoms outside Africa during the current epidemic, had direct contact with a woman stricken by Ebola on Sept. 15, just four days before he left Liberia for the United States, the woman’s parents and Mr. Duncan’s neighbors said.

In a pattern often seen here in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, the family of the woman, Marthalene Williams, 19, took her by taxi to a hospital with Mr. Duncan’s help on Sept. 15 after failing to get an ambulance, said her parents, Emmanuel and Amie Williams. She was convulsing and seven months pregnant, they said.

Turned away from a hospital for lack of space in its Ebola treatment ward, the family said it took Ms. Williams back home in the evening, and that she died hours later, around 3 a.m.

Mr. Duncan, who was a family friend and also a tenant in a house owned by the Williams family, rode in the taxi in the front passenger seat while Ms. Williams, her father and her brother, Sonny Boy, shared the back seat, her parents said. Mr. Duncan then helped carry Ms. Williams, who was no longer able to walk, back to the family home that evening, neighbors said.

“He was holding her by the legs, the pa was holding her arms and Sonny Boy was holding her back,” said Arren Seyou, 31, who witnessed the scene and occupies the room next to Mr. Duncan’s.

Sonny Boy, 21, also started getting sick about a week ago, his family said, around the same time that Mr. Duncan first started showing symptoms.

In a sign of how furiously the disease can spread, an ambulance had come to their house on Wednesday to pick up Sonny Boy. Another ambulance picked up a woman and her daughter from the same area, and a team of body collectors came to retrieve the body of yet another woman — all four appeared to have been infected in a chain reaction started by Marthalene Williams.

A few minutes after the ambulance left, the parents got a call telling them that Sonny Boy had died on the way to the hospital.

Mr. Duncan had lived in the neighborhood, called 72nd SKD Boulevard, for the past two years, living by himself in a small room that he rented from the Williams couple. He had told that them and his neighbors that his son lived in the United States, played baseball, and was trying to get him to come to America.

For the past year, Mr. Duncan had worked as a driver at Safeway Cargo, the Liberian customs clearance agent for FedEx, said Henry Brunson, the company’s manager. In a statement, Fedex said that Mr. Duncan was employed as a personal driver for the company’s general manager.

In an office with a large FedEx sign outside the building in downtown Monrovia, Mr. Brunson said that Mr. Duncan quit abruptly on Sept. 4, giving no reason. But Mr. Brunson said he knew that Mr. Duncan had family members in the United States as well.

“His sister came from the United States and he asked for a day off so that he could go meet her at the Mamba Point Hotel,” Mr. Brunson said, mentioning a hotel popular among foreigners. “He quit a few weeks after that.”

The way Mr. Duncan appears to have been infected with the Ebola virus is typical in Monrovia, where the epidemic is spreading rapidly and most people are dying at home because of a lack of ambulances and Ebola treatment centers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/world/africa/liberia-ebola-victims-treatment-center-cdc.html]. At home, they spread the virus to family and friends who are taking care of them.

Ms. Williams’s family said they had no choice but to take her back home after being turned away from John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, first at its maternity ward and then at its Ebola center. While she was sick at home, she appeared to have also infected a neighbor, Sarah Smith, whose corpse was picked up Wednesday.

Neighbors said that an ailing Ms. Williams used to visit Ms. Smith, who lived in a pink house next door. After Ms. Smith fell ill, a friend of hers living nearby started coming over to take care of her. That friend, Marie Wread, did chores for Ms. Smith, including washing her clothes.

On Wednesday, a visibly ill Ms. Wread was taken by ambulance to a hospital; her daughter, Mercy, 9, joined her in the ambulance, though she was not showing symptoms herself. Other neighbors, fearful of the growing contagion in their neighborhood, had insisted angrily that Mercy be taken away.

While Ms. Williams appears to have been the first patient in her area of the neighborhood, members of a local volunteer Ebola task force say they believe that the virus was brought in by an outsider. Ms. Williams rarely left home because of her pregnancy, they said. But a cousin who came to visit Ms. Williams later died of Ebola after apparently being infected by her mother, who is now in a Ebola treatment center, members of the task force said.

“That’s how Ebola came here,” said Mark Kpoto, 21, a task force member.

The Ebola outbreak is the worst on record. More than 3,300 people have died. But other diseases spread much faster.

Via The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/09/29/some-good-news-about-ebola-it-wont-spread-nearly-as-fast-as-other-epidemics/]

Ebola isn’t the fastest-spreading disease in human history. That distinction goes to measles. In the era prior to 1963, when children were first routinely vaccinated, each case of measles created 17 new secondary cases, with transmission spreading like wildfire in schools, especially.…Each case of the Spanish flu — which caused the pandemic of 1918 to 1920 that many call the worst in recent history — produced two to five additional victims.…

Ebola has a lower reproductive rate than measles in the pre-vaccination days or the Spanish flu. [In 2004, it was estimated] that each case of Ebola produced 1.3 to 1.8 secondary cases on average. This ongoing outbreak … has a reproductive rate that is about the same as the last one. It hasn’t become more transmissible in the more than 10 years it was lying low.

U.S.
In Dallas Schools, Fear of Possible Ebola Exposure

DALLAS — There is Ebola, and then there is fear of Ebola.

For the thousands of parents and schoolchildren in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, it is a concern that they wrestled with on Thursday morning after learning that five school-age children had had contact with a man who is ill with the disease.

“My mom, she recommended that I not touch a lot of kids at school,” said Royale Hollis, 15, a freshman at Emmett J. Conrad High School, which at least one of the children attended. “I haven’t been shaking hands, just bumping elbows. People just keep their distance. Girls don’t give boys hugs. We’re all cool with each other but we just don’t want to catch anything.”

The school is just around the corner from an apartment complex where the Ebola patient, Thomas E. Duncan, was staying before he was rushed to the hospital and given the diagnosis.

Mr. Duncan, who is in isolation at a Dallas hospital, came into contact with five children who went to four different schools — a high school, a middle school and two elementary schools.

The children are believed to have had contact with Mr. Duncan over the weekend, when he was sick and contagious, and to have attended school the following Monday. Those children, who have not been identified, are being kept at home, and health workers are monitoring them daily for signs of the disease.

None of the children have symptoms, and the chances that they passed the virus to other people at the school are extremely low, health officials said. Even when people are infected with Ebola, they are not contagious until they get develop symptoms. And even then, the virus can be transmitted only through bodily fluids and close physical contact.

Still, some parents decided to keep their children home Wednesday, according to news reports, while many others warily accepted the reassurances of public health officials — even if they planned their own improvised protective measures, like telling their children to keep their distance.

Outside Dan D. Rogers Elementary School in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood of Dallas, parents were greeted by throngs of reporters and TV cameras.

Ashley Jackson, 28, said she decided 25 minutes before the morning bell to let her kindergarten daughter come to school.

“One thing I know about my daughter: she wanted to go to school,” Ms. Jackson said. “I talked to my mom, and we spoke about it. It’s very scary.”

But she had to put her faith in the authorities, she said.

Andre Riley, a school district spokesman stationed Thursday morning at Rogers, said the school was performing nightly “deep cleanings, just to be proactive.” The district sent letters home with students and set up a hotline to reassure parents.

Inside the schools, Ebola so dominated the conversations that students said it was hard to concentrate on anything else.

Jimmy Glover, a 16-year-old sophomore at Emmett Conrad, said he had thought about wearing a medical mask to school but could not find one. “The teachers can’t really teach because everyone’s talking about it,” he said.

Alex Luna, 17, said he had considered staying home, but as a senior hoping to get into college, he did not feel he could afford to miss days. “I’m worried about catching it and spreading it to my family,” he said. “It’s not something to play around with.”

Ana Yanci, 16, a junior, said that her parents had urged her to stay home for a few days, but that she had decided to remain at school as long as other Ebola cases do not develop. “It’s not a big deal to me now,” she said. “I think it’s under control.”

Some parents said the schools should be doing more to ease concern.

Eyefe Palmer, 49, originally of Nigeria, was disappointed that administrators at L. L. Hotchkiss Elementary sent out only what amounts to a fact sheet about Ebola.

“They told me those things,” he said, “but I feel the principal should call a meeting with the parents to explain, not just a letter. Maybe to build up confidence.”

Mr. Palmer is especially nervous because the school will not release detailed information about the child who had contract with the Ebola patient, including grade level, age, gender or classroom.

“I heard the kid rides the bus,” he said. “Which bus did he ride? Who were the fellow students in that bus before they noticed? They won’t tell if the kid was in my kid’s class,” he said. “Ebola is not something you joke with.”

U.S.
Contact Tracing Is Called Pivotal in Fighting Ebola

Ebola’s arrival in Texas has set off waves of concern across the country, but despite the disease’s fearsome symptoms and high toll in Africa, health officials say that a straightforward strategy can contain it.

“Contact tracing can stop the Ebola outbreak in its tracks,” declared a chart[https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/517417364691116034] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed on Twitter on Wednesday, a message echoed in a news conference on Thursday.

Although health officials have not said how many people will be involved in contact tracing in this case, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, has said that his team is focused on identifying every person who had contact with Thomas E. Duncan, who arrived in Dallas from Liberia on Sept. 20.

Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, and someone who has it is contagious only after symptoms begin — in Mr. Duncan’s case, on his fourth day[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/us/retracing-the-steps-of-the-dallas-ebola-patient.html] in the United States. From that moment until he was put into isolated care, as many as 100 people may have been exposed to the virus, health officials in Texas said Thursday. It is the job of contact tracers to find every one[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html] of them.

Although Ebola is new to the United States, the goal of contact tracing is the same in any disease: Track down those who could have been exposed, interview them and monitor them — in this case, for 21 days, the incubation period of the Ebola virus. Those showing symptoms or thought to be at particular risk are isolated, and their contacts traced and monitored, until the outbreak is declared dead.

In the United States, it is far more common for contact tracers employed by local and state health departments to investigate measles, sexually transmitted diseases like H.I.V. and gonorrhea, and illnesses that originate with animals, such as rabies.

It is rare for contact tracers to be in the spotlight. Part disease detective, part social worker, most of the time they sleuth around without anyone really noticing. The most telling sign that a tracer has successfully done his or her job, several epidemiologists said, is that a disease fails to generate any press.

“Every health department has an unsung hero who tracks down people,” said Jennifer Nuzzo[http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-staff/profiles/nuzzo/], an epidemiologist with the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore. “They are generally really low-paid jobs, but people tend to stay at them for a long time. It’s a labor of love.”

Contrary to Hollywood depictions of disease fighters laden with technical gadgets, contact tracing is generally a low-tech art.

“They go out with clipboards and pieces of paper — write down answers to things,” Dr. Nuzzo said.

The effectiveness of the tracer requires “navigating bureaucracies that are completely foreign to your own experience,” said Derek Cummings, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

That might mean sweet-talking a hospital administrator into handing over records quickly, tracking down the celebrity guest list when a bartender at a club comes down[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.bc.edu/health/2008/02/21/hepatitis-a-crashes-ashton-kutchers-birthday-party/] with hepatitis A, or compiling a list of people who may have bought prairie dogs from an animal distributor in the Midwest linked to a Monkeypox outbreak[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5227a5.htm].

The best contact tracers, several epidemiologists said, are those who have a nuanced understanding of the community where they work and an intuitive sense of when someone might be holding back information because of shame, fear or faulty memory.

Barbara Johnson, who has spent 14 years trying to mitigate the spread of tuberculosis, an airborne disease, for the Baltimore City Health Department, says that in her quest for accurate information she tries to be both subtle and insistent.

Even when knocking on the home of a drug dealer, she said, “You come at them and treat them as equals, you offer your respect and they cooperate.”

Despite the new concern over Ebola in the United States, she said she was less alarmed by it than by enterovirus [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/science/first-deaths-linked-to-enterovirus-68-are-announced.html]68[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/science/first-deaths-linked-to-enterovirus-68-are-announced.html], a serious respiratory illness that has affected children in more than 40 states. With the rapid transmission of a virus from child to child, state to state, she said, “There’s no way you can do contact tracing.”

Crude Oil Prices Continue Decline, Dropping to Lowest Since 2012

Crude oil prices continued their decline on Thursday, with the main international benchmark falling less than 1 percent and the American equivalent dropping below $90 a barrel during the day.

Now at their lowest levels since 2012, crude prices have been under pressure in recent months. The increase in global demand for oil this year is turning out to be slower because of weaker-than-anticipated growth in China and Europe, while oil supplies remain strong, leading to growing inventories.

But the sudden drop on Thursday was seen as a response to Saudi Arabia's signaling on Wednesday to the markets that it was more interested in maintaining market share than in defending prices. Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, stunned markets by announcing that it was cutting prices by about $1 a barrel to Asia, the crucial growth market for the Persian Gulf producers, as well as by 40 cents a barrel to the United States.

With oil prices already under pressure, “there has been a widespread perception or hope that the Saudis would pull back on production,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London. Instead, he said, the Saudis are “pricing aggressively to retain buyers,” potentially at the expense of their rivals in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, like Iran and Iraq.

Brent crude, the main international benchmark, closed at $93.42, down 74 cents, on Thursday. West Texas Intermediate, its American counterpart, was around $88.60 a barrel in early trading, dropping below $90 for the first time since April 2013, before recovering to close at $91.01, up 28 cents.

Some analysts expect downward pressure on prices to continue. Citigroup last week cut its forecast for 2015 prices for West Texas Intermediate by $10 a barrel, to $89.50 per barrel.

Falling crude prices are bringing down gasoline prices for motorists. Prices fell to a national average of $3.33 a gallon for regular unleaded — the lowest since February — in the United States on Thursday, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report. “Barring any major disruptions in demand, drivers are expected to see some of the lowest prices since 2010,” the group said in a commentary.

The main source of supply growth continues to be the United States, which, as a result of the shale oil boom, now rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia in oil output. The International Energy Agency, the energy consumers organization based in Paris, says the United States produced about 8.5 million barrels a day of crude oil in August, as well as roughly three million barrels a day in liquids from natural gas. By comparison, the agency says, Russia produced about 10.9 million barrels per day in liquids. Saudi Arabia is producing an estimated 9.8 million barrels a day of crude.

Exports of crude from the United States have risen to about 400,000 barrels a day, and analysts say that the recent sale of a cargo of Alaskan crude to South Korea, a crucial market for gulf producers, by ConocoPhillips could be a breakthrough.

“What we are seeing is pressure starting to mount on the Saudis as it hasn’t before,” said Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London.

While the United States remains a modest oil exporter, its surging output pushes other oil, particularly from West Africa, out of the American market, helping to lower prices. Net oil imports to the United States have fallen since 2007 by 8.7 million barrels a day, “roughly equivalent to total Saudi and Nigerian exports,” according to a recent Citigroup report.

The production surge in the United States has enabled the oil markets to shrug off potential disruptions in supply. The confrontation with Russia over Ukraine, political instability in countries like Syria and Iraq and even the Ebola outbreak in West Africa all have the potential to disrupt supply, but instead, oil prices have softened.

Another source of unexpected crude has been Libya, where production has bounced back sharply to around 800,000 barrels a day from around 240,000 barrels a day in June.

At times of falling prices, other producers look to the Saudis to throttle supply. But this time, OPEC leaders appear reluctant to do so.

What they may be doing is jockeying ahead of a scheduled meeting in November to force countries like Iraq and Iran to share in the pain of any production cutbacks.

“The Saudis are frustrated by the expectations of Iraq and Iran that it is all on the Saudis to balance the market,” Mr. Mallinson of Energy Aspects said.

Business Day
Market Nearly Static After Days of Losses

The stock market sputtered to an indecisive close on Thursday, pausing after three straight days of losses.

Small-company stocks, which have slumped 10 percent from their peak in early July, recovered the most.

Thursday’s pause followed what has been tough spell for the market, including a 238-point drop for the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday and its weak performance in September.

The buying may have reflected people entering the market to take advantage of the recent declines, a trend of buying on the dip that has kept the market rising all year despite various geopolitical shocks and worries about Europe’s flagging economy.

Stocks had been sharply lower most of the day, only to recover in the last couple of hours of trading. The Dow had been down as much as 130 points.

“People have been waiting a long time to get back in,” said Aaron Jett, an equity strategist at Bel-Air Investment Advisors. The September decline “created an entry point for the cash on the sidelines to start buying again.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was effectively unchanged on the day, rising one one-hundredth of a point to close at 1,946.17. Technically, the S.&P. 500’s ever-so-slight gain let it avoid a fourth straight day of declines, which would have been the first time that has happened since December 2013.

The Dow fell 3.66 points, or 0.02 percent, to 16,801.05, and the Nasdaq composite rose 8.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,430.20.

The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, gained 1 percent.

“People are willing to dip their toes back in,” Mr. Jett said.

Airline stocks made a modest recovery after sliding on Wednesday. United Continental rose 66 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.13, Delta Air Lines was up 38 cents, or 1 percent, to $35.28 and JetBlue rose 34 cents, or 3 percent, to $10.59. The airlines fell sharply on Wednesday on fears that the news of the first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States might curtail demand for travel.

“Confirmation of a case of Ebola in the U.S. has joined a growing list of bad news stories with geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Hong Kong, and growth concerns around China and Europe,” Niall King of CMC Markets said in a commentary.

Even with Thursday’s slight gains, the general direction of the stock market in recent weeks has been down. The biggest point of concern for investors has been Europe, and that concern flared up again on Thursday.

European stock markets sank after Mario Draghi, the European Central Banks president, said the bank would keep interest rates at record lows and start a bond-buying program to help increase economic demand. The details of the program were limited, prompting investors to sell stocks across the Continent.

Germany’s DAX index lost 2 percent, France’s CAC-40 index fell 2.8 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 1.7 percent. Some of Europe’s riskier stock markets, including those in Spain and Italy, were down more than 3 percent.

Economic weakness in Europe has been a problem for American investors for several weeks. American companies sell goods globally, and if Europe’s economic slowdown were to continue, it could hurt their profits.

Wall Street had one bit of positive economic news. The number people seeking unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, the lowest level in more than eight years. Over all, 2.3 million people are receiving unemployment benefits, the fewest since June 2006.

Investors are waiting for the September employment report on Friday from the Labor Department. Economists forecast that employers added 215,000 workers in September and that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.1 percent.

In the bond market, interest rates rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent, from 2.39 percent late Wednesday. Its price fell 13/32, to 99 15/32.

As the Ebola epidemic intensifies across parts of West Africa, nations and aid agencies are pledging to respond with increasing force. But the disease has already raced far ahead of the promises, sweeping into areas that are not in the least prepared for it. Overflowing hospitals have turned away[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-spreading-in-west-africa.html] sick patients, and a dearth of trained medical personnel and proper equipment has compounded[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/health/Ebola-Doctor-Shortage-Eases-as-Volunteers-Begin-to-Step-Forward.html] the spread of the brutal disease.

The following organizations are involved in trying to halt the outbreak and help those affected in a variety of ways.

Doctors Without Borders

This organization has treated more Ebola patients in this outbreak than any other entity[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/health/Ebola-Doctor-Shortage-Eases-as-Volunteers-Begin-to-Step-Forward.html]. Here is a list of ways [http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/support-us]to contribute to the group’s work.

International Medical Corps

The International Medical Corps, which conducts health care training, relief and development programs, is focused on responding to the outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia. It is seeking[http://internationalmedicalcorps.org/ebola-emergency-response#.VC3KTufTZQZ] staff and volunteer workers as well as donations[https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/ebola].

Unicef

Unicef, the United Nations children’s agency, is focused on distributing equipment and educating families in West Africa about how to protect themselves. Donations for specific Ebola efforts can be made here[http://www.unicefusa.org/mission/survival/ebola].

Save the Children

Save the Children says that donations[https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.9198647/k.34C/Donate_to_the_Ebola_Childrens_Relief_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp?msource=wexgpebo0914&gclid=CMfXoLHvjsECFWsV7AodHEQA7A] will go toward training teachers, health workers, nurses and local organizations on prevention measures. The organization is also distributing protective kits and essential medical equipment.

International Red Cross

The International Red Cross, which has a history in Liberia, says it plans to send[https://www.icrc.org/en/document/ebola-stepping-humanitarian-response#.VC3HSufTZQY%20] additional staff members to Monrovia and other parts of the country to help with the outbreak. A related organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, [http://www.ifrc.org/ebola-crisis]has more than 4,000 volunteers in West Africa focused on Ebola. It has reached about 40 percent of its funding goal for efforts in Liberia. Visitors can volunteer, apply for a job or donate here. [http://www.ifrc.org/en/get-involved/]

World Food Program

The organization says it is working to prevent this public health crisis from becoming a food crisis by distributing food[http://www.wfp.org/stories/wfp-response-ebola] to patients and their families.

Samaritan’s Purse

This Christian organization, which has a long history in Liberia, is focused on delivering supplies[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/disaster/ebola-crisis/] and equipment to be used in the fight against Ebola.

Partners in Health

Partners in Health says it is working closely with an organization in Liberia and another in Sierra Leone to combat the outbreak. The organization is looking for[http://www-google-com.proxy.bc.edu/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pih.org%2Fblog%2Fpartners-in-health-ebola-response&ei=4s4tVKrtBJO3yATS0IGYBg&usg=AFQjCNFt8auJAUwku_aBVLuuXrwRrwV-WQ&sig2=hvhrjFaUmMcCz8IKYipbhQ&bvm=bv.76802529,d.aWw] health care professionals to join its staff as well as volunteers for short- and long-term positions. It is also accepting donations, specifically for its Ebola programs.[https://donate.pih.org/pages/donate/our-ebola-response?subsource=tout_blog]

Americares

The organization says that it will direct its resources[http://www.americares.org/who-we-are/newsroom/news/ebola-outbreak-urgent-deliveries-medicines-protective-gear-west-africa.html] toward sending emergency medical aid — including masks, protective clothing and disposable gowns — to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Understanding the Risks of Ebola, and What ‘Direct Contact’ Means
By DENISE GRADY

Can you catch Ebola on a crowded bus or train if you are standing next to someone who is infected? What if that person sneezes or coughs on you? If the person has symptoms, the answer could be yes.

Questions that may have seemed theoretical a few days ago have taken on a troubling reality since a traveler from Liberia, Thomas E. Duncan, carried the virus to Texas and potentially exposed dozens of people before he was placed in isolation. And the hospital where he first sought help failed to make the diagnosis, leaving him in the community for several days when he was becoming more and more contagious.

It could happen again, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], in a telephone news briefing on Thursday. He said there was no way to detect the disease during the incubation period — the interval before symptoms set in — so other infected people could pass fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] checks at airports in West Africa, just as Mr. Duncan did, and board planes to the United States.

But Dr. Frieden emphasized that the odds of contracting Ebola in the United States were still extremely low. The disease is not contagious during the incubation period, and patients do not transmit it until they develop symptoms, he said. And those with symptoms will probably feel sick enough to stay home. People are highly unlikely to catch the disease on the bus or subway, Dr. Frieden said.

The incubation period can run from two to 21 days, but is usually eight to 10. The first symptoms are typically fever, aches and pains, nausea, vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Even after they set in, it takes direct contact with bodily fluids to transmit Ebola. Blood, vomit, urine and diarrhea from very sick patients are highly infectious, but other body fluids like sweat, saliva, tears, semen and breast milk[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/breast-milk/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] are also risky.

Direct contact means that the fluids splash or spray into someone else’s mouth, eyes or nose, or enter the bloodstream through cuts or breaks in the skin.

People can also contract the disease by touching infected fluids and then touching their eyes or mouth. The virus does not spread through the air, unlike measles[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/measles/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or chickenpox[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/chickenpox/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. And Ebola does not invade healthy skin, so merely touching secretions does not mean an infection will follow. But washing hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is essential after any potential contact, to avoid spreading the virus to other people or to one’s own eyes or mouth.

Ebola does not cause respiratory problems, but a cough from a sick patient could infect someone close enough to be sprayed with droplets of mucus or saliva. Droplets can generally fly about three feet, so people dealing with anyone who may be ill are told to stand at least three feet away, preferably six. Being within three feet of a patient for a prolonged time, without wearing protective gear, is considered direct contact, Dr. Frieden said.

According to the C.D.C.[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas.html], the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops. But it can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid at room temperature. It is not clear how long it may survive in soiled linens and clothing. Bleach[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/poison/sodium-hypochlorite-poisoning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] solutions can kill it.

Dr. Frieden and other experts have been saying for months that even if Ebola did reach the United States, it would not gain a foothold, because hospitals here would quickly diagnose it and would follow rigorous infection-control procedures that would prevent the disease from spreading to health workers or other patients.

An American woman who traveled in Uganda contracted the Marburg virus[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/marburg_virus/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], similar to Ebola, and was treated in an American hospital in 2008 without spread of the disease.

Experts also say the disease would be quickly stamped out here because health authorities would trace all of a patient’s contacts and isolate any who developed symptoms.

But Mr. Duncan’s case reveals a gap in the defenses: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital failed to diagnose the disease when he first went there last Thursday night, even though his symptoms were suggestive of Ebola and he said he had recently arrived from Liberia. He returned to the apartment where he was staying, potentially infecting those around him as well as the ambulance crew that wound up rushing him back to the same hospital on Sunday.

Although there is no proven antiviral drug to treat Ebola, supportive care to nurse people through the worst of its symptoms — tremendous loss of fluids and electrolytes like potassium — can greatly improve the odds of survival. So doctors believe the death rate here would be far lower than the devastating 70 percent in West Africa.

Whether he knew it or not, boarding that plane in Monrovia was Mr. Duncan’s best hope of saving his own life.

Ebola Patient’s Journey Shows How Global Travel Is Open to the Spread of Disease

MONROVIA, Liberia — The arrival in the United States of a Liberian man infected with the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] virus shows how difficult it is to control or restrict the disease from spreading, and how porous current procedures are in a world of globalized air travel.

Liberian officials said on Thursday that they planned to prosecute the passenger, Thomas E. Duncan, for lying on an airport questionnaire[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/world/africa/dallas-ebola-patient-thomas-duncan-airport-screening.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] about not having contact with a person infected with Ebola before his travel — a pivotal part of the country’s screening process.

“He lied on his form,” said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority. “If he had answered truthfully,” he added, Mr. Duncan would not have been allowed to leave the country.

Mr. Duncan took three planes as he flew from Monrovia, the Liberian capital, to Dallas last month, connecting in Brussels and Washington.

His journey illustrates just how easily the disease can travel and how thin the procedures are, relying heavily on the honesty of travelers and the diligence of airport workers. Some experts say that the system, given its inherent weaknesses, could quickly be overwhelmed by the rapidly spreading disease.

Mr. Duncan’s temperature was taken by an airport worker in Monrovia who had been trained by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, registering a non-feverish 97.3, the agency’s director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, said Thursday.

But Mr. Duncan did not acknowledge during that screening that he had helped carry a woman stricken with the symptoms of Ebola to and from a hospital just days before[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?ref=africa], Liberian officials said. That woman died, as did her brother, who helped carry her with Mr. Duncan.

The Obama administration has not changed procedures on air travel in light of the Dallas case, beyond stressing its existing guidance to airlines and border agents to be on the lookout for sick passengers.

Customs agents at airports, for instance, conduct “passive surveillance” for overt signs of illnesses, including visual observation and questioning of entering passengers at all American ports of entry. There are “screening procedures in place at our border,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday. “There is nothing about this case that we know so far that would indicate any weakness or any flaws in that system right now.”

In an interview, Dr. Frieden defended the existing screening process at airports in the United States, saying the costs of a more comprehensive process would not be worth the potential benefits.

“Like any intervention, there are upsides and downsides,” Dr. Frieden said. There are a lot of downsides. You slow travel. You end up costing people money.”

The best way to keep the virus out of the United States is to eradicate it at its source — in Africa, he said. But in the meantime, he noted, the risk of another infected person coming to the United States is “not zero.”

“Whatever we do, we are not going to get to zero risk in the U.S. until the outbreak is over in Africa,” Dr. Frieden said. “People may be uncomfortable with it, but we tell it like it is.”

Liberia had no screening at its airports before July 26, adding measures only after an American-Liberian man, who was visibly sick and vomited during his flight, took the disease to Nigeria, resulting in 20 infections and eight deaths.

Now, Liberia says passengers’ temperatures are taken twice by scanning their foreheads with infrared thermometers, stopping anyone with a fever over 99.5 degrees, in addition to the required health questionnaire. Officials acknowledged that the controls rely in part on the honesty of travelers, but they argued that until symptoms are evident, there were few other options.

“There is nothing else we could do short of quarantining people who want to travel 21 days before their departure,” Mr. Kesselly said, referring to the maximum incubation period for Ebola.

But of the 9,624 passengers who have flown out of Monrovia on commercial aircraft under the new guidelines, only two have been flagged for additional screening.

Some health experts in the United States said that number seemed suspiciously low, saying that it was "highly unlikely” or “not possible” that such a minuscule percentage of travelers would have fevers, even if unrelated to Ebola.

Another health expert said it was plausible that airport workers were taking passengers’ temperatures and reading the numbers correctly, but questioned the accuracy of the devices and pointed out that such methods had not necessarily worked in the past.

During the SARS[http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars/overview.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] epidemic, for instance, thermal scans of more than seven million passengers leaving Canada, Singapore, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan detected no cases of the disease, one study found.

Global health officials have said the hazards of air travel are low, since infected passengers are not contagious during the incubation period.

But as the epidemic expands, these policies need to be reassessed, argued J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“Those procedures were developed when the threat was more manageable,” he said. “The threat is becoming more magnified now.”

Screening passengers at the point of embarkation will always have weaknesses, said Alexander Garza, the chief medical officer at the Department of Homeland Security from August 2009 until April 2013.

Government officials and airport workers ask, “Do you have a fever or any of these signs or symptoms, or have you been around anyone with Ebola for 21 days?”

But “how honest are people going to be?” asked Mr. Garza. “Unfortunately, there’s no simple test for that.”

Emily Veltus, who volunteered for Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone, flew home to the United States in September. She said her temperature was checked at the airport and that she had to fill out forms with questions about whether she had been in contact with sick people or dead bodies.

“My own opinion is that temperature checks do very little,” Ms. Veltus wrote in an email. “It might have a small added value, but people could just take medicine to reduce their fever.”

Still, in Monrovia, the new screening protocol appeared to be a big improvement in weeding out the visibly sick.

Ashley Gilbertson, a photographer working in Liberia, described the absence of precautions at the end of June, three months after the start of the epidemic in Liberia.

“I had gotten really sick,” he said. “I had five different symptoms of Ebola.”

He said he repeatedly sought treatment in Monrovia, but no one would test him for Ebola, even after he urged them to. When he got to the airport in Monrovia, no one took his temperature or asked him any questions about his health.

“There was absolutely no screening process, and I looked like hell,” he said. “They just stamped me and let me leave.”

Once he landed at Kennedy International Airport in New York, he said, he was asked no questions. “I got a welcome home,” he said. “It was a little bit alarming.”

Before his symptoms subsided, he said he continued seeking medical help, asking again to be tested at a clinic in Manhattan.

“There were a ton of doctors crowded around a computer, Googling Ebola,” he said. Finally, he recalled, they said, “We can’t test for this,” and gave him a Post-it with a number for the C.D.C.

“Call this if you get sicker,” he said they told him. “It was a 1-800 number. It wasn’t even an emergency line.”

Missteps on Ebola: Contamination in Dallas, Slow Aid in Liberia

DALLAS — More than six months after an outbreak of Ebola began its rampage through West Africa, local and federal health officials have displayed an uneven and flawed response to the first case diagnosed in the United States.

In the latest indication, state and local authorities confirmed Thursday that a week after a Liberian man fell ill with Ebola in Dallas, and four days after he was placed in isolation at a hospital here, the apartment where he was staying with four other people had not been sanitized and the sheets and dirty towels he used while sick remained in the home. County officials visited the apartment without protection Wednesday night.

The officials said it had been difficult to find a contractor willing to enter the apartment to clean it and remove bedding and clothes, which they said had been bagged in plastic. They said they now had hired a firm that would do the work soon. The Texas health commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, told reporters during an afternoon news conference that officials had encountered “a little bit of hesitancy” in seeking a firm to clean the apartment.

The delay in cleaning the apartment came amid reports that as many as 100 people could have had contact with the victim, Thomas E. Duncan. And it came a day after the hospital acknowledged it had turned him away when he first visited.

When Mr. Duncan, 42, first was first taken to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25, he was examined and sent home with antibiotics by doctors who apparently did not suspect Ebola. A nurse had learned from Mr. Duncan that he had traveled from Liberia, one of three African countries where the virus is rampant, but that detail apparently was not communicated to the rest of his medical team, according to hospital officials. The woman whom Mr. Duncan was staying with told CNN in an interview that she had been with him the first time he sought treatment at the hospital and that she had twice emphatically told workers there he had been in Liberia.

The international transportation system has also proved to have porous screening procedures. In an indication that current safety procedures are relying heavily on the honesty of travelers and the diligence of airport workers, the chairman of the Liberian national airport authority, Binyah Kesselly, said Thursday that Mr. Duncan had been deceptive about his exposure to the virus when he flew out of Roberts International Airport in Monrovia on Sept. 19.

Mr. Kesselly said that Mr. Duncan, who was screened before boarding and did not have a fever, answered “no” to a question about whether he had had contact with any person who might have been stricken with Ebola in the past 21 days. That is the maximum period of incubation for Ebola.In the United States, local

and national health officials have also been unclear, and sometimes contradictory, about how many people in the Dallas area may have come into contact with Mr. Duncan while contagious (the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids like saliva, blood and vomit).

They said Wednesday that they believed 12 to 18 people had direct contact. On Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for Dallas County Health and Human Services said it was thought that 80 people had contact either directly with Mr. Duncan, or secondarily with his direct contacts. Then in a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that health workers were assessing 100 people — including hospital workers and emergency medical technicians — to determine whether they had been exposed. That number does not include secondary contacts, a spokesman for the agency said.

The woman who spoke to CNN said that Mr. Duncan, had been sweating profusely and had been suffering from diarrhea, . He also vomited in the apartment complex parking lot, according to local health officials. Like all others exposed to Mr. Duncan, who is listed in serious condition, the woman has not shown symptoms of Ebola.

The failure to sanitize his sheets and towels also revealed a broader problem in handling materials possible infected with the virus. Hospitals say they face a major challenge disposing of waste generated in the care of Ebola patients because two federal agencies have issued conflicting guidance on what they should do. As a result, hospitals say, waste may pile up, and they cannot get rid of it.

Those who are discovered to have had direct contact with Mr. Duncan will be monitored for three weeks, receiving twice-a-day visits from health officials who will take their temperature and inquire about other symptoms. “Our approach really is to cast a wide net,” Dr. Frieden said.

The four family members who are living in the apartment — the woman, one of her children and two nephews — are among a handful who have been directed by the authorities to remain in isolation, after what officials said was a failure to comply with an order to stay home. Texas health officials hand-delivered orders to residents of the apartment at The Ivy, a complex in the Vickery Meadow neighborhood north of downtown, requiring them not to leave their home and not to allow any visitors inside until their roughly three-week incubation periods have passed.

The orders, known as communicable disease control orders, are permitted under the state’s health code. Violations could result in criminal prosecution or civil court proceedings. Police cars were stationed at the complex Thursday, to keep reporters out and the family in. Officials said they were arranging to have food and other necessities delivered to the apartment.

President Obama called the mayor of Dallas, Mike Rawlings, on Thursday from Air Force One, officials said, pledging whatever federal resources were necessary to treat Mr. Duncan and make sure the disease does not spread.

State and federal officials sought to reassure local residents that they were doing all that was necessary to contain the virus. But the area remained somewhat on edge, and some parents kept children home from four schools where several students had been removed because of their contact with Mr. Duncan.

Mike Miles, the superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said that attendance at the schools had been about 86 percent, down from about the usual 96 percent. Attendance at other schools showed no change. Nurses and other health workers were making the rounds of classrooms to calm students and check for symptoms.

Students arriving Thursday at Emmett J. Conrad High School, just down the block from The Ivy apartment complex, said the removal of an exposed student earlier in the week had sent shocks through the classrooms and hallways.

“My mom, she recommended that I not touch a lot of kids at school,” said Royale Hollis, 15, a freshman. “I haven’t been shaking hands, just bumping elbows. People just keep their distance. Girls don’t give boys hugs. We’re all cool with each other, but we just don’t want to catch anything.”

On Thursday, Mr. Duncan’s nephew said that even after his uncle was rushed to the hospital three days after his initial visit, vomiting and gravely ill, he did not think there was enough urgency and called the federal authorities to alert them to the situation.

“I called C.D.C. to get some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he was not getting the appropriate care,” the nephew, Josephus Weeks, told the NBC program “Today.” “And I feared that other people might get infected if he was not taken care of.”

Dr. Frieden of the C.D.C. said the report was being examined but that he did not know if there was any record of the call.

Dr. Frieden defended the lack of a more robust screening process at airports in the United States, saying the costs of setting up a more comprehensive process aimed at identifying potential Ebola carriers would not be worth the potential benefits.

"Like any intervention, there are upsides and downsides," he said. “There are a lot of downsides. You slow travel, You end up costing people money. Who’s going to get screened? Who’s going to train them? If you have a positive, where are you going to bring them to?"

He added: "Whatever we do, we are not going to get to zero risk in the U.S. until the outbreak is over in Africa."

Texas says up to 100 are at risk of exposure to Ebola

Health officials in Texas said Thursday that they had reached out to as many as 100 people who might have had contact — directly or indirectly — with a Liberian man sick with the Ebola virus while he was contagious.

Of those people, only a handful have been isolated, including family members and the medical technicians who rushed the patient, Thomas E. Duncan, to the hospital on Sunday. Most on the list are there simply because they had contact with people who had had contact with Mr. Duncan.

A spokeswoman for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, Erikka Neroes, said the initial list of 12 to 18 people thought to have direct contact with Mr. Duncan had been expanded to people who had either direct or secondary contact.

‘‘None are symptomatic,’’ Ms. Neroes said.

As interviews continue, more contacts are identified, she said, adding, ‘‘It’s constantly evolving.’’

Even as health officials scrambled to find and monitor those people, a group that includes five school-age children, they sought to ease concerns among the city’s residents. The Texas health commissioner, David Lakey, said Thursday that four members of Mr. Duncan’s family had been told to stay home and not to have visitors.

‘‘We have tried-and-true protocols to protect the public and stop the spread of this disease,’’ Dr. Lakey said. ‘‘This order gives us the ability to monitor the situation in the most meticulous way.’’

The five children who came in contact with Mr. Duncan were being kept home from school, and local officials tried to reassure parents at the four different schools they attended that the facilities were thoroughly cleaned and that children are safe. There were reports that some parents were keeping their children home.

At the same time, there were more questions about how the case was handled by local doctors and health officials as the timeline on Mr. Duncan’s activities shifted.

Initially, the federal authorities announced at a news conference on Tuesday that Mr. Duncan first sought treatment at the hospital on Sept. 26, but that account has been changed. The hospital issued a statement saying that the patient went there after 10 p.m. on Sept. 25, when he was examined and sent home. Neither the hospital nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explained how officials had gotten the date wrong and what effect it may have had on the investigation.

The woman who was hosting Mr. Duncan in Dallas told CNN on Thursday that she had brought him to the hospital the first time and twice told hospital workers he had been in Liberia. Still they sent him back with only some antibiotics to the apartment where the woman was staying with one of her children and two nephews. The woman, whom CNN did not identify, said she had no symptoms at this point.

On Thursday, Mr. Duncan’s nephew said that even after his uncle was rushed to the hospital three days after his initial visit, vomiting and gravely ill, he did not feel that they were acting with enough urgency, so he called the federal authorities to alert them to the situation.

‘‘I called C.D.C. to get some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he was not getting the appropriate care,’’ the nephew, Josephus Weeks, told the NBC News program ‘‘Today.’’ ‘‘And I feared that other people might get infected if he was not taken care of.’’

Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that things could have been handled better but said that he was confident that the measures being taken would prevent any outbreak of the disease.

‘‘It is regrettable that there wasn’t the connecting of the dots,’’ Dr. Fauci told CNN on Thursday.

Mr. Duncan remained in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday, in stable but serious condition. He probably was infected in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Sept. 15, when he helped carry his landlord’s convulsing pregnant daughter to a clinic to be treated for Ebola.

A drug that experts said is the most promising for treating people with Ebola has been in short supply, but federal officials said they are taking steps to increase production.

Still, not nearly enough supplies of the drug, ZMapp, are expected to be available by early next year should the epidemic continue to spiral out of control in Africa.

U.S. Effort to Help Liberia Finds Much Work to Do Before It Gets Started

MONROVIA, Liberia — In the furious battle against time and a rampaging Ebola epidemic, the gravel crusher joined a long list of enemies.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin A. Holsinger was standing on an acre of neatly cleared dirt, surrounded by coconut trees, bush and bright yellow earth-moving equipment — the construction site for the first of 18 Ebola treatment centers the American military plans to build in Liberia.

Suddenly, around noon on Tuesday, the local contractor announced that the crusher’s engine, needed to smash rocks, had broken. Ergo, no gravel to lay down.

“I’m frustrated,” said Petty Officer Holsinger, a United States Navy Seabee, as Liberian soldiers gazed at him from across the field. “I want to get this done and start helping people.”

Two weeks after President Obama announced that time was running out in the fight to stem the epidemic, the American treatment centers planned here in the center of West Africa’s Ebola crisis are still a long way off.

The beds for the first field hospital, flown in by the military from Kelly Air Force Base near San Antonio, remained in a hangar at Liberia’s main international airport, wrapped in plastic alongside the tents, generators and the medical equipment needed to set up the facility. Military planners say it will probably be another 10 days before even this first 25-bed treatment center is up and running.

And that unit is meant to be used solely by health care workers who become infected — not for the hundreds of new Ebola cases[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1] that have sprung up in this country in recent weeks. They will have to be served by the other 17 centers farther back in the pipeline.

“The response here is a race against time,” said Nancy Lindborg, assistant administrator with the United States Agency for International Development, which is helping the effort.

The need could not be more clear. For every Ebola patient being treated in a hospital or other setting where infected people can be isolated, there are about four more battling the disease at home, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, virtually guaranteeing that Ebola victims will pass the virus on.

Every 30-day delay it takes to vastly increase the number of people in treatment beds could triple the number of cases occurring each day at the epidemic’s peak, the C.D.C[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid=su6303a1_w].[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid=su6303a1_w] warned[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm?s_cid=su6303a1_w].

Even the Ebola case that surfaced in Dallas this week appears to stem from the lack of treatment beds here in Liberia’s capital about 5,700 miles away.

Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian who took the virus with him to Dallas, helped carry home[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/world/africa/ebola-victim-texas-thomas-eric-duncan.html?ref=africa] a neighbor who was gravely ill with the symptoms of Ebola on Sept. 15, holding her by the legs after a hospital turned her away because there were no beds, her family and neighbors said. She died the next day. A few days later, Mr. Duncan flew to the United States, Liberian officials say, his own symptoms not yet evident.

The urgency here in Liberia is so great that Capt. Andrew Hill, an American Army engineer, was recently sketching drawings for a new treatment unit in the car on the way to view the site. He then photographed it with his telephone camera and emailed the image to Vicenza, Italy, where American officers could turn it into an architectural drawing.

But in the end, the biggest obstacle may come after the centers are built.

The military is not filling the treatment centers with doctors and nurses, so the U.S.A.I.D. and the Liberian government are trying to figure out how to run them once they are completed.

The African Union, nongovernmental organizations and other nations — including Cuba — have promised to send health care workers to the region, and American officials are hoping to patch together enough personnel to operate the centers effectively. That includes training as many as 500 volunteers a week, a goal that many find overly optimistic.

“It will be a huge challenge,” said Dr. Timothy P. Flanigan, a Brown University infectious disease specialist who has been in Liberia for the past month.

For the Pentagon, which expects to deploy more than 3,000 troops in the effort, mostly from the 101st Airborne Division, the sprint to catch up with the virus began two weeks ago at Roberts International Airport, known colloquially here as Robertsfield, the aged and decrepit structure that is Liberia’s main international airport.

Planes land in viewing distance of the ruins of the passenger terminal destroyed by rockets during Liberia’s civil war. Now, Robertsfield is the receiving port of C-17 military cargo flights bringing hundreds of thousands of tons of equipment to set up the Ebola treatment units, as promised by Mr. Obama.

But when Col. Brad Johnson of the Air Force, the commander of the Joint Task Force-Port Opening, arrived at Robertsfield last month, he found a runway too degraded to withstand an avalanche of relief cargo. He had hustled to San Francisco International Airport within 10 hours of receiving his orders to deploy to Liberia, but upon arriving here found that the six-month rainy season had left holes the size of craters in the airport’s World War II-era runway.

So Colonel Johnson and a crew of engineers and construction workers have been filling in cavities, hauling rocks, sweeping up pebbles and building tented residences for the coming American troops in a round-the-clock operation.

Construction delays caused by things like a temperamental backhoe loader and a road grader with a busted steering hose have also bottlenecked the campaign. Hauling parts and equipment from the United States and Europe takes time, and then there are negotiations with local contractors for heavy equipment.

The process is also long because setting up an Ebola treatment unit is nothing like setting up a regular Army field hospital. Military field hospitals usually treat trauma patients. An Ebola treatment unit requires quarantine rooms, chlorine shower stalls and larger-than-average bathrooms — because many Ebola patients die in the bathroom, where they collapse after violent bouts of vomiting and diarrhea, and need to be removed.

On Wednesday, Michael Lumpkin, an assistant secretary of defense, was at a 300-bed Ebola treatment center under construction on the site of Liberia’s wrecked and never-occupied Ministry of Defense, built by the dictator Samuel Doe before he was killed in 1990 by a warlord, Prince Johnson.

“Those viewing rooms over there are for families so they can have their last moments with the bodies,” said Ben Hemingway, a regional advisers for the U.S.A.I.D., underscoring how different Ebola treatment units are from Army field hospitals. “Over there is where the bodies will be cremated.”

Then Mr. Lumpkin arrived at the ELWA — Eternal Love Winning Africa — treatment center managed by Doctors Without Borders that is widely viewed as the model for the American units the military is building.

In the triage area, health workers behind plastic orange fencing greeted an ambulance with two new suspected cases, barking instructions at the driver.

“Soon as you open the door, move from there!” one triage worker yelled out. “Now wash your hands! Don’t take off the gloves til you wash the hands!”

The driver scrubbed his gloved hands, took off his gloves, and then washed his hands again in the chlorine water streaming from a cooler — such chlorinated faucets are at the entrance to public buildings, hotels, supermarkets and a slew of other places.

Finally done, he moved away from the open ambulance. A minute passed, and two skinny legs appeared, attached to a 9-year-old boy. Slowly, he made his way to a plastic chair in the triage area, still separated from the workers by 10 feet and the plastic barrier. He collapsed into the chair and stared at the workers, who were wearing plastic shower caps and gloves.

He looked small and frightened.

“Small boy, wha’ your name?” the triage worker shouted.

The boy answered.

“How many times you now toilet?”

“Plenty,” the boy whispered.

“Anybody now die from your house?”

“Three,” the boy said.

Two feet away, Mr. Lumpkin surveyed the scene. Hours later, he was still grappling with it.

“The complexity of managing and running” an Ebola treatment center, he said, “was not apparent to me until I saw it firsthand.”

Ebola Patient in Dallas Lied on Screening Form, Liberian Airport Official Says

MONROVIA, Liberia — Thomas E. Duncan, the Liberian man who developed Ebola symptoms[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/man-in-us-with-ebola-had-been-screened-to-fly-but-system-is-spotty.html] in Dallas after flying from Liberia last month, lied about his history of contact with the disease on an airport questionnaire meant to screen out passengers who might be carrying the virus and is subject to prosecution when he returns, Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority, said Thursday.

When Mr. Duncan flew out of Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, on Sept. 19, he answered “no” to a question about whether he had had contact with any person who might have been stricken with Ebola in the past 21 days, the maximum period of incubation for Ebola, Mr. Kesselly said.

“He lied on his form,” Mr. Kesselly said. “If he had answered truthfully, he would have been sent to secondary screening immediately and not allowed to leave.”

Mr. Kesselly said Mr. Duncan would be prosecuted upon his return.

In a teleconference with reporters, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, declined to answer when asked about Mr. Kesselly’s report that Mr. Duncan had lied on his questionnaire. But he did suggest that people often do not understand their level of exposure to infectious diseases.

“The status of his possible exposures is something that is being investigated now,” Dr. Frieden said.

C.D.C. officials said they were able to find the record of Mr. Duncan’s airport screening in Monrovia when he left the country and, with a temperature of 97.3 degrees, it clearly indicated that he did not have a fever.

The exit form used in all three countries in West Africa where the disease is rampant — Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone — asks about exposure, either at a funeral or as part of caregiving, to people who might have Ebola, Dr. Frieden said.

“Individuals often don’t know what their exposures might have been, and not all people disclose what those exposures might have been,” he said.

The circumstances under which Mr. Duncan became infected illustrate just how dire the situation remains in West Africa.

On Wednesday, in the Monrovia neighborhood where Mr. Duncan lives, neighbors and the parents of Marthalene Williams, 19, a woman who died of Ebola on Sept. 16, said Mr. Duncan had helped the family take her to and from John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital a day earlier after she started convulsing.

Ms. Williams, who was seven months pregnant, was turned away from the hospital for lack of space in its Ebola treatment ward, so Mr. Duncan helped carry Ms. Williams from a taxi to her home, holding her legs, after she grew too weak to walk, the family and neighbors said.

She died around 3 a.m., hours after she arrived home, said her parents, Amie and Emmanuel Williams. Mr. Duncan left Liberia three days later, flying out of Monrovia to Dallas after a layover in Brussels.

Mr. Duncan, who is a family friend and also a tenant in a house owned by the Williams family, rode in the front passenger seat of the taxi, her family said. Ms. Williams, her father and her brother, Sonny Boy, shared the back seat.

Sonny Boy Williams became symptomatic about a week ago, around the same time that Mr. Duncan first showed symptoms of Ebola, on Sept. 24. He died on Wednesday shortly after an ambulance came to pick him up from the family home.

In addition to the two men, Ms. Williams spread the virus to two other women in the cluster of houses near her family home, volunteers in a local Ebola task force said. One of those women also died on Wednesday.

Dr. Frieden said the focus on the way Mr. Duncan answered the question about exposure was part of a bigger and more complicated dilemma facing many nations that want to protect their own people.

“The plain truth,” he said, is that “we can’t make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa. What we can do is minimize the risk.”

He said that in September alone, around a dozen people were prevented from boarding planes in West Africa because they had a fever. Many of them did not have Ebola, but the screening indicated the level of vigilance in West Africa.

“Should we be isolating these countries in some way?” he asked. “It is a tough question.”

In Illinois Speech, Obama Trumpets Economic Success as Midterm Vote Nears

EVANSTON, Ill. — President Obama, outlining a campaign message for his party a month before the midterm elections, used a visit to his home state on Thursday to highlight the country’s economic growth and to make his case on a handful of issues that are important to Democrats in November.

“I am not on the ballot this fall,” Mr. Obama said in an address at Northwestern University here. “But make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.”

The president argued that the issues he was highlighting — raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay for women and requiring paid family leave for workers — would help the economy. But the speech was also intended to help Democratic candidates who are nervous about their prospects and have been eager for Mr. Obama to frame their arguments against the Republicans on a national stage.

Mr. Obama has been focused for months on foreign policy, particularly the fight against the militants of the Islamic State, and his speech on Thursday signified his return to the domestic political fray. 

“Obviously, recent months have seen their fair share of turmoil around the globe,” he said. 

He cast the United States’ central role in international crises in upbeat terms, using muscular language to reassure voters at a turbulent moment in history, a time of terrorist beheadings[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/world/middleeast/steven-sotloff-isis-execution.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpHeadline&module=first-column-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0], the arrival of the Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/dallas-ebola-case-thomas-duncan-contacts.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=HpSum&module=photo-spot-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news] virus on America’s shores and the controversy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/us/julia-pierson-secret-service.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] over the Secret Service’s ability to keep the White House, and the president, safe. 

“When alarms go off somewhere in the world, this is who the world calls — America,” the president said in a speech that lasted a little less than an hour. “They don’t call Moscow. They don’t call Beijing. They call us. We welcome that responsibility and leadership. That’s who we are.”

But Mr. Obama’s focus on Thursday was on the economy, recounting, as he often has, the country’s comeback from the Great Recession. 

“What I want people to know is that there are some really good things happening in America,” he said, ticking off progress in energy self-sufficiency, manufacturing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/business/an-energy-boom-lifts-the-heartland.html] numbers, health care costs[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/upshot/as-growth-in-health-care-spending-slows-asking-if-a-trend-will-last.html?abt=0002&abg=0] and other areas. He portrayed Republicans as consumed with tax cuts for the wealthy rather than the middle-class, reflecting the two parties’ “starkly different visions for this country.”

Republicans derided the event as a political ploy. “Thirty-three days before the midterm elections, President Obama is very transparently trying to refocus his party as their approval ratings continue to plummet, but he isn’t fooling anyone,” said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/republican_national_committee/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}].

Mr. Obama made only a halfhearted attempt at denying that his return home to the Chicago area was aimed at rallying Democrats. “I’m not going to tell you who to vote for, although I suppose it’s kind of implied,” he said to laughter.

Later, in a speech in Washington, Mr. Obama sought to energize Hispanic voters even as he acknowledged his failure to change the nation’s immigration[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration-and-emigration/index.html?8qa&module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}] laws. “I know there’s deep frustration in many communities around the country right now, and I understand that frustration because I share it,” he said at a dinner hosted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. “I am not going to give up this fight until it gets done.”

Mr. Obama promised to take executive action to fix the immigration system before the end of the year. He had vowed to do so by summer’s end, but said last month that he would wait, a decision that was criticized as a political maneuver[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/obama-said-to-delay-executive-action-on-immigration.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C{%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22}].

During his Illinois visit, Mr. Obama was welcomed by the state’s top Democratic officials, unlike in states where his popularity has sagged. The president was joined in Evanston by Senator Richard Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, and Gov. Pat Quinn, both of whom are up for re-election next month.

Mr. Obama, after spending Wednesday night in his own home on Chicago’s South Side, began the day at a $50,000-per-person fund-raiser for Mr. Quinn that was attended by about 25 people — but no reporters — in a high-rise overlooking Lake Michigan on the city’s Gold Coast.

Mr. Quinn said the president praised his grit, a welcome endorsement for a governor whose approval ratings are low and who is facing a difficult campaign against a businessman, Bruce Rauner. 

“He likes the fact that I’m a ‘grinder,’ ” Mr. Quinn said in an interview.

Mr. Obama remains popular here among core Democratic constituencies, and Mr. Quinn is unapologetic in his embrace of the president. “It’s an immense help to have him here,” said Mr. Quinn, adding that he hoped Mr. Obama would return for a campaign rally before Nov. 4.

Mr. Durbin, who is not expected to face much difficulty at the polls, said much the same.

“If we can narrow this down and focus on the economy and its future,” he said, “we’ll have a better chance of winning.”

U.S.
Ebola Strikes American Cameraman in Liberia

A freelance cameraman working for NBC News in Liberia has contracted the Ebola virus, the fourth American known to have contracted the disease in Liberia.

As a precaution, NBC News ordered the production team working with the cameraman, which includes Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the network’s top medical correspondent, to return to the United States and enter quarantine for 21 days.

The cameraman’s identity is being withheld at his family’s request, NBC said, though the network said he was a 33-year-old American. He had worked for NBC for just one day before becoming ill.

According to a statement released Thursday night by NBC News, the cameraman reported feeling ill Wednesday. He immediately put himself into quarantine and Thursday went to a treatment center.

Speaking from Liberia on Thursday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, Dr. Snyderman said, “The good news is this young man, our colleague, was admitted to the clinic very, very early. I spoke with him today. He’s in good spirits.”

In a note to the NBC News staff, the division president, Deborah Turness, said: “We are doing everything we can to get him the best care possible. He will be flown back to the United States for treatment at a medical center that is equipped to handle Ebola patients.”

NBC said Dr. Snyderman has not shown any symptoms of the disease, nor have the other members of the NBC team.

“We are also taking all possible measures to protect our employees and the general public,” Ms. Turness told the staff in her message. “In an abundance of caution, we will fly them back on a private charter flight, and then they will place themselves under quarantine in the United States for 21 days — which is at the most conservative end of the spectrum of medical guidance.”

NBC said the freelance cameraman is also a writer and has worked in Liberia for the past three years on a number of projects.

Dr. Snyderman is a well-known figure at NBC News, making frequent appearance on the network’s evening newscast and the “Today” show. She has worked at NBC News since 2006 after having worked for ABC News the previous 15 years.

U.S.
Countering Fear of Ebola With Education Where West Africans Live in U.S.

In the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, home to tens of thousands of people of Liberian descent, a new group called the Minnesota African Task Force Against Ebola[https://www.facebook.com/MATFAE] is blanketing neighborhoods with fliers. Their message: Stay away from West Africa for now.

“It is not helpful to travel when your travel will expose your community to harm and backlash,” said Abdullah Kiatamba, a member of the task force. “We’re telling people that, except in extreme circumstances, you can be more helpful to your family in Africa by sending them support, money, than by being there.”

Across the nation, communities with large concentrations of West African immigrants are stepping up education campaigns about Ebola that were already underway before a Liberian man was found to have the virus in Dallas on Wednesday. At the same time, the immigrants say they are bracing for a public backlash now that the virus has reached the United States. And they are trying to avoid stoking unnecessary fear among immigrant families who have little chance of contracting the virus.

But fear has already taken hold in places like Southwest Philadelphia, where some West African immigrants are avoiding hugging or shaking hands with those who have recently spent time in their homelands, and Brooklyn Park, Minn., where Kellita Whisnant, a Liberian immigrant, said her West African restaurant has seen business plummet since the Ebola outbreak intensified over the summer. She taped a poster about Ebola near the cash register to help dispel myths and changed the name of her restaurant from Mama Ti’s African Kitchen to Mama Ti’s Kitchen and Deli. But it has not seemed to help.

“Women are calling me and saying, ‘Kelly, we’re not going to be at the restaurant because my husband is leery about Ebola,’ ” Ms. Whisnant said Wednesday. “It hurts.”

In these communities and others, medical providers and state and county health officials started reaching out to West African immigrant groups over the summer, holding community meetings and circulating information about the disease. In Providence, R.I., the director of the State Health Department is meeting weekly with leaders of the state’s large West African population to help them inform[http://health.ri.gov/news/temp/EbolaBeGoneCall5Campaign.pdf] people and dispel myths.

“We’ve heard questions like, ‘My family just got here, do they need to go to the hospital as soon as they land?’ ” said the director, Dr. Michael Fine. “The good thing is that people are not afraid to ask. But we need to help everyone realize that if someone’s not sick, there’s no reason to go.”

Hospitals and health clinics are continuing to refine protocols for identifying and treating possible Ebola victims, focusing now on avoiding the communication lapse that led the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to release the Ebola patient, Thomas E. Duncan, from its emergency room last week even though he had told a nurse he had been in Liberia.

In the Minneapolis area, emergency dispatchers now ask anyone calling with difficulty breathing, diarrhea or vomiting if they also have a fever. If so, they ask if the person has traveled internationally in the last month, and where.

Dr. John L. Hick, the medical director for emergency preparedness at Hennepin County Medical Center, said the hospital is also developing new protocols for testing blood and disposing of waste from patients suspected of having Ebola. And it is trying to calm medical personnel anxious about encountering patients with the virus, he said.

“We’re trying to help everyone feel more comfortable that we’ve got the protective equipment, we’ve got the protocols in place,” Dr. Hick said. “People are much more interested now that the case in Dallas has actually made it real: ‘Yes, we’ve got to get our game face on.’ ”

Dr. Hick said that even before the Dallas case, hospital and other health officials in the Minneapolis region had been working with West African community groups to reach out to residents who might be traveling to, or having visitors from, their homelands.

“One of the key messages is that no one is going to get sick from somebody who isn’t sick,” he said. “The corollary is that if you are sick, you have to let people know.”

The stigma around Ebola is such that some people may not want to admit they feel sick, said Mr. Kiatamba, who runs African Immigrant Services, a nonprofit group in Brooklyn Park.

“The fear is, ‘If I tell them, they are going to call the newspaper on me and by the time they find out I don’t have Ebola it will have been all over the news,’ ” he said. “But everybody’s got to start talking to each other. This is getting serious. This thing is just a plane ride away.”

On Staten Island in New York, home to another large Liberian community, Telee Brown, a social worker, said he had canceled a trip to Liberia with his 2-year-old daughter. Mr. Brown, who leads a two-month-old Ebola committee for the Staten Island Liberian Community Association, has been visiting a daily farmer’s market in a neighborhood nicknamed Little Liberia to urge people to wash and sanitize their hands more often.

“We’re telling everybody,” he said, “because we don’t know who’s going to West Africa, and who is coming from West Africa.”

Amusa Ishola, 58, who owns the Targee African Market in the neighborhood, Park Hill, does not seem to need much urging to be more hygienic. For the last few weeks, Mr. Ishola, whose store sells dried fish, coconut milk and large bags of rice, has made it a habit to disinfect his hands after every customer.

Mr. Ishola said a recent customer had told him he had lost seven relatives to Ebola in Liberia. A few days later, the customer returned to say that number had spiked to 11.

“Prevention is better than kill,” he said as he poured a milky fluid on his hands, then rubbed it up and down each finger, before swabbing his counter.

In Southwest Philadelphia, Elizabeth Barquoi, whose husband owns an international grocery store, said that West Africans wanting to leave Ebola-infected areas should first be quarantined for three weeks and tested for the disease every day.

“Surveillance should be more intensive,” she said.

But Simone Chambliss, a Liberian immigrant in Brooklyn Park, said she thought it was crucial to keep allowing travel between West Africa and the United States. Otherwise, she said, “All those people who are there would be doomed. We can’t just close the door on them.”

Ken Prillaman, the fire chief and emergency management director in Brooklyn Park, said he had been constantly fighting the stigma cast over West African immigrants. He has had to calm a number of worried locals, he said, including parents reluctant to let their children play with children of West African descent.

“We had a mechanic worried because he works on a lot of cars for residents that are West African,” Mr. Prillaman said. “I actually had a group that was planning to do an event in Brooklyn Park, who called and said, ‘Should we cancel because of the number of West Africans?’ It’s like, are you kidding me?”

Dr. Fine of the Rhode Island Department of Health said that one of the most important ways to keep more Ebola cases from emerging in the United States was to encourage West African immigrants to reach out to friends and relatives in their homelands and educate them. In Rhode Island, West African community leaders were urging people to call five relatives or friends in their homeland and give them advice about preventing the spread of Ebola. The United Way has even provided a van with phones for free calls, he said.

“If there are a million and a half infected people in West Africa by January,” he said, “the number of people trying to leave Liberia and come here may be much greater, and the risk of people traveling here and getting sick here goes way up.”

He added, “The biggest challenge for all of us is to get West Africa enough resources now so we don’t get to that place.”

After 14 Years, Perry's Armor Begins to Dent

Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.

Rick Perry's protective cloak of incumbency is starting to fray.

There is an indictment accusing him of abusing his powers when he threatened the state funding for the office of an Austin prosecutor who was refusing to resign after her arrest for drunken driving.

The State Auditor's Office, an arm of the Legislature, zinged him with a devastating assessment of the signature economic development program -- the Texas Enterprise Fund -- that the governor has used to build the so-called Texas Miracle that inflated his résumé to the level of national interest.

It does not help that fresher faces have arrived to lead the cause, notably United States Senator Ted Cruz, who cut the line of Republican successors two years ago and has become the standard-bearer for the conservative wing of the Republican Party in Texas.

Maybe the warranty on the Teflon coating that has protected Mr. Perry has run out. After almost 14 years in the governor's office, he is starting to resemble a lame duck.

Mr. Perry botched a run for president during the last election cycle and has shown interest in another. He has not declared his candidacy, and says that if he decides to skip the race, it will not be because of a lack of preparation. That is a mea culpa and good camouflage all in one -- an acknowledgment that he was not ready for the national campaign he embarked on in 2011 and a cover story for activities that are outside the portfolio of a Texas governor, like going to Davos, Switzerland, for an international economic forum or to Iowa to chomp on corn dogs at the fairgrounds.

The Texas colleagues and allies who have protected the governor are starting to pay attention to other things. Intentionally or not, the audit of the enterprise fund landed in the danger zone, within 60 days of a big election, instead of safely after Election Day on Nov. 4 or sometime during the summer, when public attention to state government is low.

The timing of his indictment stinks from a public relations standpoint. Mr. Perry and his legal and political handlers have done a masterful job of perfuming that, but he still faces criminal charges -- unless the lawyers can bat them down -- between now and the next presidential election. If he is going to run, an indictment is a heavy load to carry in that race.

The audit weighs in at about 100 pages, criticizing the way the administration granted investments from the enterprise fund and the way Mr. Perry's office monitored the performance of the companies in which it invested those public dollars.

The governor's political rivals have repeatedly tried to tag him as a practitioner of crony capitalism, of helping his political friends do well in their economic endeavors. The audit does not say that directly, but an industrious analyst with a copy of the audit and access to the governor's public campaign finance filings over the last 20 years will find enough material to write talking points for his presidential rivals.

It is not just a partisan matter, either. Several of Mr. Perry's past supporters jumped to his defense when he was indicted, but made a point of saying they were not endorsing him politically. The strongest defense of economic development funds in the current statewide races has come from Wendy Davis, the Democrat running for governor. Her legislation resulted in the critical audit, and she is calling for tighter controls over the funds as a result. But while many Republicans are demanding that the state get out of the incentives business, she remains an advocate.

Her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, is more circumspect, saying the state should not be picking economic winners and losers. His is a tricky balancing act. Ms. Davis contends that as attorney general, Mr. Abbott should have had his eye on the operation of the enterprise fund and other funds. He has not run as a reformer -- his party, after all, has held the governorship since 1994. And conservatives in his own party have raised economic and ethical questions about the funds.

The governor, meanwhile, does some of his best work when there is a crisis -- a hurricane, a flood or a sweeping urban fire. He seems to regain his popularity at times like that. Mr. Perry was in Dallas this week for the latest emergency, a confirmed case of Ebola in Texas.

Maybe there is still some Teflon left.
