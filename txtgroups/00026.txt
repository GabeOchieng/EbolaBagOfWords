Had the deadly virus started in the West, the response would have been vastly different

Can a selfie be selfless?

Shame on Nigel Farage for playing hateful politics over HIV

Of all the thousands of people who have died from the Ebola virus, just eight deaths tell us most about the disaster.

These eight dead people embody the scale of epidemic that authorities around the world are facing. In mid-September, local administrators, two medical officers and a preacher, accompanied by three journalists, travelled through remote villages of south-east Guinea, where the outbreak first began. They were attempting to educate the local people about how the disease is spread and how to limit the number of people it infected. But things did not go according to plan.

Instead of delivering their message and moving on to the next village, they went missing. Their bodies were later found in the village latrine. They had been murdered by the villagers.

Such violence is not an isolated event. There have been other reports of local people attacking hospitals, aid workers and doctors across West Africa. While these communities are ravaged by the infection, they are distrustful and scared of outsiders. They believe that foreigners are bringing the disease and are petrified of coming into contact with them.

There have been reports of youths protecting villages and roads with machetes and slingshots. With crushing poverty comes ignorance, fear and superstition. Many prefer to consult tribal doctors who, in reality, provide no remedy against the illness except hope. One bishop in Liberia has announced that he plans to rid the country of the virus with a mass exorcism using Vimto instead of communion wine.

All of the West African countries under siege from the virus have one thing in common: extreme poverty. It is this that makes them so susceptible to such an outbreak. Poor sanitation and nutrition have created the perfect storm for the virus to thrive, while poor transport and communication networks have made any coordinated response almost impossible. So volunteers must traipse from village to village in a desperate attempt to educate the people.

But not only is it dangerous in countries where the people have learned to be scared and distrustful of officials, it is grossly inefficient and time-consuming. The murders not only speak of a petrified, ignorant people. They are also testament to the international community’s ignoring of the unfolding tragedy, and how for too long the only help came from a handful of volunteers and small aid agencies.

International health organisations have been woefully, shamefully slow to react. The World Health Organisation (WHO) failed to heed warnings about the severity of the outbreak for months. It only acknowledged the seriousness of the problem on August 8, when it finally declared a global emergency.

The Liberian government has tried to place the blame on its people, arguing that their distrust of healthcare workers, burial practices and disregard for its advice have worsened the outbreak. But that is a simplistic view. The people of these poor nations have been let down by their governments, which have failed to prioritise education and infrastructure development – and the world is now witnessing the results.

Had Ebola started in a Western country rather than Africa, the global reaction, including that of the WHO, would have been different. The West’s response has been terrifyingly myopic. In the globalised world, it was only a matter of time before the infection spread to cities and, from there, to other continents. How could we have been so stupid to think that one of the world’s most virulent diseases wouldn’t affect us?

Currently, each infected person is infecting two more before dying or overcoming the illness. Survival rates are about 50 per cent, dropping to 10 per cent in remote areas with poor water and supplies. The epidemiology comes down to simple maths: it will not be until each infected person infects, on average, fewer than one other that the tide will reverse.

This latest outbreak – by far Ebola’s deadliest to date – may in part be due to the pathological qualities of the virus, but it has sprinted ahead while global health authorities plodded along. We can only hope it is not too late to catch up.

Oh no, another week, another social media craze involving celebrities posting pictures of their favourite subject: themselves. The online orgy of narcissism never seems to come to an end. The latest “selfie” craze involves celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, the model, sharing images taken after they wake up for Unicef’s #wakeupcall campaign.

I’ve got nothing against awareness campaigns, or using social media to promote an issue. It’s the fact that campaigns always seem to centre on pictures or videos of ourselves. It seems grotesque – as though we can have no interest in anything unless we’re able to put ourselves at the centre of it.

When did the act of charity stop being selfless and become a selfie?

</br>Words almost fail me over Nigel Farage’s ignorant, even hateful, comment that we should ban people with HIV from entering Britain.

HIV is now considered a chronic disease rather than a death sentence, thanks to great strides in the way it is managed. Indeed, a recent study showed that those with HIV can expect to live for as long as non-sufferers.

The real problem faced by those living with HIV is the stigma attached to the disease – and it is this that Farage is feeding into.

The implication is that those with HIV might infect the rest of us, which is ludicrous. HIV is already endemic in our population. Why is Farage suggesting a measure discussed – and rightly rejected – three decades ago? Even during the most fearful days in the Eighties, we never showed such a lack of humanity.

Farage must know that there is no evidence to suggest that border controls would have any impact on the rate of infection. He must know his suggestion will never be implemented.

If it’s economics that he’s interested in – the cost to the NHS – then why not ban anyone with cancer entering the country? Because that doesn’t resonate with people’s prejudices in the same way, does it? It makes me hang my head in shame that this country gives a platform to someone with such views.

Farage is pandering to people’s fear and ignorance of HIV and demonising a marginalised group. Whatever one’s views of his politics, this is a low blow. Shame on you, Nigel Farage, for playing such cheap and hateful politics with other people’s lives.

Dr David Nabarro, who is heading up the UN response to Ebola, says he is concerned that the outbreak is "growing at an exponential speed"

The British expert in charge of the United Nations response to Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] has warned the disease knows "no boundaries" as anyone could turn up in a new location and transmit it to others.

Nonetheless, Dr David Nabarro, the UN's special envoy on Ebola, hopes the spread of the killer virus will be "under control" in three months.

He said systems were now put in place, along with international help from nations including Britain, that could help turn the tide and reduce the number of cases from one week to the next.

Dr Nabarro said people in the affected countries, which include Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, now had a better understanding of the need to stop the virus spreading by isolating themselves if they became infected.

He added: "The epidemiologists, the people who study disease, say that when 70% of those who have got the virus are enabled to avoid spreading it to others then the epidemic curve will come down and that's our target for the next 90 days."

Ebola will come to London, warns Boris Johnson

Mayor of London he says there is "little doubt" a case of Ebola will emerge in Britain

Ebola will almost certainly hit London, Boris Johnson has warned.

The Mayor of London said he feared the disease, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives world wide, would come to Britain.

Airport screening, introduced for passengers from Ebola-hit African countries, is “far from perfect” without blood tests, he warned.

"I have no doubt, I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city."

He added: “The idea of screening it at airports is far from perfect as a solution."

"It's one of those cases where we are at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense. You can't blood test everybody coming into the country."

The comments follow a warning from Dame Sally Davies, the government's Chief Medical Office, that cases will hit Britain.

“It will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months," she said.

The Government has introduced the screening of passengers arriving at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal in an effort to spot anyone displaying symptoms of the disease.

Teams equipped with thermal guns will take the temperatures of passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, asking them a series of questions about their possible exposure to the virus.

As part of the UK effort to help contain the outbreak, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a medical ship, is being loaded with supplies in Falmouth ahead of a mission to Sierra Leone.

The UK is sending 750 Ministry of Defence personnel to help Sierra Leone’s government cope with the crisis, including more than 200 military staff to run and staff World Health Organisation-led Ebola training facilities in West African country.

On Saturday paramedics in protective suits took part in a major exercise at key locations around the UK on Saturday to test whether Britain is ready to deal with a potential outbreak of Ebola.

As part of the exercise potential Ebola victims were transferred to specially prepared hospital facilities to test the ability of staff to respond to the crisis without placing themselves at risk of infection.

In one of the staged scenarios a shopper who fell ill at a shopping centre in Gateshead was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, and placed in isolation.

After initial blood tests ruled out malaria, samples were rapidly sent to PHE Porton Down for testing. Following the diagnosis of Ebola, the patient was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London.

The Royal Victoria Infirmary, PHE and Ambulance Trust also simulated tracing the patient’s movements and known contacts.

The virus causes fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, and sometimes internal bleeding, and spreads through direct contact with body fluids.

Spanish Ebola victim conscious and sitting unaided

Teresa Romero, the only known person to catch the virus outside of west Africa, is doing much better after dose of an experimental drug ZMapp

The Spanish nurse infected with Ebola was conscious and sitting unaided on Saturday, as three more people joined the 13 admitted to hospital in Madrid to be monitored for signs of the deadly disease.

Teresa Romero, 44, is the only person known to have caught the virus outside Africa. None of the 16 others under observation has been diagnosed with Ebola so far, though the Spanish government is under fire for its handling both of Romero's case and the threat of a wider outbreak of the disease.

Reuters images showed Romero alert and sitting upright in her hospital room with an oxygen mask strapped to her face and responding to the hospital staff attending to her. She had taken a turn for the worse two days ago, health authorities said, and is still considered critical.

"Teresa Romero's condition has undergone no significant changes and is still serious, but stable," a government Ebola committee said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.

The latest outbreak of the disease has already killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in West Africa, and Romero's case has raised fears about contagion in Europe and elsewhere.

"The big problem is in West Africa where the doubling rate is every four weeks and it really is going up and up, so it will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country," said Sally Davies, Britain's chief medical officer.

"I would expect a handful of cases over the next few months," Davies told BBC TV after an eight-hour nationwide drill to test the country's readiness to deal with an Ebola outbreak.

Britain has said it will start screening passengers for Ebola who enter the country through London's two main airports and by railway from continental Europe. The United States on Saturday began screening travellers from West Africa at New York's John F. Kennedy International airport.

Spain's government tightened Ebola detection protocols on Friday and tasked Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria with responding to the health crisis, five days after the contagion was confirmed.

Romero was diagnosed with Ebola after caring for two priests who had contracted the disease in Africa and were then repatriated to Spain. Both men died, one in August and one in September.

Three more people who came into contact with Romero - a hairdresser, another nurse and a cleaner - were admitted to the isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital on Friday evening. The 13 who were already under observation include Romero's husband.

An experimental treatment, ZMab, is available in Spain for use in her case, a health source said. However, it was not clear whether she was now being given the drug. She was given antibodies from previously infected patients earlier this week.

The ZMab combination drug, made by Canada-based company Defyrus Inc., is one of the agents used to make ZMapp, another treatment, which was developed by MappBiopharmaceutical Inc. ZMapp has been used on some Ebola sufferers, a number of whom survived, but available supplies are exhausted.

Hospital authorities and the government declined to comment.

Amid disquiet in Spain over how the virus could have spread, some government officials initially deflected blame to the nurse, Romero, seizing on her admission that she may have touched her face with the gloves of her protective suit.

Angry health workers jeered Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday as he visited the hospital, throwing surgical gloves at his car. Unions and the public have also laid into the government for its sluggish response.

Romero remained undiagnosed for days despite reporting she had a fever, one of the symptoms of Ebola.

"The bad way this crisis was handled by politicians proved fertile ground for panic," El Mundo newspaper said on an editorial on Saturday. It described the case of one school that wanted a nurse to keep her child away, because she worked in another Madrid hospital where Romero was first admitted.

Several hundred protesters calling for government officials to step down gathered in central Madrid on Saturday evening, carrying a banner that read "We are all Teresa". Earlier in the day, animal rights campaigners demonstrated in several cities because the Madrid government had Romero's pet dog, Excalibur, put down this week, fearing it could spread the disease.

Three hairdressers were among those under observation on Saturday, after Romero visited a salon for a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed.

Patients also included five doctors, a hospital porter and four nurses, one of whom had also cared for one of the repatriated priests and tested negative for Ebola in an initial examination.

A man in one of the hospital wards cleared for the patients under observation could be seen at a window on Saturday, smiling and waving a banner which read 36.1 degrees celsius - meaning he has no fever.

A sure for diabetes and awful jokes

On reflection, it wasn't the most usual of dates. Or at least I'd never before come across someone whose approach to wooing a woman was stripping naked, putting a pair of boxer shorts on his head, uttering a string of sounds that sounded rather like "wibble", before running to the kitchen and drinking a bottle of Lucozade.

Reader, of course I married him.

Not because I have a secret penchant for Lucozade drinkers, but because it became clear that this wasn't my husband's normal approach to romance. Rather, it was because he is one of the 300,000 people in Britain with Type 1 diabetes, and was suffering what is known as a "hypo" - or hypoglycaemia - when blood glucose levels fall so low that the body and mind can no longer function properly.

Last week, while politicians were focused on the threat from Ebola, a genuinely good health news story broke that we should all be celebrating. A potential cure for Type 1 diabetes is said to be within reach after scientists developed a treatment that eliminates the need for sufferers to inject insulin.

And the reason for this is one man's personal quest - a Harvard scientist called Doug Melton. He has toiled on this for 23 years after his son Sam was diagnosed frighteningly young, at just six months old. As doctors tried to work out what was wrong with his baby, Melton, then a molecular biologist, took the decision to change focus and start investigating diabetes. "I did what any parent does," he said. "I asked, 'What am I going to do about this?'"

Now more than two decades on, he's done a phenomenal amount. Prof Melton says that his team is just one step away from the finish line. That one step will, of course, take many years - human trials have yet to start to replicate the success found in trials with mice - but it's been described as potentially a medical game-changer on a par with the development of antibiotics for bacterial infections.

Those with Type 1 diabetes - previously known as juvenile onset diabetes, because it usually occurs in childhood - produce no insulin and are dependent on daily insulin injections and blood tests. Melton's brilliant team has developed stem cells that can be reprogrammed to produce insulin, obviating the need for injections, and in the longer term helping to avoid common complications such as strokes, kidney disease and blindness, as well as hypos, which can result in coma or death.

On a lighter note, if the success is reproduced in human trials, it will also presumably save me from having to listen to my husband's appalling jokes (a sure sign of low blood sugar is the fact that he finds what he is saying absolutely hilarious), and that there's no chance of us ruining yet another major social occasion.

The most embarrassing one was when the paramedics coming to treat him managed to set off several car alarms hours after my best friend's wedding, more or less under the happy couple's window.

It will also mean that I won't have physically to sit on top of him to stop him hurting himself while thrashing around semi-conscious - at 6ft 3in to my 5ft 5in, that's no easy task.

Although, on the downside, it means that I won't make friends with the local team of paramedics. My husband once regained consciousness to hear one ask me, "Now, it was America you were about to go to last time we came here to help, wasn't it?"

Politicians and health workers have become fixated on Type 2 diabetes, because of its shocking rise; there are now nearly three million people in the country with Type 2, which is often triggered through obesity and unhealthy lifestyle choices, as opposed to Type 1, where a patient's own immune system turns on itself and destroys pancreatic cells. Diabetes is the fastest-growing health threat of our time - accounting for 10 per cent of the NHS budget, while £1 million is spent every hour on diabetes.

Meanwhile, too many children and young people struggle on, trying to manage growing up with a chronic illness that affects their life both dramatically but also in mundane ways - never being able to be without blood tests or insulin, trying to juggle sensible eating and drinking while all their friends do what they like with no adverse consequences.

And if they do mess up - as all those with diabetes do - there's often a lack of understanding and sympathy. Back in 2005, police Tasered a man in a bus depot in Leeds who was having a hypo. In the US, a woman was handcuffed and thrown into a police van after police mistook her hypo for drunkenness.

So think for a moment this week about those around you behaving irrationally, stupidly, disconcertingly. They may just need a bit of understanding and some sugar quickly.

Especially if they are telling awful jokes with their pants on their head.

EBOLA REACHES EUROPE

Zsuzsanna Jakab, European director of the World Health Organisation, told reporters on Tuesday it was "unavoidable" that Europe would see more cases of Ebola, after a Spanish nursing assistant was diagnosed with the virus in Madrid. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, announced plans to send 750 British troops into West Africa in a bid to contain the outbreak.

UKIP IN PARLIAMENT

The former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell romped home in a by-election in Clacton, Essex, with 21,113 votes - a margin of more than 12, 000 over his Tory opponent. In his acceptance speech as Ukip's first-ever elected MP, Carswell said that if the party remained true to its principles, "there is nothing that we cannot achieve, in Essex, East Anglia, in England, and in the whole country beyond".

LIFE AFTER DEATH?

Scientists at Southampton University have found that consciousness can persist even after the brain has shut down completely. In the largest study of its kind, researchers examined 2, 000 people who had suffered cardiac arrests. Some 40 per cent of those who survived recalled some kind of awareness in the minutes after they had "died" - most commonly a sense of peacefulness or a bright light engulfing them. One man was even able to describe watching his own resuscitation from the corner of the room.

QUESTOR

News for investors

EBOLA HITS CRUISE SHARES

1. The cruise holiday industry has been hit hard by the spread of the deadly virus Ebola. The travel sector suffered further losses when Prime Minister David Cameron said Ebola testing was needed to "keep people safe". Anyone now arriving at airports and Eurostar terminals from areas that have been affected by Ebola will be screened. Shares in cruise operator Carnival ended last week down by 10pc at £22.11. The company had to take action and change itineraries of two ships that were scheduled to land in ports near West African countries hit by the spread of the virus.

CALMER WATERS

2. Until the Ebola fears escalated, things were improving for the cruise operator. In a trading update at the end of September, the company reported better-thanexpected quarterly profits and raised its full-year forecast as higher demand from Chinese holiday makers boosted ticket sales for cruises in Asia. The company said it now expected adjusted earnings of $1.84-$1.88 per share for the year ending Nov. 30, up from its previous forecast of $1.60-$1.75. Net revenue yields, which combine ticket sales and money spent onboard, are expected to be flat.

CHEAP OIL BOOST

3. Carnival was also in line to receive an added boost from falling fuel costs. Fuel makes up about a quarter of the total cost of running a cruise liner. This has been painful for the industry, with the benchmark Brent crude price staying around $110 a barrel. However that has all changed this year as the oil price has collapsed by more than 20pc since $115 per barrel in June to below $90 today as excess global oil production and falling demand has hit prices. Questor estimates that a 10pc drop in fuel costs would represent a saving of $210m (£128m) for Carnival.

RATING DOWNGRADED

4. The Ebola fears could not come at a worse time for the cruise operator just as earnings are recovering and fuel costs are falling. The cash flow improved in the first half and the balance sheet is backed by $32bn in tangible assets, largely made up of the cruise ships. The cruise operator's shares are by no means cheap. Analysts are forecasting revenues of $16.2bn, giving adjusted pre-tax profits of $1.43bn and earnings per share of $1.8. So at today's prices the shares are trading on 21 times forecast earnings. With a high rating and risks around Ebola rising, we end our tip and downgrade.

Unstable eurozone could topple the world

Stalling growth is hitting hopes of wider economic recovery, writes Jeremy Warner

At the US Federal Reserve in Washington, there is concern bordering on alarm. By now the world economy was meant to have been, if not exactly humming, at least bumping merrily along behind America's own economic recovery, with a return to relatively decent levels of growth. Instead, conditions have again been softening precipitously. Growth in Japan and China has disappointed, while the eurozone shows every sign of slipping back into recession, the third such contraction since the crisis of 2008-9.

In its World Economic Outlook, published last week, the IMF sharply cut its forecasts for the main eurozone economies, and assigned a near-40pc chance to prospects of outright recession in the euro area as a whole.

The chances of Japanese-style deflation are put as high as 30pc.

All hopes that Europe's economic malaise was beginning to lift have been dashed. Even Germany, long the trusty mainstay of the European economy, is struggling, with once buoyant export industries badly dented by weak demand elsewhere in Europe, slowing growth in Asia, and Russian trade sanctions. All of a sudden, Europe is back centre stage as the biggest threat to recovery and growth.

Minutes of the Fed's last Open Markets Committee meeting, released last week, reveal evident alarm among US policymakers that the worsening international outlook is inflicting damage on the recovery back home. The point at which US interest rates begin to rise, once widely expected towards the middle of next year, looks destined to be pushed back again. That, at least, was the way financial markets read the minutes. Thanks to Europe, normalisation of monetary policy will have to wait. Billions were wiped off stock values as investors absorbed the news — the recovery, so hard-won and long in coming, is again in danger of stalling. By the end of the week, many stock indices were down a full 10pc on the month, thereby satisfying the technical definition of a fully blown stock market "correction". Next stop, 20pc — the classical definition of a "bear market", some were warning.

Adding his own voice to the chorus of alarm, the UK Chancellor, George Osborne, said: "This is a critical moment for the British economy. The eurozone risks slipping back into crisis. Britain cannot be immune from that — indeed it's already having an impact on our manufacturing and our exports".

At the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Washington, few could resist finger-pointing at Europe, and its apparent inability to resolve its problems. "It's like being under siege", said one senior European policymaker. "Europeans are being made to feel it's all their fault. We are the bad guys in the world economy, with Germany seen as Public Enemy Number One.".

We have, of course, been here many times before. At the same meeting three years ago, it looked as if it was all over for the beleaguered euro, with the threat of disorderly collapse hanging like a pall over the entire world economy. But then Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, uttered his three magic words — "whatever it takes" — and the immediate crisis began to subside. Unfortunately, it was job only half done. The immediate sovereign debt and banking crisis had been stayed, yet the growth did not return.

The patient had been rescued from near-death only to sink back into a state of chronic long-term illness. Three years later and Europe is still struggling to raise itself from its sick bed. Worse, its condition is again deteriorating sharply, leaving exasperated outside experts desperately casting around for solutions. At the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, the managing director, urged the ECB to do more, including the purchase of sovereign bonds, so-called quantitative easing.

Better than any, she must know that Draghi's hands are tied. He is bound by treaty and German stricture not to do anything that looks like debt monetisation and thereby jeopardises the German savings glut.

Recession was avoidable, said Lagarde, but only "if the right policies are decided — if both surplus and deficit countries do what they have to do", and she urged both a recalibration of fiscal consolidation programmes and a ramping up of infrastructure spending.

By the end of the week, "infrastructure" had become the new call to arms, the latest mantra to ease Europe's pain and get the Continent back on its feet. For countries with the fiscal space to engage in such investment, Lagarde insisted, it would both reduce unemployment and add to growth potential. Higher resulting growth would in time also reduce debt burdens. After years of prescribing austerity to crisis-hit countries, these thoughts are for the IMF something of an epiphany.

Yet they also recognise an underlying reality. For France, Italy, Spain and others, it is already inevitable that debt targets will again be missed. If they are to be breached by default, it might as well be done in a negotiated fashion, so renewed deficit spending can at least be applied wisely for long-term growth.

Even so, there is an evident mountain to climb in convincing Berlin, Germany's own plunging growth rate and the counsel of Germany's five economic institutes — or "Wise Men" — notwithstanding. They too have urged the German government to step up investment spending in an effort to revive flagging growth. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, is having none of it. He opposes QE, and is deeply suspicious of those who advocate more government spending as the solution to Europe's problems.

Going head to head at an IMF seminar with Larry Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary, Schäuble angrily dismissed the idea that the crisis was anything to do with failings in European policy. "America was the cause of this crisis, to be frank", said Schäuble, and he refused to take lessons from Summers on how to manage Europe's affairs. Europe would proceed at its own pace with infrastructure spending, he insisted, with the European Investment Bank instructed to draw up a list of suitable projects which would in time be fully financed.

Undeterred, Summers persisted, comparing Europe's "dismal" economic performance to the Japanese stagnation of the past twenty years and the Great Depression in the 1930s. "What's being done in Europe is not working. They are just repeating the mistakes of Japan. And what followed in Japan was 15 years of deflation and dismal economic performance, followed by dramatic declines in interest rates — that is the path that Europe is on without a substantial discontinuity in policy."

He criticised Germany in particular for what he characterised as a demand-side problem in the European economy. You don't fix a lack of demand by adding more supply, he insisted, because that will only add to deflationary pressures.

It is hard to disagree with some aspects of his analysis. Germany's current account surplus is approximately 8pc of GDP. That means Germany's output is 8 per cent higher than its spending. If Germany could be persuaded to increase its spending, this would make a huge contribution to rebalancing in the European economy as a whole.

Even the normally ultra-diplomatic Draghi seemed to join in with the German-bashing, indicating that he was willing to risk German fury by indulging in QE and virtually naming Berlin as the one capital that could do more to support demand with fiscal measures.

Decision makers from outside Europe urge some kind of grand bargain, whereby Germany agrees to reflate and allows the depression-engulfed periphery a little more fiscal space in return for a "big bang" approach to structural and labour market reform.

Yet it may be that the crisis needs to deepen further before the merits of such an approach are accepted. The thinking seems to be that only under pressure of economic ruin will recalcitrant nations embrace meaningful reform. For what it is worth, Summers said he could think of no case in history where deflation acted as a powerful incentive to reform. On the contrary, strengthening demand and avoiding deflation would make reform politically very much easier.

Bereft of any plausible path to debt mutualisation, and with many countries still struggling with record unemployment, time is again running out for Europe's experiment in monetary union. Perhaps the oddest thing about the whole sorry affair is that, despite the manifest fault lines, there are still no serious discussions about how to build the shared institutions and fiscal functions necessary for a sustainable currency union. Hesitant steps towards a banking union scarcely count when resolution and deposit insurance remain a firmly national responsibility. Early enthusiasm for shared social security arrangements and common labour market laws has petered out.

In any case, Europe's problem is at root not insufficient infrastructure spending, but bad governance and a dysfunctional monetary system.

Schäuble excuses the lack of progress in establishing the shared fiscal arrangements necessary to underpin the single currency by insisting that political union was always going to be impossible in Europe. These were testing economic times, he conceded, but Europe had defied the sceptics. The currency union was still standing.

Indeed it is, but for what purpose? If it be that of economic prosperity and harmony between nations, then it is having the exact opposite effect. Far from uniting Europe, the euro is proving a powerfully divisive force.

At the IMF, they deal only in the art of the possible, and for now, the idea of lasting solutions to Europe's travails is thought of as too ambitious to be realistic. Europe may get there in the end, admits one official, but it is going to take many years, and in the meantime it's all about trying to make the best out of a bad job. Hence the IMF's Damascene conversion to an infrastructure spending spree.

Will it work? Even if Europe could be persuaded to loosen its debt targets to accommodate such an exercise, it's not certain it would. You only need to look at Japan to see that infrastructure is not always the magic bullet fondly assumed. More than twenty years of building roads and bridges to nowhere has failed to lift Japan out of its economic funk. France's economic malaise is not for want of infrastructure spending; the country has some of the best infrastructure in the world. Similarly, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and even Italy, do not obviously need more roads, trains, houses and airports.

To the extent that Europe has had a growth strategy this past few years, it seems to rely on the hope that the global economy as a whole will eventually lift all boats. With the best rate of growth in the G7 this year, Britain has played the role of Europe's consumer of last resort.

What Europe is getting wrong, the UK seems largely to be getting right, from sticking to public spending plans to welfare and other structural reforms. Like the US, it also has the support of accommodative monetary policy and the blessing of a highly flexible labour market.

Much of Europe is still a million miles away from these basic building blocks. The recognition is there, but the political will is lacking. France talks root and branch labour market reform, but words are not followed by meaningful action.

To make matters worse, the world economy is being hit by a series of external shocks, from renewed turmoil in the Middle East to Russian imperialism in Ukraine, and now the possibility of a worldwide pandemic of the killer Ebola virus. As if all this wasn't enough, the emerging markets miracle — an important counter to the West's post-financial crisis stagnation these past five years — seems fast to be running into the sand, with China slowing fast as it attempts to rein in a runaway credit boom and Brazil close to recession.

Meeting alongside the IMF, the G20 made one of those characteristically vacuous commitments — to unleash hundreds of different measures which in themselves would raise global output by nearly two percentage points. Good luck with that one. It would be nice to depict the current alarm as just a passing squall, a temporary soft patch that will soon be behind us. Regrettably, this does not look like the way to bet; the oil price at a four-year low tells a much grimmer story.

Ebola screening is 'a complete waste of time'

BRITISH doctors, nurses and soldiers sent to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa will not automatically be brought back to the UK for treatment if they are infected with the virus.

A total of 750 British troops are being sent to Sierra Leone to tackle the Ebola outbreak, along with hundreds of NHS volunteers who responded to an appeal from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies.

However, both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that medical and military personnel would not be guaranteed repatriation if they developed Ebola while working on the relief effort.

Instead, they could be treated in field hospitals in Sierra Leone and would only be flown home on a "case by case" basis, the departments said.

The disclosure came as:

Plans to introduce screening for Ebola at British airports descended into chaos, amid accusations that the Government's handling of the matter had been "shambolic";

Public health experts criticised the scheme, with one saying the proposed screening was "a complete waste of time";

Officials in Macedonia admitted that it was "highly unlikely" that a British man said to have died of Ebola in the country actually had the disease;

The World Health Organisation revealed that 4,033 people had died from Ebola. There are now 8,399 reported cases, an increase of 366 in just 48 hours.

David Cameron was yesterday forced to defend the Government's response to the Ebola crisis in the face of fierce criticism.

Earlier this week, the Government had insisted screening at airports was unnecessary.

However, on Thursday ministers said "enhanced screening" for the disease would be brought in at Gatwick and Heathrow airports and at the Eurostar terminal in London. But yesterday morning a spokesman for Gatwick said the airport had not been contacted about the plan.

David Mabey, a professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that in any event, screening for the disease was a "complete waste of time".

"Firstly, there won't be anyone coming from these (West African) countries because all direct flights have been cancelled," he said.

"Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration?"

Mr Cameron however, insisted the Government was simply responding to advice from health officials.

"Quite rightly we are taking all the steps we can to keep our own people safe," he said.

Britain's deployment of 750 troops, three helicopters and a military vessel to support the relief effort is one of the biggest since the Libya campaign of 2011.

However, concerns were raised last night after it emerged that NHS workers and British soldiers may have to be treated in new centres in Sierra Leone if they contracted the virus. There were concerns that the care would not be at the standard they would receive in the UK. One British worker said: "Infectious disease doctors volunteering say it feels like being asked 'to go over the top'."

A spokesman for the Department of Health said that repatriation would occur on a case–by–case basis, and added: "The welfare of our personnel is a top priority. The decision to treat in country or return to the UK will be determined in discussion with the MoD, Department of Health, Public Health England and the Foreign Office."

The Health department stages simulation of suspected Ebola outbreak to test readiness

Health workers in the UK were on high alert on Saturday as an eight-hour nationwide drill[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11156114/Britain-prepares-for-Ebola-crisis-as-deaths-continue-to-rise.html]was carried out to test Britain's preparedness for a possible Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outbreak.

In this video released by the Department of Health, health professionals are seen responding to a possible scenario of a sick person who has recently returned from Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst affected by the disease.

The footage shows an actor pretending to collapse in a shopping centre in Newcastle and the ensuing precautionary steps taken by NHS emergency workers.

The exercise, which also included a fake emergency government Cobra meeting, was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron to test Britain's preparedness for UK cases after the estimated death toll from the disease in West Africa passed 4,000 for the first time.

Emergency workers stage major exercise to test Britain's response to Ebola outbreak as numbers of dead continue to rise in West Africa

In scenes guaranteed to evoke the country’s worst fears, paramedics in protective suits took part in a major exercise at key locations around the UK on Saturday to test whether Britain is ready to deal with a potential outbreak of Ebola.

Actors posing as potentially infected patients were transported on trolleys to test the responses of emergency services and the Government to a disease which has now killed more than 4,000 people worldwide.

The 'nightmare scenarios’ tested in the exercise included paramedics being called to a Gateshead shopping centre after a person collapsed after feeling unwell and an individual visiting a Hillingdon walk-in centre with flu-like symptoms, after recently returning from West Africa.

The eight-hour exercise followed the introduction of screening of passengers arriving from areas hit by Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal in a bid to spot anyone displaying symptoms of the disease.

The Prime Minister has defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening for the virus at Britain’s major airports and terminals, saying it had been taken on “medical advice”.

Similar precautions are being taken in the US, with screening under way at New York’s JFK airport and checks at some other airports due to start in the next few days.

Teams equipped with thermal guns will take the temperatures of passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, asking them a series of questions about their possible exposure to the virus.

The latest developments came as a UN expert said the world will live with Ebola “forever” unless global action is taken to stop the virus.

Dr David Nabarro, UN special envoy on Ebola, said “just about every country in the world” needed to support countries suffering from the disease, warning that otherwise it would be “impossible” to get the virus quickly under control.

As part of the UK effort to help contain the outbreak, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a medical ship, is being loaded with supplies in Falmouth ahead of a mission to Sierra Leone.

The UK is sending 750 Ministry of Defence personnel to help Sierra Leone’s government cope with the crisis, including more than 200 military staff to run and staff World Health Organisation-led Ebola training facilities in West African country.

During yesterday’s exercise Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee, attended by other Ministers, senior officials and the Chief Medical Officer.

Mr Hunt said: “This is an extremely useful exercise and I feel doubly reassured that we have robust plans in place in the event that we get an Ebola case in the UK. We will evaluate what went well and what we need to improve.

“This exercise is just one small part of our ongoing contingency plans for Ebola. It builds on activity we routinely practise for a wide variety of illnesses and other emergencies.”

As part of the exercise potential Ebola victims were transferred to specially prepared hospital facilities to test the ability of staff to respond to the crisis without placing themselves at risk of infection.

In one of the staged scenarios a shopper who fell ill at a shopping centre in Gateshead was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, and placed in isolation.

After initial blood tests ruled out malaria, samples were rapidly sent to PHE Porton Down for testing. Following the diagnosis of Ebola, the patient was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London.

The Royal Victoria Infirmary, PHE and Ambulance Trust also simulated tracing the patient’s movements and known contacts.

Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, said: “This vitally important exercise gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of Ebola. Today has included a variety of scenarios involving personnel from hospitals, ambulance services and local authorities around the country.”

Latest figures from the World Health Organisation show the number of deaths from the disease has risen to 4,033. The vast majority of the fatalities – 4,024 – were in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

In Spain 16 people were being monitored in a Madrid hospital yesterday for signs of Ebola, with patient numbers rising as anger continued to rise over the Spanish government’s handling of the first outbreak of the disease outside Africa.

Teresa Romero, 44, a nurse who contracted the virus after caring for two infected priests repatriated to Spain, remained seriously ill but was said to be improving. She is so far the only person who has tested positive for Ebola through a transmission in the country.

A hospital source said: “Her condition improved in the night. She is conscious and talks from time to time when she is in a good mood.”

She is thought to have contracted the disease in late September in a Madrid hospital while caring for a Spanish missionary who was repatriated after he became infected with Ebola in Africa.

Three more people who came into contact with Mrs Romero – a hairdresser, another nurse and a cleaner – were admitted to the isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital on Friday evening.

But a leading Spanish doctor who is fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has said training for medics in Sierra Leone was more rigorous than that given in Spain.

Jota Echevarria, 62, a senior health coordinator for the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said Spain had failed to carry out correct containment measures.

He said: “I can tell you that [in Sierra Leone] all medical staff charged with treating patients suspected of Ebola have rigorous training, most of all in how to put on and take off the protective suits.”

In Liberia’s 41 members of the United Nations peacekeeping mission were yesterday under “close medical observation” after an international member of its medical team contracted the disease. The mission said in a statement that the measures were precautionary and that none of the staff members had shown signs of Ebola.

Amid the ongoing international crisis it emerged that jihadi terrorists have discussed using the Ebola virus to attack the West, according to Internet intelligence being monitored by counter-terrorism agencies.

In the worrying development, one group aligned to Isil has talked about fighters infecting themselves with Ebola to carry out suicide attacks on America and its allies.

The virus causes fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, and sometimes internal bleeding, and spreads through direct contact with body fluids.

Britons are being advised that the chances of developing Ebola in the UK are very low, but that if they have any of these symptoms and have had contact with an Ebola patient they should ring 111 first and not go directly to A&E or a GP. If there has been no contact with an Ebola patient they should seek help from 111, their GP or A&E if necessary.

A cure for diabetes and awful jokes

Diabetes is the fastest-growing health threat of our time – accounting for 10 per cent of the NHS budget

On reflection, it wasn’t the most usual of dates. Or at least I’d never before come across someone whose approach to wooing a woman was stripping naked, putting a pair of boxer shorts on his head, uttering a string of sounds that sounded rather like “wibble”, before running to the kitchen and drinking a bottle of Lucozade. Reader, of course I married him.

Not because I have a secret penchant for Lucozade drinkers, but because it became clear that this wasn’t my husband’s normal approach to romance. Rather, it was because he is one of the 300,000 people in Britain with Type 1 diabetes, and was suffering what is known as a “hypo” – or hypoglycaemia – when blood glucose levels fall so low that the body and mind can no longer function properly.

Last week, while politicians were focused on the threat from Ebola, a genuinely good health news story broke that we should all be celebrating. A potential cure for Type 1 diabetes is said to be within reach after scientists developed a treatment that eliminates the need for sufferers to inject insulin.

And the reason for this is one man’s personal quest – a Harvard scientist called Doug Melton. He has toiled on this for 23 years after his son Sam was diagnosed frighteningly young, at just six months old. As doctors tried to work out what was wrong with his baby, Melton, then a molecular biologist, took the decision to change focus and start investigating diabetes. “I did what any parent does,” he said. “I asked, 'What am I going to do about this?’”

Now more than two decades on, he’s done a phenomenal amount. Prof Melton says that his team is just one step away from the finish line. That one step will, of course, take many years – human trials have yet to start to replicate the success found in trials with mice – but it’s been described as potentially a medical game-changer on a par with the development of antibiotics for bacterial infections.

Those with Type 1 diabetes – previously known as juvenile onset diabetes, because it usually occurs in childhood – produce no insulin and are dependent on daily insulin injections and blood tests. Melton’s brilliant team has developed stem cells that can be reprogrammed to produce insulin, obviating the need for injections, and in the longer term helping to avoid common complications such as strokes, kidney disease and blindness, as well as hypos, which can result in coma or death.

On a lighter note, if the success is reproduced in human trials, it will also presumably save me from having to listen to my husband’s appalling jokes (a sure sign of low blood sugar is the fact that he finds what he is saying absolutely hilarious), and that there’s no chance of us ruining yet another major social occasion.

The most embarrassing one was when the paramedics coming to treat him managed to set off several car alarms hours after my best friend’s wedding, more or less under the happy couple’s window.

It will also mean that I won’t have physically to sit on top of him to stop him hurting himself while thrashing around semi-conscious – at 6ft 3in to my 5ft 5in, that’s no easy task. Although, on the downside, it means that I won’t make friends with the local team of paramedics. My husband once regained consciousness to hear one ask me, “Now, it was America you were about to go to last time we came here to help, wasn’t it?”

Politicians and health workers have become fixated on Type 2 diabetes, because of its shocking rise; there are now nearly three million people in the country with Type 2, which is often triggered through obesity and unhealthy lifestyle choices, as opposed to Type 1, where a patient’s own immune system turns on itself and destroys pancreatic cells. Diabetes is the fastest-growing health threat of our time – accounting for 10 per cent of the NHS budget, while £1 million is spent every hour on diabetes.

Meanwhile, too many children and young people struggle on, trying to manage growing up with a chronic illness that affects their life both dramatically but also in mundane ways – never being able to be without blood tests or insulin, trying to juggle sensible eating and drinking while all their friends do what they like with no adverse consequences.

And if they do mess up – as all those with diabetes do – there’s often a lack of understanding and sympathy. Back in 2005, police Tasered a man in a bus depot in Leeds who was having a hypo. In the US, a woman was handcuffed and thrown into a police van after police mistook her hypo for drunkenness.

So think for a moment this week about those around you behaving irrationally, stupidly, disconcertingly. They may just need a bit of understanding and some sugar quickly.

Especially if they are telling awful jokes with their pants on their head.

Gorgeous George is a vote-winner

Was it the prospect of living next door to Uri Geller that swung it? Or the chance that Paul Daniels and the lovely Debbie McGee might pop in? Whatever, the pretty village of Sonning in Berkshire can now boast George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin as their newest residents, after it emerged that they have bought a £10 million manor there.

But from Santa Monica to Sonning is a leap. Clooney is said to have been fascinated by Downton Abbey – but beautiful as his new home is, he may be in for a shock if he thinks that he’s going to be in a living version of the ITV series. Down-to-earth locals have pointed out that for grocery shopping it’s a choice between Waitrose in Woodley or Sainsbury’s in Winnersh, while the Reading Post alerted him to the fact that there’s always a tailback over the one-way Sonning bridge – no chance of

A-list cavalcades sweeping through here. And any chance of deference being shown to the new couple’s stellar status is limited: residents point out that they are used to celebrities. “You often see Theresa May around the village,” said one.

Interestingly, it’s recently been rumoured that Clooney is repositioning himself to pursue a political career. But does his choice of home in Berkshire rather than the Beltway indicate that he’s looking to become an MP instead of a Congressman?

For psephologists, this could add some spice to next May’s election. David Cameron recently issued the infamous warning: “Go to bed with Farage, wake up with Miliband.” But there is an opportunity for any enterprising local politico to maximise their vote in 2015 by tweaking the slogan slightly. Who, after, all could resist a party that promised, “Go to bed with us – wake up with Clooney?”

Let’s go shopping in our pyjamas

I can tell you exactly what I was doing at 5.41am last Thursday morning. I was being a national stereotype. More specifically, I was buying something online – insurance for my iPhone, in this case – along with thousands of others who have taken to shopping in the small hours.

According to research commissioned by John Lewis, there has been a 30 per cent increase in online shopping between the hours of midnight and 6am. (Fascinatingly, there is apparently a surge around 4am of Lego purchases.) The reason for this is the growth of smartphones and tablets, which make it much easier to complete an impulse purchase.

Shopping was once a formal transaction that took place between the hours of nine and five; now it has become a convenience, thanks to new technology.

Critics say this indicates a horrifying future when none of us are ever offline, but then I’m sure there were plenty of Paleolithic doomsayers who stood around predicting a grim future for any civilisation that used fire.

Of course, no one should spend all their lives online – but let’s be realistic: this has made life much easier for busy parents. If I can buy Lego at 4am, I can actually shut down the computer at 4pm to construct a plastic monstrosity with my children.

It’s all about balance and moderation – so don’t let’s stop taking the tablets.

Ebola virus 'far ahead' of global response as Spanish nurse get better

The condition of Teresa Romero, the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, improves but the world's ability to combat an Ebola epidemic is criticised

Countries across the world scrambled to stem the deadly Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outbreak that is getting worse "every day" on Saturday, as the condition of a Spanish nurse infected with the disease improved.

Travellers were screened and safety drills were carried out as a UN official just back from west Africa warned the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11155624/Ebola-toll-passes-4000-as-fears-grow-worldwide.html], was outpacing efforts to fight it.

"The virus is far ahead of us and every day the situation gets worse," the head of the United Nations' emergency Ebola mission Anthony Banbury, told UN leaders after a tour of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the nations worst hit by the epidemic.

"Collectively we must stop the spread to other countries and ensure that countries are prepared to rapidly detect, control, and eliminate the virus if it is introduced."

A suspect case was ruled out in Brazil, where a Guinean man tested negative for Ebola, the health ministry said, but fears of contagion persisted in Europe.

Attention focused on Madrid-based nurse Teresa Romero, 44, the first person diagnosed as having caught the disease outside Africa.

Spanish government officials were locked in a meeting on Saturday to coordinate their response to the crisis.

Romero's condition "improved in the night. She is conscious and talks from time to time when she is in a good mood," a hospital source said

Her condition "is serious but is improving", the source said.

Sixteen other people, mostly hospital staff, are under observation at the Carlos III hospital where Romero is being treated. The hospital said one of them was expecting final test results and could be discharged Saturday.

Doctors started treating Romero with the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp late on Friday, the source added.

There is still no vaccine or widely available treatment for Ebola, but ZMapp, made in California, is one of several drugs that have been fast-tracked for development.

Romero is thought to have contracted the disease in late September in a Madrid hospital while caring for a Spanish missionary infected with Ebola in Africa who later died.

The World Health Organisation said 4,033 people have died from Ebola as of October 8 out of a total of 8,399 registered cases in seven countries.

The sharp rise in deaths came as the UN said aid pledges to fight the outbreak have fallen well short of the $1 billion (£622 million) needed.

The Spanish health ministry on Friday called on citizens "to continue their daily activities normally," after a series of hoaxes fuelled fears of wider contagion.

Police said on Saturday they had arrested a man in the southern Spanish city of Cadiz who they said had triggered a safety alert by pretending to have Ebola symptoms.

Officials at the Madrid hospital insisted there was no risk of infection from patients under observation, including Romero's husband, who were photographed leaning out of the windows of their hospital rooms.

Britain held a nationwide exercise on Saturday to test its preparedness for an Ebola outbreak.

The eight-hour exercise featured actors pretending to be infected with Ebola plus medical staff treating them at undisclosed locations around the country.

Britain and the United States have boosted screening at major airports such as London Heathrow and JFK in New York.

In Latin America, Peru and Uruguay have announced similar airport measures and Mexico and Nicaragua planned to tighten controls of migrants heading for US soil as an Ebola precaution.

The Canadian government advised its citizens to leave the west African countries most affected by Ebola. It took measures at its own borders to screen for potentially exposed travellers.

The United Nations and leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone pleaded for greater help on the frontline of the disease in Africa.

UN Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson said only a quarter of "the one billion dollars sought" to combat the disease had been pledged. He appealed for doctors, nurses and other healthcare personnel to come forward.

The president of Guinea met Friday with International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, who promised the organisation was "ready to do more if needed."

Ebola concern spread to the sports world, with hosts Morocco calling for the January-February 2015 Africa Cup of Nations to be postponed, but the African Football Confederation said the schedule would not be changed.

Ebola medics 'better trained in Sierra Leone than Spain'

A top Spanish doctor says nurses in West Africa are more rigorously trained to avoid the infection and detect Ebola symptoms than in his native Madrid

A leading Spanish doctor who is fighting the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outbreak in West Africa has said training for medics in Sierra Leone was more rigorous than that given in Spain.

Jota Echevarria, a senior health coordinator for the International Rescue Committee (IRC), expressed dismay at the measures being used in his native Madrid to contain the outbreak, claiming Spain[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/] had failed to carry out correct containment measures.

“I can tell you that [in Sierra Leone] all medical staff charged with treating patients suspected of Ebola have rigorous training, most of all in how to put on and take off the protective suits,” said the 62-year old doctor, who is is currently in the west African country to set up a treatment and isolation clinic.

Speaking to The Telegraph from Freetown, the doctor with more than 25 years experience in humanitarian crises around the world explained: “It takes ten to 14 days to become fully trained in wearing a special protective suit. It is hard to put on and even harder to remove and that is where the biggest danger of infection lies.”

His comments after Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, an auxiliary nurse on a specialist team charged with treating two missionary priests who had been repatriated from West Africa, became the first person to contract Ebola in Europe.

She tested positive to the deadly hemorrhagic fever on Monday after being taken in an ambulance to her local hospital, six days after first showing symptoms of Ebola.

Mrs Romero, 44, admitted that she likely became infected when she touched her face with a contaminated glove while removing her protective suit after treating Manuel Garcia Viejo, the 69 year old missionary who died on September 25.

Madrid Health chiefs appeared to pin the blame of contamination on the nurse herself even as medical staff complained that they had had insufficient training and substandard equipment to deal with Ebola patients.

One doctor said he had received only a 10-minute briefing and was shown some photos on a wall before being expected to treat the Ebola patient.

“Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I will be expected to treat the Ebola patient and nobody has even taught me to put on the protective suit,” said Dr Santiago Yus, a specialist in intensive care with more than 30 years experience, in an interview with Spain’s daily El Mundo newspaper last Tuesday.

“I am not ready, I am not trained. And it’s the same with my colleagues,” he said.

Dr Echevarria said he was “surprised” when comparing the procedures that were in place in Spain compared to those followed in the field.

“I have seen pictures of the protective suits used there (in Spain) and they are not like the ones we’ve been using here.” he argued. “It seems that in Spain nobody has bothered to follow the procedures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).”

In his daily life, Dr Echevarria comes face to face with the deadly epidemic that has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa, and claims that security protocols applied by his team are very “rigorous and strict; not a single step is left out”.

“Here it takes 20-25 minutes to take off a protective suit and must be done with two trained supervisors who watch every step in a military manner to ensure no mistakes are made, because a slip up can easily occur and of course can be fatal,” he said.

He also expressed surprise at learning that Mrs Romero had been taken in a normal ambulance to the emergency department at her local hospital where no specialist isolation procedures were taken.

“I read the open letter from the doctor that treated her there,” said Dr Echevarria. “He acted with great courage in very difficult circumstances and I feel very sorry for him.”

He was referring to Juan Manuel Parra, the doctor at Alcorcon hospital who treated Mrs Romero for 16 hours before she tested positive to Ebola and was transferred to the specialist isolation unit at Carlos III hospital.

Dr Parra gave a damning account of the failure in biosecurity surrounding the first case of Ebola contracted in Spain including the fact that his protective suit left his arms exposed, before voluntarily isolating himself on Wednesday night over fears that he too had been infected.

In total 17 people are now in quarantine including Mrs Romero, the majority of them medical staff who treated her while she was showing symptoms of Ebola as well as her husband and three beauticians who came in contact with her when she went to get her legs waxed.

But Mrs Romero, whose condition was described as “stable but critical” after suffering multiple organ failure and who on Friday began to receive the experimental ZMapp drug, is the only one yet to test positive to Ebola.

Authorities are monitoring a further 80 people and have told them to stay in their homes with minimal contact with the outside world.

Questions still remain as to why Mrs Romero was not under closer observation after reporting symptoms given her contact with the infected missionaries.

“I can only hope that Spanish health authorities have learned their lessons very quickly and can tighten measures to contain the outbreak,” warned Dr Echevarria. “Ebola is not a nice guy to have around.”

Doctors and nurses to take part in national exercise to test Britain's readiness for an Ebola epidemic

A national exercise to test Britain's readiness for an Ebola outbreak will take place on Saturday.

Government ministers will join dozens of medical professionals from hospitals, the ambulance service and Public Health England for the eight-hour exercise in locations across the country.

Actors will simulate symptoms of the deadly virus to test the response of emergency services, while some staff will wear personal protective equipment.

A simulated meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee will also be held, chaired by Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary

The exercise was ordered by David Cameron as part of the UK's contingency plan against Ebola, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa.

It comes after the Prime Minister defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening for the virus at major airports and terminals, saying it had been taken on "medical advice".

Questions have been raised about the checks, which are to take place at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar rail terminals, with a spokesman for Gatwick saying that the airport had not been given any instructions about how the screening should be carried out.

The move was also criticised by health experts, with one describing it as a "complete waste of time".

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said the lack of precise information available about the screening was "shambolic".

Mr Cameron said: "What we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that's why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.

"What we are focusing on as a country is taking action right across the board to deal with this problem at source."

The Department of Health (DoH) did not reveal the locations of Saturday's exercise in advance.

A spokesman said: "The public can be assured that we have been planning our response to an Ebola case in the UK for many months now since the outbreak started in West Africa. It is vital that we test these plans in as realistic a situation as possible - with real people.

"That will include a full COBR meeting chaired by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to assess the outcome and learn any wider resilience lessons.

"It is important to remember that the overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low, and the UK has some of the best public health protection systems in the world with well-developed and well-tested systems for managing infectious disease."

A Number 10 spokesman said the decision to introduce enhanced screening for Ebola was based on advice from Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer.

But David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the screening was a "complete waste of time".

"There won't be anyone coming from these (West African) countries because all direct flights have been cancelled," he said.

"Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption."

Ebola now threatens the whole world

The latest outbreak of the lethal disease is very different – worse still, it could mutate into something even more deadly, says Tim Butcher, who knows the infected area of west Africa well

He is called ''S1’’ by scientists. He was two years old, born in a bush village called Meliandou, a beaten-earth patch of ground hacked from the jungle at the far end of a footpath worming through the remnants of the once mighty Guinean Rainforest.

The village is nothing more than a collection of mud-walled huts tasselled with leaf frond roofs. A ''rice larder” protects the communal foodstore, a thatched chamber set high on bare lengths of timber, the bark stripped off to deter rats and other vermin that infest all human settlements hereabouts.

Life in Meliandou is hard but ''S1’’ could have been expected to play his part, growing up to work the rice fields in the annual cycle for survival, learning to cope with seasonal extremes when the Harmattan wind blows in fierce heat from the Sahara before cooling rains arrive around Easter in a tumultuous thundery climax. Or he might have left to try urban life in the sprawl of Conakry, his nation’s capital, two days’ rough road travel off to the west. Instead, he died last December, vomiting, feverous and passing blackened stool. His name was Émile.

There is some debate as to when exactly he passed away. Some say the 6th of the month, some Boxing Day, but what is not debated is that he died from Ebola, the first fatality in an outbreak of the disease that is already the world’s worst.

This status makes him ''S1’’ or ''Serial 1’’ in the eyes of epidemiologists who published a paper on the outbreak in the New England Journal of Medicine. In line with all other Ebola outbreaks the scientists did not have to look far for ''S2’’, the boy’s three-year-old sister who died a few days later, ''S3’’, his mother, ''S4’’, his grandmother, and so on as the viral infection sped through the community claiming the village nurse, ''S5’’, and local midwife, ''S6’’, who took the disease out of the village and to her own community. The spread had begun.

So far, so like other Ebola outbreaks. But the proximity to Meliandou of international borders – due south into Liberia, south west into Sierra Leone - and the nature of those countries - broken by war, hopelessly misgoverned and yet small enough to be covered by transport routes – has given this outbreak uniquely terrifying characteristics.

It is these that make it no exaggeration to say this current outbreak could lead to a health crisis of continental, even global proportions.

We have seen the first inklings of this with health workers in Spain struck down, a panic when a mortally infected Liberian man spent several days in America potentially infecting others. And this fear is going to breed like microbes in a petri dish until the special character of this outbreak is finally recognised and addressed.

It was 1976 when Ebola was first identified in that crucible for so much that is portentous about Africa, the Congo. Then known as Zaire, vials of blood from a sick Belgian nun were sent on ice in an old vacuum flask to a laboratory in Antwerp. One vial broke in transit creating a hazardous soup of melted ice, infected blood and glass shards but the skilled scientists safely recovered an intact vial and began their work.

What they found was new to science. It was a virus but by viral standards it was a whopper, much larger than normal viruses, but very long and very thin, like an unruly filament of hair. It was an example of a filovirus, a family of viral agents that are very dangerous to humans although this one, soon to be named after the Ebola river not far from the dying nun’s mission station, appears to be primus inter pares in terms of lethality.

Fruit bats are suspected of being the natural ''reservoir’’ for the Ebola virus, the animal having evolved to live with it in its system. Every so often – as happened in 1976 – the virus jumps into the human population, either when a person is bitten by an infected bat, or kills and butchers such a bat, or kills and butchers a deer or other animal recently infected by a bat.

Once inside a human the virus invades cells and replicates like fury, spewing out new copies of itself that use the blood system to spread around the body contaminating other cells. For reasons of safety, research into Ebola is far from complete, although it is known it has the ability to hijack the immune system, somehow making the body’s defences turn on themselves.

It hoodwinks blood into clotting where clotting is not needed, for example around the liver, and then it damages the lining of blood vessels to such an extent that infected blood cells, packed with replicated versions of the original virus, can smash their way through like wrecking balls.

With the body’s clotting agents already used up, the tiniest breach in skin membrane leads to heavy bleeding, sometimes from the nose, fingernails or anus, a characteristic that has Ebola categorised as a haemorrhagic fever. Victims die from multiple organ failure as their blood pressure peters away to naught.

Horrible though that is, the positive thing about Ebola from a public health point of view is that the virus has to date been difficult to spread. It has not been dispersed through the air, nor transferred by insect vectors such as mosquitoes, nor carried far in water. If a victim’s infected body fluids are avoided by other humans, or neutralised using agents such as chlorine, the infection chain can be broken.

In crude terms that is what had happened since 1976 in the few dozen known eruptions of Ebola which have all happened in and around the Congo river basin. The spread of the disease has been stopped because either it has wiped out the entire human population, often small and in remote locations, or trained medical personnel, practising barrier nursing techniques, have treated patients safely until they have either died or recovered.

Just like generals who fight the last war, slow to adapt to a changing conflict situation, so world leaders have fallen into the same trap with the Meliandou outbreak. The attitude has been “don’t panic – a few doctors with biohazard gear will sort it out’’. They could not have been more catastrophically wrong.

Now is not the time for finger-pointing about the inadequacies of the world’s response. That must come later. Much more urgent is recognising how dangerously different this outbreak is and changing our response. For a start, this virus appears to be a new strain, cropping up 2,000 miles away from the only previously confirmed instances in the Congo.

Never before has Ebola spread through a significant urban population yet this is what is happening in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone; Monrovia, capital of Liberia and Conakry, capital of Guinea.

In 2009, I walked across Liberia and Guinea from the Sierra Leone border – the ''hot zone’’ for the current outbreak – and I know from my own experience the poverty of the communities, how porous the frontiers are and how easy it is to reach the cities. I canoed across a river border away from official controls and saw how bush roads take taxi and bus traffic all the way to the big cities in a matter of hours.

And I also know how hopelessly inadequate the governments of both countries are, letting down their sterling yet long-suffering people year after year, regime after regime. Outsiders suffer from an ''illusion of normalcy’’ when applied to cities like Monrovia, the presumption being that it must have normal city-like characteristics. It does not.

It has none of the basics taken for granted in the developed ''north’’: clean water is not widely available, power is in short supply and public health is piecemeal, propped up mostly by hardworking outsiders such as aid workers or missionaries.

Like Freetown, where a cholera outbreak happened two years ago, the authorities in Monrovia have failed to improve squatter camps packed with impoverished people who have no option other than to use the sea in the city centre as their lavatory. Monrovians used to joke about what was found on the beach near the West Point slum. Few are laughing about it any more.

The arrival into these communities of a highly infectious pathogen like Ebola has meant it has reached a near-perfect site for mass replication and, more ominously, mutation.

Virologists have been able to establish that the HIV/Aids epidemic took off only after an original SIV virus jumped from primates to humans to create the forerunner of HIV. But to become a global epidemic the early HIV versions needed a large group of humans in which it could replicate, morph and develop. It found just such a population in the colonial capital of the Congo, Léopoldville, today’s Kinshasa.

Parallels with the current situation in West Africa are alarming, not alarmist: it is a place where tens of thousands of people live cheek by jowl, without decent public health infrastructure, walk the same muddy alleys, use the same open latrines, sleep in the same rooms as people who have already died of Ebola leaving infected traces of their bodily fluids.

These are the realities behind the projected figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, America’s leading public health body, which suggest 1.4 million people could be infected by Ebola within three months of today.

They are behind the astonishing warning from Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, issued this week that unless the outbreak is contained and stopped, ''the future of not only West Africa but perhaps even Africa is at stake’’.

Even getting the message out there to people distrustful of central government is not easy. In Monrovia, there have been riots by mobs spooked at the sight of health workers dressed like spacemen taking away corpses dumped on the streets. Back over the border in Guinea, not far from Meliandou, seven members of a team monitoring the spread of the disease were beaten to death.

The most worrying aspect is the longer the virus continues spreading in these communities, the greater the likelihood of a mutation that will create an even more pathogenic virus, one that might even be transferred through the air. This is not the stuff of a fiction writers, this is the sort of thing currently being talked about by virologists.

The sequence that began with Émile has already passed Serial 3,800. World leaders need to wake up and fight today’s war, not yesterday’s, to stop that number growing exponentially.

Unaffected countries' risk remains low, says Dr Richard Dawood

Travel news

Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are closer to London than they are to Kenya, South Africa or Zambia. Yet the evolving Ebola outbreak in west Africa has already devastated travel to unaffected countries far away, cutting tourism to east and southern Africa by as much as 40 per cent. Industry experts are fearful of downplaying risks – the memory of John Gummer, Minister for Agriculture at the start of the "mad cow" BSE outbreak in 1990, feeding his daughter a hamburger in a much–derided attempt to allay public fears looms large.

Following recent cases in the United States and Spain, more instances of people travelling from affected countries and becoming ill subsequently are inevitable. Despite the alarm such cases cause, secondary spread in countries with a good public health infrastructure has very limited potential.

Travel restrictions do not work. Research conclusively shows that even the most draconian travel restrictions have minimal impact on the spread of disease. In the particular case of Ebola, they could actually make things worse, hindering the movement of people and supplies that are essential to the response.

Border screening measures make it appear as though something is being done, but are similarly wasteful, inconvenient and pointless. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, Canada used thermal imaging to scan 763,082 incoming travellers, but not a single one tested positive for SARS. An information sheet for arriving travellers, including clear instructions on when, where and how to seek medical attention, would be more valuable.

Meanwhile, travel will continue. The important facts for travellers to keep in mind concern Ebola's method of spread, which is only by direct or indirect contact with blood or body fluids.

Contact with symptom–free people carries no risk as it is only symptomatic or unwell people who can spread infection. Ebola is not an airborne disease, and no virus has ever "mutated" to change its mode of transmission.

Important precautions – regardless of Ebola – are careful attention to hygiene, especially frequent hand washing with soap and water or alcohol hand gel. (And, of course, avoiding blood, body fluids, or anything that might have come into contact with them.)

As with travel during the SARS and swine flu outbreaks, it is vital to reduce your risk of any fever during your travels, to avoid triggering unnecessary alarm. This means extra attention to malaria precautions and travel vaccines, and, in my view, being sure to have a flu jab before any kind of travel this winter.

There's no room for complacency, and it is essential to follow the latest advice from the World Health Organization and UK public health authorities, but I have no plans to restrict my own travels at present.

There may well be some attractive bargains on offer in east and southern Africa this winter, and I see no current prospect of Ebola risk in the splendid isolation of a luxury safari or a beachside villa, thousands of miles from the heart of the crisis.

Dr Richard Dawood is a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic, London.

THREE OF THE BEST: POLITICS AND CURRENT AFFAIRS

Le Show

tgr.ph/1vADbC9

For listeners who prefer their current affairs served with a healthy dollop of satire, Harry Shearer – the actor best known as the bassist in Spinal Tap and the voices of Ned Flanders, Mr Burns, Smithers, Principle Skinner and a host of other Simpsons characters – has been making this enormously funny weekly radio show for over 30 years. It's an idiosyncratic blend of Private Eye–style news commentary, sketch comedy (Shearer writes the sketches and performs the voices) and the occasional musical interlude – and is refreshingly unlike anything else in the podcast world.

The New Yorker Political Scene

tgr.ph/1yAAXqX

The New Yorker creates a wide and typically urbane variety of podcasts, covering everything from fiction to poetry to features (all of which are available at www.newyorker.com/podcasts[http://www.newyorker.com.proxy.bc.edu/podcasts]) . Hosted by the magazine's executive editor, Dorothy Wickenden, and featuring whip–sharp analysis from its staff writers, this excellent series zeroes in on one or two major current affairs issues per week, and never fails to leave me feeling better informed. To give a sense of their outlook (which is considerably more internationalist than most American publications), recent episodes have included discussion of Syria, the Ebola outbreak, ISIS and Ukraine.

Pienaar's Politics

Where else in the world of broadcasting might you hear a serious interviewer asking William Hague which judo move he'd like to pull on recently–defected (to UKIP) Tory MP Mark Reckless? Or halt a rambling diatribe by the Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna by saying "[this is] like having an argument with a tuba"? The answer, of course, is on John Pienaar's weekly 5 Live political news show, which – for listeners who aren't in a particularly receptive mood at 10am on a Sunday – is also available as this handy podcast. Enlivened by Pienaar's broadcast style, which mixes gentle gravitas, a masterful command of the facts and a wryly mischievous sense of humour, it's a real highlight of the schedules.

Global investor pessimism leads to falls in all major European indices, while Brent Crude slumps to lowest level since 2010

GLOBAL stock markets plunged and the price of oil collapsed to its lowest level in more than four years yesterday as pessimism about the economic outlook for the eurozone gripped investors around the world.

The FTSE 100 index of the UK's leading shares fell 91.88 points, or 1.43pc, to 6,339.97, its lowest mark in a year and 7.82pc below highs of 6,878 in May.

The value of gold – a traditional shelter in turbulent times – surged 2.64pc, to $1,222.95 per ounce, as Brent crude hit its lowest level since mid–2010 at $88.11 per barrel. And the "fear index", a measure of investor anxiety known as the Vix, leapt by nearly 25pc as a raft of gloomy economic data emerged.

UK construction data showed output contracted by 3.9pc in August, much worse than analysts had predicted. French industrial production also appears to be stagnating and reports emerged that Germany's central bank would cut its official growth forecast next week. The impact of Ebola and lurking geopolitical risks added to the confluence of pessimism.

In Germany, the benchmark DAX index collapsed by 216.21 points, or 2.4c, to 8788.81, bringing the falls for the week to more than 4pc. Exports from the country in August suffered their worst monthly fall since January 2009 when the global economy was rocked following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In France, the CAC 40 index of leading shares also tumbled, by 66.74 points – or 1.64pc – to 4073.71.

Remarks made by central bankers were taken to mean they were retreating from imminent interest rate rises. Normally this would be a boost to the markets but yesterday they were interpreted as a sign of weakness and added to the woe.

Alastair McCaig, market analyst from IG, said: "The FTSE 100 has broken through the support on its recent trading range. This is becoming more than just a dip."

He added: "European markets looks like they are staring over the edge and into the abyss, or may have even stepped off the cliff."

US traders reacted to the mood. The S&P was down slightly in early trading as Wall Street worried the US economy would be dragged down by weakness in Europe and the rest of the world.

Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF annual meeting in Washington, George Osborne warned that "serious clouds" were gathering and the threat of a triple–dip recession in the eurozone posed the biggest risk to the UK and global economy.

Separately, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said she thought there was a 35pc to 40pc chance of the eurozone falling back into recession. She said that the world was stuck in a "painful jobs crisis" that threatens to lock a generation out of the labour market and leave millions more disenchanted. Ms Lagarde said urgent action was needed to tackle youth unemployment, which remains above 50pc in countries such as Greece and Spain.

"We are stuck in a painful jobs crisis. Two hundred million people around the world are looking for work today – if the unemployed formed their own country, it would be the fifth–largest in the world," she said in a speech.

Viewpoint

Western governments have been disgracefully slow to wake up to the threat posed by West Africa's Ebola epidemic. Ebola was never an exclusively African problem; from the start, it was a global one. And it has always demanded an international response, not just for reasons of compassion, but also out of naked self–interest. It may seem insensitive to cite these wider interests in providing assistance given the scale of the tragedy on the ground, but if they help instruct a more effective approach, it can only be for the good.

We know from experience that pandemics will frequently have deeply negative economic consequences. This has actually got very little to do with the direct impact of the virus itself. Much more important is the effect on behaviour, the fear factor if you like, and the aversion response it triggers.

Already we are seeing the early signs in reduced international travel and cancelled trade, never mind the direct consequences for already fragile African economies. Shares in travel companies and airlines have taken big hits this week.

The World Bank quantifies these negative financial impacts at $32.6bn (£20.2bn) for the immediately affected region alone, and that assumes containment by the end of the year. If containment is slower, the numbers are plainly going to be much bigger. And in a worst–case scenario, where the disease spreads more widely, taking in Western nations, we could be talking about a new global recession. One health expert here in Washington describes it as the worst threat to global health since Aids. It's hard to disagree. The outbreak has occurred at a point when the world economy is already looking vulnerable. It needs further shocks like a hole in the head.

The longer international action is delayed, the more expensive dealing with the epidemic becomes. This is one of those instances where relatively small amounts of investment in African health care and infrastructure could save the West incalculable costs further down the line. Rarely is the case for overseas aid made as strongly as this.

By the by, it has also given that almost forgotten institution, the World Bank, a new lease of life. Dr Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president, has been leading from the front here at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in mobilising the international response and providing some of the funds needed to contain the problem.

The renewed sense of purpose Ebola has given the bank is perhaps just as well, for in other respects, Dr Kim finds his staff in open mutiny. The cause is a root and branch restructuring, including a substantial cost–cutting programme. It hardly needs saying that the troops, grown fat and complacent on their taxfree Washington salaries and perks, don't much like it. At a "town hall" meeting earlier this week, Dr Kim was confronted by one angry staffer with the complaint that cuts to the travel budget were forcing employees to fly at inconvenient times, thereby interfering with their "breakfasts". Such hardship is apparently unknown at the World Bank – a curiosity, to put it mildly, for an institution committed to helping poorer nations with development. Whatever next? A ban on business class?

In a world of plentiful finance, even for Third World countries, it has been increasingly hard to figure out the point of the World Bank, other than that of keeping its government–nominated placees in comfortable semi–retirement.

Dr Kim is doing a good job at reinventing the bank for the modern age, but it's small thanks to his mollycoddled lifers.

Tory defector strides firmly past attempts to drive a wedge between him and his new leader

By–election special

By–election sketch

SOMEHOW, it was an image that summed it all up. I arrived in Clactonon–Sea at 8.50am, and, as I walked out of the station, the very first sight to greet my eyes was this: Nigel Farage, fag in hand, standing beside a white van, in front of a kebab shop.

Almost all the boxes ticked. If only he had been holding a pint of beer, it would have made a perfect shot for the next Ukip poster campaign.

Fag finished, Mr Farage sauntered into the UK Independence Party's local HQ – which was next door to the kebab shop – to host a radio phone–in about the triumph of the night before.

Having won the Clacton by–election, Ukip now had, in the shape of Douglas Carswell, its first MP (not counting Bob Spink, a Tory MP who represented Ukip for six months in 2008 after defecting without calling a by–election).

The winning margin had been handsome: a majority of 12,404 (even greater than the majority Mr Carswell won at the general election of 2010, when he held the seat as a Conservative). On his radio phone–in, Mr Farage honked with delight. What time had he been to bed, if at all? "There was a pub, a Ukip–supporting pub that kept itself open, and I'm not sure what time we left – about a quarter past five, something like that…"

It was now a quarter past nine. The Ukip leader and his shiny new MP were due to celebrate their win with a walkabout through the streets of Clacton at 11am, starting outside McDonald's. The media massed in advance, eyes darting around hungrily for their prey. Ten minutes behind schedule, a familiar black Range Rover drew up across the road. The rear passenger doors opened.

Instant chaos.

TV cameras, microphones, photographers, reporters swarmed around the car. Questions were shouted like threats. The scrum was so wide that it brought a halt to both traffic and pedestrians. Zimmer frames and buggies struggled to squeeze past.

Although neither man was visible from outside the scrum, some passersby deduced their identity, and excitedly joined in the commotion. "Titanium Nigel!" hollered a man in a baseball cap. "Well done, Doug!"

A squatly solid man of around 70 muscled his way into the rear of the scrum and bellowed, to no response: "When are we leaving the Common Market?" A young woman clambered up a nearby tree to take a photograph on her phone. For a fleeting moment, Mr Carswell's face came into view; he flashed what looked like a half–anxious grin, and gave the thumbs–up.

Inside the scrum, the goal was to make Mr Farage and Mr Carswell disagree about something. Handily, Newsweek Europe magazine had just published an interview with Mr Farage in which he had said that prospective immigrants who were HIV positive should not be allowed to enter Britain. By coincidence, Mr Carswell's father had been one of the first doctors in the world to diagnose cases of HIV. Did the MP share his leader's view?

"I agree with everything Nigel has said," said Mr Carswell loyally. (This was a slight modification to the answer he had given to a reporter earlier in the morning, which was: "You have gratuitously mischaracterised [Mr Farage's] position." Later on, incidentally, he was asked whether he shared Mr Farage's discomfort at hearing foreign languages spoken on British trains. His reply: "Sometimes in politics people say things and what they say is mischaracterised." Something tells me Mr Carswell will be resorting to this answer a lot.) The scene in the street concluded with Mr Farage scrambling back into the Range Rover, which had sat stationary since he had emerged from it. During his walkabout he had walked roughly a yard.

Mr Carswell struck off alone on foot, pursued by a smaller swarm of reporters. Another attempt at wedgedriving commenced. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, came to Britain in 2012 for life–saving surgery from the NHS. A reporter asked whether this made her, to borrow one of Mr Farage's favourite phrases, a "health tourist". Would Ukip have kept her out? Mr Carswell kept up his stride. "I'm not going to answer that question," he said briskly. "I'm not familiar with that case." "She's just won the Nobel Peace Prize," explained the reporter helpfully. But Mr Carswell strode firmly on.

Every so often, locals would recognise their MP and congratulate him on his re–election under new colours. One middle–aged man seemed particularly eager to have a word. Mr Carswell stopped and offered him a handshake. "Mr Carswell," said the man urgently. "I must ask you."

Mr Carswell looked at him expectantly. "Why is it," continued the man, "that when you go in the polling booth, you have to vote using a pencil? Why not a pen?" Mr Carswell donned an expression of deep gravity. "I have never thought of that," he said slowly, and no doubt truthfully.

The walkabout ended up back at Ukip HQ, where an increasingly exhaustedlooking Mr Carswell gave a series of interviews. Before one of these, with Sky News, he could be heard saying down the line to a producer, "What are you going to be asking me about? You're not going to be asking me about Ebola, are you?" Perhaps, after HIV and Malala, Mr Carswell had had enough questions about Ukip health policy for one day. Happily, the producer's answer proved to be no. Instead he was asked about the future of politics.

"Change!" cried the man who has represented Clacton since 2005. "We need change… Change is going to happen… We can deliver change by being the change…"

So far, he has changed his rosette. Locals will look forward to seeing what else he can do.

Market report

BALFOUR Beatty's shareholders could be forgiven for regretting a missed opportunity recently. The construction group's rejection of a £1.8bn offer from its rival Carillion in August was followed by a £75m profit warning and the exit of its chairman, Steve Marshall.

Things went from bad to worse yesterday when shares in the FTSE 100 group fell to an 11–year low after analysts at Jefferies cut their price target on the company, and urged investors to reject a proposed sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff, its lucrative professional services division.

"Why take the strongest player off the pitch when you are 5–0 down?" said Jefferies' Anthony Codling, who questioned why shareholders should support a sale championed by Mr Marshall when his exit "seems to us an admission that he got things wrong".

He added that the company's new management should wait until they have a "firm grasp of the business" before pressing ahead.

Jefferies cut its price target on the shares from 233p to 164p by applying an "uncertainty discount".

Balfour's shares dropped 3.8p, or 2.4pc, to 152p, meaning it is trading at almost half what Carillion offered.

The company was just one of 88 fallers on the FTSE 100 amid a global sell–off caused by continuing worries about the global economy. The index of London's leading stocks dropped 91.88, or 1.4pc, to 6,339.97, a 12–month low. This came despite further hints of more stimulus measures from Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.

"Bad economic data are now being viewed as bad and the dove–ish signals from central banks are now being taken as a sign of weakness rather than a reason to ramp up equities," said Jonathan Sudaria, at Capital Spreads.

Tullow Oil was the biggest faller on the Footsie after the oil and gas explorer reported a dry well off the coast of Gabon. This, combined with Brent Crude falling below $89 a barrel for the first time since 2010, sent Tullow's shares down 45p, or 7.9pc to 526p.

Commodity weaknesses hit the miners, with Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Glencore dropping 3.6pc, 3.1pc and 3.1pc respectively.

Ebola fears continued to blight travel stocks, with TUI Travel down 3.7pc, Carnival off 2.7pc and International Airlines Group losing 2.3pc.

Housebuilders were a rare bright spot, with the announcement of Scotland's new house tax plans seen as positive for the sector. Persimmon rose 15p, or 1.2pc, to £12.91, while Hammerson and builders merchant Travis Perkins also gained ground.

Ebola victim in US was sent away with 'dangerously high' temperature

Thomas Duncan, who died from the disease earlier this week in Texas, was sent home by hospital a 39.4 Celsius temperature reading

The temperature for the first person to die of Ebola in the US spiked to 103 degrees (39.4 Celsius) during the hours of his initial visit to an emergency room - a fever that was flagged with an exclamation point in the hospital's record-keeping system, his medical records show.

Despite telling a nurse that he had recently been in Africa and displaying other symptoms that could indicate Ebola - fever, sharp headache and abdominal pain -Thomas Eric Duncan of Liberia underwent a battery of tests and was eventually sent home.

Duncan's family provided his medical records to The Associated Press - more than 1,400 pages in all. They chronicle his time in the ER, his urgent return to the hospital two days later and his steep decline as his organs began to fail.

In a statement issued Friday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said it had made procedural changes and continues to "review and evaluate" the decisions surrounding Duncan's care.

Duncan carried the deadly virus with him from his home in Liberia, though he showed no symptoms when he left for the United States. He arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 and fell ill several days later.

When he first showed up at the hospital, he reported severe pain - rating it an eight on a scale of 10. Doctors gave him CT scans to rule out appendicitis, stroke and numerous other serious ailments. Ultimately, he was prescribed antibiotics and told to take Tylenol, then returned to the apartment where he was staying with a Dallas woman and three other people.

"I have given patient instructions regarding their diagnosis, expectations for the next couple of days, and specific return precautions," an emergency room physician wrote. "The condition of the patient at this time is stable."

After Duncan's condition worsened, someone in the apartment made an emergency call, and paramedics took him back to the hospital on Sept. 28. That's when he was admitted and swiftly put in isolation.

Duncan died Wednesday, almost two weeks after he first sought help. He was 45, according to the records. Relatives said he was 42. The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services on Friday said his remains had been cremated.

Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said his uncle's care was "either incompetence or negligence."

Either way "there is a problem, and we need to find the answer to it," he said, adding that it was "conspicuous" that all the white Ebola patients in the U.S. survived "and the one black man died."

Only a fraction of the documents are related to the first visit. Most are related to Duncan's care after he was admitted to the hospital.

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who reviewed some of the records, said the care after Duncan's second ER visit was "impeccable." Dallas physicians immediately signaled concern about Ebola and "spared no measure to try to keep him alive."

The documents show that a nurse recorded early in Duncan's first hospital visit that he recently came to the U.S. from Africa, though he denied having been in contact with anyone sick. There was no indication in the paperwork that he was asked any follow-up questions about his travels.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had alerted hospitals nationwide to take a travel history for patients with Ebola-like symptoms.

The hospital said it had made changes to its intake process and other practices "to better screen for all critical indicators" of Ebola.

Doctors who evaluated Duncan did not respond to messages left at their offices by the AP.

A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services said the agency was considering investigating the hospital for compliance with state health and safety laws.

The hospital has repeatedly changed its account of what the medical team knew when it released Duncan from the emergency room early on Sept. 26.

A few days later, on Sept. 30, it initially said Duncan did not tell the staff he had been in Africa. On Oct. 1, it said Duncan's nurse had been aware of the Africa connection but did not share that information with the rest of the medical team.

The next day, the hospital blamed a flaw in its electronic health-records systems for not making Duncan's travel history directly accessible to his doctor.

A day later, on Oct. 3, the hospital issued a statement saying Duncan's travel history had been available to all hospital workers, including doctors, who treated him during his initial visit.

Duncan's travel history was listed in a nursing notice but not in the physician's note, Adalja said.

The patient's 103-degree (39.4 Celsius) fever might warrant "a little more investigation," Adalja said. A chart showed Duncan did not arrive with a fever but left with one.

After it became clear that Duncan was suffering from Ebola, another option would have been to give him a transfusion from an Ebola survivor in the hopes that antibodies in the blood could help him fight the disease.

But Duncan did not receive a transfusion because the blood types did not match, the hospital said.

Dr. Kent Brantly, the first American flown back to the U.S. for treatment of Ebola, confirmed that account, saying he spoke with a doctor caring for Duncan and was willing to donate blood. But their blood types were incompatible, he said Friday in an interview with Abilene Christian University's alumni magazine.

Also Friday, the World Health Organization announced that the Ebola death toll had surpassed 4,000 confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola deaths. All but nine were in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea.

Actress fawns over President while introducing him at fundraiser at her LA home

A blushing Gwyneth Paltrow told President Barack Obama: “You’re so handsome that I can’t speak properly,” as she introduced him to guests at a fundraiser at her home in Los Angeles.

The 43-year-old actress was hosting the event on behalf of the Democratic National Committee in the garden of her mansion in the wealthy LA neighbourhood of Brentwood.

Guests including fellow Hollywood A-lister Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford, the West Wing actor, sipped wine and cocktails and ate hors d’oeuvres while rubbing shoulders with the president, who was on a three-day fundraising visit to the California.

In a gushing speech to introduce him, Paltrow told Mr Obama that she was one of his “biggest fans, if not the biggest,” and described him as an “incredible role model.”

The mother-of-two, who also has a business as the owner of the Goop lifestyle website and is estimated to earn around $19 million (£12 million) a year, went on to thank him for his work on equal pay, saying it was: “very important to me as a working mother”.

She urged guests to help return a Democratic-controlled Congress in elections due next month, saying: “It would be wonderful if we are able to give this man all the power he needs to accomplish the things he needs to.”

As she concluded, Paltrow stumbled over her words and laughed off her gaffe, telling Mr Obama she was distracted because he was too handsome.

In response to her fawning introduction, the President thanked his hostess and her children, Apple, 10, and Moses, eight, for letting him “crash your house”.

Referring to the youngsters present as an example of why it was important to tackle the Ebola crisis, Mr Obama went on: “I want to assure everybody that the likelihood of an epidemic here in the United States is extraordinarily small.

“But there’s a humanitarian crisis that’s happening right now in West Africa where children not much older, and in some cases younger than Apple and Moses, are dying on the streets alone.”

Following the cocktail party, a select group of 50 groups including Roberts and Whitfield stayed on to an exclusive dinner at Paltrow’s house.

Guests paid $1,000 to hear Obama speak and between $15,000 and $32,000 to dine with him.

It is not the first time Paltrow has played host in order to raise money for President Obama.

In 2011, along with her then-husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, she hosted an event at their London home in order to help finance his re-election campaign. However the president did not attend, saying there were no “doors to knock on” to get votes in the British capital.

Ebola: 'Highly unlikely' British businessman had virus

Health officials said it now appears 'highly unlikely' that Colin Jaffray, the British businessman who died in Macedonia, had contracted Ebola

It is "highly unlikely" the British man said to have died of Ebola in Macedonia actually had the disease, the country's health ministry said on Friday.

The man, named locally as 57 year-old businessman Colin Jaffray, died on Thursday evening, just 90 minutes after he was admitted to hospital in Skopje suffering from a fever, severe stomach pain and vomiting.

His friend and business partner Michael English, who was with Mr Jaffray in Macedonia to find investors for a new project and who has been quarantined in his hotel since his friend’s death, said it was “crazy” to suggest he died of Ebola.

He said Mr Jaffray had not visited Africa for more than six years, and the last time he went was to Nigeria – a country due to be declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organisation on October 20.

Health officials in Macedonia sparked international panic on Thursday, when they said Mr Jaffray may have been suffering from Ebola, as he was displaying some of the symptoms, including a high temperature, and because his condition deteriorated so quickly.

As result, the hotel where he was staying - the Super 8 - was put in quarantine and 25 staff and guests, including Mr English, told to stay in their rooms. The guests, believed to be from Holland, Albania, Turkey and Belgium, remained trapped inside on Friday.

Doctors and nurses who treated him were also put in quarantine, and the hospital's emergency contagious disease protocol activated. They too remained in quarantine on Friday.

Tests have yet to confirm the cause of death but Dr Jovanka Kostovska from the Macedonian Ministry of Health said on Friday that initial observations suggested it was not Ebola.

She said none of the other people at the hotel or any medical staff had shown any symptoms but both the hotel and hospital remained on lock-down as a precaution and defended the hospital’s response.

At a press conference at the hospital, Dr Kostovska said: "There are no other similar cases registered and even the patient's friend that accompanied him during his stay does not show symptoms.

Samples have been sent to Hamburg, Germany, for testing, with the results due back on Saturday.

"Considering the epidemiological surveys that were conducted yesterday, the health authorities are getting closer to the standpoint that there is no large probability that this is a case of Ebola."

Mr Jaffray had traveled to Macedonia with Mr English on October 2.

News of his death prompted widespread fear that Ebola may be in Britain as he had traveled to Macedonia from London with Mr English on October 2.

The disease has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which led to concerns he could have infected people in the UK.

Mr Jaffray, was previously the president of the Foreign Investors Council in Macedonia. He was also the regional director in Macedonia for Johnson Matthey, the UK chemical firm, until 2010.

Mr English said the pair were in Macedonia to find investors for a new fish farm they wanted to open near the city of Ohrid, the country’s most popular tourist area.

He said Mr Jaffray, his friend of many years, had taken ill with severe stomach ache and remained in his room for three days.

“He was complaining for three days that he was not feeling well,” he said.

“He had high temperature. The morning before he was taken to hospital he said he was feeling better but somewhere around noon he called me back and said he was not feeling well again - he was confused and his hands were shaking. He did not want to go to hospital but the hotel personnel called an ambulance.

“It is crazy that somebody thought he had Ebola because he has not visited Africa for six years.”

He also dismissed reports that Mr Jaffray’s death was as a result of “excessive alcohol consumption”.

“The suggestion that he was an alcoholic was certainly not true. He did not drink more than anyone else."

It is understood he lived in Royston, Cambridgeshire, with his wife Dawn, 55, who runs a catering firm, and their three children.

Jatin Thakrar, who worked with Mr Jaffray at Johnson Matthey, said: “He was a friend. Our thoughts are with Colin's family and friends - we are very sorry to hear it, it’s tragic.”

A spokesman for Johnson Matthey said: "We are awaiting confirmation that it is indeed the Colin Jaffray who worked for us. He was in our employ from 1974, but retired from the firm in 2010, and then did consultancy work. Many people here knew him well, and people will be really saddened if the news turns out to be confirmed."

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "We are aware of the death of a British citizen on October 9 and are providing consular support to the family at this sad time."

AMERICA'S top health official has compared the outbreak of Ebola to the Aids epidemic amid dire warnings by international officials about the potential for the virus to spread.

Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a veteran of the fight against Aids, delivered his bleak assessment at a World Bank summit to raise funds to fight the disease.

"In my 30 years in public health, the only thing that has been like this is Aids," Dr Frieden told the conference in Washington. "We have to work now so that this is not the world's next Aids."

Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, struck a similarly sombre tone as he said that the global response to the Ebola crisis was "way behind the curve", leaving Africa's future "at stake".

The men were speaking at a summit also attended by Ban Ki–moon, the UN secretary–general, Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund managing director, international charity chiefs and leaders of the three worst affected West African nations.

"We have to quickly speed up, and scale up, the global response to this crisis," Mr Kim said. "Unless we quickly contain and stop this epidemic, nothing less than the future of Africa is at stake."

As the impact of the crisis continued to spread, aircraft cleaning crews in New York walked out in protest at lack of training and equipment.

CDC experts have predicted that the virus could infect up to 1.4 million people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea by the end of January. "It's going to be a long fight," said Dr Frieden.

The World Health Organisation has warned that the virus could be impossible to eradicate and become a part of life in West Africa.

Spain sets up Ebola crisis team as angry health workers protest at PM’s hospital visit

Spanish officials criticised after setting up crisis committee to deal with “complex and difficult” Ebola outbreak five days after nurse confirmed as first person to contract virus outside of West Africa

Spain has set up a crisis committee to deal with the “complex and difficult” Ebola outbreak, five days after a nurse was confirmed as the first person to contract the deadly virus outside of West Africa.

The belated move came amid increasing anger in Spain as prime minister Mariano Rajoy was met by dozens of protesting health workers outside the hospital where 14 people are now quarantined, including Maria Teresa Romero Ramos.

Mrs Romero is fighting for her life after contracting the haemorrhagic fever.

Nurses shouted “Bastards, useless cowards,” at the prime minister and regional president of Madrid as they made a surprise visit to the Carlos III hospital to thank medical staff who were treating the quarantined patients.

“Lots of people are working here at a moment that we all know is complex and difficult,” Mr Rajoy told reporters, but added that he was “absolutely convinced” everything necessary would be done to overcome the crisis.

Meanwhile Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the deputy prime minister, announced that a crisis committee would be formed to “to give the best care possible to Mrs Romero, to transmit calm to the population and to coordinate our actions”.

Spain’s special Ebola committee will include Ana Mato, the health minister, and representatives from the economy, interior and defence ministries, as well as from the Carlos III hospital and a separate new scientific committee to advise on handling of Ebola outbreak, Mrs Saenz said.

Opposition politicians have criticised the government for taking so long to form a crisis committee, and calls continued for the resignation of Ana Mato and other officials of the conservative governing Popular Party over their handling of the nurse’s case.

A litany of errors have emerged including the fact that it took over a week to isolate the infected nurse after she began to feel unwell, and that she was initially sent to a public hospital with inadequate protection measures.

Mrs Romero was said to be in a “stable but critical condition” on Friday after having suffered breathing difficulties and multiple organ failure.

She suggested that she may have become infected after touching her face with a glove during the process of taking off protective gear after treating a repatriated missionary.

She was scheduled to start receiving the experimental anti-Ebola drug ZMapp after Spain managed to obtain some of the drug, which is in extremely short supply worldwide, a spokesman for Madrid’s regional health agency confirmed.

Overnight on Thursday seven others voluntarily presented themselves for quarantine, including two beauticians who had been in contact with the infected nurse when she went for a leg wax.

The others quarantined included medical and ambulance staff who had treated her when she was admitted into her local hospital in Alcorcon on Monday as well as Javier Limon, the husband of the infected nurse.

None of them have yet shown symptoms of the Ebola virus.

More than 80 others are being monitored by health authorities for symptoms of Ebola and have been told to stay in their homes.

Ebola screening test: questionnaire explained

We look at how the checks will work as new screening measures are being introduced at major aiports as part of efforts to protect against the spread of Ebola

What is enhanced screening?

The government has announced the passengers travelling from countries in West Africa which are suffering the current Ebola outbreak will face extra screening when they enter Britain.

Where is it taking place?

Passengers travelling into the London airports of Heathrow and Gatwick, and through Eurostar terminals may face enhanced screening.

Will I be screened?

If you have travelled from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea you will face more checks. Immigration staff will ask about recent history and contacts and onward travel arrangements. There are no direct flights to Britain from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea –the three countries affected by Ebola – but it is possible to come here via other countries, such as by getting a flight to Brussels, then coming to London via Eurostar.

Airport officials will focus on questioning those who bought tickets out of the affected countries. Others may be quizzed on whether they have been in any of those countries, or in contact with those suspected of having Ebola, or whether they have any possible symptoms.

Will there be medical checks?

If there is sufficient concern, medical staff will be one hand to carry out a health assessment.

Passengers travelling from West Africa will also be given advice on what to do should they develop symptoms later.

Border staff are also looking for passengers suffering from fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat or rash.

Are airports considering temperature screening?

Although America and South Africa are currently checking temperatures at the border, the Government has decided that it is unnecessary and is unlikely to pick up many cases. However they say they will review the situation.

Temperature entry screening in the UK is not recommended by the World Health Organisation .

Why has screening been introduced now?

The Government says it has kept the situation under review, and acted on new advice from the Chief Medical Officer.

What arrangements were in place until now?

Those leaving the affected regions - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – are already screened for symptoms of Ebola before they depart.

Are people in the UK at risk from Ebola?

Ebola can only be transmitted through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal. As such, the risk to the general UK population remains very low.

Is there a public health risk from a person with Ebola coming into the country?

As the crisis continues it is looking increasingly likely that we will see cases of Ebola imported into Britan.

The World Health Organisation has said new cases in Europe are 'unavoidable' and the Foreign Secretry Philip Hammond has warned that the disease 'knows no borders.'

If you’re on a flight with someone with Ebola what is the risk to you?

You cannot catch Ebola through social contact or by travelling on a plane with someone who is infected, without direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.

Cabin crew identifying a sick passenger with suspicion of infectious disease on board, as well as ground staff receiving the passenger at the destination, would follow the International Air Transport Association guidelines for suspected communicable diseases.

Eurozone recession is biggest risk to UK, says George Osborne

Chancellor says 'serious clouds are gathering on the horizon' for the global economy

The threat of a triple-dip recession in the eurozone poses the biggest risk to the UK and global economy, George Osborne has warned.

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting, the Chancellor said "serious clouds were gathering on the horizon" for the global economy, and a third recession since the financial crisis for the 18-nation bloc would hit UK growth.

"We have a set of external shocks from the conflicts in the Middle East, the Ukrainian [crisis] to the horrific disease of Ebola in West Africa, which are increasing uncertainty. But most seriously, the biggest risk to the global economy at the moment and certainly the biggest external risk to the UK is the risk of the eurozone falling back into recession and into crisis," he said.

Mr Osborne's comments came amid a slew of poor economic data on Friday that suggested Europe was slowing down. UK construction figures showed that output contracted 3.9pc in August, while French industrial production stagnated and reports emerged that Germany's central bank would cut its official growth forecast next week.

The gloomy data hit stock markets on Friday[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/marketreport/11153756/FTSE-100-correction-more-than-a-dip-as-Europe-stares-into-abyss.html] . Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index fell 1.18pc, or 76 points, to 6,356. while Germany's DAX index dropped 1.96pc, or 176.7 points, to 8,828.

The Washington-based Fund's annual healthcheck of the global economy showed the UK would be the fastest growing economy this year, with expected growth of 3.2pc in 2014. However, it downgraded its estimates for the global economy and the eurozone.

The Chancellor said it would be unwise to "rest on my laurels" as the eurozone remained Britain's single biggest trading partner, and repeated his comments on Thursday that the UK recovery was at a critical juncture[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11154749/Eurozone-recession-is-biggest-risk-to-UK-says-George-Osborne.html].

"We've seen the growth forecast not just of Italy and France, but also Germany, cut back this year. Unemployment remains 11pc in the euro area, which is now close to double the UK's unemployment rate. This is a weak position for these European economies from which to weather further deterioration in our economic performance.

"The UK is not immune to this turbulence, 40pc of our exports go to the eurozone, and manufacturing [data is] showing output beginning to fall. The British Chambers of Commerce in Britain have warned of a fall in export growth this autumn, and indeed today we've got volatile figures on construction in the UK."

Mr Osborne said Britain was not "powerless when faced with these external risks". Lowering taxes for business, cutting welfare and encouraging more people into work would ensure the UK remained competitive, he said.

The IMF believes there is around a 40pc chance that the eurozone could slip back into recession over the next year.

Mr Osborne said it was critical that growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy, remained robust.

"Without the strength of the German economy the European situation would have been a lot worse," said Mr Osborne.

"Perhaps the issue that gives the greatest cause for concern at the moment are the German data in the sense that we know about the weakness of some of the other economies. Germany has been the exception, and we want it to remain that. But there has been some surprisingly weak German data [and] there's no doubt that they've been more affected than others have been by the situation in Ukraine and resulting sanctions."

The Chancellor also raised doubts over the IMF's call for governments to raise public spending on infrastructure, which the Fund claimed would "pay for itself" in the current environment of low borrowing costs.

However, Mr Osborne said that while he supports proposals by the G20 for governments to support infrastructure initiatives by backing projects led by the private sector, he insisted there was no such thing as a "free lunch".

"When it comes to investment in capital, I would question whether there is such a thing as a free lunch here. It's a fashionable theory, often by people who just want to spend more money in all circumstances. Things needs to be paid for, governments have to show they can credibly pay for things, and I'm all for spending more on capital and transport infrastructure, but I think you have to make savings in your budget to afford those," he said.

Ebola is a global economic crisis and requires a global response

In a worst-case scenario, where Ebola spreads to Western nations, we could be talking about a new global recession

No director could satisfy the new-look regulators

Western governments have been disgracefully slow to wake up to the threat posed by West Africa’s Ebola epidemic. Ebola was never an exclusively African problem; from the start, it was a global one. And it has always demanded an international response, not just for reasons of compassion, but also out of naked self-interest. It may seem insensitive to cite these wider interests in providing assistance given the scale of the tragedy on the ground, but if they help instruct a more effective approach, it can only be for the good.

We know from experience that pandemics will frequently have deeply negative economic consequences. This has actually got very little to do with the direct impact of the virus itself. Much more important is the effect on behaviour, the fear factor if you like, and the aversion response it triggers.

Already we are seeing the early signs in reduced international travel and cancelled trade, never mind the direct consequences for already fragile African economies. Shares in travel companies and airlines have taken big hits this week.

The World Bank quantifies these negative financial impacts at $32.6bn (£20.2bn) for the immediately affected region alone, and that assumes containment by the end of the year. If containment is slower, the numbers are plainly going to be much bigger. And in a worst-case scenario, where the disease spreads more widely, taking in Western nations, we could be talking about a new global recession. One health expert in Washington describes it as the worst threat to global health since Aids. It’s hard to disagree. The outbreak has occurred at a point when the world economy is already looking vulnerable. It needs further shocks like a hole in the head.

The longer international action is delayed, the more expensive dealing with the epidemic becomes. This is one of those instances where relatively small amounts of investment in African healthcare and infrastructure could save the West incalculable costs further down the line. Rarely is the case for overseas aid made as strongly as this.

By the by, it has also given that almost forgotten institution, the World Bank, a new lease of life. Dr Jim Yong Kim, the bank’s president, has been leading from the front at the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting in mobilising the international response and providing some of the funds needed to contain the problem.

The renewed sense of purpose Ebola has given the bank is perhaps just as well, for in other respects, Dr Kim finds his staff in open mutiny. The cause is a root and branch restructuring, including a substantial cost-cutting programme. It hardly needs saying that the troops, grown fat and complacent on their tax-free Washington salaries and perks, don’t much like it. At a “town hall” meeting earlier this week, Dr Kim was confronted by one angry staffer with the complaint that cuts to the travel budget were forcing employees to fly at inconvenient times, thereby interfering with their “breakfasts”. Such hardship is apparently unknown at the World Bank – a curiosity, to put it mildly, for an institution committed to helping poorer nations with development. Whatever next? A ban on business class?

In a world of plentiful finance, even for Third World countries, it has been increasingly hard to figure out the point of the World Bank, other than that of keeping its government-nominated placees in comfortable semi-retirement. Dr Kim is doing a good job at reinventing the bank for the modern age, but it’s small thanks to his mollycoddled lifers.

</br>The moment bankers asked for a bail-out, they essentially surrendered their right to self-governance. The regulatory crackdown that has occurred since is regarded by many as not just deserved, but thoroughly necessary. Some would go further still.

Even so, when directors start thinking of resigning for fear of the presumption of guilt should some kind of regulatory infringement occur, you have to ask yourself whether things have not gone just a little bit too far. This is not supervision, but regulatory overkill.

The bank in question is HSBC, Britain’s largest by far. This week it was reported that two of its non-executive directors were preparing to quit, in part because of new rules affecting senior bankers.

These rules, still out to consultation, make directors liable if it is shown that insufficient steps have been taken to prevent regulatory breaches. Some bankers used to think of themselves as “masters of the universe”, but no director can ever have the kind of omnipotent knowledge that now seems to be demanded by regulators. For many, it’s simply not going to be worth the risk of serving on the boards of complex, international banks. Oversight and governance will be much the poorer for it.

It is, of course, quite unlikely that in practice any banker would be jailed under the new rules, but that’s beside the point. To be caught up in interminable legal proceedings over alleged liability will be punishment enough. Bankers escaped largely unscathed when their organisations ran onto the rocks during the crisis of 2008-9. The new law is meant to satisfy demands for more effective retribution. Yet if there are no directors left to hold to account, it’s hard to see how it helps.

In any case, the idea that the crackdown might lead to resignations feeds into a wider narrative of growing risk aversion among bankers which is likely in time to prove quite damaging to economic growth. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, has highlighted the dangers before. Last summer, he referred to “an observable danger of disproportionate risk aversion creeping into decision-making … as individuals, facing uncertainty as to what may be criticised with hindsight, and perceiving a zero tolerance of error, seek to protect themselves and the firm from future censure”.

Barely a week goes by without banks suffering another record-breaking fine or compensation order. It’s open season, with the banks regarded as a ready source of revenue for hungry attorneys and regulators. In New York, the settlements are helping fund an upgrade to the subway system.

So relentless are the penalties – another lorry load of them in connection with alleged forex market rigging is expected shortly – that some banks have started to regard them as a more or less permanent operating cost, a bit like payroll taxes.

At the last count, the total amount paid out in fines and compensation had topped $130bn. At the same time, new “know your customer” requirements to counter terrorism and ensure compliance with trade sanctions are leading many banks to withdraw from certain lines of business altogether, disrupting cross-border money flows.

You might argue that it serves them right. Yet if it only ends up damaging trade, commerce and access to finance, you have to wonder who the real losers are.

Ebola hoax causes scare on US Airways flight

A passenger was escorted off a flight by officers in protective suits after he sneezed and claimed to have Ebola

The American passenger flying from Philadelphia to the Dominican Republic was forced to leave the plane after sneezing and yelling: “I have Ebola!”, while the remaining 255 passengers were made to stay on board for two hours.

The unnamed passenger, who doesn’t have Ebola, was escorted off the plane by officials as he declared: “I ain’t from Africa”. The man had reportedly been sneezing and coughing, which are said to be early signs of having the deadly virus, throughout the four-hour journey to Punta Cana.

A video captured by one of the other passengers shows four officers dressed in protective Hazmat (hazardous materials) suits boarding the flight, while a flight attendant tries to reassure fliers that the situation “looks worse than it really is”. She adds that, having worked in the airline industry for about 30 years, she was sure “the man who has said this [joke] is an idiot”.

Passengers sat near the man covered their faces and those filming the incident yelled at him while he was forced to remove his luggage from the overhead lockers and leave the plane. He was detained at Punta Cana International Airport where he underwent extensive medical checks and was interviewed by airport officials before it was confirmed he did not have Ebola. He is believed to have the flu, according to Walter Zemialkowski, the airport’s director of terminals and maintenance, the Daily Mail reports[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2787292/Hazmat-team-rushed-meet-US-plane-Dominican-Republic-passenger-sneezed-yelled-I-Ebola-poor-taste-joke.html] .

The man’s passport did not indicate he had made any recent trips to Africa, Alberto Smith, the director of operations at Punta Cana airport, told Acento.com.do[http://acento.com.do/2014/actualidad/8182163-tengo-ebola-grito-pasajero-y-provoco-panico-en-el-aeropuerto-de-punta-cana/] .

“The closest he came to the continent was in 2012 when he visited Europe” said Mr Smith. “It was a false alarm set off by the passenger who is slightly unbalanced. [He] did it for attention.”

The scare follows US President Barack Obama’s recent call for an extra level of screening at five major US airports[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11151002/US-airports-screen-for-Ebola-in-attempt-to-limit-virus.html] with a view to catch any travellers from Ebola-affected countries who may be carrying the disease.

British authorities said yesterday they would introduce "enhanced" screening of travellers for Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11152997/Ebola-how-the-UK-will-prepare-screening-for-travellers.html] airports and Eurostar rail terminals.

Prime Minister David Cameron's office said passengers arriving from West Africa would be quizzed about their travels and contacts.

A British man suspected of having Ebola died in Macedonia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11152489/Ebola-crisis-British-man-dies-of-disease-in-Macedonia.html], and a second man was believed to be fighting the disease, officials reported yesterday.

The disease has killed at least 3,800 people in West Africa with no signs of abating. The presidents of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the countries hardest hit in the outbreak, are appealing to the World Bank for more help for their nations.

Ebola: David Cameron defends accusation of a shambles

The Prime Minister has defended the Government's plans to introduce screening against Ebola at some airports and railway terminals

Plans to introduce screening for Ebola at airports descended into chaos on Friday amid accusations that the handling of the matter has been “shambolic”.

The Prime Minister was forced to defend the Government after a string of public health experts criticised the scheme, with one saying it was “a complete waste of time”.

Health officials on Friday were unable to provide basic information about the plans, and could not even say when the measures will be brought in.

Downing Street said that screening will be put in place "as fast as possible" but highlighted the fact it has taken five days for similar measures to be implemented at US airports.

The night before the Government had said “enhanced screening” will be brought in at Gatwick and Heathrow airports and at the Eurostar terminal in London.

But within hours a spokesman for Gatwick said the airport had not been contacted about the plan, which involves questioning passengers about where they have come from, and whether they have suffered from symptoms which could suggest Ebola.

During a constituency visit on Friday morning, David Cameron defended the Government decision, which he had been taken following advice from health officials.

It followed the decision by the United States to introduce screening, with temperature checks on passengers.

The decision to introduce questionnaires for passengers from some countries followed confusion over whether Britain would introduce the measure, with conflicting messages coming from Chancellor George Osborne, the Department of Health and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

Until Thursday evening, health officials had insisted the move was unnecessary.

On Friday morning, Mr Cameron said: “What we are focusing on as a country is taking action right across the board.”

"To deal with this problem at source, we’re making a bigger contribution than almost any other country in West Africa to help deal with this crisis at it's source.

“Quite rightly we are taking all the steps we can to keep our own people safe. We listened to the medical advice and we acted on it to offer appropriate advice.”

The Prime Minister said the changes in policy followed new advice from medical advisors.

"Quite rightly we’re taking all the steps we can to keep our own people safe here in the UK and what we do is we listen to the medical advice, we act on that advice and that’s why we’re introducing these screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.”

Checks are to take place at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar terminals, but a spokesman for Gatwick said on Friday that the airport had not been given any instructions about how the screening should be carried out.

"We've not had anything at all," he said. "We're still waiting for Public Health England (to let us know)."

Professor George Griffin, chair of the Government's Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, said he was surprised that screening was being introduced after being led to believe it would not be.

Prof Griffin told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: "These decisions are very, very difficult to make.

"It is somewhat surprising after I think we were all led to believe that the decision was not to screen.

"Clearly there may have been more evidence which we were not privy to.

"Of course one of the big things is that the United States has started screening and it might have been an idea to bring things into parallel with the United States." He added: "Most of the scientific community feel that the instrument is very, very blunt."

David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the screening was a "complete waste of time".

"Firstly, there won't be anyone coming from these (West African) countries because all direct flights have been cancelled," he said. "Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption.

"Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control when they arrive at the airport?

"People will have been screened before getting on flights and may seem to be healthy if they're not yet showing symptoms.”

World Health Organisation (WHO) director of strategy Dr Chris Dye said it was unlikely the screening would detect anyone with Ebola coming into the UK.

"The chances of someone with Ebola turning up in the UK is relatively small," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

"The chance of someone turning up in the UK showing symptoms of Ebola at the time is even smaller.

"It potentially could prevent a few cases but I suspect the more important impact is that it will hugely increase awareness."

Downing Street said the tests will be introduced for passengers travelling from the main Ebola-affected regions in west Africa - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - where the death toll has reportedly risen to nearly 4,000.

The screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, with whom they have been in contact, and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel.

Contingency planning is also under way, including a national exercise to make sure the country is fully prepared.

But last night a spokesman for Public Health England was unable to say when the screening will be introduced, only saying that details would be disclosed soon.

MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the Government was right to take the decision, but said the handling of the matter, and lack of information was “shambolic”.

The Labour MP said: "We need targeted, enhanced screening to reassure the public and to relieve pressure on the Border Force.

"As to whether more should have been done sooner on this matter, the time for an inquiry is not now, but we must learn lessons from this delay in action."

The introduction of screening comes as a Briton died in Macedonia with symptoms similar to Ebola, although health officials yesterday said it was "highly unlikely" the death was caused by the virus.

A spokesman for Heathrow said the airport was working with Public Health England to implement the measures.

Ebola UK: everything you need to know about the crisis

The NHS claims it is ready to deal with Ebola in Britain. But should we be screening flights or sending more help to West Africa? Here is what you need to know:

What is Ebola?

Ebola virus disease (previously known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a rare but severe disease which is caused by Ebola virus.

It can result in uncontrolled bleeding, causing damage to the patient’s vital organs. It was first recognised in 1976 and has caused sporadic outbreaks since in several African countries

The virus is initially transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission through contact with blood and body fluids.

Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat or rash.

Where is the current outbreak?

Since March 2014 there has been a large, widespread outbreak affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria and Senegal are also affected by imported cases. Latest information is available from WHO.

The virus has killed more than 3,400 people and infected more than 7,200.

Are people in the UK at risk from Ebola?

Ebola can only be transmitted through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal.

As such, the risk to the general UK population remains very low.

The risk to UK travellers of contracting Ebola is very low and can be mitigated by simple precautions such as maintaining good hygiene and keeping away from infected areas and people. There is a higher risk for humanitarian healthcare workers exposed to patients.

Specific advice has been prepared for humanitarian and health care workers

Is there a public health risk from a person with Ebola coming into the country?

As the crisis continues it is looking increasingly likely that we will see cases of Ebola imported into Britan. The World Health Organisation has said new cases in Europe are 'unavoidable' and the Foreign Secretry Philip Hammond has warned that the disease 'knows no borders.' Public Health England this week admitted there was a 'reak risk' the disease could enter the country.

Doctors have been told to take a detailed travel history of any patients with a fever.

The Deparment of Health has written to clinicians warning: "It is unlikely but not impossible that people infected in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia could arrive in the UK while incubating the disease, and then develop symptoms after their return."

However the Government has said that Britain has robust, well developed and well tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases.

Four major NHS hospitals in England have now been identified as units to take patients with Ebola if the need arises.

Currently, just one unit has been established, in the Royal Free Hospital in north London, which treated William Pooley, a British nurse who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone in August.

Royal Liverpool University Hospital NHS foundation trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation trust and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals foundation trust have now been identified as hospitals which could take Ebola patients if the virus reaches the UK.

What steps are UK airports taking to stop Ebola?

On Thurdsay the government has announced the passengers travelling from countries in West Africa which are suffering the current Ebola outbreak will face extra screening when they enter Britain.

Where is it taking place?

Passengers travelling into the London airports of Heathrow and Gatwick, and through Eurostar terminals may face enhanced screening.

Will I be screened?

If you have travelled from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea you will face more checks. Immigration staff will ask about recent history and contacts and onward travel arrangements. There are no direct flights to Britain from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea –the three countries affected by Ebola – but it is possible to come here via other countries, such as by getting a flight to Brussels, then coming to London via Eurostar.

Airport officials will focus on questioning those who bought tickets out of the affected countries. Others may be quizzed on whether they have been in any of those countries, or in contact with those suspected of having Ebola, or whether they have any possible symptoms.

Why has screening been introduced now?

The Government says it has kept the situation under review, and acted on new advice from the Chief Medical Officer.

What arrangements were in place before?

Those leaving the affected regions - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – are already screened for symptoms of Ebola before they depart.

If you’re on a flight with someone with Ebola what is the risk to you?

You cannot catch Ebola through social contact or by travelling on a plane with someone who is infected, without direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.

Cabin crew identifying a sick passenger with suspicion of infectious disease on board, as well as ground staff receiving the passenger at the destination, would follow the International Air Transport Association guidelines for suspected communicable diseases.

Why don’t we use body temperature scanners at airports?

Entry screening in the UK is not recommended by WHO. Entry screening would require the UK to screen every returning traveller, as people could return to the UK from an affected country through any port of entry. That would be huge numbers of low risk people.

What do the experts say about screening?

Many public health experts are not convinced that screening would stop the virus entering the country.

David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the Government plans to question travellers were a "complete waste of time".

"Firstly, there won't be anyone coming from these (West African) countries because all direct flights have been cancelled," he said. "Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption.

"Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control when they arrive at the airport?

"People will have been screened before getting on flights and may seem to be healthy if they're not yet showing symptoms.

"And then what will they do if they think they do have Ebola? Lock them up in solitary confinement?"

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading said: "The sorts of tests that can be done on large numbers by non-doctors would not be likely to stop an infected person from entering the UK.

“The screening that is being proposed in the US would not have caught Thomas Eric Duncan as he arrived in Dallas - he had only recently caught the virus and did not have any visible symptoms yet. Blood tests over several days are the only surefire way to detect Ebola, and I do not think turning airports into isolation wards would make us much safer or happier.”

What do the politicians say?

Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has warned that it is possible that someone with Ebola could enter Britain but added the health service was prepared.

"Well this is clearly one of the most serious global health emergencies of recent years. Our first priority as the Government is to make sure the British people are safe,” he said.

"It is now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK by one route or another but we have very, very good plans in place.

Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary said on Thursday that screening is unnecessary and the Government would continue to follow the advice of the World Health Orgainisation.

"The World Health Organisation advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure that people who are leaving are not infected, rather than trying to screen people who arrive," he said, soon before the Government changed its policy.

"At the moment there are no direct flights from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom. It is very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the United Kingdom.

"It is particularly difficult because the symptoms may not be obvious for a number of weeks after you actually catch the disease. It is not straightforward."

Philip Hammond the Foreign Secreatry, has warned that the disease ‘knows no borders.’

“We now need, as the secretary has said, the wider international community to step up to the plate and deliver that additional resource, not just money, but trained medical and clinical personnel to lead that effort on the ground.

“We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.

"The disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders. We have to get ahead of this disease, but if we get ahead of it, if we rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it. We know how to do this. It is not complicated to do. It just requires a large focus of resource and effort to deliver it.”

Keith Vaz, MP, the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee has called for temperature screening at airports.

“What we need to ensure is that the public feel there is confidence at our borders and that means, we need to put in screening at our borders in order to give the public that confidence” he said.

“We don’t want to deal with this after the event just because we have the best health service in the world. We don’t want to test it to see if it can cope with Ebola.

“What we need to do is understand those who police our borders are not health experts, they are immigration officers.”

How is Britain helping the crisis in West Africa:

More than 750 British troops will be sent to Sierra Leone along with three helicopters and a medical support ship.

Troops will deploy to West Africa as early as next week, where British military engineers and medics are already overseeing the building of an Ebola hospital.

The troops will include soldiers of the Royal Scots Borderers (1 SCOTS) based in Co Down, Northern Ireland.

The government has committed £125 million to tackle the disease.

Medical leaders have appealed for NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics to volunteer to treat Ebola victims in Sierra Leone.

If we get a case of Ebola in the UK, would we see an outbreak similar to West Africa?

While the UK might see cases of imported Ebola, this is extremely unlikely to result in a large outbreak in the UK. England has a world class health care system with robust infection control systems and processes and disease control systems which have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases

Is there a treatment for Ebola?

There is no specific vaccine or medicine has yet been proven to be effective against Ebola. There is no cure for this disease, and antibiotics are not effective.

In some instances, clinicians treating individuals with Ebola may source and decide to use an experimental drug, such as Zmapp.

Will Pooley was treated with Zmapp and survived, but others who have taken the drug have died. It could be that they were given the medication too late.

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care, which may include rehydration with intravenous fluids

How worried should Britain be about the Ebola outbreak?

The disease has devastated Liberia and Sierra Leone - but we are far better prepared

An African villager arrives home after a trip through the jungle, nursing an animal bite. A few days later, we see the same man, sweating and feverish, submitting himself to the care of local doctors. Gradually, the circle widens: the man’s wife, his friends, the doctors themselves, all start to display symptoms. Cut to an international departure lounge, where a Western businessman or holidaymaker is knocking back paracetamol, sure that this nagging flu will have cleared up by the time he gets home.

The fear of pandemics is one that haunts our culture – and it is one that has been given new life by the events in West Africa, where the Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] virus has claimed almost 4,000 lives. In keeping with the horror-movie narrative, the disease is starting to creep out of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, with cases reported in Spain and America. Yesterday saw the death of the first suspected British victim, in Macedonia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11152853/Ebola-crisis-disease-may-already-be-in-Britain-as-man-dies-on-business-trip.html], and the announcement by the Government that it is tightening screening procedures at airports. On Wednesday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, warned that Ebola may become “the next Aids”[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11152727/Ebola-compared-to-Aids-epidemic-by-top-American-health-official.html] – a killer not of thousands, but of millions.

Yet those who have seen this movie before may also feel they know how it ends. When SARS – severe acute respiratory syndrome – appeared in Asia in 2002, we were told that it had a 25 per cent chance of killing “tens of millions”. There were calls for borders to be locked down, and new arrivals showing symptoms to be locked up. But despite a spike in sales of surgical masks, and the hurried cancellation of thousands of holidays to Hong Kong and Thailand, the disease ended up killing only 775 people worldwide.

It was a similar story in 2009 with swine flu. The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, warned that 65,000 Britons could die, and the government duly spent more than £1.2 billion to prepare for the viral apocalypse. Yet while the disease was incredibly contagious, infecting millions worldwide, it turned out to be relatively mild. In Britain, only 457 people died – a significant number, but 25 times fewer than the 12,000 who are carried away by normal seasonal flu every year. To make matters worse, some experts later claimed that the £424 million spent on stockpiling 40 million doses of Tamiflu had essentially been wasted: its average effect, they said, was to shorten the disease’s duration from seven days to 6.3 (a finding which its manufacturer, Roche, disputed).

With the Ebola virus, too, there are reasons to believe that the impact in Britain will be relatively limited – which is why, to its credit, the Government appears to be resisting calls to panic. True, the virus is not only horrifically nasty, liquefying the internal organs of those who catch it, but devastatingly effective.

Of those who catch it, the overwhelming majority will develop symptoms – and of those, most will die. There is as yet no cure, and no vaccine. In addition, the disease itself has an incubation period of 21 days: plenty of time for it to sneak into the country aboard a jumbo jet.

Ebola’s strengths are, however, outweighed by its weaknesses. If you get it, you’re in very big trouble, but the odds of that are quite small. It is not, unlike the pathogens of our worst nightmares, airborne: it is spread via infected bodily fluids, which have to enter the body via the eyes or mouth or a cut or wound. Moreover, it is quite fragile, meaning that it does not survive long outside of its host – and can be defeated by the simple act of washing one’s hands.

As a result, the “R0” figure of the current outbreak – the technical term for the number of further victims that one sufferer can be expected to infect in turn – is somewhere around 2. That makes it a much slower spreader than Sars, smallpox or the strain of Spanish flu that killed tens of millions of people in the wake of the First World War.

All of this means we can be reasonably confident that Western health systems will contain any infection relatively easily. The disease has only escaped into the wild in Spain because of a series of avoidable errors: the nurse at the centre of the outbreak was apparently “fobbed off with paracetamol” when she tried to present herself; she was transported and treated by medics who weren’t wearing protective gear; and even when the right hazard suits were procured, the sleeves turned out to be too short. If Spain’s health system, or ours, were on a proper “war footing”, the chances are that we would be able to detect and quarantine patients quickly enough to prevent the disease spreading. The panic that would follow any wider outbreak would also do much of the authorities’ work for them: the economy might take a knock as we all huddled at home, twitchily washing our hands, but the opportunities for infection would be limited.

Ebola is, above all, a disease of poverty – just like measles, which kills thousands in the developing world but hardly anyone in the West. It has struck Liberia and Sierra Leone so savagely because these states, and their health systems, were barely functioning to begin with. If the outbreak had begun even in say, Rwanda, it would have been halted relatively easily. As it is, containment has been hampered by chronic shortages of medical personnel; of facilities, equipment and medication; even of faith in the efficacy of Western medicine.

There was also, admittedly, a failure by the international community to take the outbreak seriously enough, quickly enough. The world, says Jim Kim, president of the World Bank, “failed miserably” in its response – at the cost of billions of dollars and thousands of lives. Now, belatedly, the international effort is grinding into gear. American troops are on the ground; Britain has despatched a hospital ship, RFA Argus, and is giving £125 million to Sierra Leone to contain the outbreak.

In short, the likelihood is that even if Ebola does become the new HIV/Aids, then it will, like HIV, be a blight on Africa rather than the world. But the West should still do everything in its power to stamp it out. First, for the obvious humanitarian reasons. Second, to prevent the region from becoming further impoverished and destabilised. And third, and perhaps most important, out of basic self-interest.

The truth is that with Ebola, bird flu and swine flu and all the others, we have dodged a bullet. None of these pathogens is both deadly enough and contagious enough to wreak apocalyptic havoc. But the longer such viruses circulate, the more chance there is of one of them mutating in precisely such a fashion – of a strain of swine flu emerging that kills more than a fraction of its victims, or a variant of Ebola that can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes.

To make matters worse, millions of people in both Africa and Asia are living in precisely the circumstances that make such a genetic leap more likely. Human agriculture and settlements are reaching into jungles and rainforests that may be rife with unknown contagions – such as Ebola itself, whose natural home is the fruit bat. Meanwhile, in crowded towns and villages, millions of people live cheek by jowl with animals, enabling diseases to be transferred between them. The H5N1 strain of avian flu, which has killed 375 of the 630 humans confirmed to have contracted it, first appeared in the Kanchanaburi province of Thailand: one of the first to die was Kaptan Boonmanuch, a six-year-old boy who carried a sick chicken home from his uncle’s farm and died less than two weeks later, his lungs choked with fluid.

Globalisation has made pandemics vastly more likely. Researchers in America have shown that the prevalence of flu precisely follows the volume of domestic air traffic, as infected people carry the disease from state to state. Worldwide, the number of passenger flights per year is expected to quintuple from the current three billion by 2050 – meaning billions more unsuspecting virus carriers. Global travel also gives diseases from different parts of the planet the chance to meet, mingle and mutate, potentially combining their deadliest traits.

At the same time, however, our best defence against infection is the prosperity that globalisation brings – the prosperity that gives people proper sanitation and hygiene, in the form of clean beds, clean water and clean food. Economic progress also gives us the technological tools to track outbreaks via email chatter or early warning data. As for those of us in Britain, Ebola isn’t the end of the world. But it’s certainly a reminder of what a risky place it is, and how vigilant we need to remain.

Ebola crisis: disease may already be in Britain as man dies on business trip

The death of a businessman in Macedonia from suspected Ebola has led to fears that the disease may already be in Britain

Ebola may already be in Britain, it was feared on Thursday night, after a businessman who had travelled to Macedonia became the first Briton to die from the disease.

Macedonian officials confirmed that the 57-year-old, who has not been named, had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding and that his condition had deteriorated rapidly.

"These are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient," said Dr. Jovanka Kostovska of the health ministry's commission for infectious diseases.

A second man, 72, who had travelled from London with the victim on October 2 has also been isolated and the hotel they were staying in the Macdeonian capital of Skopje has been sealed off.

Sampling has been sent to Germany to confirm the cause of death but the disease has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which means the dead man could have been infected in Britain.

Officials said he had not travelled to any country caught up in the outbreak before arriving in Macedonia, but he may have been making his way to Nigeria.

Before his death, the victim had been complaining of a severe stomach ache and had stayed in his hotel for three days. At around 3pm yesterday he was taken to hospital, but he died just 90 minutes after being admitted.

The ambulance crew who took him to hospital have also been isolated.

Elsewhere in Europe, a Prague hospital said it was testing a 56-year-old Czech man with symptoms of the Ebola virus, while the health of an infected Spanish nurse worsened in Madrid, where a total of seven people are in isolation.

On Thursday Downing Street announced that enhanced screening will be brought in at the London airports of Heathrow and Gatwick and at Eurostar Terminals.

The Government, which has up until now insisted additional checks were not necessary, changed guidance following new advice from the Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies.

Under new guidelines, people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be questioned about travel arrangements and recent contacts. They may also face medical checks.

A Downing Street spokesman said: "These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100 per cent protection from non-symptomatic cases.

“It is important to remember that the overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low, and the UK has some of the best public health protection systems in the world with well-developed and well-tested systems for managing infectious diseases when they arise. Contingency planning is also underway including a national exercise and wider resilience training to ensure the UK is fully prepared.”

Dame Sally said that 'further measures' were necessary to protect the public.

“In view of the concern about the growing number of cases, it is right to consider what further measures could be taken, to ensure that any potential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible.

“We remain alert and prepared, should an Ebola case be identified here.”

However Britain is not yet following the lead of America and South Africa by bringing in temperature checks to detect passengers suffering from fevers.

And experts warned that passengers are unlikely to be truthful if they had visited infected areas.

Professor David Mabey, a physician specialising in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said he believed that questionnaires asking passengers about their recent travel, were a waste of time".

He said: "I think people will lie. They don't want to be subjected to the inconvenience. Why would people tell the truth?

"If last week your aunt died of Ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday?”

Professor Julian Hiscox, from the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said public information was key to prevent the spread of Ebola.

"What we need to see is information handed to people as they step off planes and a phone number people can call if they start to develop symptoms.

"The main thing is not to panic about this or to drive people coming to the UK underground.”

Prof David Evans, Professor of Virology, University of Warwick, said that enhanced screening of inbound passengers was the most that can be done 'to balance practicality and effectiveness with the need to reassure the UK public that their health is being protected.'

However Dr Ben Neuman, Lecturer in Virology, University of Reading, said: "I don't think there is a strong scientific case that airport screening will help keep Ebola out of the UK, but it’s a step that will reassure some people."

Professor Peter Piot, who was part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, said that more European cases were ‘unavoidable’

The Foreign Office said it was still working to confirm that the men were British.

On Thursday night former foreign secretary David Miliband said there is no question that the West has been slow in its response to the Ebola crisis.

Mr Miliband, who is in Sierra Leone with the International Rescue Committee which he heads, called on the "big guns" of the world to lend more support.

"There's no question that there's been a tardiness, a slowness, a lateness of response,” he told Channel 4 news.

Dr Marc Sprenger, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said current models predicted between 500,000 and 1,500,000 cases in West Africa by the end of January if no action is taken.

He said while official figures put the number of cases so far at around 8,000, in reality the collapse of West African health care meant the true scale was unknown and could be two-and-a-half times higher.

He told the Telegraph that good exit screening from affected regions was higher priority than entry screening at British airports.

He said: “First of all you need to have exit screening. If exit screening is well done, and the flight is not that long, then in fact it’s not necessary to have the person checked on arrival.

But while it may be simple to screen flights coming direct from West Africa, he said it would be far more difficult to track and screen connecting passengers.

And he warned they were of limited use. He said: “You only catch the people who have fever but a lot of people are in an incubation period and will develop later and become infectious.”

Travellers returning to Britain from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will face enhanced screening and potentially medical checks, Downing Street has announced

Enhanced Ebola screening will be brought in at Gatwick and Heathrow Airports as well as Eurostar terminals, Downing Street announced today.

The Government, which has up until now insisted additional checks were not necessary, changed guidance following advice from the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies.

Under new guidelines, people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be questioned about travel arrangements and recent contacts. They may also face medical checks.

A Downing Street spokesman said: "These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100 per cent protection from non-symptomatic cases.

“It is important to remember that the overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low, and the UK has some of the best public health protection systems in the world with well-developed and well-tested systems for managing infectious diseases when they arise. Contingency planning is also underway including a national exercise and wider resilience training to ensure the UK is fully prepared.”

Dame Sally said that 'further measures' were necessary to protect the public.

“Although the risk to the UK remains low, in view of the concern about the growing number of cases, it is right to consider what further measures could be taken, to ensure that any potential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible.

"Rapid access to healthcare services by someone infected with Ebola is not only important for their health but also key to reducing the risk of transmission to others.

“We remain alert and prepared, should an Ebola case be identified here. We have well tested processes in place but anything that means that people are more likely to present early are to be welcomed.”

The Government has been divided on screening. Today George Osborne, the Chancellor, said travellers entering the UK would be tested for Ebola if medical experts say it is necessary but Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said policy should stay in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) advice which is only advising outgoing screening.

He said that the Government's policy on screening was in line with the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

"The World Health Organisation advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure that people who are leaving are not infected, rather than trying to screen people who arrive," Mr Fallon added.

"At the moment there are no direct flights from Sierra Leone to the United Kingdom. It is very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the United Kingdom.

"It is particularly difficult because the symptoms may not be obvious for a number of weeks after you actually catch the disease. It is not straightforward."

The deadly virus has killed more than 3,400 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and infected more than 7,200.

Today Professor Peter Piot, who was part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, said that more European cases were ‘unavoidable’

Prof Piot, a director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he never believed an Ebola outbreak could have become so deadly.

"We will see other cases in Europe, this is unavoidable," he told BBC Breakfast. "People travel, people come back, people get infected in west Africa - volunteers. So we need to be prepared for more cases like this.”

Yesterday Keith Vaz MP, the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called for disease screening at airports after the US announced that that travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would face body temperature tests and enhanced questioning.

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary admitted that the disease ‘knows no borders’ while Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary said that it was “now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK.”

However despite the growing alarm, Public Health England said it would not be changing guidance to airports, where immigration staff are currently advised to take action only if passengers are showing visible signs of the disease.

Economists warned that the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa could lead to turmoil on the international financial markets on a on a greater scale than the SARS outbreak a decade ago.

On Wednesday, after a meeting of the government’s emergency committee, Cobra, it was announced that more than 750 British troops wold be sent to Sierra Leone along with three helicopters and a medical support ship.

Troops will deploy to West Africa as early as next week, where British military engineers and medics are already overseeing the building of an Ebola hospital.

Downing Street also announced that new posters will be placed in British airports with information for passengers on symptoms of Ebola and instructions to call a doctor if they become ill within three weeks. A 'national exercise' will also take place to 'eunsure the UK is fully prepared,' although no further details were made available.

Macedonian health officials say they cannot confirm cause of death until results come back from labororatory

Macedonian health officials said that the first Ebola-suspected death of a British citizen in Skopje is still to be confirmed or denied by a German laboratory in 48 hours.

Jovanka Kostovska, a senior ministry of health official told media late on Thursday that they still cannot confirm that the 56-year-old businessman, who arrived with another Briton to the capital Skopje, died from the deadly disease.

She said that some of his symptoms, including his high temperature of 37.4 degrees C, and the information that he often used alcohol, which can show a similar clinical picture with Ebola but may lead to another disease.

However, she said that many of his symptoms, including internal bleeding and sudden death after three days of suffering abdominal pain in the hotel room resemble Ebola symptoms.

Three days ago the Briton started complaining on abdominal pain, and refused to take any food in the hotel Super 8 in downtown Skopje where he stayed, but did not want to call the ambulance.

Early Thursday the victim’s condition worsened and the hotel staff called the emergency hospital. He was take to hospital with a temperature and died an hour after he was sent to the Skopje Clinic for Infective Diseases.

His companion, who was at the same hotel, was also admitted after getting similar symptoms on Thursday, while the other guests and hotel staff were evacuated and sent to medical tests and the hotel is closed.

“Though there is a big chance that this death was not about Ebola, we had to take all the operational measures until we get the preliminary results from a relevant international laboratory in Germany”, she told media in Macedonian capital.

Late on Thursday many police officers and medical teams dressed in special suits were surrounding the hotel situated in the very center of Skopje, near the historic Bitpazar quarter and the river Vardar.

FTSE 100 correction 'more than a dip' as Europe stares into abyss

Global stock selloff is 'more than a dip' as European markets 'step off the cliff' says Alastair McCaig, market Analyst from spread betting firm IG

The Global stock market selloff accelerated on Friday with the FTSE 100 index falling 91.56 points, or 1.4pc, to 6,340.2, it's lowest level in a year and 7.81pc below highs of 6,878 on May 14.

Gold, a shelter for investors in times of uncertainty, has surged during the past week by as much as 2.64pc, to $1,222.95 per ounce, as the Federal Reserve minutes hinted at delaying interest rate rises till later next year.

Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of investor anxiety known as the Vix or “fear index”, leapt more than 24pc.

"The FTSE 100 has broken through the support on its recent trading range and US traders have moved from the 'buy the dip' and 'risk on' commentary we heard earlier in the year, this is becoming more than just a dip," said Alastair McCaig, market analyst from IG.

"Going into the weekend with so much uncertainty in the air will only further fuel traders compulsion to get out of risky assets and it would take a miracle for the bulls to salvage anything today," added Jonathan Sudaria, from Capital Spreads.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by 334.97 points, or 1.97pc, to close at 16,659.25 last night as Wall Street feared the US economy would be dragged down by weakness in Europe and the rest of the world.. The price of Brent crude also collapsed to its lowest level in five years at $89.42 per barrel.

"European markets looks like they are staring over the edge and into the abyss, or may have even stepped off the cliff," added Mr McCaig as Ebola screening at UK airports and the discovery of new cases raised fears the deadly virus may have spread to the continent.

"European equities have plunged on the open as storm clouds gather over the global economy. Bad economic data is now being viewed as bad and the dovish signals from central banks are now being taken as a sign of weakness rather than a reason to ramp up equities," said Mr Sudaria.

In Germany the benchmark DAX index collapsed by 196 points, or 2.16pc, to 8809.83, bringing the falls for the week to more than 4pc.

Investors were concerned about the slowdown in the German economy as exports in August reported their biggest fall since January 2009 when the global economy was rocked following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The CAC 40 index of leading shares in France was also 63.9 points, or 1.5pc lower, at 4,076.27 by midday.

In London it was travel stocks which led the market lower on ebola fears, with TUI Travel down 7.34pc to 330.7p and Carnival the cruise ship operator falling 3.3pc to £21.93. Oil related stocks were also feeling the pain as African oil explorer Tullow Oil fell 5.6pc to 539p, and Weir the Scottish based manufacturer of industrial pumps used in the oil industry, was down 3.2pc to £22.26.

Ukip have their first elected MP in Clacton and they've given Labour one hell of a fright in Heywood & Middleton. The numbers are:

Clacton: Ukip 21,113 (60%), Conservatives 8,709 (25%), Labour (11%)

Heywood & Middleton: Labour 11,633 (41%), Ukip 11,016 (39%) Conservatives 3, 496 (12.3%)

It's a thumping defeat for the Conservatives – but a shattering victory for Labour. A percentage point increase on their 2010 showing in Heywood & Middleton, and in a seat that is only the 148th most Ukip-friendly. The question on Labour minds is: how will Ukip do in Great Grimsby, or Rotherham, both seats that Nigel Farage's party could take from them in May?

The Tory focus is now on Rochester & Strood, the 271st most Ukip-inclined seat as opposed to Clacton at N0. 1. If CCHQ can defeat Mark Reckless then they may be able to breathe a little easier – but there's a growing acceptance that a parliamentary presence for Ukip will be a fact of life, not just for the next eight months but for the forseeable future.

Both sides are out in force with their lines to take. "It underlines the scale of the challenge facing Labour," Douglas Alexander told the Today programme. "That's just put Ed Miliband closer to Downing Street," Grant Shapps said on the same programme later.

These soundbites feel awfully…familiar. Didn't their damp performance in the European elections "underline the scale of the challenge facing Labour"? Is there any reason to suspect the new variation on "Vote Ukip, Get Labour" will be any more effective than the last one? I wrote after the Scottish referendum that neither David Cameron or Ed Miliband seemed to have any real idea how to tackle one populist politician in the shape of Alex Salmond. They still don't seem to be any closer to working out how to contain Nigel Farage.

The PM shares something of the same attitude as his predecessor-but-one, Tony Blair, says Lord Richards. "There are bad things happening in the world and they would like, with others, to do something about it. I think they do enjoy being influential, feeling that together with others they are making a difference. It's quite a drug.

Fears Ebola outbreak will spread globally rising, with deteriorating health of an infected Spanish nurse, a British man who died in Macedonia being tested for virus and hundreds more suspected cases around the world

Spain

Teresa Romero, 44, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease. She is being treated in a hospital Madrid hospital however her condition is said to be worsening.

In total seven people are in isolation, though only Romero has tested positive for Ebola. The others include the nurse's husband and two doctors who cared for her. Three other people were released from the isolation unit late on Wednesday after testing negative.

France

In France, police imposed a lock-down on a social services centre in a town near Paris after four people who arrived from Guinea this month fell ill with headaches and fever.

Officials in Cergy Pontoise, northwest of the capital, later said that the fears that the four were suffering from Ebola were a false alarm and the nearly 60 others inside were allowed to leave.

Macedonia

A British businessman staying in the Macedonian capital died on Thursday after suffering from Ebola-like symptoms. Tests are underway to find out if he had the disease.

He and a friend had travelled to Skopje directly from Britain and had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks - raising the possibility that he contracted the disease in the UK or Macedonia.

Czech Republic

In Prague, a 56-year-old Czech man with Ebola symptoms was being tested for the virus yesterday. A spokesman for the Bulovka hospital said the man, who had recently travelled in Liberia, was in isolation, and that tests had been carried out and sent to a laboratory in Berlin. Results should be known on Friday.

US

In the US, Ashoka Mukpo, a British-American photojournalist with NBC News who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, continued to receive treatment with an experimental anti-viral drug in hospital in Nebraska.

Thomas Duncan, a Liberian national who had travelled over to America, this week became the first person to die from the virus on US soil.

Australia

There were also fears that the disease may have reached the far side of the world after an Australian nurse who treated Ebola patients while working for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone developed a fever following her return.

Sue-Ellen Kovack, 56, was admitted to hospital in Cairns, Queensland, where doctors will receive the results of an Ebola test on Friday. She felt healthy when she arrived home last weekend but still quarantined herself as a precaution, raising hopes that even if she has been infected, she will not have passed the virus to others.

Liberia

Liberia is the worst-hit, with 2210 so far dead and nearly 1,000 more confirmed cases. It is believed to be the ground zero for the current outbreak.

Sierra Leone

Sierra Leone has lost 879 to the deadly disease and nearly 2,500 more confirmed cases

Guinea

There are 768 confirmed death and 1,000 more confirmed

When a terrifying, life-threatening disease strikes Africa and threatens the world, who rushes to face the lethal consequences head-on? Why, America – aka the Great Satan – of course.

3,000 American troops are going to Liberia, ably assisted by Little Satan – ie us. Britain is sending 750 troops to Sierra Leone.

America – and, to a lesser extent, Britain – are the world's whipping boys when it comes to supposedly wicked, mercenary, semi-colonial efforts to run the world. But, when they do unvarnished good – using that most evil of institutions, the army – what is the response from those critics? Silence – or, in some cases, anger that brilliantly efficient armies are being used instead of charitable institutions or departments for international development.

Still, the American and British armies won't mind – they're too busy saving lives to notice.

Nurses calling in sick to avoid risk of infection

MEDICAL staff in Madrid refused to treat possible Ebola patients yesterday for fear of becoming infected themselves, as the condition of the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus deteriorated further.

The Carlos III hospital, where seven quarantined cases are being treated, has had to draft in extra staff after nurses there refused to turn up for shifts.

"There are members of staff who are cancelling their contracts so that they don't have to enter [rooms with possible Ebola patients]," said Elvira Gonzalez of the SAE nurses union.

Formal absentee figures have not been released, but a number of nurses and health technicians have formally resigned from their posts while others have made excuses to avoid turning up. "A lot of people are calling in sick," one member of staff told El Pais newspaper. "They are saying they have period pains, or that they feel dizzy."

Staff members who have agreed to work in the hospital's isolation ward are receiving psychological counselling.

The reports come as Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, suffered multiple organ failure and was put on a ventilator. "Her clinical situation has deteriorated," said a spokesman for the Carlos III hospital where Mrs Ramos, 44, was being treated, while her brother informed reporters that she had been intubated.

"We don't have great hopes for her," Jose Ramon Romero Ramos said in an interview with local television.

Meanwhile, one of the doctors who treated Mrs Ramos when she was admitted to her local hospital in Alcorcon on Monday gave a damning account of the failure to isolate Mrs Ramos and protect health workers from infection in an open letter to health chiefs.

Dr Juan Manuel Parra Ramirez said it was not until hours after he first requested "immediate action" to isolate her that she was finally transferred to the specialist unit equipped to deal with Ebola patients at Carlos III hospital. He also said the full protective suit he was issued with had left his bare skin exposed. "At all times the sleeves were too short," he wrote, while quarantined.

Madrid health chiefs have laid the blame for Mrs Ramos becoming infected on "human error" and insisted that procedures to avoid contagion remained intact.

Mrs Ramos herself has admitted that she most likely became infected after touching her face while removing the biohazard protection suit after visiting the infected missionary priest, Manuel Garcia Viejo, who died on September 25.

Four people were put into quarantine on Thursday, bringing the total number of those in hospital, including the nurse's husband and several doctors who treated her, to seven. A further 84 people were being monitored in their homes.

FEARS of a global Ebola outbreak spread yesterday as French officials sealed off a building with 60 people inside, an Australian nurse and Czech man were tested for the disease and aeroplane cleaners went on strike in New York.

In France, police imposed a lockdown on a social services centre in a town near Paris after four people who arrived from Guinea this month fell ill with headaches and fever. Officials in Cergy–Pontoise, north–west of the capital, later said that the alert was a false alarm and nearly 60 others inside were allowed to leave.

The panicked response of the authorities in France, which has not had any confirmed cases of Ebola, highlighted the scale of global concern.

There were fears that the disease had reached the far side of the world after an Australian nurse who treated Ebola patients while working for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone developed a fever following her return.

Sue–Ellen Kovack, 56, was admitted to hospital in Cairns, Queensland, where doctors will receive the results of an Ebola test today. She felt healthy when she arrived home last weekend but still quarantined herself as a precaution, raising hopes that even if she had been infected, she will not have passed the virus to others.

In the US, Ashoka Mukpo, a British–American photojournalist with NBC News who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, continued to receive an experimental antiviral drug in hospital in Nebraska.

But the Texas deputy sheriff who was admitted to hospital after suffering possibly Ebola symptoms yesterday tested negative for the disease. Sgt Michael Monnig had entered the Dallas apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died of Ebola in Texas this week. Doctors said Sgt Monnig was being treated out of an "abundance of caution".

Zimbabwe also experienced an Ebola scare when the main infectious disease hospital in Harare was closed following the admission of a Congolese student who was vomiting and bleeding. That case also turned out to be a false alarm after the young woman tested positive for malaria.

In Prague, a 56–year–old Czech man with Ebola symptoms was being tested for the virus yesterday. A spokesman for the Bulovka hospital said the man, who had recently travelled in Liberia, was in isolation and tests had been carried out and sent to a laboratory in Berlin. Results should be known today.

In New York, about 200 cabin cleaners at LaGuardia Airport went on strike partly over fears about Ebola, saying they had not received proper equipment or training. "The workers are really worried because they tend to be exposed to bodily fluids, including by cleaning out bathrooms on aeroplanes," said Amity Paye, a union spokesman.

The US government will this weekend begin checks at five major airports of the temperatures and health histories of passengers who began their journeys in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

More than 8,000 people in West Africa have been officially diagnosed with Ebola and the fatality rate is nearly 50 per cent. But the World Health Organisation believes that the true tally is much higher. Meanwhile, the first trial of an Ebola vaccine in Africa started in Mali with the vaccination of three health–care workers.

Market report

WHILE Ebola fears continued to rattle travel–related stocks, shares in one of London's smaller companies jumped after traders picked up on its work combating the deadly virus.

Andover–based Bioquell, a specialist in decontamination technology, surged 19½p, or 21.8pc, to 109p in trading volume that was far higher than normal.

Dealers said the company had drawn attention because of its involvement in treating Ebola, which has caused the deaths of more than 3,400 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and has now spread to Europe.

The group's Bioquell Pod product converts open wards into single–patient rooms and can be used to manage patients potentially infected with Ebola. Furthermore, its hydrogen peroxide vapour system decontaminates equipment and rooms used in the fight against the virus and has been put into action in France and Holland, as well as at the Royal Free Hospital in London, where an Ebola survivor, William Pooley, received treatment.

Yesterday, speculation that Bioquell will experience an increase in demand for its products pushed the shares to their highest close since May.

More broadly, however, the virus remained a concern for investors amid worries it would hit demand for overseas travel. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, fell 10.3p to 333p, holidays group TUI Travel lost 10.1p to 356.9p and easyJet closed 37p lower at £13.41.

The London market started the session brightly, buoyed by a surge in Wall Street overnight after the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve suggested interest rates would not be lifted in coming months.

Brokers said retail investors used the morning rebound to sell out of positions in the wake of two days of falls in the FTSE 100, the FTSE 250 and the junior Aim market. Indeed, it was not long until the market turned once again. Another set of disappointing economic data from Germany knocked investor confidence and a warning from Chancellor George Osborne of the risks posed by the weakening eurozone economy gave another incentive to sell.

Consequently, the FTSE 100 relinquished its early gains to finish down 50.39 points, or 0.8pc, at 6,431.85 – its worst close for a year – the FTSE 250 lost 122.19 to 14,811.33 – a 0.8pc decline – and the FTSE Aim All–Share slid 0.7pc.

Investors on Wall Street also took fright, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling to close more than 300 points lower.

Société Générale strategist Albert Edwards, a self–described "uber bear", best summed up the mood by warning that fund managers are "getting increasingly nervous that we have reached the end of the road and a major market top may be forming in equities".

Although equities generally were out of favour, gold surged as much as 2.2pc to $1,233 (£765) an ounce on the dovish Fed minutes and stock sell–off, pushing shares in London–listed precious metals miners higher.

Fresnillo climbed 46½p, or 6.4pc, to 770p and Randgold Resources gained 248p to £42.98, a 6.1pc rise. An upgrade to "overweight" from "neutral" by HSBC gave Randgold an additional lift, as did a move to "buy" from "add" at Numis.

Egyptian gold miner Centamin advanced 0.65p to 58.4p, having pleased with third–quarter production results that stuck with a full–year output guidance of 420,000 ounces of the yellow metal.

In fact, corporate updates were a major driver of share prices yesterday.

Recruiter Hays climbed 2.7p to 122.7p in the wake of an encouraging set of firstquarter numbers. John Wood Group, the oilfield services company, gained 13½p to 692p after confirming that it expects to meet forecasts for the year.

But N Brown, the home–shopping retailer, plunged 46.2, or 13.3pc, to 302p after rattling investors with a shock profit warning. Peel Hunt analyst John Stevenson noted that the company had only updated the market on September 16, but was now slashing its guidance for the second–half of the year. Given the short space of time, the analyst said he found the "scale" of the downgrades required "difficult to justify in light of just three weeks further trading", and cut his recommendation from "buy" to "hold".

Elsewhere among the retail shares, positive broker comment following a presentation to analysts a day earlier helped Dixons Carphone up 0.9p to 367p. "Post–merger integration activities for Dixons Carphone are well under way and, if anything, are ahead of schedule with £80m of synergies firmly underpinned," said the experts at Investec. The tie–up between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse completed in early August.

Vodafone slumped 6.95p to 197.35p after Nomura analysts warned that the telecoms giant faces growing competition in the UK, Netherlands and India.

Reports that the group may revive its bid interest in Italian broadband company Fastweb also hurt the shares, with Espirito Santo analysts saying they found "some of the suggested multiples, in the eight times to 10 times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation] range, surprising for a business that generates next to no cash flow".

Finally, Associated British Foods, the sugar–to–clothing–conglomerate, fell as much as 32p before closing down 12p at £25.53 after it was hit by a warning from Germany's Suedzucker, the biggest sugar producer in Europe, that it was becoming harder to reach its target for annual operating profits.

Ebola victim in US’s family: why did white patients live while black patient died?

Dallas hospital denies allegations of racial discrimination in the treatment of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first to die from the disease on US soil

The Dallas hospital that treated the Ebola patient who died this week tried to fend off accusations that it initially turned him away because he was a poor African immigrant without insurance.

"Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care," Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said in a statement.

Duncan first sought help at the hospital on Sept. 25 and was sent home several hours later with antibiotics rather than being observed further, even though he told a nurse he had recently returned from West Africa, where an Ebola outbreak has killed nearly 4,000 people.

About two days after that, he returned to the same hospital by ambulance and was placed in an isolation unit. He died on Wednesday after being attached to a ventilator and a dialysis machine. The hospital said he was 45.

An experimental drug called ZMapp, a cocktail of three antibodies that has been used on American patients infected with Ebola while in West Africa, was not used on Duncan because it was not available, the hospital said.

A serum transfusion used on an Ebola patient airlifted from West Africa to a hospital in Nebraska was not used on Duncan either because his blood type did not match the treatment.

His nephew, Josephus Weeks, launched a renewed attack on the Dallas hospital, claiming his uncle had received inferior treatment.

Mr Weeks said: 'He is a poor black man. He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that.'

"We feel he didn't get the medicine and treatment for the disease because he's African and they don't consider him as important as the other three [Ebola patients]," Mr Weeks said.

The hospital said his heart stopped and Duncan "had expressed his wishes to his attending physician that the care team should not perform chest compressions, defibrillation or cardioversion to prolong his life."

Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said during a visit to Dallas for the case that Duncan was initially discharged because he was poor, black and without insurance. Duncan's fiancee asked for a full investigation regarding his care.

Dr. Craig Smith, medical director for infectious disease at University Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, said Ebola, like any disease, was easier to beat the sooner it was treated.

After he was admitted, a team of more than 50 people cared for him and an entire 24-bed intensive care unit was secured and dedicated to Duncan's care, the hospital said.

"The treatment area remains sealed and is being aggressively decontaminated," it said.

"The nurses, doctors, and team who cared for him, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, grieve the loss of Mr. Duncan," the hospital said.

Latest

23.30 Thanks for joining us, we'll leave it here for today, but join us tomorrow for more of the latest develelopments.

23.00 Public Health England has said it believes the death of a British man in Macedonia is "unlikely" to have been caused by Ebola, despite some similar symptoms.

Dr Brian McCloskey from the agency said: "Public Health England is aware there are unconfirmed reports of a British national dying in Macedonia, who may have exhibited some symptoms compatible with Ebola.

"We understand Ebola to be unlikely as the cause of death but are will continue to work with partners to investigate."

22.40 Defence secretary Michael Fallon and Ebola medical experts shed light on the UK's strategy for keeping the virus out of the country

21.40 Sources in the Macedonian government say the British man who died in Skopje had hemorrhagic fever but likely not to be Ebola. A second man has been admitted to hospital, however neither have visited Africa recently.

21.25 A Spanish nurse who is the first person known to have been infected with Ebola outside Africa is at "serious risk" of dying after her condition worsened Thursday, officials have said.

Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, suffered multiple organ failure and was put on a ventilator.

“Her clinical situation has deteriorated,” said a spokesman for the Carlos III hospital where Mrs Ramos, 44, was being treated, while her brother informed reporters that she had been intubated.

“We don’t have great hopes for her,” Jose Ramon Romero Ramos said in an interview with local television.

Madrid regional president Ignacio Gonzalez told parliament Mrs Ramos “is at this time very ill and her life is at serious risk as a consequence of the virus.”

21.02 Fears of global Ebola outbreak have spread across several continents[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11152811], reports Philip Sherwell:

Fears of a global Ebola outbreak spread on Thursday as French officials sealed off a building with 60 people inside, an Australian nurse and Czech man were tested for the disease and airplane cleaners went on strike in New York.

In France, police imposed a lock-down on a social services centre in a town near Paris after four people who arrived from Guinea this month fell ill with headaches and fever.

Officials in Cergy Pontoise, northwest of the capital, later said that the fears that the four were suffering from Ebola were a false alarm and the nearly 60 others inside were allowed to leave.

But the drastic reaction of the authorities in France, which has not reported any cases of Ebola, indicated the scale of concerns gripping officials across several continents.

There were also fears that the disease may have reached the far side of the world after an Australian nurse who treated Ebola patients while working for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone developed a fever following her return.

Read on: Fears of global Ebola outbreak spread across continents [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11152811]

20.46 A Public Health Center vehicle is parked in front of the Macedonia hotel where a 58-year-old man, reported to be British, was taken to hospital and died of severe internal bleeding from what may have been Ebola, in Skopje:

20.32 Further confusion has emerged over how - and more specifically, where - the 'Briton' who has reportedly died of Ebola in Macedonia may have contracted the virus.

"Initially we had information that he had been to Nigeria, but then his friend told us they hadn't been anywhere," Macedonian health ministry spokesman said Jovnaka Kostovska.

A government spokesman said later: "Medical authorities have informed us that up till now they cannot confirm whether the patient who died had Ebola. But as a precaution, based on the protocol of the World Health Organisation, medical authorities are taking all measures as if the patient had been suffering from a highly infectious disease."

20.10 An official has said tests will be carried out on the body of a British business traveler who died in Macedonia to see if he had the Ebola virus, AP reports.

Jovanka Kostovska of the Health Ministry said the unidentified 58-year-old died of severe internal bleeding on Thursday, shortly after being taken to a hospital in Skopje from his hotel.

The hotel was placed under quarantine until the test results are known in 48 hours.

Kostovska said there was no indication the man, who had been in Macedonia about a week, had recently been to Africa, but that protocol required the blood and tissue tests, which will be carried out in Germany.

In London, Britain's Foreign Office said officials are investigating reports that the man died of suspected Ebola.

19.40 Fiona Govan reports from Madrid, where medical staff are now refusing to treat Ebola patients for fear of infection:

Scared medical staff in Madrid refused to treat possible Ebola patients on Thursday for fear of becoming infected themselves, as the condition of the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus deteriorated further.

The Carlos III hospital, where seven quarantined cases are being treated, has had to draft in extra staff after nurses there refused to turn up for shifts.

“There are members of staff who are cancelling their contracts so that they don’t have to enter [rooms with possible Ebola patients],” said Elvira Gonzalez of the SAE nurses union

Although no formal absentee figures have been released, a number of nurses and health technicians have formally resigned from their posts, while others have made excuses to avoid going into work.

“A lot of people are calling in sick,” one member of staff told El Pais newspaper. “They are saying they have period pains, or that they feel dizzy. People are anxious and can’t be expected to work like that.”

Staff members who have agreed to work in the hospital’s isolation ward are receiving psychological counselling.

19:11 More from Reuters on the British man with symptoms of the Ebola virus who has died in Macedonia:

Authorities said they had sealed off a hotel where he stayed, keeping another Briton and hotel staff inside.

A Health Ministry official said the man had arrived in the capital, Skopje, from Britain on Oct. 2 and had been rushed to hospital at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, where he died several hours later.

Dr. Jovanka Kostovska of the ministry's commission for infectious diseases said the man had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding, and that his condition deteriorated rapidly.

"These are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient," Kostovska told a news conference, adding that samples had been sent to Germany for tests to confirm the cause of death.

19:09 The 60 people who were quarantined near Paris have been let out of the municipal health office where they were quarantined and the authorities say the "suspicion" of a possible ebola case has been lifted.

19:08 About 200 cabin cleaners at New York’s LaGuardia Airport have gone on strike partly because of fears about the risk of Ebola, saying they were not receiving the proper equipment or training.

“The workers are really worried because they tend to be exposed to bodily fluids, including by cleaning out bathrooms on airplanes,” said Amity Paye, a union spokesman.

The union is holding its own training sessions, saying that the airlines are not preparing for a possible infection.

The US government will this weekend begin checks at five major airports of the temperatures and health histories of passengers who began their journeys in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

19:04 America’s top health official has compared the outbreak of Ebola to the Aids epidemic amid dire warnings by international officials about the spread of the virus, writes Philip Sherwell:

Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a veteran of the fight against Aids, delivered his bleak assessment at a World Bank summit to raise funds to fight the disease.

"In my 30 years in public health, the only thing that has been like this is Aids," Dr Frieden told the conference in Washington. "We have to work now so that this is not the world's next Aids.”

Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, struck a similarly sombre tone as he said that the global response to the Ebola crisis was “way behind the curve”, leaving Africa’s future “at stake”.

The World Health Organisation has warned that the virus could be impossible to eradicate and become a part of life in West Africa, as Aids is in the world today, if action to defeat it is not taken swiftly.

There is one crucial difference however with Aids however. Ebola has only been passed on by an infected person demonstrating symptoms of disease, while HIV can be transmitted by people who for years show no signs of carrying the virus that causes Aids.

18:56 There have also been reports in the past 15 minutes that French authorities had sealed off a building near Paris over suspected cases of Ebola, although within minutes this precaution had apparently been lifted.

18:54 A spokesman from the Macedonian foreign ministry said: "I can confirm that a British person has died and he is in the state hospital in Skopje.

"We are looking to see what are the reasons according to the protocols of the World Health Organisation."

18:53 The Telegraph's Harriet Alexander has the following update:

The attention seems to be focussed on a hotel in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.

Local media reported that the TC Mavrovka hotel was "blockaded by men dressed in pressurised space-suits, and special medical vehicles checked all persons who were in contact with the person who allegedly died of Ebola."

It is still not clear at all whether the person who died had Ebola - and if they did, what nationality they were.

Some initial reports suggested the victim was British, but that was not confirmed. Other reports suggested the victim could have been Norwegian or Nigerian.

18:50 The Macedonia Health Ministry has confirmed the death of a British national, saying Ebola is "suspected" and that the victim travelled from Britain, reports Reuters.

18:37 Futher details from Reuters on the British man suspected of contracting the Ebola virus who has died in Macedonia. The report quotes a senior Macedonian government official:

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters a second Briton had also shown symptoms of the virus.

He said the two had been staying at a hotel in the capital Skopje and that hotel staff and the ambulance crew that took them in for treatment had been put into isolation.

The virus, which is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, has killed nearly 4,000 people in West Africa since March, in the largest outbreak on record.

18:23 In Spain, the nurse infected with Ebola is at "serious risk" of dying from the disease after her condition worsened on Thursday, officials said.

The nurse, Teresa Romero Ramos, "is at this time very ill and her life is at serious risk as a consequence of the virus," the Madrid regional president Ignacio Gonzalez told parliament.

18:11 If confirmed, this would be the first death of a UK national from Ebola, although British nurse Will Pooley was cured of the deadly virus last month.

The news came as Downing Street said enhanced screening for Ebola will be introduced[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11152500/Ebola-crisis-screening-to-start-at-Gatwick-Heathrow-and-Eurostar-terminals.html] at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports and Eurostar terminals following advice from the Chief Medical Officer.

18:06 A second Briton had shown symptoms of the virus, the Macedonian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

17:59 The Foreign Office is investigating reports that a British national has died in Macedonia of suspected Ebola. An FCO spokesman said: "We are aware of the reports and are urgently looking into them."

17:57 According to local reports from Macedonia[http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/26226/1/], a man believed to be a British citizen died at the clinic of infectious disease in Skopje.

The doctors, according to the symptoms exhibited when the patient was admitted, believe he had Ebola. When admitted to the hospital, the patient was unable to communicate and died shortly afterwards.

Macedonian authorities are taking measures in compliance with WHO protocols, according to reports.

Ebola has yet to be confirmed by tests, however doctors agree his symptoms were nearly identical to other Ebola cases in the US and Spain.

17:51 A British man suspected of contracting Ebola has died in Macedonia, according to a senior Macedonian government official, reports Reuters.

Parents' anxiety keeps charity worker and son from school

CANCELLED VISIT

A SCHOOL in Stockport has cancelled the visit of a charity worker and banned her son from attending lessons after "ignorant" parents feared their children would be infected with Ebola.

Elizabeth Inman, the head teacher, wrote to parents on Tuesday to say that "with a very heavy heart" the school had decided to stop the visit, despite both mother and son being screened by the Health Protection Agency and given the lowest risk level possible.

Miriam Mason–Sesay, who is British but has lived in Sierra Leone since 2000, where she is country director for education charity EducAid, said the decision was down to "ignorant" parents.

"We've been met with leper–type attitudes from wealthy people overreacting and trying to protect themselves from a threat that isn't there."

Nine–year–old Kofi Mason–Sesay was due to study at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Hazel Grove, Stockport, this month while his mother was in Britain fund–raising for EducAid.

Kofi, who travels to Britain with his mother twice a year and has attended the Stockport school previously, said he felt "upset" and "rejected".

Last year, Ms Mason–Sesay, 48, was awarded an MBE for her education and charitable work. She said: "If we are being treated like this, how will others from Sierra Leone be treated, how will West Africans be treated?

"The idea that Ebola is lurking behind every flipping tree and is out to get to you is absolute nonsense. There is a willingness [among some parents] to believe 'what we should do is hunt [Kofi] down, protect our own and sod the rest'."

Last month, the school had tried to reassure parents that the visit posed no risk. It took advice from health chiefs in the borough and passed on guidance that anyone travelling from affected countries but free of symptoms was not infectious.

Ms Inman said: "I understand there is a lot of misinformation about how Ebola is spread. A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears."

'Save Excalibur' - clashes with police in campaign to protect Ebola dog

A petition to save Excalibur, a dog Spanish authorities want to put down in response to the Ebola outbreak, gathers over 350,000 signatures as protesters clash with police outside Madrid flat

Spanish protesters camped outside the house of Europe's first Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] victim have clashed with police, as they bid to save her dog, Excalibur, who authorities are planning to put down.

The policemen caused a scuffle when they dragged the protesters, who were blocking the gates, away from the entrance of the apartment building, in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon.

Excalibur the dog remains inside, but on Wednesday afternoon authorities entered the building to clean the flat and remove the dog.

The 12-year-old rescue dog is owned by Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, who on Monday was confirmed as being the first person in Europe to contract the deadly virus [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11147947/Spanish-nurse-I-have-no-idea-how-I-contracted-Ebola.html] . She caught the disease through her work as a nurse, when she cared for a Spanish missionary priest who died on September 25.

Since she was admitted to hospital on Monday, her husband Javier Limon and three other people have been quarantined – two other members of the nursing team in Madrid, and a man who had recently travelled through West Africa.

But much of the attention has focused on the plight of Excalibur, who authorities in Madrid said should be euthanised to stop the spread of the disease. Scientists are not sure whether Ebola can be transferred from dogs to humans.

A petition, organised online on change.org, had been signed by over 300,000 people by Wednesday morning [https://www.change.org/p/a-los-que-sea-m%C3%ADnimamente-sensibles-poner-en-cuarentena-o-aislamiento-al-perro-de-la-auxiliar-infectada-por-%C3%A9bola-en-lugar-de-sacrificarlo] . Four hours later, it had passed 350,000 signatures.

A Facebook page, set up to campaign on the animal's behalf, had over 86,000 "likes" [https://www.facebook.com/salvemosaexcalibur] and the Twitter hashtag "Save Excalibur" - #SalvarExcalibur – was being widely spread. Over 75,000 tweets mentioning the mongrel were sent in the past 24 hours.

On Wednesday morning there were 142 tweets per minute about the subject.

Mr Limon highlighted the dog's case in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Mundo, in which he begged the vets not to destroy the animal.

"The dog is fine," he said, speaking from the Madrid hospital where he is currently quarantined. "He has the whole house to himself, with the open terrace so he can do his business."

Mr Limon, before checking himself into Carlos III hospital, said he left Excalibur alone with plenty of water and 33 pounds of food – enough to last several weeks. He said that the dog had no contact with the outside world and so presented little risk to public health.

"Are they going to put me to sleep, too?" he said.

Indeed, experts are divided as to whether killing the dog would serve any purpose.

Eric Leroy, who studied Ebola transmission between dogs and humans in Gabon in 2001, said that dogs could catch the disease but not show any symptoms. And he said that their study of 439 dogs lead them to believe most dogs caught the virus through eating other infected animals – although it was possible, but difficult, to catch it from contact with humans.

"We've shown that dogs can get infected," [http://www.elmundo.es/ciencia/2014/10/08/5434178fe2704e3a2c8b457c.html] he said. "And although the risk of infection from humans is low, it does exist. That's why you have to take necessary precautions so that there is no transmission."

But Mr Leroy said that the dog should be kept alive, even if infected, so that more can be understood about the virus.

"I would recommend keeping him in quarantine and under observation in a specific site – but not killing him," he said.

"I would look at his evolution through various parameters – biological, virological, serological (studying the plasma). It's a precious opportunity to see if dogs can play a key role in the propagation of Ebola."

But Madrid's health advisory board stated: "There exists data which confirms the risk from dogs with positive antibodies from Ebola, which indicates that dogs can suffer from a process of viremia (introducing viruses into the bloodstream), even though they do not show any symptoms."

And animal rights campaigners in Spain have seized on the case – calling it yet another example of the Spanish authorities' incompetence.

"We demand that the animal be diagnosed and put in quarantine and treated if necessary," said Javier Moreno, the international coordinator of Igualdad Animal. "This just shows the incompetence of those who are handling this crisis."

SECURITY OPERATION

THE first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on United States soil has died, leaving medical officials scrambling to identify dozens of people he could have exposed to the virus.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died on the day he was hoping to be reunited – over a video monitor – with his 19–year–old son, whom he had not seen for 16 years. He apologised for having put his fiancée, the "love of my life", in danger.

Doctors at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas said he had "fought courageously" against the virus. Mr Duncan, who was Liberian, arrived in the US from his home country on Sept 20. Hours before he died US officials disclosed they were planning to monitor passengers arriving from West Africa at five major airports. "Enhanced screening measures" will begin as early as this weekend at Washington DC, Chicago, Atlanta, and two airports in New York.

Mr Duncan had arrived in Washington DC from Liberia on his way to Dallas.

Security agents will observe visitors and take their temperatures to see if they have feverish symptoms. Passengers will also be given questionnaires.

A total of 48 people in Dallas who came into contact with Mr Duncan are having their temperatures taken twice a day. Tight precautions are being taken with the disposal of Duncan's body.

THE first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on United States soil has died, leaving medical officials scrambling to identify dozens of people he could have exposed to the virus.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died on the day he was hoping to be reunited – over a video monitor – with his 19–year–old son, whom he had not seen for 16 years. He apologised for having put his fiancée, the "love of my life", in danger.

Doctors at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas said he had "fought courageously" against the virus.

A total of 48 people in Dallas who came into contact with Mr Duncan are having their temperatures taken twice a day.

Doctors at the same hospital were last night examining a policeman who was one of several officers to enter Mr Duncan's apartment without protective clothing last week and had contact with his family. The Dallas County Sheriff's Office said that Sgt Michael Monnig had "expressed concern" after feeling sick and was told to seek medical help.

Mr Duncan, who was Liberian, arrived in the US from his home country on Sept 20 on his way to Dallas. Hours before he died, US officials said they were planning "enhanced screening measures" of passengers arriving from West Africa at five major airports; Washington DC, Chicago, Atlanta and two airports in New York.

Ebola compared to Aids epidemic by top American health official

Thomas Frieden, a veteran of the battle against Aids, issues dire warning at Washington fundraising summit as World Bank chief warns that Africa's future is "at stake"

America's top health official has compared the outbreak of Ebola to the Aids epidemic amid dire warnings by international officials about the spread of the virus.

Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a veteran of the fight against Aids, delivered his bleak assessment at a World Bank summit to raise funds to fight the disease.

"In my 30 years in public health, the only thing that has been like this is Aids," Dr Frieden told the conference in Washington. "We have to work now so that this is not the world's next Aids."

Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, struck a similarly sombre tone as he said that the global response to the Ebola crisis was "way behind the curve", leaving Africa's future "at stake".

The men were speaking at a summit also attended by Ban Ki Moon, the UN Secretary-General, Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund managing director, international charity chiefs and leaders of the three worst-affected West African nations.

"We have to quickly speed up, and scale up, the global response to this crisis," Mr Kim said. "Unless we quickly contain and stop this Ebola epidemic, nothing less than the future of Africa is at stake." As the impact of the crisis continued to spread around the world, an Australian nurse was tested for the virus after returning from Sierra Leone and aeroplane cleaning crews in New York walked out in protest at lack of training and equipment.

CDC experts have predicted that the virus could infect up to 1.4 million people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea by the end of January. "It's going to be a long fight," said Dr Frieden.

In a videophone link to the summit, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, described how her country needed assistance with challenges as basic as removing the bodies of victims from the streets and burying them in a sanitary fashion.

Mr Kim cited his organisation's estimates that the crisis could cost the West African economies more than $30 billion and risked causing food shortages as farmers stayed home to try to avoid contracting the virus.

The World Health Organisation has warned that the virus could be impossible to eradicate and become a part of life in West Africa, as Aids is in the world today, if action to defeat it is not taken swiftly.

There is one crucial difference with Aids however. Ebola has only been passed on by an infected person demonstrating symptoms of disease, while HIV can be transmitted by people who for years show no signs of carrying the virus that causes Aids.

Meanwhile, there were fears that disease may have reached the far side of the world after a nurse who treated Ebola patients while working for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone was admitted to hospital in Cairns, Queensland, with a fever.

Doctors will receive the test results for Sue-Ellen Kovack, 56, on Friday.

She felt healthy when she arrived home last weekend and quarantined herself as a precaution, raising hopes that even if she was infected, she will not have passed the virus to others.

In the US, Ashoka Mukpo, a British-American photojournalist with NBC News who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, continued to receive treatment with an experimental antiviral drug in hospital in Nebraska.

But Texas health officials said they did not believe that a deputy sheriff who was admitted to hospital after feeling unwell was at risk of the disease. The officer had entered the Dallas apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died of Ebola in Texas this week.

About 200 cabin cleaners at New York's LaGuardia Airport went on strike partly because of fears about the risk of Ebola, saying they were not receiving the proper equipment or training.

"The workers are really worried because they tend to be exposed to bodily fluids, including by cleaning out bathrooms on aeroplanes," said Amity Paye, a union spokesman.

The union is holding its own training sessions, saying that the airlines are not preparing for a possible infection.

The US government will this weekend begin checks at five major airports of the temperatures and health histories of passengers who began their journeys in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Liberia attacks British Airways for suspending flights to Ebola-hit country

Liberia's information minister accuses British Airways of a knee-jerk reaction that now risked undermining the long-term aid effort

Liberia [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] 's government has attacked British Airways for stopping flights to the Ebola-hit nation, saying it is hampering the international aid effort.

BA suspended its four-times-weekly flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone back in early August, cutting off the only direct links between Britain and the Ebola-infected area of west Africa. It has now extended that suspension until the end of March, amid ongoing concern about "the deteriorating public health situation in both countries".

But other airlines have continued to fly to both countries - backed by aid agencies who say that commercial flights are the only way to ferry in enough international aid workers and equipment to cope with the Ebola outbreak.

In an interview on Wednesday with the Telegraph, Liberia's information minister, Lewis Brown, accused British Airways of a knee-jerk reaction that now risked undermining the long-term aid effort.

"We need as many airlines coming in to this region as possible, because the cost of bringing in supplies and aid workers is becoming prohibitive," he said. "There just aren't enough seats on the planes. I can understand BA's initial reaction back in August, but they must remember this is a global fight now, not just a west African one, and we can't just be shut out."

At present, Liberian air connections to Europe are served by two main carriers - the Belgian state airline Brussels Air, which flies direct to Liberia via Brussels, and Royal Air Maroc, which flies to Liberia via Casablanca. Both services usually stop off in Sierra Leone as well.

With Britain now preparing to send out hundreds of aid workers to both countries - some 400 NHS volunteers are to go to Sierra Leone alone - demand for flights is expected to soar in coming months. Mr Brown urged BA to change its mind, saying it should not undermine the aid work being done by Britain for both countries.

BA says it has based its decision partly on concerns for the safety of its flight staff, although some suspect the real reason is fears of backlash in Britain were it to inadvertently bring an Ebola-infected passenger into the country.

Mr Brown's words echo the concerns of Save the Children, which has staff in both Sierra Leone and Liberia.

"At a minimum, they could run targeted humanitarian flights, like they did during the recent Phillipines typhoon disaster," he said. "This is significantly different, I grant you, but a bit more urgent, and we need as many health care workers from around the world as possible, as well as their equipment. BA can't be fairweather friends."

"BA, in our view, could be a wonderful humanitarian air bridge," said Gemma Parkin, a Save the Children spokesman, who recently had a member of staff stuck for 30 hours when a Royal Air Maroc flight headed for Liberia got stuck at Casablanca. "It is a bit strange that BA should have taken this arbitrary stance."

Christopher Stokes, director of MSF in Brussels, added: "Airlines have shut down many flights and the unintended consequence has been to slow and hamper the relief effort, paradoxically increasing the risk of this epidemic spreading across countries in west Africa first, then potentially elsewhere. We have to stop Ebola at source and this means we have to be able to go there."

A spokesman for British Airways said: "We suspended flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia in August due to our concerns about the public health situation in both countries.

"Those flights have now been suspended until the end of March, 2015.

"There are a number of considerations when determining whether it is safe to operate a flight, including the welfare of our crews and teams on the ground.

"The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will reassess the routes in the coming months."

Britain urged to follow US in screening for Ebola at airports

BRITAIN was last night urged to bring in Ebola screening at airports as the US stepped up security in response to the growing crisis.

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, warned that there was "no time to waste" as he announced that travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would face body–tem–perature tests and enhanced questioning at US airports.

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary admitted the disease "knows no borders", while Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said it was "now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK".

Despite the growing alarm, Public Health England said it would not be changing guidance to airports, where staff are advised to take action only if passengers are showing visible signs of the disease. Last night Keith Vaz MP called for screening to be introduced. "What we need to ensure is that the public feel there is confidence at our borders and that means we need to put in screening at our borders in order to give the public that confidence," he said.

Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said "focusing on flights from high–risk areas would help", but warned it may give a false sense of security.

Yesterday, the Government announced that more than 750 British troops, along with three helicopters and a medical ship, would be sent to Sierra Leone.

Downing Street also announced that a "national exercise" will take place to "ensure the UK is fully prepared", although no further details were available.

UK MEASURES

BRITAIN will send hundreds of troops, a hospital ship and three helicopters to West Africa to tackle the Ebola outbreak.

Troops will head to Sierra Leone as early as next week, where British military engineers and medics are overseeing the building of an Ebola hospital.

Around 750 personnel will help set up treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.

The measures were decided during a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee, as the Foreign Secretary said the world had to do more "to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe".

RFA Argus, a medical ship with a 100–bed hospital on board, will be sent, along with three Merlin helicopters.

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said the disease had become "an unprecedented threat that knows no borders".

He said: "We have to get ahead of this disease, but if we get ahead of it, if we rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it. We know how to do this, it is not complicated to do, it just requires a large focus of resource and effort to deliver it."

He added: "We now need the wider international community to step up to the plate and deliver that additional resource, not just money, but trained medical and clinical personnel to lead that effort on the ground.

"We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe."

Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, said: "Following today's meeting, we are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak, on land, in the air and at sea."

The troops will include soldiers of the Royal Scots Borders 1st Battalion based in Co Down, Northern Ireland.

Lt Col Matt Munro, commanding officer, said: "Of course there is a risk of soldiers from this battalion contracting the virus, but it is a very low risk because there are all sorts of very practical and sensible measures that my people can employ… And it is worth saying also that, for the most part, my soldiers have been queuing up to deploy."

Pet pays price

The dog owned by the Spanish nurse who became the first to contract Ebola in Europe was last night put down by order of health officials in Madrid despite a furious campaign by animal lovers.

Excalibur, the 12–year–old rescue dog of Maria Teresa Romero Ramos and her husband Javier Limon, pictured with the pet, was destroyed as a precautionary measure by authorities trying to limit the spread of Ebola. However, the decision enraged animal rights protesters, who clashed with police as they blockaded the apartment building in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcón, where the dog had been locked up since its owners were quarantined.

Campaigners had hoped for a last–minute reprieve after the rector of the Complutense University of Madrid – where Excalibur was ordered to be taken to be destroyed – refused to allow the dog to be "sacrificed" there.

A petition, organised online at change.org, had almost 400,000 signatures. A Facebook page, set up to campaign on the animal's behalf, had more than 86,000 "likes" and the Twitter hashtag "Save Excalibur" – #SalvarExcalibur – was being widely spread.

The fate of the dog became a flashpoint as anger mounted over the authorities' handling of the Ebola outbreak. Experts on Ebola had argued that the dog should be kept alive, even if infected, so that more can be understood about the virus.

Ebola crisis

Spanish nurse says her fever was ignored for six days

MEDICAL ERRORS

THE nurse in Madrid who became the first case infected with Ebola outside West Africa, repeatedly tried to report her symptoms to health authorities, but was told to take paracetamol before being finally diagnosed with the deadly virus and put into isolation.

María Teresa Romero Ramos has admitted that she likely caught the virus when she touched her face with a contaminated glove as she removed her protective suit after visiting the room of the infected missionary priest who was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone.

It was the first indication as to how she became infected with the deadly haemorrhagic fever, as Spanish health officials struggled to contain the virus and placed two more nurses under quarantine and dozens of others under observation for symptoms of Ebola.

However, it emerged that a catalogue of errors led to her not being isolated in a specialised unit until six days after she showed signs of the illness and after she had sought medical advice three times.

The 44–year–old believes that she became infected after cleaning up waste in the room of Manuel Garcia Viejo, the 69–year–old missionary who died on Sept 25.

"I think the error was in the removal of the [protective] suit," Mrs Romero told Spanish daily El País newspaper in a telephone interview from her hospital bed. "I see that as the most critical moment, when something could have happened. But I'm not sure," she said.

Health investigators attempting to reconstruct events that led to her infection confirmed that she had told them she may have touched her face while removing the protective suit, an error that she was not aware of at the time, and, therefore, did not report.

"She has talked to me about the gloves, she touched her face with the gloves. That's what she remembers and what she has told me three times," Germán Ramírez, one of the doctors at Carlos III hospital where the nurse is being treated, said outside the hospital.

When she left work to go on holiday, the day after the missionary had died, the nurse was told to take her temperature twice a day and report any symptoms to the specialist occupational risk team at the Carlos III hospital.

Four days later, on Sept 30, she reported suffering from a mild fever and general fatigue, but as her temperature had not reached the 38.6C threshold, she was advised to visit her local clinic, where she was reportedly prescribed paracetamol.

Several days later and with no sign of her fever abating she again contacted health authorities, but no action was taken.

It was not until Sunday night, when her fever had reached the 38.6C barrier, that she was advised by clinicians at the Carlos III unit to contact her local hospital. She was then transported in an ambulance by paramedics who were not dressed in protective clothing to the emergency department of the Alcorcón hospital. Once there, after reportedly waiting some time in a busy waiting room, she informed medics that she feared she may have contracted Ebola.

"The nurses who dealt with me were wearing normal clothes without any protection when they took me to hospital," Mrs Romero told El País.

Hospital staff at Alcorcón have complained that the patient was left in an improvised isolation area marked off by a curtained screen and security tape.

Finally, six hours after tests confirmed that she was infected with Ebola, she was transferred in a specialist ambulance to the isolation unit set up at Carlos III hospital where the missionaries had been treated.

Some of the 84 people now under observation by Madrid health authorities are those she had contact with at her local hospital, others are family and friends with whom she had close contact with while feeling unwell, and the remainder are those who also treated the repatriated missionaries.

Her husband is in quarantine, although has yet to show symptoms of the virus. So, too, are three other nurses who were in the original medical teams assigned to care for the missionaries.

The coordinator of emergency health services at the Spanish ministry of health, Fernando Simón, has conceded that it would have been better to have admitted the nurse into hospital earlier.

He said that although she had not presented the symptoms used by clinicians to suspect a case of Ebola, her history of having been in contact with the stricken missionaries meant it would have been preferable to err on the side of caution.

"In this case it would have been better to have admitted her for observation on September 30 rather than wait for the more serious symptoms," said Mr Simón.

Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, appealed for calm over Spain's Ebola outbreak and pledged to step up efforts to contain the virus. "Let the professionals do their work," he told the Spanish parliament on Wednesday. "What we have to do right now is be alert, but stay calm – this is the government's position."

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855

Great efforts are being made to contain the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa and treat its victims. The courage and dedication of health workers at the forefront of this fight have been exemplary. The American government has despatched thousands of soldiers to the areas most affected, and now Britain is to send 750 military personnel and a fleet auxiliary medical ship to Sierra Leone. This is a justified deployment given the importance of halting the spread of the virus.

So it is a great disappointment that lax safety protocols in Spain appear to have allowed this deadly virus to enter Europe. Five people, including a nurse who treated a Spanish priest recently returned from Sierra Leone, have contracted Ebola or are showing signs of having done so. Some 50 others who have been in contact with the victims are also being monitored.

But while vigilance is necessary, we should avoid hysteria. Ebola is not as easily transmittable as, say, influenza, and the NHS is good at managing unusual infectious diseases. This presupposes that sufferers can be identified, and it is here where controversy lies. President Obama has ordered US border officials to screen incoming air passengers for the virus, yet in the UK there are no plans to follow suit. Public Health England said it would mean screening "huge numbers of low–risk people".

Moreover, if a case of Ebola were reported here, the infected person would be isolated and protective measures implemented. It does not follow that because there has been an outbreak in Spain that we are at any greater risk. But public reassurance is important; and while not screening for it seems sensible now, the policy needs to be kept under review in case this crisis becomes a catastrophe.

Ebola 'threatens to cost West African economies £20bn'

THE spread of the deadly Ebola virus could result in a £20bn hit to economies in Africa and cause turmoil in financial markets, experts have warned.

The World Bank yesterday outlined a worst–case scenario that would see almost 12pc wiped off the economy of Liberia, the country worst affected by the outbreak, and 3.3pc off the entire west African region.

Analysts at Barclays predicted that, if the virus establishes itself further in Asia or the West, the impact on financial markets could be as bad as that caused by Asia's SARS outbreak a decade ago.

The number of people Ebola has killed is now more than 3,400 and the virus appears to be spreading beyond Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Shares in UK–listed travel companies and airlines fell amid growing fears that the spread of the virus would hit demand. TUI Travel, easyJet and British Airways–owner IAG all dropped yesterday.

Under a "High Ebola" scenario, in which the virus spreads beyond the current locations to neighbouring Nigeria and Ivory Coast, the World Bank estimated the cost to these economies would be $32.6bn (£20.3bn) – or 3.3pc of the combined GDPs of the countries affected – by the end of next year.

It would also see growth across the region fall from 6.9pc last year to 5.6pc in 2014 and 4.1pc in 2015.

If the virus can be contained and managed within the three countries currently affected, this "Low Ebola" scenario would still result in a $3.8bn hit. The World Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, said: "The international community now must act on the knowledge that weak public health infrastructure, institutions and systems in many fragile countries are a threat not only to their own citizens but also to their trading partners and the world at large."

Barclays analyst Marvin Barth said yesterday the spread of Ebola beyond the currently affected areas would "have a significant impact on global financial markets", well beyond the anxiety created by Asia's experience with SARS in 2003.

"Afflicted countries' relatively small weight in global GDP, trade and financial markets so far has limited Ebola's effects on global markets despite an already largerthan–SARS death toll," he said.

Tesco moves up again with analyst support but Ebola worries hit FTSE

Market report

WORRIES that Tesco will tap shareholders with a rights issue have weighed on the grocer ever since the supermarket group issued a third profit warning last month.

But a fundraising might not be as bad as many investors think, according to one of the City's leading retail analysts.

Tesco shares rose 2½p, or 1.4pc, to 185.1p, after David McCarthy of HSBC upgraded his recommendation on the stock to "neutral", from "underweight".

The grocer hit its lowest level since 2003 when a £250m black hole was discovered in its accounts a fortnight ago.

However, thanks to the cautiously upbeat assessment issued by Mr McCarthy yesterday, the stock rose for a third straight trading session, the first time the troubled supermarket group has managed such a run since mid–August.

"A rights issue would improve the underlying strength of Tesco and would simultaneously create problems for Sainsbury at a corporate level," the analyst said.

Indeed, a fundraising may be "positively" received by Tesco investors "as it would help resolve balance sheet concerns, while buying time to undertake asset disposals without a fire sale."

Many of the market's worries about the company are now reflected in Tesco's bombed–out share price, he added. "We expect further bad news on accounting, pensions and a re–basing of profits but believe much of this is now in the price."

As a result, Tesco ended the session as the third–biggest riser in the FTSE 100, which fell for a second day to close off 13.34 points, or 0.2pc, at 6,482.24, weighed down by the now–familiar cocktail of global growth and geopolitical concerns, as well as worries about the spread of the Ebola virus.

Mid and small–cap shares were much harder hit. The second–tier FTSE 250 slumped 165.7 points, or 1.1pc, to 14,933.52, and the FTSE Aim All–Share index slid 1.2pc, its worst one–day fall since June. The junior market is weighted toward oil and mining companies, which have been hurt by the sell–off in commodities.

Back in the FTSE 100, ITV, like Tesco, was lifted by broker research, closing up 1.4p at 205.8p after Credit Suisse analysts repeated their "outperform" on the broadcaster and added the stock to both their European and global focus lists.

"The recent pull–back, on global growth concerns, provides an attractive entry point for investors looking for exposure to one of the rare, growing, TV content assets in Europe," they told clients.

The company is viewed by many as a takeover target, especially after Liberty Global took a 6.4pc stake in July. The Credit Suisse analysts gave the broadcaster a 346p "blue sky" valuation and said "any third party seeking to control ITV would need to pay a premium over this 346p combined value".

Similarly, "buy" recommendations from both Peel Hunt and Berenberg boosted outsourcing and construction group Interserve 22½p higher to 610½p.

Conversely, GKN, the car and plane parts maker, was knocked 10.7p to 294.7p following a double–downgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, who cut to "underperform" from "buy", missing out the "neutral" rating altogether.

"On the back of increasingly negative news flow on global automotive and industrial end–markets, we see a downside risk to GKN's Driveline, Land Systems and PowderMet divisions, which together represent circa 70pc of full–year 2013 sales and 60pc of profits," they said.

Travel stocks remained under pressure amid concerns that the arrival of the deadly Ebola virus in Europe would curb demand. TUI Travel fell 15p to 367p on worries the outbreak could affect its merger with its German parent; cruise operator Carnival, which has cancelled stops in West Africa because of the disease, slid 29p to £22.99 and easyJet declined 11p to £13.78.

"If the Ebola case in Spain is a one–off and the virus is contained, the sector should rally sharply, in our view. Otherwise, expect a sharp but perhaps short–lived sell–off," said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde.

Oil companies, meanwhile, were dragged lower by the falling price of oil, with Brent crude sliding as much as 1.5pc during intraday trade. Tullow Oil lost 24½p to a near six–year low of 576p, Ophir Energy declined 10½p to 212.3p and Soco International closed down 16.7p at 352.8p.

Tullow and Ophir both have interests in West Africa, where the Ebola outbreak began, and so worries about the virus were an additional weight on the shares.

The disruption caused by the deadly disease was also one of the factors that yesterday caused Sierra Leone–focused iron ore producer London Mining to admit that there was "little or no value" in its shares. The stock slumped as much as 96.1pc before retail investors chased the miner off its worst level to close down 2.35p, or 75.8pc, at ¾p.

Finally, beleaguered infrastructure group Balfour Beatty was hurt by the closure of Blackpool Airport, which is 95pc owned by the FTSE 250 company. It closed off 6.8p at 161.6p.

"The failure to find a buyer may, in our view, provide a further concern to investors, since Balfour has indicated it will consider further disposals," said Westhouse Securities analyst Alastair Stewart.

LONDON Mining, the debt–ridden Aimlisted miner, has warned that its shares could have "little or no value" if a financial restructuring with a strategic investor takes place.

The grim update follows the iron ore miner's admission last week that it was running out of money to service its only operating mine in Sierra Leone.

"This looks like the end of the road for London Mining unless a new investor charges to the rescue," analysts at Numis Securities said.

London Mining, which traded above 400p a share in 2011 closed 76pc lower at 0.75p yesterday, valuing the business at just £1m.

Bankers at Goldman Sachs and Standard Bank are trying to drum up strategic interest in the business, but industry bankers believe that the slew of bad news could mean that the mining tiddler will end up in the hands of its creditors.

Indian steel conglomerate Jindal was reportedly weighing a takeover of the business, which would give it control of the mine at a knockdown price.

India's third–biggest steel maker declined to comment on the speculation, but added in a Bombay stock exchange filing that as "a long–term strategy, we would like to expand both organically by means of brownfield and greenfield expansions and inorganically by acquiring some existing assets. In that perspective, we keep scanning suitable opportunities, which have a strategic fit."

London Mining's desperate position follows a spat with commodities giant Glencore over the pricing of an iron ore supply contract, which is said to have put a squeeze on its short–term cash position. It is understood that Glencore is unlikely to show an interest in the company.

London Mining has been suffering from an oversupply of the steel–making commodity, which has led to iron ore prices languishing at the lowest level since 2009.

The company has also blamed the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone for its troubles, which have "introduced signifi–cant challenges both to the strategic investor process that the company began in May and to the ongoing operational performance of the business". In June, the company moved "non–essential" staff out of Sierra Leone, chartering flights to remove employees from the country. The company warned that the disruption caused by the outbreak could cost it an additional $1 per tonne of iron ore produced in 2014 and force a reduction in drilling.

However, some industry figures countered that the company's troubles ran deeper than the ongoing Ebola crisis.

London Mining has a total debt pile of $310m (£191m) with a consortium of banks. Conversations are also taking place with trade finance bank Afreximbank, which has agreed a $30m twoyear financing facility, but this is not expected to be available in the necessary time period.

Ebola crisis: 'British man dies of disease in Macedonia'

A British man suspected of having Ebola has died in Macedonia, and a second man is believe to be fighting the disease, officials have said.

A British man has died in Macedonia of suspected Ebola, Macedonian officials have said.

A second Briton had also shown symptoms of the virus, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

The Foreign Office said they were investigating both reports.

"We are aware of the reports and are urgently looking into them," said a spokesman.

The man died at the clinic of Infectious Disease in Skopje. The doctors, according to the symptoms exhibited when the patient was admitted, believe he had Ebola, Macedonian station Alfa TV reported.

When admitted to the hospital, the patient was unable to communicate, shortly after he had passed away.

Ebola has yet to be confirmed by tests, however doctors agree his symptoms were nearly identical to other Ebola cases in the US and Spain.

If confirmed it would be the first death of a UK national from Ebola, although British nurse Will Pooley was cured of the deadly virus last month.

Mr Pooley, from Suffolk, became the first Briton to contract the virus after working as a volunteer nurse in Sierra Leone, which is one of the worst-hit countries of the current outbreak.

He was flown back to Britain on August 24 and recovered after being treated in an isolation unit at London's Royal Free Hospital.

It was also reported that French authorities have sealed off a building near Paris over suspected cases of Ebola.

Meanwhile, new enhanced screening techniques will be introduced for passengers travelling from the main Ebola affected regions in west Africa - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - to give Britain an additional level of protection from the deadly virus.

The tests will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements as well as a possible medical assessment conducted by trained medical personnel.

Contingency planning is also under way including a national exercise to make sure the country is fully prepared.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London's Heathrow and Gatwick Airports and Eurostar terminals and will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements as well as a possible medical assessment, conducted by trained medical personnel rather than Border Force staff. Passengers will also be given advice on what to do should they develop symptoms later.

"As the Chief Medical Officer's advice makes clear, these measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases."

The advice of the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said it was right to consider further measures to make sure potential cases of Ebola are identified as quickly as possible in the UK.

Albert Edwards has warned of "increasing nervousness in the market”

There is mounting concern among fund managers that stock markets have peaked, according to Societe Generale strategist and self-described “uber-bear” Albert Edwards.

The FTSE 100 has fallen 6pc since early September as investors around the world have balked at worries over global growth, the spread of the Ebola virus and rising geopolitical tensions.

Mr Edwards today warned that “volatilities are definitely on the rise” and that there is “increasing nervousness in the market”.

“Institutional investors are also getting increasingly nervous that we have reached the end of the road and a major market top may be forming in equities,” he said.

“Notwithstanding particularly concerning economic data out of the formerly reliably robust Chinese and German economies, many market commentators are pointing out that US inflation expectations have now slid to levels that previously triggered the Fed to enact quantitative easing – yet there seems to be absolutely no prospect of that occurring currently. Quite the reverse.”

He concluded that “maybe it’s time to stop dancing and sit this one out”.

Ebola: Spanish doctor says protective suit 'too short' as nurse health worsens

Three more health workers quarantined in Spain as doctor says his protective suit left bare skin exposed and the health of infected Spanish nurse worsens

The health of a Spanish nurse with Ebola worsened on Thursday as one of the doctors who initially treated her at a local hospital said the protective suit he wore while attending her was ineffective.

Dr Juan Manuel Parra complained that the protective suit he was given to treat Maria Teresa Romero Ramos had sleeves which were too short for him, leaving his bare skin exposed.

The health of Mrs Romero, the first person known to have caught Ebola outside of Africa, has deteriorated, according to the Madrid hospital where she is being treated.

"Her clinical situation has deteriorated but I can't provide more information," because of the express wishes of the infected nurse, a spokeswoman for the La Paz-Carlos III hospital told reporters on Thursday.

Dr Parra gave a damning account of the failure in biosecurity surrounding the case, before voluntarily isolating himself over fears that he has been infected.

In an open letter to Madrid health authorities the doctor criticised the conditions in which he attended Mrs Romero after she was transferred to her local hospital by ambulance in the early hours of Monday.

He wrote that doctors and nurses who treated Mrs Romero initially wore just impermeable gowns and double surgical gloves, a hat and a face mask.

He cared for the 44-year-old nurse between 8am when he began his shift until after midnight when she was finally transferred to a specialist isolation unit at the Carlos III during which time he had to put on and remove the protective clothing as many as 13 times.

As Mrs Romero’s condition deteriorated and she developed vomiting, diarrhea and a chesty cough Dr Parra advised his superiors of the situation and called for “immediate action”, a request that was made at around 11 am.

Dr Parra claims that he was only given the highest level protection suit at 5pm – and that it was ill-fitting. “At all times the sleeves were too short,” he wrote.

At 6pm he had requested that the patient be transferred to a proper isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital which was equipped to deal with Ebola patients, “given the high risk of complication and instability and the constant requirements given her conditions of diarrhea, coughing and vomiting with the presence of blood”.

That transfer did not occur until after midnight, more than five hours after tests confirmed the Ebola infection.

He complained that despite being the doctor in charge of her treatment he had not been informed directly that she had tested positive for the hemorrhagic virus.

“I learned of the results from journalists rather than the relevant authority,” Dr Parra said.

It also emerged that the ambulance that initially transferred Mrs Romero from her home to the local hospital in Alcorcon went on to carry a further seven patients in the 12 hours before it was sterilised.

In total seven people are in isolation, though only Mrs Romero has tested positive for Ebola. The others include the nurse's husband and two doctors who cared for her. Three other people were released from the isolation unit late on Wednesday after testing negative.

Officials said that they would disinfect Mrs Romero’s home on Thursday, a day after her dog Excalibur was removed from the property and put down as a precautionary measure, despite furious protests by animal rights activists.

The Ebola virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in West Africa since March in the largest outbreak on record. It causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person.

The World Health Organization has said it sees no evidence of the disease being brought under control in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States died on Wednesday and the US government ordered extra screenings at five major airports.

Admitting she's 'scared' of the Ebola crisis, Naomi Campbell will use her Fashion for Relief organisation to raise awareness and funds for victims of the deadly virus

Naomi Campbell wants to do her bit for the Ebola crisis. The supermodel will stage two fashion shows in New York and London next February as part of her Fashion for Relief foundation.

The organisation was founded by the British model in 2005 as a way of generating funds for disaster relief through fashion shows and auctions. The first show raised money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and she has since used the project to raise funds following the India terrorist attacks in 2009, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, and the Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011.

Each show includes a star-studded cast, with the likes of Kate Moss and Beyoncé previously taking part.

The February shows will take place during New York and London Fashion Weeks, so will doubtless draw a similarly starry crowd of contributors.

The 44-year-old told Page Six[http://pagesix.com/2014/10/08/naomi-campbell-wants-to-launch-fashion-for-relief-shows-to-fight-ebola/] that she is “scared” of the virus, and that she owns a home in Kenya and works with three orphanages there. She hopes the shows will not only raise money to help victims but also educate the public as “people don’t have a clear idea about what Ebola is.”

“Ebola does not discriminate,” she said, adding that as a black woman she feels a responsibility to fight the crisis.

Ebola crisis: Britain urged to bring in airport screening like US

Health officials have been urged to begin screening for Ebola at the border after the US announced it would be enhancing security at airports

Britain has been urged to bring in Ebola screening at airports as it clashed with the US over how to handle the growing crisis.

The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, warned that there was ‘no time to waste’ as he announced that travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would face body temperature tests and enhanced questioning.

Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary admitted that the disease ‘knows no borders’ while Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary said that it was “now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK.”

However despite the growing alarm, Public Health England said it would not be changing guidance to airports, where immigration staff are currently advised to take action only if passengers are showing visible signs of the disease.

Keith Vaz MP called for immediate screening to be introduced.

“What we need to ensure is that the public feel there is confidence at our borders and that means, we need to put in screening at our borders in order to give the public that confidence,” Mr Vaz

Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, also agreed that: ‘focussing on flights from high risk areas would help’ but warned it may give a false sense of security.

The deadly virus has killed more than 3,400 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and infected more than 7,200.

Economists warned that the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa could lead to turmoil on the international financial markets on a on a greater scale than the SARS outbreak a decade ago.

On Wednesday, after a meeting of the government’s emergency committee, Cobra, it was announced that more than 750 British troops wold be sent to Sierra Leone along with three helicopters and a medical support ship.

Troops will deploy to West Africa as early as next week, where British military engineers and medics are already overseeing the building of an Ebola hospital.

“The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is already a global threat to public health and it’s vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic,” said Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary.

Downing Street also announced that new posters will be placed in British airports with information for passengers on symptoms of Ebola and instructions to call a doctor if they become ill within three weeks. A 'national exercise' will also take place to 'eunsure the UK is fully prepared,' although no further details were made available.

The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, will also issue further advice to doctors.

“It is unlikely but not impossible that people infected in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia could arrive in the UK while incubating the disease, and then develop symptoms after their return,” she said.

The announcement that the US will increase security at the border came as the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, died in a Texas hospital. 50 people who he came into contact with are currently being monitored.

Mr Kerry said the US and UK were "standing together" in battling the disease and paid tribute to Britain's response.

He said: "We're very grateful for the way Great Britain has now ramped up its efforts in Sierra Leone, including deploying a civil-military taskforce, constructing more than 700 beds in Ebola treatment units and providing essential supplies and personnel."

He added: "President Obama has made it crystal clear that Ebola is an urgent global crisis that demands an urgent global response."

Authorities in Spain are also dealing with the first case of the disease transmitted outside West Africa, in a hospital nurse who treated a priest flown to Madrid for treatment.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt warned it was possible someone with Ebola could enter Britain but added the health service was prepared.

"Well this is clearly one of the most serious global health emergencies of recent years. Our first priority as the Government is to make sure the British people are safe,” he said.

"It is now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK by one route or another but we have very, very good plans in place.”

Health experts were divided as to whether screening at airports would work.

“I think the present UK policy of not screening incoming airline passengers is sensible,” said virologist Dr Ben Neuman, of the University of Reading.

“The screening that is being proposed in the US would not have caught Thomas Eric Duncan as he arrived in Dallas - he had only recently caught the virus and did not have any visible symptoms yet.”

It also emerged that a boy from Sierra Leone has been banned from a Stockport school after parents believed their children could contract Ebola.

Nine-year-old Kofi Mason-Sesay was due to join St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Hazel Grove for an annual placement as mum Miriam carries out fundraising visits to schools with charity EducAid Sierra Leone. Public Health England said there was no risk.

Vivienne Nathanson, the British Medical Association's senior director, called for a ‘higher level of suspicion’ about the disease.

A day of two by-elections: in Clacton, a day of all but certain victory for Ukip, and in Heywood & Middleton, a similar walkover for Labour, although in Greater Manchester as in Essex, it's the fortunes of Nigel Farage's party that intrigue, as the People's Army underline their credentials as the second force in Labour's northern strongholds.

It's a "new dawn"declares Nigel Farage[http://click.email.telegraph.co.uk/?qs=b9b6d4711209cc2fb35b96f81708b1ec3bf5d4b70c6a1336731b38c0e691fe7f].

In the 1951 election, Labour racked up 48.8% of the vote to the Conservatives' 48%. Our poll of polls today has the two parties on 35% and 33%. The Big Two's grip on the electorate has lessened, as votes flock to the Liberals, the Greens and Ukip. "Each by-election win for the insurgents causes another small crack in the earth beneath the two-party establishment" is James' conclusion.

With both results so certain, what's there to look out for? In Clacton, look for what happens to Labour's vote share – they polled 25% of the vote in 2010 and they held the seat until 2005. And in Heywood & Middleton, see if Ukip can get to 30% in second-place in a seat that is not natural territory for them. It's a test of their machine ahead of the much more difficult battle in Rochester & Strood. And it's a reminder that, for all the talk of Ukip having reached their zenith in the European elections, their story still has a little way left to run.

Spanish nurse: 'I have no idea how I contracted Ebola'

A Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola while treating a victim of the virus has said she has "no idea" how she became infected

The first person to contract Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/]without setting foot in West Africa has said she has "no idea" how she became infected, because she followed all the nursing protocols while caring for a patient.

Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, was confirmed as having the virus on Monday. A nurse, based in the Spanish capital Madrid, she treated one of two Spanish missionaries who contracted the disease while working in West Africa.

But Mrs Romero said there was no explanation as to her infection, because she carried out the hospital's instructions to the letter.

From her hospital bed in the Carlos III centre, near Chamartin station in the centre of Madrid, Mrs Romero was asked by Spain's El Mundo newspaper, by telephone, [http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2014/10/08/543446d722601d81268b456d.html] how she had contracted the disease.

"I can't tell you, because I have no idea," she said.

She told the newspaper that she followed all the hospital protocols to the letter. Are you sure that you didn't do anything unusual, the paper asked?

"Absolutely not," she said.

The nurse had attended to Manuel Garcia Viejo, a 69-year-old Spanish missionary who was repatriated to Spain from Sierra Leone [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11112942/Ebola-150-new-cases-found-during-Sierra-Leone-lockdown.html] . She entered his room twice; once to change his medical nappy, and once, on September 25, to clean the room after he had died. Victims of Ebola are in fact more infectious after death than while alive.

Mrs Romero went on holiday the day after treating Garcia. By September 30 she had a temperature, and on October 6 admitted herself to hospital.

"She went voluntarily," her husband, Javier Limon, told El Mundo. "Others ran away. Not her."

He said that she had spent the days in between contracting the disease and developing symptoms "mostly at home".

Since her admission, 52 people have been placed in quarantine. Three people were being tested, but only one – her husband – remains under observation. He told the paper that he feels "absolutely fine".

But the Spanish authorities are coming under increasing pressure to explain how the contagion happened, and whether medical staff have been given sufficient training and equipment.

A doctor, Santiago Yus, has claimed that his colleagues at Madrid's La Paz hospital were only given a 10 minute briefing on protective equipment and procedures.

Calls are growing for Spain's health minister, Ana Matos, to resign over the case.

Spanish Ebola nurse 'may have touched face'

Maria Teresa Romero Ramos admits that she may have touched her face while wearing a contaminated glove after treating Ebola missionary

Spanish health officials say they are investigating whether a nursing assistant infected with Ebola got the disease after she touched her face with protective gloves after leaving the quarantine room where an Ebola victim was being treated.

Dr German Ramirez said nursing assistant Teresa Romero, 44, remembers she once touched her face with the gloves.

Health officials have said Mrs Romero twice entered the room of Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, who died of Ebola on Sept. 25 in Madrid.

She went in once to change his medical nappy and also entered after he died to retrieve unspecified items.

Mr Ramirez said Wednesday that Mrs Romero believes she touched her face with the glove after her first entry into the priest's room.

She became the first person to contract Ebola without setting foot in West Africa when she was diagnosed on Monday, and is now being treated at a specialist isolation unit at the Carloss III hospital in the centre of Madrid.

In an interview published by Spain's El Mundo newspaper, the woman said she followed safety protocols [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11147947/Spanish-nurse-I-have-no-idea-how-I-contracted-Ebola.html] as part of the team treating the priests. She said by telephone from quarantine she felt "better, a little bit better" since being taken to hospital on Monday.

Her husband, Javier Limon, is also quarantined at the hospital. He identified his wife in a video he sent to Spain's Animal Rights Party pleading for people to support his drive to prevent Spanish authorities from euthanising the couple's dog, a mixed breed named Excalibur [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11148388/Save-Excalibur-clashes-with-police-in-campaign-to-protect-Ebola-dog.html] .

Mr Limon told El Mundo by telephone that his wife started feeling sick with a low fever Sept. 30 but did go to a career advancement exam attended by other candidates, Mr Limon said.

Health authorities have said she did not leave the Madrid area during her holiday.

Dozens of animal rights activists outside the couple's apartment complex on Wednesday morning scuffled with police, trying to prevent an ambulance and workers in white hazmat suits from entering to disinfect the couple's apartment and take away Excalibur.

Madrid regional's government obtained a court order on Tuesday to put the dog down, saying "available scientific information" cannot rule out the possibility that Excalibur could spread the virus.

Two other people quarantined in Madrid, a nurse and a Spanish engineer who had travelled to Nigeria, were cleared on Wednesday to check out of Carlos III hospital after testing negative for the Ebola.

The first case of Ebola in a patient who has not been in West Africa is forcing airlines across Europe to reconsider their safety procedures

Airlines across Europe are monitoring their safety procedures after a nurse in Madrid contracted Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/], without having set foot in West Africa.

Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, contracted the virus after tending to a Spanish missionary, who died from Ebola after working in West Africa. Mrs Romero had never been to the region, making her the first person to catch the disease without having travelled to Africa.

And with 30 flights a day arriving in the UK from Madrid - where the nurse lived and worked - budget airlines are ensuring that their healthcare procedures are rigorously enforced.

"Passengers with contagious diseases, if spotted before the flight departs, are usually refused boarding," said one pilot with a low-cost airline.

"But if we identify it in the air then there are certain procedures we have to follow to isolate them as best as we can."

The pilot, who flies regularly around Europe, told The Telegraph that his airline have been informed that crew contact with passengers should be limited - so if one crew member has already been in contact with the ill passenger, they would remain as the sole carer of that passenger for the duration of the flight.

Aprons and gloves would be worn - but that is the limit of the protective equipment available on board.

The passenger would be moved to a spare empty row, if possible, and a lavatory would be closed for sole use of the ill traveller.

On arrival at the airport, the pilot would have called ahead to request that the duty health officials meet the arriving plane.

The guidance is essential given the high number of flights between Madrid and the UK.

On Wednesday, 30 flights carrying an estimated 5,000 people arrived at seven airports across the UK.

Easyjet operate a number of flights from Madrid - daily to Edinburgh, most days to Luton and Liverpool, and four a week to Bristol. They fly into Gatwick five times a day.

Ryanair fly into Stansted three times a day, and operates flights from Madrid to Liverpool and Manchester five times a week.

A spokesperson for Easyjet said: "None of the relevant authorities at any of the airports easyJet operates to have put any extra measures in place relating to the prevention of the spread of Ebola.

"If any measures are put in place easyJet would fully comply with them."

Ryanair said: "Our operations are running as normal, we continue to comply with all regulations.

"We have received guidelines from the health authorities and EASA, and will continue to monitor the situation."

Thomas Eric Duncan, who became the first to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil, has died in Dallas - after coming into contact with an infected person in Liberia

The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] on US soil on US soil has died as America announced it would start testing air passengers arriving from West Africa for signs of the virus.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died on the day he was hoping to be reunited over a video monitor with his 19-year-old son, who he had not seen for 16 years. He apologised for having put his fiancee, who he called the "love of my life" in danger.

Doctors at Texas Presbyterian Health Hospital in Dallas said he had "fought courageously" against the virus before succumbing.

Duncan, who was Liberian, arrived in the US from his home country on Sept 20.

Hours before he died US officials disclosed they are planning to monitor passengers arriving from West Africa at five major airports.

The "enhanced screening measures" will begin as early as this weekend at international airports in Washington DC, Chicago, Atlanta, and two in New York. Duncan had arrived in Washington DC from Liberia on his way to Dallas.

Homeland Security agents will observe visitors and take their temperatures to see if they have feverish symptoms that could be Ebola.

Passengers will also be given questionnaires to fill out which are intended to assess if they pose a risk. Facts sheets will also be distributed telling them to take their temperature twice a day and to call a doctor if they become sick within 21 days, the incubation period for the virus.

Before Duncan died family members had watched him on a monitor as his condition deteriorated in an isolation unit.

During their final visit on Tuesday, accompanied by Rev Jesse Jackson, it became too distressing. His nephew Josephus Weeks said: "What we saw was very painful. It didn't look good."

The patient's son, Karsiah Duncan, 19, a high school American football quarterback in the US, had arrived in Dallas and was hoping to speak to him on the day he died.

Karsiah Duncan had left Liberia in 1998 with his mother Louise Troh to avoid civil war.

Thomas Eric Duncan told a friend before he died that he had been looking forward to seeing his son. He said: "I'm so proud of him, I can't wait to see him."

The victim had been staying with Miss Troh in Dallas and she is now quarantined along with her 13-year-old son and two grown-up nephews who also had contact with Duncan.

The family has been moved from their apartment, which has been disinfected, to a residence inside a gated community.

In a statement issued from her quarantined home Miss Troh said: "His suffering is over now. His family is in deep sorrow and grief but we leave him in the hands of God. Eric was a wonderul man who showed comappssion toward all.

"I trust a thorough examination will take place regarding all aspects of his care.

"I am now dealing with the sorrow and anger that his son was not able to see him before he died. This will take some time but, in the end, I believe in a merciful God."

A total of 48 people in Dallas who came into contact with Duncan are having their temperatures monitored twice a day.

Tight precautions are being taken with the disposal of Duncan's body. It will not be washed before being placed in a leak-proof plastic shroud which will be inserted inside a second bag, which will then be disinfected.

Workers at the mortuary will wear protective clothing and the remains will be either cremated or put inside a hermetically sealed casket.

Duncan was initially treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, they sent him home with antibiotics - a decision that may have potentially endangered his life and exposed scores of Dallas residents to Ebola symptoms.

On October 4, he begun treatment with an experimental drug called brincidofovir. The drug has already been tested in up to 900 patients in late-stage FDA trials, but for viruses like cytomegalovirus and adenovirus not for Ebola.

The serum which was successfully used on two American missionaries, Dr Kent Brantly and Dr Nancy Writebol, was not available as supplies have run out.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said: "It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan this morning at 7.51 am.

"Mr Duncan succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola. He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing. We have offered the family our support and condolences at this difficult time.

Dr David Lakey, Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said: "The past week has been an enormous test of our health system but for one family it has been far more personal.

"Today they lost a dear member of their family. They have our sincere condolences, and we are keeping them in our thoughts.

"The doctors, nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways. We'll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat."

THE British fiancée of the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia has spoken of her anguish at being unable to touch him while he receives treatment in the United States.

Helen Finlay flew to Omaha, Nebraska, to be with Ashoka Mukpo, 33, a British–US citizen, after he was taken there by private plane from the west African nation to receive specialist care.

The couple have been together for four years and had lived in Liberia for two, where Miss Finlay worked for the Open Society Foundation, which promotes human rights and social reform around the world.

She told NBC News that due to the highly contagious nature of the virus she was able to speak to her fiancé only via a video link. Asked how it felt to be able to see but not to touch him, the University of Bristol graduate said: "Heart–wrenching. I mean, when you have got a loved one who is as sick as he is, all you want to do is curl up next to them and tell them it's going to be OK, and obviously I can't do that, so it's hard."

Mr Mukpo had volunteered at an Ebola clinic before starting work with NBC, and told his family he thought he had contracted the disease after being splashed while he spray–cleaned a vehicle in which a victim had died.

Miss Finlay said Mr Mukpo was aware of how much danger he was in. "He knows how bad it can get, which is making it very hard I think," she said.

The cameraman is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Centre, the largest decontamination centre in the US.

Mr Mukpo, whose mother is the British aristocrat Lady Diana Mukpo and father the respected intensive care doctor, Dr William Levy, attended the London School of Economics and New York's Columbia University. He had returned to the United States from Liberia in May, staying with his parents in Rhode Island, but told them he wanted to return to Africa to help with the Ebola outbreak there. Mrs Mukpo told NBC: "He just said 'Mum, I'm going tomorrow'. I said 'Please don't go, I'm frightened, you're going to get Ebola'."

Meanwhile, NBC's medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman and her team, who were with Mr Mukpo in Liberia when he began developing symptoms, have been allowed to fly back to the US after testing negative for the disease.

Doctors have said that Mr Mukpo's condition is not serious at this stage, although they expect him to worsen.

Disease will reach Britain unless we take action, expert warns

MAJOR NHS hospitals across the country have been put on standby, as health officials warn of a "real risk" that the Ebola virus could spread to Britain.

The Prime Minister will convene a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee today to discuss the growing threat from the spread of Ebola.

A Spanish nurse has become the first person to contract the disease outside Africa.

The United States has drawn up plans to screen arrivals for the virus but public health officials in this country ruled out such action.

Four major NHS hospitals in England have been identified to take patients with Ebola if the need arises.

Currently, just one unit has been established, in the Royal Free Hospital in north London, which treated William Pooley, a British nurse who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone in August.

Royal Liverpool University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust have now been listed as hospitals which could take Ebola patients if the virus reaches the UK.

Thirty medical staff in Madrid were being monitored for signs of the virus, with four people, including the nurse's husband, placed in quarantine.

Today's emergency meeting in Whitehall, chaired by David Cameron, comes after the World Health Organisation said more cases in Europe were "quite unavoidable".

Ministers yesterday announced plans to send a humanitarian operation out to west Africa, to treat medics with the disease.

Latest forecasts from US scientists warn of a 50 per cent chance that the virus could reach Britain within three weeks.

Under NHS contingency plans, protective equipment will be sent to the hospitals in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool, if the need arises.

Operational guidance from NHS England dated last month warned that there were only two high–level containment beds available in the country — both in the Royal Free Hospital — with no isolation units available at all in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Universities and schools have been sent advice warning them to look out for students who have travelled from west Africa showing signs of fever.

The unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in Africa.

Earlier this week President Barack Obama indicated that the US plans to screen incoming air passengers for the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said it does not intend to introduce screening for travellers from west Africa, insisting such efforts would be impractical, and mean checks on "huge numbers of low–risk people".

Officials said if a case of Ebola was reported in the UK, the affected person would be isolated and protective measures implemented.

PHE said the overall chance of the virus entering Britain remained "low" and the country has "robust, well–developed and welltested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases".

However, officials said there was a "real risk" the disease could reach Britain, and virologists said the arrival of the virus now appeared "inevitable".

Last night the European Commission started an investigation into the actions of the Spanish authorities, and why it was that the Spanish nurse, treating repatriated Ebola patients, was not diagnosed and placed in isolation until a week after she began feeling unwell. The Spanish nurse, 44, contracted the virus after helping to treat two repatriated priests who both died.

She reportedly contacted doctors to say she was suffering from a fever and fatigue on Sept 30, but did not present herself to her local hospital for more than one week.

Dr Nick Beeching, a senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: "With the increasing likelihood of somebody turning up in the UK we have been put on alert in Liverpool and have been making sure the plans are in place."

Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: "If the outbreak goes on indefinitely, Ebola will eventually come to the UK. When and exactly how is a tough call. That is an argument for fighting Ebola as hard as possible, right now.

"Fight it there, or we will eventually have to fight it here."

Dr Brian McCloskey, the director of global health at PHE, said: "UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated."

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after the Spanish case. "It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK," she said. "But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now."

Army personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to be part of a humanitarian operation sent to west Africa within the next few weeks. They will staff a field hospital to treat medics with the disease.

Mark Francois, the Armed Forces minister, said: "The Ebola virus represents a global threat to public health and we will not stand idly by."

A Downing Street spokesman said: "As part of the Government's ongoing efforts to combat the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, the Prime Minister will chair this week's Cobra meeting.

"This is part of an ongoing series of Cobra meetings to coordinate the UK response that started in late July and has been in the diary for some time."

Mr Cameron last night called the president of Sierra Leone to be updated on the situation there, and discussed the use of £125million of UK aid, including support for 700 extra beds.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "We are aware of the situation in Spain and are monitoring it closely. This is a reminder that we must support health care workers in maintaining the most rigorous infection control procedures when dealing with Ebola. The NHS has tried–and–tested systems for managing infectious diseases, and we continue to inform clinicians about the signs of Ebola, the need for vigilance and the action to take if they have cause for concern about a particular patient."

The risks and how to steer clear of them

What is Ebola?

Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe condition which can result in uncontrolled bleeding, causing damage to the patient's vital organs.

How is it transmitted?

The virus is transmitted to people from animals and can spread from human to human through contact with blood and bodily fluids. Contact with objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles has also been linked to the spread of the disease.

Am I at risk in Britain?

The risk to the general British population remains very low.

If I am on a flight with someone with Ebola, what is the risk?

You cannot catch Ebola through social contact or by travelling on a plane with someone who is infected, only through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person.

What precautions can I take?

It is best to avoid infected countries unless travel is absolutely necessary. If you have to travel, avoid health care facilities unless you yourself suspect you may be infected. Keep an eye on friends or family members who have visited infected areas for signs that they might have picked up the disease. If they begin to show signs of fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, a sore throat or a rash, it is important to avoid physical contact with them or their bodily fluids.

What if I think I might have Ebola?

If you feel unwell with symptoms within 21 days of returning from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, you should stay at home and immediately telephone 999 and explain that you have recently visited west Africa.

Keep calm, pleads Spain amid fears deadly virus could spread

Ebola outbreak

SPANISH officials were facing mounting criticism last night over their handling of Europe's first Ebola outbreak.

They admitted they had still not worked out how a nurse became infected with the virus while working at a Madrid hospital.

The European Commission has demanded an urgent explanation from the Spanish authorities of how the infection happened in what was supposed to be a high–security treatment ward.

Spain's health ministry has now put more than 50 people under observation for signs of infection.

The nurse at the centre of the scare was named yesterday as Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, who is believed to have become infected while treating Manuel Garcia Viejo, an elderly Spanish missionary repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone last month.

Three other people, including her husband, were placed in quarantine yesterday, while a further 52 health workers have been put under observation by the health authorities.

While Spanish officials tried to quell public panic, insisting that "all necessary measures were in place to ensure public health", concerns remained about their failure to identify exactly how Ms Romero had become infected.

Like other staff at the specialist isolation unit of Carlos III hospital in Madrid she had been drilled in how to use protective clothing when treating patients, and had apparently only visited Mr Garcia's room twice, once to change his medical nappy and once to clear the room after his death on Sept 25.

"We are complying with the established procedure but we are revising all protocols, including those inside the hospital and those outside," said Rafael Perez–Santamarina, a senior health offi–cial, admitting that the source of the infection was still unknown.

Javier Limon, the husband of the infected nurse, insisted that his wife had stringently "followed regulations" while caring for the missionary priests repatriated with the illness.

"She did everything she was told to, and at no time was she concerned that she could have been infected," he told El Mundo newspaper in a telephone interview from a hospital isolation ward.

Staff at the hospital staged a public protest yesterday, complaining that emergency measures and training on how to look after Mr Garcia and another Ebolainfected priest had not been adequate.

They said they had been issued with substandard overalls which were not entirely impermeable, and that they should also have been given breathing apparatus, although medical experts say the latter is not considered essential as Ebola is not airborne.

Questions have also been raised as to why it took so long to isolate the nurse after she began to feel unwell on Sept 30.

She reportedly contacted health workers to tell them she was suffering from a low fever and fatigue, explaining that she had assisted in the care of the missionaries.

But it was not until she presented herself at her local hospital with a high fever early on Monday that she was finally admitted and tested positive for the haemorrhagic virus.

Spanish officials also took the extra precaution last night of taking away her pet dog to be put down. There are concerns that the dog could have acted as a carrier of the virus.

Ms Romero is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside West Africa, where the virus has claimed nearly 3,500 lives.

The outbreak, which began in Guinea in December, has spread mainly to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, but isolated cases have been reported in Nigeria and Senegal.

Last week a man tested positive in the US after flying to Texas from Liberia. Thomas Eric Duncan has been in a critical condition at a Dallas hospital since Saturday. He was put on a kidney dialysis machine last night.

Yesterday, opposition parties called for the resignation of Ana Mato, the health minister of Spain's conservative government over her handling of the crisis.

A European public health safety committee will meet today to review the situation, amid fears that the Madrid outbreak could spread to other countries.

Zsuzsanna Jakab, the director of the World Health Organisation, predicted that further outbreaks of the Ebola virus would almost inevitably take place in Europe, given the extensive air links between the European capitals and West Africa.

"Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely," Ms Jakab said.

"It is quite unavoidable … that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around."

Passengers travelling from Ebolainfected nations in West Africa currently undergo temperature checks before boarding flights, with anyone registering a thermometer reading of 100.4F (38C) banned from boarding.

But given that the virus has an incubation period of up to three weeks, it is impossible to screen with complete effectiveness.

While some airlines, including British Airways, have suspended direct flights to infected countries, United Nations health chiefs have lobbied for others to remain in operation, arguing that a complete ban on international air travel would hamper the international aid effort.

Despite the Spanish case, Ms Jakab said a widespread outbreak in Europe was unlikely because of the high standard of health services and public sanitation. "The most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk, and the western part of the European region particularly is the best–prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers," she said.

She added that she saw no reason yet for screening at Europe's borders of travellers coming from the affected countries in West Africa, despite plans for such measures in the US.

Market report

and in the GROWING fears about the spread of the Ebola virus sparked a sell–off in travel stocks.

Confirmation that a Spanish nurse has been infected with the deadly disease – the first person outside West Africa to contract Ebola – fuelled worries that airline and other tourism–related companies will be hit by weakening demand for overseas travel.

All of London's travel shares suffered heavy falls. International Airlines Group, the owner of Spanish carrier Iberia, slumped 25.7p, or 6.9pc, to 345.6p, easyJet lost 78p to £13.89 and Carnival, the cruise company, was down 167p at £23.28.

Similarly, InterContinental Hotels Group slid 85p to £22.44, tour operator TUI Travel closed down 15.3p at 382p and, in the FTSE 250, Thomas Cook declined 6.4p to 112.6p.

Investors took fright despite JP Morgan analysts reassuring investors that Ebola, which is spread through contact with infected body fluids, was not a "material risk" unless it became airborne.

The SARS outbreak in 2003 shook airline shares, but investors should not expect Ebola to have the same impact, according to the broker's experts.

"Any comparisons with SARS are misplaced, in our view, given that SARS was an airborne illness relatively easy to contract, and balance sheets were considerably weaker at that time from the aftermath of 9/11," the analysts said.

Nevertheless, the travel sell–off dragged on the wider FTSE 100, which finished 68.07 points lower at 6,495.58, a 1pc decline.

Poor German industrial production data also rattled investors, as did the International Monetary Fund, which cut its forecast for global growth next year. The IMF also warned that "frothy" stock markets were at risk of a correction.

Rio Tinto rose as much as 6.2pc, but ended the day up just 23½p, or 0.8pc, at £30.20½, after Glencore, off 8.3p at 331.05p, said that although it had informally inquired about a merger, it was no longer "actively considering" a deal.

Anglo American, which has in the past been tipped as a potential target of Glencore, rose 27p to £13.75.

Lonmin, the FTSE 250 platinum producer in which Glencore holds a near–25pc stake, added 2.6p to 170½p.

The mid–capper has also previously been buoyed by talk that Glencore might make a takeover approach.

Tesco closed up 5.85p at 182.6p following a report that TPG is interested in buying the grocer's Dunnhumby business, the division behind its Clubcard scheme which is valued at more than £2bn.

Cineworld was lifted 9.3p to 329½p by a show of confidence from chief executive Moshe Greidinger, whose family vehicle, Global City Holdings, lifted its stake to 28.2pc from 26.9pc.

Meanwhile, Cairn Energy was up 3.6p to 183½p on news that its joint venture off the coast of Senegal had struck oil.

Deutsche Bank analyst Lucas Herrmann said the find was "potentially significant" not just for Cairn but for the broader European exploration and production sector, given it "has been a barren period for conventional exploration".

Elsewhere among the energy shares, oil groups Gulf Keystone Petroleum and Genel Energy, which both operate in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, fell 2¾p to 56p and 14½p to 793½p respectively on concerns about the territorial gains made by radical group Islamic State in the country and near the Syrian border with Turkey.

Staying with the day's fallers, telecoms testing group Spirent – down 21.55p, or 21.8pc, to 77.1p in the FTSE 250 – dropped to a five–year low following a warning that third–quarter revenues would miss expectations, which in turn would hit operating profits.

"M&A speculation is likely to increase, and to be the main positive catalyst in the short term," said Investec analyst Roger Phillips.

Back in the FTSE 100, a double downgrade of Schroders by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts knocked the fund manager 55p lower to £22.96.

Cutting to "underperform" from "buy", a move that skipped out the intervening "neutral" rating, the experts warned that Schroders would suffer a 16pc drop in profitability if the European Securities and Markets Authority implemented plans to stop asset managers paying for research with dealing commission.

Finally, a day after Electra Private Equity, 10p cheaper at £25.65, saw off an attempted boardroom coup by activist investor Edward Bramson, attention shifted to the future of his 20pc stake in the investment trust. The shareholding is held by Mr Bramson's Sherborne Investors vehicle.

"It would not be easy simply to walk away and trade out of such a position in the near term without materially impacting the share price," said Numis analyst Charles Cade.

"In any case, Sherborne is seeking to deliver gains from the investment, rather than sell out at the current price. As a result, we believe that it is more likely to add to its stake on weakness, rather than to sell."

Price of cocoa beans becomes 'barometer' for fears over Ebola

ONE of the main ingredients of chocolate has become a key barometer of the Ebola epidemic.

The price of cocoa beans, the raw material from which chocolate is made, has leapt as outbreaks of the lethal virus threaten to spread across West Africa, which is responsible for 70pc of global cocoa production.

The three countries most affected by Ebola – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – are not big commodity exporters. But Ivory Coast, which is the world's largest producer of cocoa, shares a border with Guinea and Liberia. The price of cocoa spiked more than 10pc last month on concerns that the virus could spread through the region.

"The Ebola epidemic is, of course, first and foremost a human tragedy. As the human toll rises, so too does the risk of the virus spreading further," said Hamish Smith, a commodities economist at Capital Economics.

"Overall, unless the virus spreads far more widely, the risks to commodity markets should be limited to cocoa and perhaps bauxite." Signs that the outbreak could move further are likely to be interpreted by markets as a threat to cocoa production, causing the price of the commodity to rise again.

Supplies of bauxite, used in the production of aluminium, have already been disrupted in Guinea, where miners have sent staff home and restricted access to some facilities in an attempt to prevent transfer of the virus.

Since the beginning of the current Ebola outbreak at the end of 2013, there have been more than twice as many as all previous incidents combined since 1976.

Michael Lewis, global head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank, said: "[Ebola] is not only leading to curtailing labour mobility around the region, but it has also led to panic buying and food shortages."

Most large producers of chocolate will have derivative contracts to hedge against the risk of increased costs. But some companies, including Nestle, have already been stung by the rising price of chocolate ingredients this year, for reasons unrelated to Ebola. The prices of other components, including hazelnuts and milk, have soared, squeezing the profitability of the Swiss company's chocolate division.

Jean–Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, told Bloomberg: "Nestle's last set of results raised some concerns about the confectionery division as profitability fell." Nestle is due to report next week.

Excalibur, the 12-year-old rescue dog of infected nurse Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, destroyed as precautionary measure in battle to limit spread of Ebola in Spain

The dog owned by the Spanish nurse who became the first person to contract Ebola in Europe was on Wednesday night put down by order of health officials in Madrid despite a furious campaign by animal lovers.

Excalibur, the 12-year-old rescue dog of infected nurse Maria Teresa Romero Ramos and her husband Javier Limon, was destroyed as a precautionary measure by authorities battling to limit the spread of Ebola.

But the decision enraged animal rights protesters who had clashed with police as they blockaded the apartment building in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon where the dog had been locked up since both his owners were quarantined.

Campaigners had hoped for a last minute reprieve after the rector of the Complutense University of Madrid – where Excalibur was ordered to be taken to be destroyed – refused to allow the dog to be "sacrificed" there.

A petition, organised online at change.org was approaching 400,000 signatures. A Facebook page, set up to campaign on the animal's behalf, had over 86,000 "likes" and the Twitter hashtag "Save Excalibur" - #SalvarExcalibur – was being widely spread. Over 120,000 tweets mentioning the mongrel were sent in the past 24 hours.

The fate of the dog became a flashpoint in a city where anger was mounting over the authorities handling of the Ebola outbreak.

Mr Limon highlighted the dog's case in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Mundo, in which he begged the vets not to destroy the animal.

"The dog is fine," he said. "Are they going to put me to sleep, too?"

World experts on Ebola have argued that the dog should be kept alive, even if infected, so that more can be understood about the virus.

"I would recommend keeping him in quarantine and under observation in a specific site – but not killing him," said Eric Leroy, who studied Ebola transmission between dogs and humans in Gabon in 2001.

"It's a precious opportunity to see if dogs can play a key role in the propagation of Ebola."

Annimal charity PETA said: "PETA is sad to hear that a dearly loved dog was destroyed because of the Ebola scare, even though no one can point to any evidence that dogs can transmit Ebola and efforts could have been made to quarantine him.

"The last thing that this nurse needs is to learn that a family member has been lost, even if, as we all hope, her own life is saved. We appeal for common sense and mercy to prevail if such a case arises in the future."

What next for America's efforts to control Ebola?

With the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil, David Millward and Peter Foster look at how authorities are trying to halt the spread of Ebola in the United States

America[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/] 's first fatality from Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] has intensified determination to stop the spread of the virus in Texas, where Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed - and in West Africa, where he was infected.

Duncan, a Liberian, had been in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas since September 28.

He had been receiving brincidofovir, an experimental drug which had been given emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration. But he had been initially discharged by a hospital after complaining of a fever, only to return days later.

In Texas the key task will be to contain the virus by tracking people who had been in contact with Duncan.

Dr David Lakey, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services commissioner, said the coming week would be critical.

“We’re monitoring with extreme vigilance,” he said. “If a contact develops symptoms, we will tell you.”

Dr Lakey’s officials are monitoring 48 potential contacts to see if they have displayed signs of the disease.

Some hospitals in the United States have already started running Ebola drills to ensure they can handle a patient with the disease without allowing the virus to spread.

The United States is also stepping up screening of airline passengers arriving at the country’s airports from west African countries where the Ebola outbreak has been at its most virulent. Passengers will be screened at five of the country’s major airports: JFK in New York, Washington Dulles, Newark, Chicago O’Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta.

Passengers from three countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - will be screened.

Another challenge is to ensure the disease does not spread as his body is dealt with.

“The body remains infectious for up to 72 hours after the patient has expired,” said Dr Frank Glover director of the Urology Institute and Continence Centre in Georgia.

He said in Liberia bodies have been cremated rather than embalmed or buried to reduce the risk of infection spreading to health workers.

But he warned that containing the disease in Liberia was an almost impossible task.

“The Liberian health system has been decimated by the war.

“There are only 200 beds to treat ebola patients and 90 per cent are being turned away because there are no beds to treat them.

“We are not able to build treatment centres fast enough to keep up with the virus.”

John Kerry, the American Secretary of State, appealed to countries to step up their efforts to contain the disease.

Standing alongside Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Kerry said more equipment and personnel were needed straight away.

"While we are making progress, we are not where we can say that we need to be. And there is additional – there are additional needs that have to be met in order for the global community to be able to properly respond to this challenge, and to make sure that we protect people in all of our countries," he said.

"There are specific needs, and I want to emphasize those needs by showing a few slides, if I can. As you’ll see in the first slide to my left here, we need more countries to move resources of specific kinds.

"It is not just a question of sending people, though it is vital to send people. But we need Ebola treatment units. We need health care workers. We need medevac capacity."

He also pleaded with airlines not to stop flights to West Africa, to ensure doctors and medical staff could be flown in to bolster the drive to prevent the crisis worsening.

Mr Hammond added: "We now need, as the secretary has said, the wider international community to step up to the plate and deliver that additional resource, not just money, but trained medical and clinical personnel to lead that effort on the ground.

"We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.

"The disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders. We have to get ahead of this disease, but if we get ahead of it, if we rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it.

"We know how to do this. It is not complicated to do. It just requires a large focus of resource and effort to deliver it."

Meanwhile the Pentagon said that up to 4,000 US troops will be sent to the region to control the outbreak.

Healthy boy barred from UK school amid Ebola 'hysteria'

A school is forced to cancel the visit of a charity worker and her son following opposition from 'ignorant' parents who feared their children would catch Ebola

A healthy 9-year-old boy from Sierra Leone who has been banned from attending a school in Stockport amid parents’ fears about their children catching Ebola has said he feels “rejected” and "upset".

Despite being screened by the Health Protection Agency and given the lowest risk level possible, the school barred Kofi Mason-Sesay from lessons after a “misguided hysteria” swept through parents.

Head teacher Elizabeth Inman wrote to parents on Tuesday to say that "with a very heavy heart" the school had taken "the pragmatic decision" to stop the visit.

Kofi was due to study at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Hazel Grove, Stockport, this month while his mother was in the UK on fundraising duties for EducAid, an education charity in Sierra Leone.

He said: “I was really surprised and I felt bad because they [have] never rejected me before. I am kind of upset about what they have done.”

“It is not really the head teacher’s fault, just the parents, they are the ones who are most worried.”

Kofi said he has never had problems on previous visits to the UK, adding: “It is just now that we know the crisis of Ebola is here, the problem is coming.

“It really has changed people’s attitudes. Now you can’t go anywhere if you are from areas which have recently had Ebola, you can’t go near people because they will just reject you.”

Miriam Mason-Sesay, who is British but has lived in Sierra Leone since 2000 where she is Country Director for EducAid, said her son has been treated like a "leper", adding that the school’s decision was down to “ignorant” parents.

"Unfortunately, there was so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act," she said.

"We've been met with leper-type attitudes from wealthy people overreacting and trying to protect themselves from a threat which isn't there."

Last year Ms Mason-Sesay, 48, was awarded an MBE for her outstanding contribution to education and charitable work, and was made a Member of the Order of the Rokel by the President of Sierra Leone.

“If Kofi is home educated for a month it is not the end of the world. It is the bigger picture that is the problem,” she said.

“If we are being treated like this, how will others from Sierra Leone be treated, how will West Africans be treated?

“The idea that Ebola is lurking behind every flipping tree and is out to get to you is absolute nonsense.

“There is a willingness [among some parents] to believe that ‘what we should do is hunt him [Kofi] down, protect our own and sod the rest’.

Last month the school had tried to reassure parents that the forthcoming visit posed no risk to the pupils of contracting the disease.

The school took advice from health officials in the borough and passed on Public Health England's guidance that anyone travelling from affected countries who were free of symptoms was not infectious.

Ms Inman said: "I understand that there is a lot of misinformation about how Ebola is spread. A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears.

“As you know, I always listen to parents. Ebola cannot be spread as some parents have suggested.

“Of course I would never endanger any child or colleague and I have to put my trust in the professionals.

“It is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit. The misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience."

The head suggested to parents that a sizeable donation should be made instead to EducAid to recognise its work in a country "which has received more than its share of setbacks".

Experts have said the chances of it spreading in the UK are 'very low' - and there has been just one imported case from a medic who was treating patients in Sierra Leone.

A nurse in Madrid is the first person to have contracted the virus outside of West Africa after treating two missionaries who returned home to Spain from the region.

How can a nurse in an Ebola treatment ward become infected?

The main danger point is not while wearing protective gear, but while taking it off

Watching a medic robing up before entering an Ebola treatment ward, it is hard to imagine how they could possibly end up being infected by the virus.

As the video above shows, the process takes nearly 20 minutes, and involves donning up to four different sets of gloves, overalls and masks, the idea being to leave absolutely no patch of skin uncovered. As an additional precaution, each set of clothing is bound with tape and ligaments to prevent it slipping loose, and before any medic enters the ward, a "buddy" medic checks over their uniform to ensure every seal is perfect.

Yet no amount of protection is a complete guarantee of safety, as has been proved by the case of the Spanish nurse who has become infected with the virus at a hospital at Madrid's La Paz-Carlos III hospital. The nurse, Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, was part of a 30-strong medical team that was treating two elderly Spanish missionaries who died of Ebola shortly after they were repatriated from Africa. All the staff were experienced medics who had had training for how to deal with the virus safely. So how could it have happened?

The answer may lie in the nature of Ms Romero's duties in the Ebola ward, which included disposing of the soiled medical nappies worn by her patient, who, like most Ebola carriers, would have been suffering near-constant vomiting and diarhhoea. This is potentially the most dangerous job in any Ebola ward, as faeces and vomit are two main conduits for the virus, and can infect anyone whose skin comes into contact with them.

The main risk, though, comes not during the ward rounds itself, but afterwards, when taking off clothing that may have become contaminated. At that point, the multiple layers of protective attire are supposed to act in a kind of Russian-doll fashion, ensuring that as the outer layers of clothing is disposed of, there is still some residual protection from inner layers. But medics say that even with a "buddy" watching over them once again, it is possible to become accidentally infected during the disrobing procedure, especially if the protective garb is heavily soiled.

Whichever way it happened, the Spanish nurse's case demonstrates that even the most stringent procedures are not entirely foolproof. Medicins Sans Frontieres, the main aid agency in the frontline of the fight against Ebola, used to pride itself on how none of its international staff had ever been infected while treating patients for the disease. Last month, however, that record came to an end when a medic tested positive while working at a clinic in Liberia.

Spanish Ebola case: 'I am due to treat the patient. But I have no idea what to do'

A doctor who will treat Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who has contracted Ebola, has launched a scathing attack on his country's training procedures

A senior doctor at the Madrid hospital where the Spanish nurse infected with Ebola[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] is being treated has warned that staff are not sufficiently trained to deal with the virus.

His warning comes as the sixth person in Spain was put into quarantine on Wednesday morning.

Dr Santiago Yus, a specialist in intensive care with more than 30 years experience at the hospital where the six isolated patients are being treated, claimed medics have received only minimal training.

"Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I will be expected to treat the Ebola patient and nobody has even taught me to put on the protective suit," he said in an interview with Spain's daily El Mundo newspaper.

"I am not ready, I am not trained. And it's the same with my colleagues."

He said that he and other doctors had been given a ten-minute briefing on management of Ebola patients and shown some photographs on a wall. Two months ago they were given a demonstration on how to put on the protective suit.

"A doctor and a nurse put the suit on and took it off. The training was and is absolutely insufficient," he said.

The warning will set off alarm bells as Spain's public health officials struggle to quell panic after a fourth nurse in Madrid – who like Maria Teresa Romero Ramos had cared for an infected Spanish missionary – was quarantined with suspected symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus.

In addition to the four nurses, Mrs Romero's husband is in quarantine, as is an engineer who returned to Spain from Nigeria.

Dr Yus is among fifteen health workers at the Carlos III hospital who have made a formal complaint to management about their lack of training in the face of the current crisis.

Mrs Romero was transferred to a specialist isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital on Monday night after testing positive for the haemorrhagic fever, becoming the first case of contracting Ebola virus outside West Africa.

It is still unclear how exactly she was infected with the virus while she was part of a team treating two missionaries repatriated from West Africa.

But sources close to the investigation into how the infection occurred have suggested Mrs Romero may not have followed proper procedure when removing her protective suit after coming into contact with the second Ebola patient.

Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69 died at the Madrid hospital on September 25, five days after being airlifted from Sierra Leone.

Miguel Pajares, 74, died there in August after his repatriation from Liberia.

Ebola conspiracy theories: separating fact from fiction

Not everything you hear about Ebola is true. Here are five myths and conspiracy theories about the disease

As the world faces the biggest Ebola outbreak[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] since the deadly virus was first discovered in Central Africa in 1976, health officials in Britain have warned of a “real risk” that it could soon hit the UK.

With cases already reported in the United States - last week, a man was admitted to a Dallas hospital[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11132703/US-Ebola-case-doctors-confirm-they-are-treating-patient-in-Dallas.html] after traveling from West Africa - and Spain, where a nurse who treated a missionary from Sierra Leone has become the first person to contract the disease outside Africa, the NHS has been put on standby, with four key hospitals identified as units to take patients with Ebola, should the need arise.

Though Ebola is a rare and often fatal virus that results in non-specific symptoms, and for which there is no definitive cure, this doesn’t mean the end of the world is nigh.

Here are five myths surrounding Ebola that need debunking.

1) You can catch Ebola from drinking water

False. Human-to-human transmission of the Ebola virus is transmitted principally by direct physical contact with an ill person - not happen through drinking the same water or breathing the same air. So in a West African village, the water supply isn’t going to contaminate all its residents, nor will airplane passengers be infected through the aircon. Ebola is, in fact, not the easiest of diseases to catch. For humans to contract the virus requires direct contact with bodily fluids, blood and secretions. Humans are not infectious until they develop the fever-like symptoms.

2) If you catch Ebola, you will bleed from your eyes and nose

False. Though some patients do haemorrhage - the virus’s correct name is EVD (Ebola haemorrhagic fever) - many do not. In fact, the disease often starts out looking like a case of flu. The image of people drowning in their own blood, undoubtedly, is a terrifying one, but it is not a true or definitive representation of all Ebola cases.

3) Ebola outbreaks are uncontrollable

False. Previous outbreaks of Ebola have been brought under control. Since the first reported case of the disease in 1976, there have been over 25 recorded outbreaks – all of which have been contained. Infrastructure and medical resources are vital in controlling the disease, which is why it has spread so rapidly in West Africa. If it were to hit our shores[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11010135/If-Ebola-was-in-the-UK-wed-cure-it-says-leading-doctor.html], the outbreak would be manageable.

4) Survivors are infectious for years

False. The Ebola virus actually disappears from a survivor's bloodstream surprisingly quickly. It has been known to linger in breast milk and semen for longer – sometimes up to three months - but not years.

5) Ebola is the deadliest disease in the world

Again, false. Though the current outbreak has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 to date, it is by no means the deadliest disease in Africa, let alone the world. HIV, malaria, diarrhoea and many other infectious illnesses all are bigger killers than Ebola. An Ebola diagnosis is not a guaranteed death sentence.

Ebola: Could virus's spread cause financial market turmoil?

As stocks are hit by fears, analysts say market effect could be bigger than that of SARS a decade ago

What to watch

The spread of Ebola beyond West Africa could lead to turmoil on international financial markets on a greater scale than the SARS outbreak a decade ago, economists have warned.

Analysts at Barclays warned that the continued spread of the deadly virus would hit global growth and "have a significant impact on global financial markets".

This week, a Spanish nurse became the first person to contract Ebola outside of Africa[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11147947/Spanish-nurse-I-have-no-idea-how-I-contracted-Ebola.html] .

It had previously been largely confined to areas of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

On Wednesday, the FTSE 100 fell with several stocks slumping on fears about the outbreak, extending an Ebola-related sell-off seen on Tuesday[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/11145573/Travel-shares-drop-on-Ebola-fears.html] .

"Ebola's likelihood of spreading to larger, more integrated economies has increased," Barclays' Marvin Barth said.

He said that although the crisis has had little impact on the global economy to date, "the current outbreak in West Africa may be changing that".

"It remains a tail risk, but has jumped in probability to one that can no longer be ignored," Mr Barth added.

The Ebola outbreak has drawn comparisons with Asia's outbreak of the airborne SARS virus in 2003.

According to Barclays, "the economic impact was short lived", but real, with a pronounced fall in retail sales, tourism and China's stock exchange.

"[Ebola] afflicted countries' relatively small weight in global GDP, trade and financial markets so far has limited Ebola's effects on global markets despite an already larger-than-SARS death toll," Barclays said.

Whether the crisis causes market turmoil, according to the analysts, depends on its reach outside of Africa. If the virus becomes endemic in its current locations, this would greatly increase this threat.

"A sustained outbreak in a larger or more globally integrated economy likely would have a significant impact on global markets," Mr Barth said. "That endemicity of Ebola to West Africa, or even a larger outbreak, greatly increases the chances of the disease breaking out to other more economically integrated economies, is evident in the fact that cases have already been confirmed in Dallas, Texas, and Madrid, Spain.

"The difference with SARS would be that the persistence of a large human host reservoir would mean any panic may not fade as rapidly."

</br>The economists said investors should watch three things to assess the impact of Ebola on financial markets

• Whether the virus expands within West Africa

• Whether it becomes increasingly contagious

• How successful countries outside of West Africa are at dealing with periodic cases

Photos emerge of 'isolation' methods used at Spanish hospital before nurse with Ebola was transferred to specialist care

This is the front line in the battle to stop the spread of Ebola across Europe: A screen pulled across a hospital bed, in the corner of an emergency room.

Two lines of flimsy tape with a warning sign are the only barrier to infection.

Medical staff at the Alcorcon hospital, in southwestern Madrid – where Teresa Romero Ramos who tested positive to the deadly Ebola virus on Monday was first treated – have complained of insufficient measures to prevent infection.

They said that for the first 24 hours that she was treated in the hospital, staff with no training in dealing with isolation cases were responsible for her care, while she was treated behind a curtain like any other patient.

Mrs Romero was transferred to her local hospital by ambulance during the early hours of Monday morning and remained in a curtained area of the emergency department until being transferred to a specialist isolation unit at the Carlos III hospital in Madrid late on Monday night.

“It is clear that there has been a massive failure in the prevention and identification of the Ebola case and this needs to be urgently investigated,” the disgruntled worker who took the damning photos told the Telegraph.

Asking to remain anonymous, he said that hospital staff were very worried about the risk of infection.

“There has been a tremendous lack of information given to hospital staff," he said.

"There has been no general meeting called to tell us what we should do. We do not know if we run or ran the risk of contagion. Some workers have been put under observation but none have been quarantined."

Ebola-hit London Mining warns investors will be wiped out

Aim listed miner warns there is no value in the equity of the company as it struggles with debts following a slump in iron ore prices and the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone

Debt-ridden London Mining this morning warned that there would be little or no value remaining in its shares as a result of financing proposals with potential strategic investors.

Shares in the Aim-listed iron ore miner crashed last week after it admitted it will run out of money to service its only operating mine in Sierra Leone if it does not raise new financing.

The desperate position follows a spat with commodities giant Glencore over the pricing of an iron ore supply contract, which is said to have put a squeeze on its short-term cash position.

The shares of the company closed at a record low of 4p last week - a huge fall considering they were trading at a high of 432p in 2011.

London Mining is in talks with a strategic investor but any deal will wipe out investors undet the proposed rescue terms.

"Under the structures currently proposed, the Board believes that there will be little or no value remaining in the equity of the Company and the other listed securities of the group", London Mining said.

"The capital that is needed from such an investor is significant and the proposals currently contemplate funding of the life of mine expansion and a cash injection into Marampa to allow the mine to continue operating," the company said.

London Mining has a total debt pile of $310m (£190.6m) with a consortium of banks.Conversations are taking place with trade finance bank Afreximbank, which has agreed a $30m two-year financing facility, but this is “not expected to be available in the required time period with discussions on structure ongoing”, the company said.

Indian conglomerate Jindal has reportedly been weighing a takeover deal which could allow the group to cut costs.

Iron ore is at its lowest level since 2009 which has piled pressure on the group's Marampa mine. The outbreak of Eola in Sierra Leone has also piled pressure on the group.

In June the group moved its "non-essential" staff out of Sierra Leone.

The outbreak could cost it an additional $1 per tonne of iron ore produced in 2014 and force a reduction in drilling.

As the Government announces that it will send 100 army medics to Sierra Leone, find out how the military is preparing to combat spread of the disease

The Government has announced that it will send more than 100 army medics to Sierra Leone to help tackle the Ebola crisis. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/]

Members of the British Army's 22 Field Hospital have been undergoing special training in a hangar in Strensall near York, practicing the various containment procedures in a mock-up field hospital before their deployment to West Africa.

However, despite the extensive training the army medics have undertaken, UK health authorities have insisted that the systems already in place in British hospitals to prevent the spread of infection are adequate should Ebola reach the UK.

The British field medics will set up a field hospital in Sierra Leone designated to the treatment of medics who have been contaminated by the virus, not the general public.

The months-long outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 3,500 people.

How should Nato respond to the Islamic State?

Big Question: As former Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg settles in as head of Nato, he will have to decide how to respond to new global threats

When Jens Stoltenberg took over as Secretary-General of Nato last week, he found the organisation in a new phase of its existence.

There is no longer a question mark over its future, but instead several over its direction. Vladamir Putin's actions in eastern Europe and the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/](Isil) have seen Nato shed its image as a Cold War dinosaur.

The challenge for Mr Stoltenberg will not be finding a mission for Nato, but deciding the missions in which to deploy troops from the western military alliance.

Is Russia a threat?

For Nato's central European members in particular, the Russian involvement in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea have raised questions about Putin's desire for expansion. Nato has already started to respond. It has reinforced its air policing mission over the Baltic States, which continues as successive member states take a turn in maintaining the integrity of the Baltic States airspace. Nato countries have also pledged to undertake far more military exercises on the territories of eastern members, signalling the alliance’s commitment to collective defence.

This should deter further expansion of Russia, but will leave the question of Ukraine unresolved and do little to settle the lasting question of membership within the Caucasus. Here Mr Stoltenberg will be forced to steer the organisation through the issue of Nato membership for the likes of Georgia and others.

Where does Nato fit in the fight against Isil?

Although the current coalition of states engaged in military strikes against Isil is not affiliated to Nato, the fact that Turkey borders both Iraq and Syria means the organisation will remain an interested party. As the key border town of Kobane continues to come under seige, their interest is likely to peak significantly.

Mr Stoltenberg is not completely removed from the fight, however. Nato has already deployed the Patriot air defence system to combat any use of ballistic missiles and their involvement could broaden as Turkey looks more and more likely to enter the battle.

Should Nato join the fight against the Islamic State?[http://polldaddy.com/poll/8357275/]

What if Islamic terrorism spreads into Africa?

Nato remains committed to supporting the African Union (AU) and concern remains about terrorism in the Horn of Africa. Here Mr Stoltenberg’s challenging task will be to offer substantial support to the AU without becoming embroiled in complex and potentially dangerous African operations.

There is historically little appetite among Nato members to become engaged in an African conflict - whether to fight terrorism or not. But another African issue could demand Mr Stoltenberg's attention.

Ebola. What will Nato do to help?

The deadliest outbreak of the Ebola virus in history has generally been dealt with on a nation to nation basis. With the situation continuing to worsen, there may be a call for greater military assistance to west Africa in the form of medics and engineers to help staff and build the necessary medical infrastructure. So far both the United States and the United Kingdom have deployed personnel but further support looks like it is needed.

Whilst the AU would the more obvious provider of regional support, the capabilities of Nato members may well mean that these are either offered as a seperate mission. The difficulty for Mr Stoltenberg will lie in charting a route through the potential political minefield so that the situation can be ameliorated.

Is Nato’s involvement in Afghanistan at an end?

Although Nato is in the process of withdrawing its forces from combat operations in Afghanistan, it retains a limited in developing the Afghan forces and the Afghan state. This is likely to continue for some time and Mr Stoltenberg’s task will be to help encourage the Afghan government to reform itself further, reduce corruption and achieve some form of agreement with elements of the Taliban.

How can Nato afford to do all that?

At Nato's latest summit in Wales, members pledged to reverse the relative decline in their respective defence budgets to help cope with global threats. With a few exceptions including the US and Britain, Nato members now spend less than 2 percent of their GDP on defence. They have pledged to meet the long-standing 2 percent target within a decade but getting them to adhere to this pledge will be challenging.

Mr Stoltenberg will however be assisted by his Norwegian roots. Norway has already started to increase its defence budget in response to the situation in the Ukraine.

The three countries to watch here are Germany, which announced further cuts after the summit, France, which is below the 2 per cent threshold, and the United Kingdom, which is scheduled to fall below 2 per cent in the next couple of years. If he can get these three Nato members to up their defence spending, his time as Secretary-General will be successful.

A SPANISH nurse has tested positive for Ebola in what is the first case of the deadly virus being contracted outside of Africa.

The woman, whose name has not been made public, has tested positive in two initial tests, health authority sources told local media.

The Spanish nurse presented herself to a hospital near her home in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon with a high fever yesterday morning.

It is understood that she was part of the medical team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo, a Spanish missionary priest who died of the virus at a Madrid hospital less than a fortnight ago after being evacuated from Sierra Leone. Mr Garcia Viejo, 69, died from Ebola on Sept 25, four days after being repatriated.

The first Spanish victim of Ebola was another priest, Miguel Pajares, 75, who died on Aug 12 despite receiving the experimental ZMapp drug while being treated at Madrid's Carlos III hospital after being repatriated from Liberia.

Both priests were members of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Roman Catholic group that runs a charity working with Ebola victims in Africa.

Spain's ministry of health called an emergency meeting yesterday.

"The woman arrived at the University Hospital in Alcorcon suffering a high fever," a ministry of health source told Spain's daily El Mundo newspaper. "The first test came back positive."

The hospital where the woman was being treated launched emergency protocols for dealing with contagious diseases. Meanwhile in America, the US–British cameraman who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia arrived by private plane for treatment at the Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha, the largest biocontainment hospital in the country. Ashoka Mukpo, 33, is thought to have become infected when he was splashed as he spray–cleaned a vehicle in which a victim had died.

His mother, Diana Mukpo, who went to school with the Princess Royal and now runs a dressage centre in the US, and father, Mitchell Levy, a leading doctor, spoke of their relief that their "strongwilled" son was receiving treatment. Dr Levy said he had told Mr Mukpo he was "crazy" to go to Liberia.

A graduate of the London School of Economics, Mr Mukpo had been working for an NGO for two years in the west African nation before returning home to the US state of Rhode Island in May. He went back to Liberia last month, against his parents' wishes, in order to volunteer at an Ebola clinic, only to contract the disease last week.

Asked how Mr Mukapo was feeling, his mother said: "He's enormously relieved to be here. He's still quite frightened but he is hanging in and he shares in the relief of his family that he is able to come back for good medical care here."

The current Ebola outbreak is believed to have infected about 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths in west Africa, according to estimates by the World Health Organisation, with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea the worst hit.

The Ebola virus is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids – blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen – of an infected person who is showing symptoms. It causes fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

Ebola-infected nurse 'followed regulations', husband says

The Spanish nurse who became the first person to contract the Ebola virus in Europe is named as Teresa Romero Ramos as three more people are hospitalised

The husband of the infected nurse who became the first person to contract the deadly Ebola virus in Europe has insisted that his wife stringently “followed regulations” while caring for the missionary priests who had the illness.

“She did everything she was told to, and at no time was she concerned that she could have been infected,” Javier Lemon, the nurse’s husband, said in a telephone interview with daily Spanish El Mundo newspaper from the hospital isolation where he has been quarantined.

His wife Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, has 15 years experience as a nurse in Madrid.

It is not yet clear how exactly she contracted the virus except that she was part of a special team that cared for a Spanish missionary priest who died of Ebola last month after being repatriated from Sierra Leone.

The couple were due to go on holiday the day after the priest died, explained her husband. But they delayed it because he had inured his leg.

“She decided instead to spend a few days with her mother and then on September 30 she began to feel unwell,” the husband said.

Angry with health authorities, the quarantined man complained that he had been told his dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier, would have to be put down because it had shared close contact with his wife.

“I won’t give permission, and they said that if I don’t they will get a court order to kill the dog. What next, will they sacrifice me too?”

His wife is believed to have been carrying the deadly virus for more than a week before being diagnosed on Monday after becoming infected while caring for missionaries who had returned to Spain from Sierra Leone.

Four people, including the nurse, have now been hospitalised and are being monitored for potential contagion of the deadly disease, Spain's health authorities said on Tuesday.

Officials for Madrid's health system told a press conference those hospitalised included the nurse's husband, a traveller from one affected country and another health worker.

The nurse is currently being treated with antibodies from previous infected patients in the hope of providing a cure, including blood from a Spanish missionary nun who was evacuated from Liberia in August and survived Ebola.

Another 21 medical staff who came into contact with the infected nurse when she was admitted into hospital in the early hours of Monday are also being monitored for signs of the virus.

"If appropriate containment measures were adopted this really should not have happened," said Jonathan Ball, a virology professor at the University of Notthingham. "It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again."

"As the African outbreak perfectly illustrates, healthcare workers put their life on the line, so everything should be done to ensure that risks are minimised as much as possible," he said.

"That is why it is so important for the international community to ramp up their efforts to combat this deadly disease."

The European Union has also demanded an explanation from Spain as to how she could have become infected.

In comments to Britain's Science Media Centre, experts said protective suits worn by health workers, coupled with safe disposal of patients' bodily waste, substantially reduced the risk.

"The recent report of a Spanish nurse who has contracted the virus... is of concern as it suggests that the barrier methods and training were not sufficient to protect healthcare workers and prevent secondary infection," said virology professor David Evans of the University of Warwick.

Ebola, which is contracted through contact with infected bodily fluids, has killed more than 3,400 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

The delay in diagnosing the illness has raised serious questions over the ability of Spain’s health service to contain the virus after the controversial repatriation of the two elderly missionaries.

Ana Mato, the Spanish Health Minister urged people to remain calm, insisting that “all possible measures” were in place to guarantee public safety.

An investigation has been launched in an attempt to determine exactly how the nurse contracted the virus while working within strict guidelines set up at the specialist unit where the repatriated missionaries were treated.

She had access to Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, the missionary who died on September 25, five days after being repatriated from Sierra Leone, on only two occasions, Madrid’s health chief confirmed.

The first was to treat him during his illness and the second was after he died when she entered the room to collect materials for disposal.

Staff at the hospital have expressed concern that standards designed to keep the virus in check were not sufficient. They complain that the protective suits issued to the medical team treating the missionaries were sub-standard because they were not completely impermeable and did not include separate breathing apparatus.

Oxford University head attacks 'vainglorious' politicians

Prof Andrew Hamilton, the head of Oxford University, calls for major reforms of the student visa system as he criticises an obsession with political "point scoring"

The vice-chancellor of Oxford launched an attack on “vainglorious” politicians today as he called for more foreign students to be allowed to take courses at UK universities.

In a highly-critical intervention, Prof Andrew Hamilton warned that MPs were more interested in political point-scoring than addressing the fundamental problems facing Britain’s higher education system.

He said “hostile” visa restrictions prevented large numbers of bright foreign students starting courses in the UK, insisting current rules should be relaxed to boost admissions from countries such as China and India.

Prof Hamilton also criticised continuing underinvestment in higher education, saying Britain spent less on universities than almost every other European country.

But in his annual oration to academics, he said he had “limited expectation” that effective policies on higher education would be developed in the run-up to the general election because “vainglorious” politicians are too obsessed with “point-scoring on past crimes and misdemeanours”.

In further remarks, he also spoke of the importance of education for its own sake, rather than simply to get a job, saying Oxford reserved “the right to investigate subjects of no practical use whatsoever”.

The comments come just a day after Prof John O’Keefe, winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine, described Britain’s immigration system as a “very, very large obstacle” that prevented universities recruiting world-class scientists.

According to figures, students from outside the EU bring £7 billion into the British economy every year through fees and living expenses. In all, almost 300,000 were in the UK in 2012/13 – accounting for a third of all arrivals to the country.

But research from Universities UK has found that the number of non-EU students starting courses in Britain has fallen recently, from 174,225 in 2010/11 to 171,910 two years later.

The number of enrolments from India plummeted 49 per cent over this period alone.

Prof Hamilton said: “Wherever I travel in the world, particularly in China and India, one question persists. Why has the UK adopted a visa system so hostile to student entry?

“I do my best to answer but, frankly, the question baffles me as well.

“For the first time in decades, the number of international students at our universities has dropped, most markedly from India. Why are we doing this to them – and to ourselves?

“The excellence of UK higher education is, in crude material terms, an attractive commodity in the world market. Why, at a time of continued economic constraint, are we limiting one of our most effective generators of overseas revenue?”

Prof Hamilton said Oxford produced “huge public benefit” by leading major research into global health concerns over malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and lately Ebola while providing significant investment in the regional economy.

But he said this was “sadly, benefit which far outstrips the level of public investment in our sector”.

He quoted figures showing just 0.9 per cent of UK gross domestic product was spent on higher education – below the international average and among the lowest in Europe. He said the budget for research was “equally dismaying”, at 1.72 per cent of GDP, compared with an EU average of 2.06 per cent and 2.79 per cent in the US.

The message “does appear to have been getting through” but it is “still all too rare to hear higher education described, accurately, as just about the most important investment a nation can make on behalf of its citizens”, he said.

“That’s why I have somewhat limited expectation, come the general election, that properly developed policies on higher education – as opposed to vainglorious point-scoring on past crimes and misdemeanours – will take up much of the politicians’ time or attention.

“That’s sad, because it is exactly the sort of issue on which a real effort to find a new, meaningful consensus between the parties would be of immense benefit – benefit, of course, to the students and to the universities of the future, but also, as I hope to have demonstrated this morning, hugely beneficial to the public good.”

In further comments, Prof Hamilton also said it was important to pursue education and research for their own sake – not to hit a political or economic goal.

He quoted the example of the university’s earth sciences department which recently estimated the body masses of 426 species of dinosaur, adding: “Now, unless you’re a budgerigar wishing to trace your family tree, that information is of precisely zero practical value. Yet it’s brilliant research and, somehow, I feel better just for knowing it.”

Prof Hamilton said: “At Oxford, we reserve the right to investigate subjects of no practical use whatsoever.”

Transmission of the deadly virus from an infected priest treated in Madrid to a health worker is the first time it has been contracted outside Africa

A Spanish nurse has tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus, in what is the first case of the virus being contracted outside of Africa.

The 44-year-old woman, whose name has not been made public, has tested positive to two tests, health authority sources confirmed.

She was admitted to a hospital near her home in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon with a high fever on Monday morning and was said to be in a “stable condition”.

Spain’s heath ministry confirmed that she was part of the medical team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo, a Spanish missionary priest who died of the virus at a Madrid hospital 11 days ago after been evacuated from Sierra Leone.

Mr Garcia Viejo, 69, was the second person in Europe to die from Ebola after being repatriated from West Africa. He died on September 25, four days after being airlifted to Spain.

The first was Miguel Pajares, 75, a Spanish missionary priest who died on Aug 12 despite receiving the experimental ZMapp drug while he was being treated at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital after being repatriated from Liberia.

Both were members of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Roman Catholic group that runs a charity working with Ebola victims in Africa.

Spain’s Ministry of Health called an emergency meeting on Monday evening before making a televised statement.

Authorities confirmed that 30 health workers who had been in contact with the missionary were now under observation and that they were working hard to determine who else may be at risk.

“All measures have been taken to give the best care to the patient, and guarantee the safety of all citizens,” Ana Mato, the Spanish Health Minister, said.

“We are working hard to verify the source of infection,” she added.

Antonio Alemany, head of health care for the Madrid region, explained that the infected nurse had not been into work since the day after the death of the second Spanish priest because she had been on annual leave. She had started to feel unwell on September 30, he said.

“We have already begun to determine all those who may have had contact with her during this period,” he said, adding that her husband was being monitored.

The hospital where the woman was being treated launched emergency protocol for dealing with contagious diseases.

The current Ebola outbreak is believed to have infected around 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 people in West Africa according to estimates by the World Health Organisation, with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea the worst hit.

The Ebola virus is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids - blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen - of an infected person who is showing symptoms.
