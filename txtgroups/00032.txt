Some things are indeed automatic as Miranda Lambert won the first trophy of the night at the 48th annual Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday in Nashville.

Wearing a bright blue minidress, Lambert accepted single of the year for Automatic as presenter Steven Tyler applauded. Later in the evening, she struck gold again, winning album for Platinum. Lambert had received nine nominations in seven categories, including female vocalist, where she was trying for a record-setting fifth consecutive win.

Follow Your Arrow, by last year's best new artist Kacey Musgraves, took home song of the year -- a bit of a surprise given its lyrics that address gender identity. Other early winners included Brett Eldredge for best new artist; Florida Georgia Line for best vocal duo; and Little Big Town for vocal group.

Kenny Chesney opened the show with a funky reading of American Kids, flanked by dancers in retro clothing and singing against a '60s-style backdrop reminiscent of a set from Hair. He gave way to Lambert and Meghan Trainor singing a hip-hop/Latin-flavored duet All About That Bass.

Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, hosting the show for the seventh time, came loaded with their patented zingers and sendups. First victim was recently retired legend George Strait, sitting up front, who was chided by Paisley for not "riding away" into the sunset. "Can we call Uber for you?" Underwood suggested.

Ebola (a made-up song called Quarantine sung to the tune of Jolene), Renee Zellweger's apperance, and, of course, a certain pop queen who has strayed from country ("Postpartum Taylor Swift Disorder" was Underwood's name for it) also took shots.

In a cute running gag throughout the show, Paisley teased his co- host about her pregnancy with husband/hockey player Mike Fisher, at one point revealing the child's sex by suggesting that he be named Garth (after Brooks, a later presenter).

Rookie senators, beware ; Obama's failures of competence mean experience is back in vogue

A word of warning to senators thinking about running for president in 2016: Beware. Republicans Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, Democrat Elizabeth Warren and independent Bernie Sanders, this means you. Your leadership record and management skills won't get a free pass.

President Obama's troubled record as federal government CEO is going to make it tough for you. This goes double for senators elected Tuesday night.

Obama was the first sitting senator elected president since 1960, when John F. Kennedy stepped from the Senate to the White House. During the 2008 election, few Obama critics denounced his lack of management experience. Since then, the chorus arguing that senators with mostly legislative skills do not have the savvy to run an enterprise with 2.7 million employees and a $4 trillion budget has grown louder.

Competence matters

Whether it be the botched Obamacare rollout, false record- keeping about long waits at Veterans Affairs medical facilities, the breakdown in the Secret Service and now the halting response to the Ebola scare, Obama's leadership and management are suffering blistering criticism, not only from Republicans but Democrats as well. "When you think about it, many of the Obama administration's 'scandals' have been failures of competence," wrote New York Times columnist Joe Nocera.

All presidents between Obama and JFK were either governors, chief executives in their states, or vice presidents. The only modern exception was Kennedy's predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, who commanded the largest multinational military force in world history. Most recent presidents have run something bigger and more complicated than a Senate office.

Riding a wave of public adulation, Obama's lack of management experience didn't get a lot of scrutiny when he ran for president six years ago. The news media, and for the most part his top political opponents -- first Hillary Clinton and later John McCain - - spent more time debating disagreements with him on issues such as health care, the economy and foreign policy than they did on his lack of management experience.

It seemed to matter little that he was the least-experienced major-party presidential nominee since corporate lawyer Wendell Willkie carried the GOP banner in 1940. When opponents did criticize Obama's record in 2008, it mostly was for lack of foreign policy experience and not his thin background as a manager. Before he entered the Oval Office, Obama served four years in the U.S. Senate after eight as an Illinois state senator. His top credentials before that were as a writer, law school lecturer and community organizer.

Democrats ready

The next likely Democratic successor, Hillary Clinton, pretty much a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run, spent eight years in the Senate. However, she also spent four years as Obama's secretary of State, where she ran the huge and far-flung State Department. She probably learned a thing or two about leadership and management as "co-president" with her husband in the 1990s.

While Clinton will have to defend her management record, many of her likely opponents will have to prove they have one at all.

Republican aspirants Cruz, Paul and Rubio are rookie senators. Paul's work before entering the Senate in 2011 was mostly as an ophthalmologist. Cruz was Texas solicitor general and a lawyer in the U.S. Justice Department. Rubio has extensive legislative experience as a Miami city commissioner, Florida state lawmaker and speaker of the state House.

Democrat Warren, another rookie senator, mainly was a law professor, author and federal adviser on consumer protection.

Independent Sanders once gained executive experience as mayor of Burlington, Vt., but spent the past 24 years in the U.S. House and Senate as a lawmaker.

GOP governors and former governors who might run in 2016 include Ohio's John Kasich, Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, Texas' Rick Perry, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, New Jersey's Chris Christie and Arkansas' Mike Huckabee. On the Democratic side are New York's Andrew Cuomo and Maryland's Martin O'Malley. Should they enter the contest, their gubernatorial management and leadership skills and records will face heavy scrutiny, too.

That is just as it should be. We have Obama to thank for again making executive experience relevant for presidential hopefuls.

Voters, uncertain about the economy and worried about Ebola at home and terrorism abroad, handed Republicans a cluster of Democratic seats Tuesday and could grant the party its biggest majority in decades when all the votes are counted.

House Republicans headed into election night with 233 seats under their control while Democrats held 199. There are three vacancies, one of which is considered safely Republican.

President Obama's low approval ratings -- combined with a midterm electorate that is likely to be older, whiter and more Republican than voters in presidential elections -- has independent political handicappers predicting Republicans will pick up anywhere between five and 12 seats Tuesday night.

"Presidents wear their welcome out," said G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin and Marshall College. "No one expects anything but Republican gains. The only question is how many."

If Republicans pick up just nine seats, they will claim their biggest House majority since Harry Truman was in the White House.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, whose tenure has been marked by revolts from the conservative wing of his caucus, has visited 175 cities and raised more than $102 million to help GOP candidates as he worked to consolidate his power.

Boehner this week predicted a gain of five to 10 seats, saying it will give him "a little stronger hand when it comes to moving legislation."

Big gains would add to his caucus' moderate column as Republicans seize seats from Democrats.

Any majority also will include a new batch of lawmakers from solidly Republican areas who have refused to pledge any allegiance to Boehner or to the agenda embraced by the party's pro-business wing.

"For Boehner, it's a good news-bad news situation," said David Wasserman of The Cook Political Report. "The House Republican conference will include more Boehner allies and more rebels as well."

Boehner political spokesman Cory Fritz said his boss "has done a very good job of working for and listening to all of our candidates."

"He doesn't agree with them on all the issues," he said."But there's a lot of mutual respect."

Boehner's priorities, Fritz said, include approval of the stalled Keystone XL pipeline that would take heavy crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast and repealing unpopular parts of the Affordable Care Act.

Some of the Republicans' biggest opportunities came in swing districts held by first-term Democrats.

In Florida, for instance, freshman Rep. Joe Garcia lost to Republican Carlos Curbelo in a district carried by Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.

In Illinois, voters tossed out two Democratic freshmen. In Chicago's northern suburbs, Rep. Brad Schneider fell to Bob Dold, the Republican he beat two years ago. In Southwest Illinois, Republican state Rep. Mike Bost beat Rep. Bill Enyart.

Election night also could sound the death knell for southern white Democrats. Republicans picked up three seats in the region.

In West Virginia, 19-term Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall lost to GOP state Sen. Evan Jenkins. In Georgia, five-term Democratic Rep. John Barrow lost to Republican businessman Rick Allen. And in North Carolina, Republican David Rouzer captured a Democratic-held seat in the southeastern corner of the state.

In a bright spot for Democrats, Rep. Ann McLane Kuster beat GOP state Rep. Marilinda Garcia in New Hampshire.

Only a handful of Republican incumbents have faced serious challenges this year. Among them was Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, who was indicted on 20 federal fraud charges. He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia.

In Florida, meanwhile, two-term GOP Rep. Steve Southerland lost to Democrat Gwen Graham, an attorney and the daughter of popular former Florida governor and senator Bob Graham.

Voters, uncertain about the economy and worried about Ebola at home and terrorism abroad, are likely to leave the U.S. House firmly in Republican control Tuesday and could grant the party its biggest majority in decades.

Some of the Republicans' biggest opportunities for gains have come in swing districts held by first-term Democrats.

In Florida, for instance, freshman Rep. Joe Garcia faced Republican Carlos Curbelo in a too-close-to-call fight in a district carried by Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.

However, Rep. Patrick Murphy, another Florida freshman Democrat targeted by Republicans, survived a challenge Tuesday night from Republican Carl Domino in another district Romney won two years ago.

Election night could sound the death knell for Southern white Democrats.

In West Virginia, a loss by 19-term Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall could signal a national movement toward Republicans. His opponent, GOP state Sen. Evan Jenkins, hammered Rahall in coal-producing West Virginia over the Obama administration's efforts to reduce carbon emissions from coal plants.

In North Carolina, Republican David Rouzer captured a Democratic- held seat in the southeastern corner of the state. The incumbent Rep. Mike McIntyre, one of the dwindling ranks of the House's conservative Blue Dog Democrats, had decided against seeking a 10th term.

Only a handful of Republican incumbents have faced serious challenges this year. Among them: Republican Rep. Michael Grimm, indicted on 20 federal fraud charges.

Even so, the race remained a tossup headed into Election Day.

In Virginia, Republicans retained a hotly contested seat in the increasingly Democratic suburbs of Northern Virginia. State delegate Barbara Comstock defeated Democrat John Foust, a local county supervisor.

In Richmond, Va., college professor David Brat backed up his GOP primary upset of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor by capturing the House seat Tuesday night.

It is hard to believe how little thought goes into voters' minds when they weigh the perils facing us. Yes, all of the topics of the survey cited in USA TODAY's article are of concern, including Ebola, jobs and the Islamic State ("Election Day nears and U.S. is rattled," News, Friday).

But far more important is the impact of an election that could deliver a legislative branch capable of pushing the judicial branch further into the pocket of corporations.

Global climate change will impact disease, jobs and insurrection in a far greater fashion than the knee-jerk issues of the survey.

Addison Fischer

Maple Grove, Minn.

In light of the news articles and political posturing about the economy, Ebola and ISIL, may I suggest the country needs to revisit the 1933 inaugural address of President Franklin Roosevelt: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance." It is remarkable how appropriate that complete address is for 2014 America.

The most important aspect of an election is selecting someone who demonstrates the ability to get things done. That means you don't vote for someone without experience on a large scale. If they haven't been a state or city official, major business leader, military leader, private businessman or woman, then don't vote for them. The candidate's ability to work with others should be clear.

Ron Williams

Just getting "something" done isn't enough. It's about getting the right thing done. And that's where many of us disagree.

The voters gave the Democrats two years of majority power to get something done, and the result was Obamacare and massive new, ineffective financial regulation. In a number of areas Democrats and Republicans could have found a lot of agreement, such as simplifying the tax code.

Getting something done isn't anywhere near sufficient. Bad policy is still bad policy.

A lesson from Reagan: 'Mea culpa' speech

As the second term foundered, the president's approval ratings sank, and his party lost control of the Senate in the midterm elections.

"He wasn't simply a lame duck; people were saying he was a virtual dead duck and that the country would drift for the last two years" of his tenure, recalls Kenneth Duberstein, who was part of a new White House team that helped turn around Ronald Reagan's presidency in the aftermath of the Iran-contra scandal. "Sounds like today, doesn't it?"

Duberstein, who served as Reagan's final White House chief of staff, sees lessons from that era for President Obama, hammered by criticism and almost certain to face strengthened GOP opposition after today's elections. Republicans increasingly are confident they will win the Senate as well as hold the House.

The hardest thing to persuade Reagan to do was also one of the most effective, Duberstein said in an interview with USA TODAY's Capital Download: deliver a mea culpa address to the nation.

"His poll numbers went up immediately because he had leveled with the American people and held himself accountable and said he had made mistakes," Duberstein, 70, told the weekly video newsmaker series. "All of a sudden, the American people said, 'I'm glad we gave him the benefit of the doubt. That's the Ronald Reagan we elected twice.'"

Reagan was enmeshed in a scandal. He had to acknowledge that his administration secretly sold arms to Iran in a bid to win the release of U.S. hostages held in the Mideast and that White House aides funneled the profits to Nicaraguan rebels despite a congressional prohibition on funding them.

Obama's challenge centers not on scandal but on questions about his leadership and his administration's competence in addressing threats from Ebola to the Islamic State terrorist group.

Still, Duberstein says, "I think it would be very useful and refreshing for President Obama to say he holds himself accountable, and his administration accountable, for some of the mistakes of the last few years, and let's roll up our sleeves and get to work."

After shaking up his White House staff, Reagan scored achievements during his final two years, including reaching a nuclear weapons treaty with the Soviet Union, signing a welfare overhaul and winning confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, Anthony Kennedy.

It's possible for Obama to score progress on big issues as well, Duberstein says, especially if he appoints advisers of stature with "fresh ideas" and launches a concerted effort to build bridges with congressional Republicans. The political landscape could shift with GOP gains in Congress, Duberstein says. "I think there's great incentive for the Senate Republicans and the House Republicans to demonstrate an ability to govern."

You spread more disease than Ebola nurse Hickox

Public fury is building at a nurse just returned from caring for Ebola patients in West Africa who is defying Maine authorities' demand that she remain in quarantine. The asymptomatic nurse, Kaci Hickox, insists she poses no risk to others because even Ebola- infected people are not contagious before developing symptoms, a position that is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.

While others say she is expressing willful disregard for public health, they are missing a larger risk.

As we think about the best ways to limit Ebola transmission, and how to treat those people who might be at risk for Ebola infection, let's acknowledge that each of us has, at some point, transmitted an infectious disease to someone else. When sick kids go to school and when sick grownups take the subway to work, they put others at risk. Whereas science indicates that the transmission of Ebola viral particles requires contact with infected bodily fluids, the sharing of respiratory viruses does not. Airborne respiratory viruses can be transmitted through every cough and sneeze.

Everyday deadly

Outside of the hospital, we don't worry so much about transmitting "colds" and "flu," because these diseases are generally perceived as low risk and inevitable. However, both these perceptions are inaccurate.

An upper respiratory infection might just be an annoyance to you, but it could have severe consequences for an infant or someone with a pre-existing lung disease, such as asthma. Influenza kills thousands of people every year. Infants, pregnant women, the elderly and people with immune systems weakened by chemotherapy or other drugs may be at especially high risk.

This is why when health care professionals treat patients with common respiratory infections in the hospital, it's a big deal: Depending on the bug, the CDC recommends masks, face shields, gloves and/or full body gowns.

Protect your friends

Simple behaviors will protect you and others against the risks of contagious diseases -- including Ebola, but also the large number of other more common illnesses.

There are steps that everyone can take to minimize the chances that they will be disease vectors this fall and winter. These include washing your hands, covering your coughs with your arm, keeping sick kids home from school, minimizing exposure to others if you're sick, keeping your distance when you are contagious (influenza may spread to others who are up to 6 feet away), and making sure you are up-to-date on your vaccinations. It's hard to understand how anyone could be bemoaning the lack of an Ebola vaccine while also avoiding immunization for flu or measles.

Next time someone suggests that Ebola caregivers aren't doing enough to safeguard the public from the disease they've risked their lives to treat, think about whether you're doing what you can to protect public health. We're all in this together.

November ushers in sweet spot for stocks ; Investors upbeat as seasonally hard period ends

October, the spooky, volatile month best known for stock market crashes, is finally over after giving investors a brief, frightful scare. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 are back at record levels. Enter November. A month with a market-friendly reputation and the gateway -- and starting point -- to what historically has been the most bullish six-month period for U.S. stocks.

"After October," says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, "the seasonality usually starts in the investor's favor."

The historical performance statistics back up Manley's claim.

November is the Dow Jones industrial average's second-best performing month in the past 20 years, with average gains of 2.05%, says Bespoke Investment Group.

November marks the start of the best six-month period for stocks, the Stock Trader's Almanac says. In the November-thru-April period since 1950, the Dow has posted average gains of 7.5% vs. a gain of 0.3% for the worst six-month period, which runs from May through October.

November also provides an added performance booster shot in the fourth-quarter during mid-term election years, according to S&P Capital IQ data since 1928. The S&P 500 has posted average gains of 6.47% in the October-thru-December quarter in midterm election years. (Americans head to the polls Tuesday.) On average, the stock market posts gains of 2.59% in the final quarter of a year.

The fact November tends to kick off good times for stocks, however, doesn't mean the market doesn't have risks to contend with in November and beyond.

Indeed, November marks the first month in two years in which the Federal Reserve will not be pumping billions of dollars into the financial markets each month in the form of asset purchases. The Fed announced Wednesday that it was ending its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, in October. Stock investors will also be grappling with the prospect of interest rate hikes from the Fed in 2015, and the market is likely to become more volatile as projections of when the first rate hike will come moves forward or backward because of incoming economic data.

"As the more serious discussion about raising rates begins, markets may respond less well," says Michael Farr, president of money-management firm Farr Miller & Washington. Indeed, any hints from the Fed that rate hikes will come earlier in 2015 than currently anticipated could cause market turbulence.

The outcome of the congressional elections and the impact on the balance of power on Capitol Hill could also sway markets. Also giving investors potential pause: economic conditions in Europe remain weak, uncertainty surrounding the Islamic State and domestic terrorism, and the kickoff to the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving.

"There's also the potential for new surprises," adds Farr.

Still, with October-phobia ending, Ebola fears fading, Corporate America still churning out better-than-expected profits, and the U.S. economy showing signs that it is capable of consistently growing at a 3%-plus pace, it's hard to get overly bearish on the market in November.

"When you get to November, people start thinking of a year-end rally," says Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac. "The history of seasonal strength has a psychological component to it, a self-fulfilling prophecy."

Driving the gains, Hirsch says, is the fact that the broad U.S. stock market suffered a drop of more than 9% from its recent record highs in October, which took some of the froth out of the market. Fresh buying driven by the start of mutual funds' new fiscal year, an upbeat holiday vibe, end-of-year bonuses and other bullish factors also provide a tailwind for stocks, he says.

Also working in the stock market's favor is its uncanny ability to consistently post gains after the midterm elections.

"History tells us that stocks should advance after the midterm election," says Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA.

"Stocks have rallied post-election regardless of the political outcome."

Historically, equity returns following the midterm elections tend to be superb, with a median return of 7% in the 90 days following a midterm election, according to Barclays. Since 1928, returns have been positive 86% of the time.

The market has a shot at its old 2014 highs, says Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser for Fort Washington Investment Advisors.

"There is ample cash on the sidelines, and the fears about a global slowdown are abating," he says. "People don't know where else to put their money with bond yields so low."

Election Day nears and U.S. is rattled ; Poll shows anxiety over Islamic State, Ebola, fewer jobs

As Election Day nears, America is the Land of the Fearful.

Voters are rattled by the Ebola virus, braced for years of conflict against the terrorist group Islamic State and still worried about jobs, a nationwide USA TODAY Poll finds. Two-thirds say the nation faces more challenging problems than usual; one in four call them the biggest problems of their lifetimes.

And many lack confidence in the government to address them.

"There's this cornucopia of icky that's going on right now," says Laurie DeShano, 38, of Bay City, Mich., an instructor at Saginaw Valley State University who was among those surveyed. She cites concerns ranging from ISIS - "We're absolutely in the cross hairs" - to the out-sized influence of special interests in American politics.

"Just to be painfully honest, it's obvious we're quite off track," says Mike Trujillo, 46, an emergency-room physician from Miami. "I never thought the country would be going in this direction, not in my wildest dreams."

President Obama's approval rating is a so-so 44%, and neither party is broadly trusted to handle the big issues ahead. By significant margins, those surveyed prefer congressional Republicans when it comes to dealing with the economy and ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria. By double-digits, they say congressional Democrats would do a better job in handling income inequality and social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

On dealing with the Ebola virus, one in five volunteer that they don't trust either one.

But the bottom line seems to be that the downbeat mood of the electorate is favoring the GOP, whose backers are more enthusiastic about voting and animated by their opposition to Obama.

At stake in Tuesday's election are 36 Senate seats, all 435 House seats and 36 governorships as well as state ballot measures that would, among other things, restrict abortion and decriminalize marijuana.

Only a third of those surveyed say they are generally satisfied with how things are going in the United States. That's a more optimistic outlook than in the last midterm election, in 2010, when the unemployment rate had risen to 9.8% and the debate over the Affordable Care Act had caught fire.

Today's mood is akin to those during turbulent midterms in 1994 and 2006. In those elections, the party that held the White House suffered setbacks severe enough to cost them control of the House of Representatives.

With a Democrat in the White House now, Republicans already won a majority in the House four years ago. The biggest question for this election night is whether Democrats will be able to keep control of the Senate.

The Obama factor

Half of likely voters say the president doesn't weigh in their vote for Congress. But among those who call Obama a factor, by 2-1 they say they are casting a vote against him, not for him.

"It's a tough job but this is not the best we've had, that's for sure," says Elizabeth Johnson, 58, a pharmacist from Morgantown, W.Va. "The president is not very competent and the people he's chosen are not very competent." More than four in 10 of those polled agreed.

The poll of 1,210 adults, taken by Princeton Survey Research on Oct. 23-26 by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The margin of error among the group of 697 likely voters is plus or minus 4 points.

"For me, Obama has done only 50%, not 100%," says Jose Camacho, 47, who has struggled to find a good job since moving to Tampa from Puerto Rico several years ago. "I understand the position of the president is not easy, but don't forget the old people and the poor people and the middle class."

The challenge for Obama's fellow Democrats is to turn out their supporters in the midterm election, when fewer people vote and those who do are more likely to be white, older and conservative -- that is, more likely to support Republicans.

That is proving to be difficult, although Democrats say they have honed field operations and turn-out-the-vote efforts. African- American participation has dipped slightly, from 13% of the electorate in 2012 to 12% of the likely-voter sample in the survey.

Still, some significant parts of the coalition that re-elected Obama two years ago are poised to stay home. In the poll, just 7% of the likely voters are under 30; those younger voters made up 19% of those who cast ballots two years ago, according to surveys of voters as they left polling places. In contrast, the proportion of voters 65 and older has risen to 27% from 16% in 2012.

Conservatives made up 35% of the electorate then; they are 41% of today's likely voters.

Among all registered voters, the Democratic congressional candidate is preferred over the Republican by five points, 45%-40%. But among those who indicate in a series of questions that they are likely to vote, that advantage shrinks to a single point, 43%-42%.

Harold Lowe, 46, a financial adviser from Oakland, Calif., calls Obama "the best president of my lifetime" and says racism is a major reason for the criticism of him. "If Obama was not black, we could get through issues about Obama's performance, but we can't even get to issues about Obama's performance because he is black," he says.

While he supports the president, though, Lowe also sees some "serious flaws" in Obama's leadership, including his decision early in his administration to make a health care overhaul his top priority when many Americans were more concerned about having a job.

What's on voters' minds now?

An uncertain economy

The top priority for congressional action next year is job creation, cited by 29% of those surveyed. Despite unemployment that has declined to 5.9% and an economy that grew by a healthy 3.5% in the third quarter, economic anxiety forged in the Great Recession continues to cast a cloud.

THE battle against ISIS

Six in 10 predict the United States will have to deal with the threat from Islamic State well past when Obama's tenure ends in two years. Four in 10 say it will stretch more than five years.

The threat from Ebola

Four in 10 say a major outbreak of the Ebola virus in the United States is very or somewhat likely over the next year, although public-health experts call that prospect remote at best.

More than one in 10 say it's very or somewhat likely someone in their family will contract Ebola. Four in 10 say they don't trust the government to handle the Ebola threat.

Terrorism concerns rise

If Congress could pass just one major piece of legislation next year, job creation comes first, but it's subsided as the single dominant issue it has been in the past three elections, in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown and the recession that followed. In 2012, more than four in 10 cited jobs as the top issue; now it's named by about three in 10.

Meanwhile, concern about national security and terrorism has surged amid violence in Iraq and Syria and the videotaped beheading this year by Islamic State of two American journalists.

In a 2012 poll, terrorism came in last on a list of seven issues, at 2%. In the survey, national security and terrorism rank second, cited by 21%. While jobs remains the top issue among Democrats, Republicans rank terrorism first.

Europe seeing ripples of racism ; AIDS had a similar stigma, some argue

Italian mothers in suburban Rome recently organized a petition drive to keep a 3-year-old black girl from attending kindergarten after her family traveled to Uganda -- a country thousands of miles away from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In Germany, soccer fans chanted "Ebola, Ebola" when Charles Atsina, a black player from Ghana, came onto the field.

Two British landlords refused to rent an apartment to a black Sierra Leone radio newscaster, Amara Bangura, who was moving to England to study. The landlords feared he might bring the deadly virus with him.

As Americans debate quarantining health workers returning from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone or banning travelers from those countries -- as Australia has already done -- fears of Ebola have also gripped Europe. And that fear is giving some people license to vent racist attitudes.

"The stigma of the Ebola outbreak is similar to that of AIDS when it first came to the public's attention," said Louis-George Tin, president of the Representative Council of Blacks in France. "People associated AIDS with black people and homosexuals. But not all black people and homosexuals had AIDS, and not all people with AIDS were black. A disease doesn't discriminate."

In the past few months, around nearly 5,000 people have died from Ebola in West Africa. In Europe, there have been less than a dozen infected with virus, mostly people from West Africa brought for care in European hospitals, especially Germany.

Yet fear of the deadly virus abounds in Europe.

"In France there is definitely unjustified fear," Tin said.

Politicians have capitalized on that fear. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National, made a case for isolationism during an interview with Radio Sud.

"We need to stop flights to and from infected countries in order to protect our country," she said.

Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the party, went further with an incendiary comment, telling Le Figaro: "Overpopulation is threatening to submerge France with immigrants but Monsieur Ebola could fix this in three months."

Distinguishing between outright discrimination and legitimate public health measures can be difficult. And in areas where border security has been stepped up, accusations of racism are increasingly common.

"I was interrogated and harassed by several airport officials at Heathrow, simply because I carried a Liberian passport," said Robtel Neajai Pailey, a University of London doctoral student who is African American and a U.S. citizen. "This bordered on racial profiling, because I had not traveled directly from Liberia."

That 3-year-old girl in Fiumicino, having never shown any symptoms of Ebola, returned to kindergarten after local officials assured her parents she would be OK after they kept her home for a week out of fear for her safety.

"The fact that the mother's child is African is the only reason why they took action," Fiumicino Mayor Esterino Montino said. "It was an action that should have been avoided. We intervened, and the situation is under control."

Besieged Ebola nurse Kaci Hickox left her remote Maine home Thursday for an hour-long bicycle ride, trailed by state police and reporters, in open defiance of the state's voluntary quarantine for at-risk health workers.

"It's a beautiful day for a bike ride," Hickox said as she pedaled from her Fort Kent, Maine, home, accompanied by boyfriend Ted Wilbur and watched by a gaggle of photographers and reporters.

State officials said they would go to court seeking an order confining her to home against her will in what has become the biggest test case yet over balancing public health fears with personal freedoms.

Hickox says she has no Ebola symptoms, has tested negative for the virus, poses no public health threat and shouldn't be quarantined. She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation for daily monitoring for fever and other symptoms.

Lacking a court order, state police, who have been watching her home did not have authority to stop her. "I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science- based," she said.

The drama over isolating the health worker was playing out in one of the nation's most isolated and remote locales, situated at the northern tip of Maine and just across the Saint John's River from New Brunswick, Canada.

Established as a 19th century border outpost, the town of approximately 4,000 people is closer to Quebec City, some 200 miles west, than to Maine's largest city of Portland, more than 300 miles to the south.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican in a tough battle for re- election, said hours later that the state was willing to agree to let Hickox to go out by bicycle or on foot if she stays away from public places. But he said talks with her lawyers toward such a deal had broken down, and he vowed to use "full authority" to force her to stick to a 21-day quarantine.

Hickox stepped into the vortex of the national debate over how to handle U.S. health care workers returning from Ebola duty in West Africa when she landed in New Jersey after that state's governor, Republican Chris Christie, ordered a quarantine.

She spent several days in an isolation tent at a Newark hospital before Christie relented under threat of legal action and she was allowed to travel by automobile to Maine.

States have broad authority to quarantine people to prevent the spread of disease, but legal experts differ over applying that to health workers who have shown no signs of infection by the Ebola virus, which is spread through bodily fluids, not casual contact.

Her 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends Nov. 10.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday defended the Pentagon's decision to isolate troops for 21 days after they return from Ebola duty in West Africa.

Hagel earlier this week signed off on the recommendation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that goes beyond guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Isolating troops for 21 days even without symptoms of the disease, Hagel said, was a "smart, wise, prudent, disciplined, science-oriented decision."

There are about 1,100 U.S. troops in West Africa helping to stop the Ebola virus, mostly in Liberia. The Pentagon may send as many as 3,900 troops. They are building treatment facilities and laboratories and training Liberian health care workers. U.S. forces are not expected to treat patients of the deadly virus, which has killed nearly 5,000 people in Africa.

Part of the reason to isolate troops is that they would be staying in the region longer than most medical workers, said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Troops are expected to have six-month deployments to disease-stricken areas.

Meanwhile, the military is determining which of its military hospitals in the USA are capable or will soon meet criteria to treat troops who may be sickened by the virus during deployment, said Air Force Col. Edward Thomas, spokesman for Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Thomas said he couldn't provide additional details on how many military hospitals are already able to treat Ebola. But, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., recently conducted a treatment drill and has been planning for dealing with the virus since August, said Sandy Dean, hospital spokeswoman.

A separate team is also assessing how many beds should be available across the military medical system, Thomas said.

Zoroya reported from McLean, Va.

Stop transporting host and virus

We've learned from the Ebola outbreak of 2014 that to stop pandemics, we must regulate the transport of host and virus alike. Public transmission and cellular invasion depend on the unimpeded traffic of people across borders and viruses across cell membranes.

Barring the traffic of people across the Atlantic from Liberia would certainly have prevented the first three cases of Ebola in the United States. Blocking the traffic of virus in human cells would have prevented thousands of cases worldwide.

The Ebola epidemic in West Africa presents a major challenge not only to our public health system, but also to our capacity to develop antiviral drugs.

Until such drugs emerge, there are only two time-tested ways to quell an epidemic: quarantine and sanitation. The first step would be to stop reliance on "voluntary quarantine" via thermometers and telephones to prevent transmission. Temperatures quiver and telephone interviews depend on who's asking the questions and who's answering them. Voluntary quarantines were broken in New York and Dallas.

The popular New England Journal of Medicine claimed that "hundreds of years of experience show that to stop an epidemic of this type requires controlling it at its source." That's dead wrong. In the 19th century, cholera, yellow fever and smallpox were stopped from spreading widely in the U.S. and Europe by travel bans.

For example, ships from Europe with cholera on board were forced to remain anchored in the East River right near Bellevue Hospital, where I work.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had it right when he placed a quarantine on U.S. troops who are assisting the Ebola effort in West Africa. Troops will be detained in what the Pentagon calls "controlled monitoring" for 21 days before returning home -- even though the troops are not expected to treat patients directly.

The model is a good one that should be used for other health care workers.

If the U.S. wants to win the war against Ebola, we should follow the practices already in place for our military.

Quarantines needed

As a practicing nurse of 43 years, I think the nurse who is complaining about her civil rights being violated ought to be locked up. What about the civil rights of everyone in this country? Do we all deserve to get Ebola because she chose to volunteer in Africa?

Serving the Ebola victims is admirable, but there are responsibilities and consequences for choosing to put yourself in harm's way. These selfless individuals should accept those consequences willingly. It seems they are not so selfless when it comes to infecting their own people.

Reform spying program

I agree with USA TODAY's editorial that we must reform our nation's surveillance programs ("Despite outcry, government still collects your phone data," Our view, Oct. 22). However, the piece fails to mention that the House acted this year to end bulk collection of data by the government. Like many other bills, it is sitting in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

In May, the House passed the USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan bill that ends domestic bulk collection once and for all and increases the oversight and transparency of these intelligence-gathering programs so that the government can begin to rebuild trust with the American people.

The battle to contain Ebola has not been pretty.

The developed world let the disease fester in West Africa until it became a global threat, and when -- inevitably -- the first case arrived in the United States, it was greeted with a disturbing mix of incompetence and panic.

Patient Zero was turned away from a Dallas emergency room and sent home to spread the disease. When he returned much sicker, two nurses were infected because procedures were unsafe. One traveled and flew back to Dallas with a fever, despite the obvious risk -- incredibly, with the permission of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose once-sterling reputation has been tarnished by its handling of the crisis.

Then to put a cherry on top, a couple of grandstanding governors, who should be showing the cool-headed leadership the nation saw after 9/11, sought to look decisive by imposing poorly thought-out quarantines. They looked jittery, instead. Not to be outdone, the first person quarantined, nurse Kaci Hickox, arrogantly insisted that only she has the right to judge whether she poses a threat. Obviously, there is ample middle ground.

The whole train of events is embarrassing. But there is another way to look at it as well.

Pretty much everything that could go wrong did go wrong; the virus was given every chance to spread. Yet it has not.

Not on the Dallas nurse's flight. Not among the 50 or so family, friends and community contacts of the first patient, Thomas Duncan. Not even Duncan's fiancee got sick. As of this writing, two nurses who took care of the critically ill Duncan are the only people who have contracted Ebola in the U.S., and they've been cured.

It would be naive to conclude that this means the virus has been beaten. But it's also hard to avoid the conclusion that it is both less contagious and less deadly than initially feared, given Western medical care.

Further encouragement comes from the way hospitals and the CDC have learned from their mistakes. New York is an example. Eight hospitals have been designated to treat Ebola. Workers have drilled. ER testers posing as Ebola patients have checked readiness. Similar preparation is going on elsewhere.

Screening and monitoring at airports is also improving.

This is a familiar pattern in crisis -- personal or national. You're knocked off balance. You learn from your mistakes. You adapt.

But one piece of the adjustment -- the most important -- is still dangerously incomplete. The disease continues to rage out of control in West Africa.

The right things are belatedly happening. Clinics are being built. Major donors have stepped up. Liberia is reporting a slowing of transmission. But there are still dire shortages of health care workers, beds and supplies to contain the disease, which must be tamed at its source for actions here to have meaning.

The U.S. is committing medical and military resources, and other countries are donating as well. But the domestic Ebola scare is getting in the way by discouraging volunteers. The sooner fear gives way to facts, the more likely it is that the threat will be stopped far, far away.

The number of new Ebola cases appears to be dropping in Liberia, the West African country hit hardest by the virus, a World Health Organization official said Wednesday.

The WHO has noted that new cases have been falling for more than a week. Officials aren't sure whether it means only that people have stopped going to the hospital or overwhelmed medical staff stopped reporting cases, said Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general in charge of operational response at WHO.

"It appears the trend is real in Liberia," Aylward said.

The epidemic is far from over, though. The number of cases has jumped to 13,703 -- an increase of about 3,000 reported cases in just a few days -- with about 4,922 deaths, mostly in hard-hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Aylward said. The jump is most likely because of a backlog of cases that hadn't been reported. Across West Africa, 521 health workers have been infected with Ebola and 272 have died, the WHO says. Ebola cases continue to rise in Sierra Leone and Guinea. Mali reported its first case last week.

However, three trends seem positive. Some hospital beds are opening up, and about 100 hospital beds may be free, Aylward said. Lab-confirmed cases seem to be plateauing. And the number of Ebola burials is declining.

Aylward said the country still needs many more hospital beds.

There are 15 Ebola treatment centers in the three hard-hit regions of West Africa, and the region needs 56, he said. Only 22% of the planned 4,707 Ebola treatment beds are open.

"I'm terrified that the information will be misinterpreted to say that Ebola is under control," Aylward said. "That's like saying your pet tiger is under control. A couple of burials go wrong in a couple of places, and you see a whole new transmission chain, and your numbers start going up again."

Parents, take kids seriously ; In scary times, I try to answer my children's questions honestly and factually

In our household, we don't watch TV news, so our children -- ages 8, 6 and 3 -- are shielded from images of burning buildings and crying kids. So far, they don't know about Ebola or the Islamic State.

But over the course of the past few years they have asked me about school shootings, natural disasters and death. I've learned I don't need to avoid their questions or sanitize my answers. In taking their questions seriously, they've pushed me to admit my own doubts while also explaining why I hold on to hope even in the midst of a broken world.

Nearly two years ago, a gunman shot and killed a classroom full of first-graders in Newtown, Conn., 20 miles down the road from us. Between the increased police presence at our daughter Penny's school ("There are two polices, Mom. Why are there polices at my school?") and the fact that I couldn't contain my emotions ("Mommy, why are you crying?"), I had to say something.

Dealing with tragedies

I began simply, pulling our eldest child on my lap: "Some kids got hurt in a school nearby, so lots of people are sad." I didn't mention guns or death. But a few days later, we drove by a funeral, and Penny wondered why I was crying. I said, "You know how I told you about those kids who got hurt? Well some teachers got hurt, too, and some of them died." Later she asked her dad, "Did the kids who died go to heaven?" He nodded. "Then why are we all so sad?" she asked.

We never told Penny the gory details, and I'm glad we protected her from images that might make school feel scary. But I realized that she was old enough to begin to learn about the tragedy within our world even though she has experienced little of that tragedy firsthand.

Since then, I've fielded questions about the darker sides of American history ("Why did the white people fight with the Native Americans?") on the Fourth of July; natural disasters ("Will our house ever go under water like that?") in response to photos in a book on Hurricane Katrina; and human destruction ("How did the towers fall down?") when our son, William, learned about 9/11.

I have learned to answer their questions in as clear and factual a way as possible. When William asked about the towers, I told him, "Some men flew planes into the tops of the buildings, and the planes made the buildings collapse." He didn't ask about their reasons or how many people died.

My own doubts

I have also admitted my own doubts. My husband's mother died of cancer before our kids were born. Marilee, our youngest, asked recently, "Does my grandmother live in my heart?" I considered an easy affirmation, but instead I said, "I don't know. But I hope we'll see her again one day."

Finally, I have learned to put my children's questions about the sometimes frightening world into the context of a larger narrative. I don't avoid the sadness of death or the fear of danger, but I try to frame sadness and fear with hope and healing.

After the Boston marathon bombings, some news outlets quoted Fred Rogers telling children to look for the helpers, because whenever you see pictures of people hurting, you also see those who help. When it comes to all that is scary, I try to help my kids see the good story within which we can all participate -- a story of justice and peace instead of destruction and fear.

As I look back on these conversations, I'm more convinced that we adults need to take our kids seriously when they ask serious questions. In telling my kids the honest, sometimes uncertain, but ultimately good story, I remind myself of all that I believe is true.

Debate over quarantines rages ; Nurse says she won't be 'bullied'; legal action weighed

State police are watching the rural home of a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa amid increasing national debate over medical quarantines and who must follow them.

Nurse Kaci Hickox told NBC she is symptom-free and shouldn't be quarantined.

"I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines," she said. "I am not going to sit around and be bullied by politicians and forced to stay in my home when I am not a risk to the American public."

Maine Gov. Paul LePage said he would seek legal authority to enforce her quarantine to protect the community.

As the events in Maine unfolded, President Obama said returning U.S. health volunteers "deserve to be treated like the heroes that they are."

Even as he applauded the "shock troops" of the Ebola fight and complained of hysteria greeting them in some quarters, the president and the Pentagon said U.S. soldiers returning from Ebola duty will face a similar 21-day quarantine to ensure they are not infected and contagious.

The rapidly moving developments illustrated the delicacies and confusion surrounding a growing debate over the Ebola threat just days before nationwide elections that will determine who controls Congress.

At the heart of the dispute was the question of whether health professionals who treated patients with Ebola pose a risk to public health, even if they have no symptoms and are not considered contagious under federal health guidelines.

The Obama administration has pushed back against restrictions on the health workers, including travel bans and isolation measures adopted by states from Maine to California, though it backs restrictions for soldiers.

Obama met at the White House with Ebola survivor Kent Brantly, a physician, and other health volunteers who have served or will serve in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the disease has infected more than 10,000 people and killed nearly half that number. He said the best way to keep the virus out of the United States is to stop the epidemic there.

At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel imposed a 21-day isolation requirement on troops at the recommendations of military commanders. During their deployment to West Africa, U.S. troops are not treating Ebola patients but supporting efforts by building clinics, training workers and testing blood.

Obama said the different treatment of civilian and military personnel does not alter his view that mandatory quarantines not be imposed upon civilian medical volunteers.

Maine health officials said later that they were preparing to seek a court order, acknowledging they lack authority to arrest Hickox for violating the quarantine without such an order. They were in negotiations with the nurse's attorney.

Legal experts were divided over enforcing isolation orders on health workers who are not sick.

Robert Gatter, co-director of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University, says states have police powers to protect public health under the 10th Amendment, but that is balanced by an obligation to protect the nurse's rights.

"If the law is working the way it should, and if public health officials are doing what they should, the nurse will win until the moment she spikes a fever or has another Ebola symptom," he says.

But Melissa Markey, a Michigan lawyer specializing in pandemic preparedness, says Maine probably would prevail. "It's a tough one to call," she says. "But I think it probably would be found to be a valid exercise of public health powers."

Across West Africa: Prevention and fear ; Neighbors of worst-hit nations on guard

Everywhere in this capital city, signs exhort people to wash their hands with soap. In Ivory Coast, the government has asked residents to stop their customary three-kiss hello. In Mali, travelers entering the country have their temperatures taken. In Guinea-Bissau, the Red Cross broadcasts a weekly radio program on how to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.

Because all four nations border the three West African countries hit by the worst Ebola epidemic in history, each is taking extraordinary measures to prevent its spread within its territory.

Even so, many are gripped with fear that the preventive steps won't succeed. "The state of mind of the people of Guinea-Bissau is fear across the entire country," said the country's Red Cross spokesman, Daniel Sanha. "No one is relieved that it has not come here because there is still the possibility, God forbid."

In Senegal, which has had one non-fatal case, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the all-clear this month. Still, no one is complacent. Billboards, TV and radio announcements and signs remind people of the danger. "Pay attention," the Senegalese health minister, Awa Marie Coll-Seck, warned on TV last week. "Ebola is not a Guinean problem, or West African affair, but a global one."

Senegal -- like Nigeria -- reacted quickly to its Ebola case with a public information campaign and monitoring by health officials. WHO declared Nigeria officially Ebola-free last week.

The Ebola-plagued nations -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- have recorded 10,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths, with no end in sight. They are poorer and less developed than Senegal and Nigeria and haven't been able to match those two nations' efforts to contain the outbreak so far.

Idrissa Talla, national director of disease control for the Senegalese Health Ministry, said the ministry has been training staff since August about Ebola treatment protocols at 75 health facilities nationwide. In the south, near the Guinea and Guinea- Bissau borders, there are five treatment centers ready for use should a case arise.

Land, air and sea borders with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are closed. Where arrivals are allowed, people's temperatures are taken. Volunteers go door-to-door in border regions with pamphlets about Ebola.

In Guinea-Bissau, the picture is not encouraging. Hospitals aren't prepared for patients and lack devices to diagnose the virus, Red Cross spokesman Sanha said, because the country lacks the resources. The government has closed its borders to Ebola-affected countries and banned traditional burial ceremonies.

Earlier this month, WHO sent staffers to Mali and Ivory Coast to test the preparedness of those countries and set up rapid response teams. Both are on WHO's list of top 10 African countries in danger of an outbreak. Ivory Coast is of particular concern because its population of 20 million equals that of the three Ebola-afflicted nations combined.

The coastal country opened an isolation unit, banned bush meat and urged residents to practice good hygiene.

Ivorian community health expert Bella Didier said some people don't believe Ebola exists, and convincing them otherwise is "a constant struggle." He said the Red Cross has visited nearly 200 sites, educating more than 27,000 residents since March.

In Mali, officials have been shoring up anti-Ebola measures since spring. It is the first African country to test an experimental Ebola vaccine under lab conditions. The first tests began on health care workers Oct. 10.

In a region where people frequently cross borders to work or sell wares, Mali has tightened its borders, but not closed them out of fear people may try to cross illegally. At airports and land borders, travelers' temperatures are checked. At its land crossing with Guinea, it takes temperatures and forces travelers to wash their hands. A public education campaign urges residents to wash their hands in chlorinated water.

Despite the precautions, Mali recorded its first case on Oct. 24, a young girl traveling from Guinea who died shortly afterward.

Though still the only Ebola incident, the news shook the country. "People are panicking," said Issa Dembele, of Bamako.

Nurse Amber Vinson's discharge from the hospital Tuesday brings to seven the number of American patients who have survived Ebola, leading many people to wonder what has allowed them to beat the odds.

In West Africa, about 70% of patients die from the Ebola virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Vinson, 29, was released Tuesday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. She was infected while working at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where she was part of the care team for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died Oct. 8.

As she was released, Vinson thanked Ebola survivors Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol for donating blood to help her. Doctors have been experimenting with blood transfusions in the hope that a survivor's blood will contain antibodies to help other patients fight the virus.

All of the survivors have gotten state-of-the-art care at hospitals designed to handle the most dangerous infectious diseases.

In West Africa, many patients never make it to the hospital. Hospitals have beds for one in five Ebola patients in Liberia, according to the WHO. Doctors often lack protective equipment such as gloves and gowns, or even running water and soap.

Studies of African patients have shown that those in better condition upon infection -- with better nutrition and overall health -- are more likely to survive Ebola. Younger people and those who receive blood transfusions fare better, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

Emory treated four survivors; Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha treated two.

Those hospitals have excellent intensive care units, said Robert Murphy of the Center for Global Health at Northwestern University in Chicago. Vinson's physician, Bruce Ribner, said he has learned it's possible to treat Ebola patients much more aggressively than once believed, using ventilators and dialysis.

But Ribner said it's impossible to know exactly why Vinson and fellow nurse Nina Pham recovered relatively quickly. He said the nurses' ages and circumstances in contracting Ebola may help explain their relatively rapid recovery. Ribner noted that Vinson and Pham may have been infected with a smaller quantity of virus, which can be easier to fight.

Hooray for a Happy Halloween ; We need more holidays that relieve the stress for kids and adults -- even for a day

People keep to themselves in my neighborhood. We don't drop by unannounced, except for one night a year. On Oct. 31, I visit all my neighbors. They're happy to see me. Indeed, they even give my strangely attired children treats.

What's not to like about Halloween?

Without doubt this ghoulish holiday is increasingly popular. Average consumer spending for it increased 55% between 2005 and 2013 to $6.9 billion, according to the National Retail Federation, while the economy has been flat. Growth inspires detractors, who note woes from oversexualized costumes to junk food binges. Despite all this, there are good reasons to celebrate Halloween, and indeed to wish there were more holidays like it.

Halloween's economic rise stems from several factors. It fits a retail need, filling time between back-to-school season and that Nov. 1 line before which people won't brook Christmas carols. Lisa Morton, author of Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween, points out that ghost-and-goblin-themed events give summer-centric attractions (amusement parks, zoos) a way to lure people in after the weather cools.

Everyone gets involved

Smart farms have capitalized on widespread agrarian interest to build corn mazes and pumpkin patches, and "the rise of the haunted attractions industry has kind of stunned everyone," she says. Cool technology and people with Hollywood resumes make haunted houses awesome (and cheaper real estate after the crash makes such businesses doable).

Beyond that, though, "Halloween is kind of pure fun," says Elizabeth Kraus, author of 365 Days of Marketing. "It's like Christmas without all the work." You have no obligation to visit or cook for relatives. Halloween can be celebrated at the office with no fear of offending people. We give people gifts, but not gifts that bankrupt us; anyone can afford a snack-sized Snickers bar. We have parties, and we renew neighborly ties. Few people Christmas carol anymore; Halloween is what we have left of that.

And perhaps best of all? It's completely optional: "If you don't want to celebrate it, you can turn your porch light out, and be home and do whatever you want to do," says Lesley Bannatyne, author of Halloween Nation.

To be sure, the adult takeover of the holiday is occasionally creepy. The NRF reports that Americans will spend $1.4 billion on adult costumes this year vs. $1 billion for kids.

All kinds of norms have changed in modern life, and that includes age norms, notes Christopher Noxon, author of Rejuvenile: Kickball, Cartoons, Cupcakes and the Reinvention of the American Grown-Up -- and not always for the better. Noxon says he's always tried to make sure his kids have awesome costumes, but the net result is that they ask him what they're going to wear, rather than constructing their own. "When adults get involved, it gets too complicated and too expensive, and too commercialized and too exploited," he says.

Adults become kids

But we're a long way from adults ruining the holiday; "I don't think any kid would agree with that," Bannatyne says, and many aspects of Halloween celebrations are things families can do together. Plus adults need their stress relief, too. We live in a scary world of Ebola and video beheadings. Walking around with a plastic chain saw is one way to process that. Bannatyne says, "This is a night where you take things you can't control, and you put your arms around them."

Indeed, the fun of Halloween makes me wish other holidays could employ similar tactics to liven up the calendar. Mardi Gras could go big with the costumes. On St. Patrick's Day, the leprechaun already brings some kids candy; maybe he could leave more at neighbors' houses if kids went to visit. The Fourth of July is in a retail dead zone; someone enterprising could start a patriotic trend of decking the halls with items from all 50 states.

In any case, with the weather turning colder, it's nice to have something to look forward to. Anticipation accounts for a major chunk of human happiness. The days may be getting darker, but soon that Batman costume will show up in the mail. For one day, life can be light for kids and adults alike. "You can dress up as whatever you want to be, and you get paid in candy," says Morton.

At any age, that's hard to beat.

Damaged GOP brand undermines election win ; Victory should have been cakewalk

While political prognosticators forecast a GOP takeover of the Senate in the midterm elections, Democrats are still in the fight even though Republicans should have coasted to victory.

A year ago, few would have expected the GOP would be on the ropes in Kansas, Kentucky and Georgia. Kansas Republicans haven't lost a Senate race since 1932. Now, Sen. Pat Roberts is nearly tied with businessman Greg Orman, an independent. GOP minority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, who hails from a deep red state, has been in a fierce battle with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.

Republicans should be alarmed they've had to marshal so many resources to win in an environment that so overwhelmingly favors them. The number of baked-in advantages for the GOP this election cycle is remarkable.

There's the landscape: Democrats are defending 21 seats; the GOP 15. Only one of those GOP states, Maine, went for President Obama in 2012. But the Dems are struggling to hold on to seats in seven states: Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia, that Obama lost.

Then there's the wildly unpopular Democratic president, an albatross around the neck of red-state Dems. Obama's approval ratings have been in a free fall for months as he fumbled through a series of high profile crises including Ebola and ISIL.

Really, how much easier could this be for the GOP? While bombarding voters with the message of a world out of control, which they've pinned on Democrats, recent data show that GOP campaigns, committees and outside groups have "outspent Democrats on the air in every top Senate battleground since the end of the primaries."

While South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia seem to be lost causes for Democrats, the most recent NBC/Marist poll shows Senate races in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and North Carolina within three points. In Georgia, recent polls favor Democrat Michelle Nunn, who is fighting Rep. David Perdue. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu leads her Republican opponent by a point, but is likely headed for a runoff. A Friday poll showed the Alaska Senate race in a tie.

For all the talk of how damaged Democrats are, the GOP brand is actually more dinged up. Pew Research Center reports that 55% of registered voters have an unfavorable impression of the GOP, and only 39% view the party favorably. For Dems, it's 48% say unfavorable and 47% favorable.

Things will only get harder for the GOP in 2016 when they will be defending 24 seats to the Dems' 10. Five of the GOP states went for Obama twice, and two more gave him their votes once.

If Republicans pull off a takeover of the Senate next week, their excitement should be tempered by reality. If they had to fight so hard on their home turf in a year of cascading crises, their future doesn't look so bright.

After criticism, the New Jersey Department of Health decided to discharge a nurse from mandatory quarantine who tested negative for Ebola. She had worked with Ebola patients in West Africa.

I'm sure the doctor in New York who ended up testing positive for Ebola thought he wasn't a threat either.

Sometimes in the interest of public health it may be better for everyone if these health care workers don't get on subways or go to the bowling alley, as the doctor reportedly did.

These health care workers should just get through the quarantine. It's not like they are being kept in a cell. They should watch some TV. If they don't get sick, then they get to go home.

If they do, then they'll be treated promptly and get over it before going home.

Braxton Deal

This nurse was willing to volunteer to go halfway around the world to help people from another country deal with Ebola, but was unwilling to be quarantined to protect the health of her countrymen.

Harry Papers

The quarantine restrictions for healthy medical care workers were totally unnecessary, wrongfully applied and surely politically motivated grandstanding.

Ray Gilbert Johns

LETTERS

How selfish can you be? The nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey for observation was being asked to give up only a few weeks of her life.

We have military personnel giving up months of their lives to help people halfway around the world. Give me a break!

The nurse who was quarantined chose to expose herself. We have the right to be safe.

@ddavisonnc

Mandatory quarantines for those without symptoms is a violation of civil rights.

We should have mandatory quarantines for people from Ebola- infected areas.

Quarantines are absolutely right. Individuals take risks by traveling.

Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, could find herself subjected to close monitoring for Ebola when she returns from West Africa later this week.

The White House and the State Department said the ambassador, who is visiting Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, would abide by whatever local or state restrictions are in place when she returns to the United States.

Power, 44, is scheduled to be in New York by Friday. The office of Gov. Cuomo provided no information on whether or how Power and her traveling companions would be subject to state restrictions.

New York state now requires any person who has visited affected areas but had no direct contact with Ebola patients -- which the State Department said applies to Power -- be "treated on a case-by- case basis" concerning possible isolation. At a minimum, this kind of returning traveler would be monitored for symptoms and fever twice daily by state health officials for 21 days.

Governors' hasty quarantine adds to Ebola problems

In the face of Ebola, what's needed most are cool heads and swift, decisive action. Over the weekend, the governors of New York and New Jersey got the swift part down pat, but in their rush to impose a quarantine, they made a hash of it.

The governors -- Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie -- seem to have ignored the impact of their actions on the people being quarantined, some of whom are health workers who risked their lives to fight Ebola in Africa, as well as the quarantine's effect on the essential U.S. effort to control the disease at the source.

Instead, they bluntly declared Friday that anyone coming through airports in their states who'd been in contact with Ebola would be quarantined.

Kaci Hickox, a nurse who had treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was the first person caught up in the quarantine.

According to her account in The Dallas Morning News, she was placed in a "quarantine office" for six hours, with little information and nothing to eat except a granola bar and water.

After transport to a Newark hospital, she was housed in an outside tent with a toilet but no shower. She had no symptoms, and no temperature. A blood test came back negative. But it took until Monday for the Christie administration to free her so she could go home to Maine, where health officials will decide what's next. She is worried that other returning doctors and nurses will "be made to feel like criminals and prisoners."

It gets worse. New Jersey appears to have given no thought to who will pay potentially huge hospital bills for those who are quarantined. "Those are details that will be disclosed at a later time," said a spokesman for the state's health department, which is not good news.

Insurance company representatives say health coverage typically begins for patients if and when they present with symptoms and need to be treated. So the reward for people who courageously went abroad to save others may be massive personal costs. New York at least said it would provide help to those placed in 21-day home quarantine, though how much is unclear.

The broader health impact is no less troubling. It's hard to imagine who will go to Africa if they must face not just mortal danger but also a large financial penalty and loss of their freedom. Yet virtually everyone agrees that containing the disease in Africa is the only way to defeat it.

A charitable explanation of the governors' impulsiveness is that they are responsible for protecting their citizens, and voluntary isolation has been problematic. A Dallas nurse who cared for a critically ill Ebola patient got on a plane from Cleveland to Dallas with a fever. A New York City doctor, hospitalized Thursday with Ebola, traveled on subways and went bowling the night before. NBC medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman broke a quarantine to pick up food.

If such behavior continues and other people catch the disease, quarantines will be hard to avoid. But not slapdash versions like the ones that Cuomo and Christie imposed and governors of Illinois and Florida aped.

Punishing people for heroism and undercutting the main line of attack against Ebola are not just irresponsible actions. They are dangerous ones.

Can news media meet the Ebola challenge? ; Deadly virus must be covered responsibly, not hysterically

It's clear that the Ebola story is not going away anytime soon. That presents the news media with a serious challenge -- and a major opportunity.

Ebola has all the elements that can bring out journalism's worst instincts, and in some cases already has, with cable being a prime offender. And it can be a social media nightmare as misinformation ricochets through the Twitterverse.

That's particularly true with Ebola not just in faraway Africa, where it has done such serious damage, but also in the United States, where last Thursday it made its well-chronicled debut in New York City.

That the Ebola story is a big deal is unarguable. The Ebola outbreak has infected more than 10,000 people and has killed nearly 5,000 so far. It has a mortality rate of 70%, according to the World Health Organization.

And as the disease spread to the USA, some blithe reassurances have quickly unraveled. The performance of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas hardly helped calm the nerves. It clearly wasn't ready to deal with the first Ebola patient in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, who had contracted the disease in Liberia. Two of the nurses treating him caught the disease.

So Ebola is a huge international story, and its arrival here demands intense coverage. But not too intense. The challenge is keep some perspective, to inform without panicking the populace.

Four cases -- three of them involving health care workers who have had close contact with Ebola patients -- is hardly an epidemic. And the disease, while deadly once you get it, is not spread through the air, only via bodily fluids. So it's pretty hard to get.

That leads to a big-time journalistic juggling act, one in which it is all too easy to drop the balls.

And cable, off course, has dropped plenty of them. Witness the devastating collage of Hysteria TV put together by Jon Stewart earlier this month. The breathless, alarmist reports, many from CNN and Fox, are the antithesis of what responsible journalists should be doing.

As was the ludicrous effort by CNN's Ashleigh Banfield to hammer the notion that Ebola is the ISIS of biological agents and raise the specter of suicide attackers brandishing Ebola.

But you don't have to go to such theater of the absurd lengths to do damage. The very fact of wall-to-wall coverage communicates the idea that the end is nigh, even if the coverage is peppered with the appropriate disclaimers. I was struck by that while watching CNN last Friday, the day after New York physician Craig Spencer had been diagnosed with the disease. When something is endlessly on the screen, to the exclusion everything else going on in the world, it gives the strong impression that we are engulfed in crisis.

Yes, it's a big story. But not one so overarching at this stage that it must monopolize the news.

This month Lara Setrakian, the founder of the immersive website Syria Deeply, launched Ebola Deeply, a one-stop venue for news about the deadly disease. I asked Setrakian for some of her thoughts on how the media should approach the story. The key, she says, is context. "We need to maintain a sense of balance and proportionality," she says. "It's important to avoid an overemphasis on one-off cases at the expense of the bigger story."

That "bigger story," of course, is Ebola in Africa, where the disease has claimed so many. For months Ebola wasn't a dominant story in the U.S. even while Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia were ravaged. But when two Americans in Liberia came down with the disease in late July, the American media took notice. The outbreak "started in Africa and will end in Africa," Setrakian says.

Despite the missteps, Setrakian sees great opportunity for the media to help sort things out. "There's no better time for journalism as sense-making," she says. And, she adds pointedly, "Media coverage has to be responsible when the stakes are this high."

After weeks of focusing on the "3 E's" -- Ebola, Europe and earnings -- Wall Street will refocus its vision today on the "3 F's" -- Facebook, the Federal Reserve and fundamentals.

The market is again focusing on business fundamentals rather than fear. Today investors will get fresh insights into how the U.S. economy is performing with a high-profile batch of corporate pronouncements, news events and corporate earnings reports.

Investors will get fresh readings on durable goods orders, home prices and consumer confidence. Wall Street is expecting September orders of refrigerators and other durable goods to rise 0.3% after last month's 18.4% drop, UBS says. The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index for August is also on the docket, with economists expecting the 20-city composite index to rise 0.2%. The Conference Board will release its October data on the mood of the American consumer, with Wall Street expecting a reading of 87.3, up from 86 last month.

The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day policy meeting today, and Wall Street will be handicapping whether the Fed will end its market-friendly bond-buying program at the end of the month as expected, or whether it will hold off due to recent market turbulence as one Fed official has hinted might happen.

After the closing bell, social media darling Facebook issues its quarterly profit report. Investors are expecting earnings to jump more than 60% to 40 cents a share vs. a year ago.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie failed to respond to requests for an opposing view.

Charles Krauthammer, Fox News: "Even though there's a dispute over the details of (the quarantine), there is now a national consensus, as there should be, that if you return from that zone, particularly if you have a fever, you can be in quarantine; which of course is an infringement on your civil liberties. (But) we seem all to agree that quarantine -- meaning the state depriving you of liberty -- is the way to go in a potential epidemic."

Errol Louis, CNN: "Forcing volunteers to sit in a quarantine center for three weeks will discourage, and in some cases halt, the desire of good-hearted professionals to volunteer to fight the war against Ebola. The great irony is that the politicians, driven by ambition, are going to contain, quarantine, hassle and discourage the people who really do have the right stuff: Men and women willing to put their lives on the line to save the rest of us."

The Wall Street Journal, editorial: "So the Obama administration is pressuring the governors of New York and New Jersey behind the scenes to reverse their decision on Friday to impose a mandatory quarantine on health workers returning from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. Well, if it weren't for the administration's incompetence in handling Ebola risks on U.S. soil, maybe the state leaders wouldn't have felt they had to take matters into their own hands. This patchwork mess is what happens when the federal government demonstrates a persistent record of incompetence and incredibility. As long as that holds, the governors shouldn't be criticized for using even blunt tools to protect the public."

Kaci Hickox, The Dallas Morning News: "I am a nurse who has just returned to the U.S. after working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone -- an Ebola-affected country. I have been quarantined in New Jersey. This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me. I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa. I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine."

New Jersey sent a Doctors Without Borders nurse home to Maine on Monday after a weekend of forced isolation as governors, health officials and the military wrestled with how to handle medical workers back from Ebola duty in West Africa.

The Centers for Disease Control issued updated guidance, recommending voluntary, at-home quarantine for travelers from West Africa who are at highest risk for being infected with Ebola. Those with lower risk will be monitored but not quarantined.

The guidelines came after governors of several states, including New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Maryland, outlined mandatory quarantines for returning medical workers.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, announced the release of nurse Kaci Hickox on Monday via Twitter, in the face of backlash over her treatment and scientific evidence that suggests only those infected and symptomatic can spread the virus, and then only through bodily fluids.

Hickox had called her involuntary confinement without Ebola symptoms in a spartan tent without heat, a shower or a flushable toilet "inhumane" and threatened to go to court to seek her release.

Hickox, 33, was the first person pulled aside at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday under Christie's order following her return from Sierra Leone. She said she had no symptoms, although Christie said she was ill.

Meanwhile, a U.S. Army commander said he and his troops returning from Liberia will remain in isolation for 21 days in Italy. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams told The Associated Press that the decision to isolate returning troops was taken to ensure their family members' comfort, even though he none are showing symptoms, and he does not believe any soldier under his command is at risk.

The White House on Sunday said that it is working on new guidelines for health care workers returning from Ebola-stricken states, according to a senior administration official.

The decision comes as governors in Illinois, New Jersey and New York announced over the weekend that they were instituting quarantines for aid workers returning from West Africa.

The White House stopped short of calling on states to reverse their rules, but administration officials have made clear to governors that they have concerns with unintended consequences of policies not grounded in science, said a senior administra- tion official who asked not to be identified to discuss the private communications. The new guidelines are expected to be unveiled in coming days, the official said.

Earlier, other aides to President Obama criticized decisions by three states to quarantine people who are returning from Ebola- stricken West Africa.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said quarantines may discourage health workers from traveling to West Africa to help block the disease at its source. "If you put everyone in one basket, even people who are clearly no threat, then we have the problem of the disincentive of people that we need," Fauci said on ABC's This Week. "Let's not forget the best way to stop this epidemic and protect America is to stop it in Africa."

Officials who acted in the wake of a new Ebola case in New York said they cannot rely on people to quarantine themselves.

"I don't think when you're dealing with something as serious as this you can count on a voluntary system," said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, speaking on Fox News Sunday.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, defended the quarantine policy Sunday in a radio interview. By Sunday evening, he had loosened the restrictions. He said health care workers can be quarantined at home and the state will pay for any lost compensation. On Friday, Cuomo had said workers would be held in a government-regulated facility.

In New Jersey, Kaci Hickox, a nurse who worked with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was the first to be quarantined under the new rules when she arrived at Newark on Friday. Her case raised human rights concerns.

A disease such as Ebola inspires so much fear that it can cloud our thinking -- so much so that someone who has behaved heroically can start to seem like the enemy.

Many Americans are furious that a New York doctor took the subway and went bowling after returning from Guinea, where he treated Ebola patients. Physician Craig Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola on Thursday.

But people might feel less anger at Spencer -- and maybe even grow to respect his sacrifice -- if they think about the USA's first Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan.

Dallas officials quarantined Duncan's family because they shared an apartment with him. His family would have had a very high risk of becoming sick if Duncan had a respiratory infection, such as MERS, SARS or avian flu. Those viruses spread through the air. Ebola doesn't.

One month later -- well past the 21-day incubation period for Ebola -- none has become sick. In fact, Texas health officials have cleared 67 people who were being observed because of their contact with Duncan.

The fact that Duncan's family is thriving -- while two of his nurses became infected -- illustrates the unusual nature of the Ebola virus, and why it poses a threat to hospital workers, but not to the average person.

Ebola doesn't spread easily in the general population, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston. That's because people with Ebola aren't contagious until they begin showing symptoms, such as a fever, which only occurs when they have detectable levels of virus in their blood. So no matter how mobile a patient is -- and no matter how many public places they visit -- people with Ebola aren't going to spread the disease until they develop a fever or other tell-tale signs, Hotez says.

That can be a hard concept to accept. After all, Ebola is incredibly deadly, with a 70% mortality rate. But we should remember that deadliness is not the same as infectiousness. Pancreatic cancer is almost universally fatal. But it's not contagious.

As Duncan's case illustrates, even symptomatic Ebola patients aren't that contagious in the early stages. That's because there isn't a lot of Ebola virus in a patient's blood at that point, Hotez says.

If Duncan's family didn't get Ebola after living with him, what are the odds that people will get sick because they ran into Spencer on a subway platform?

Now, I'm not saying that Ebola isn't contagious. The virus has infected 10,000 people in West Africa, with no sign of letting up.

But the key here is when Ebola becomes contagious. In the later stages of disease, the virus begins to multiply wildly, using the human body as its copying machine. As viral levels rise, even a small amount of blood is teeming with Ebola, says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

This puts hospital workers at very high risk, Osterholm says. It also illustrates why the average Ebola patient in West Africa spreads the disease to one or two other people. The average measles patient, on the other hand, spreads the virus to up to 18 susceptible people. If Ebola spread as easily as measles or the flu, there would be millions of cases, not thousands.

But here's why you and I don't need to worry: Patients at advanced stages of Ebola don't go bowling. They're too sick to circulate in the general population. In the USA, patients this sick end up in a hospital's intensive care unit. In countries such as Liberia --where there are hospital beds for one in five patients - - those with advanced disease languish at home or, even worse, on the street.

Most of us turn away from people this sick. Spencer didn't. By helping to control the disease in Africa, Osterholm says, Spencer helped to protect Americans.

The bigger the Ebola outbreak in Africa gets, the greater the chance that it could spread around the world.

"The big risk is not stopping the outbreak in Africa, and that will happen if health care workers don't go there," Osterholm says. "The very low risk posed by any health care worker coming back here pales in comparison to the consequences of not controlling the outbreak in Africa."

Pentagon builds units to move Ebola patients ; Can be used on Air Force transport planes

As U.S. troops head to West Africa, the Pentagon is developing portable isolation units that can carry up to 12 Ebola patients for transport on military planes.

The Pentagon doesn't expect it will need the units for more than 3,000 U.S. troops heading to the region to combat the virus because military personnel will not be treating Ebola patients directly. Instead, the troops are focusing on building clinics, training personnel and testing patient blood samples for Ebola.

"We want to be prepared to care for the people we do have there just out of an abundance of caution," said Pentagon spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea. She said prototypes would be tested in the next month before being deployed in the field by January.

Currently, transport of Ebola patients from overseas is done by Phoenix Air, a government contractor based in Georgia whose modified business jet is capable of carrying just a single patient.

The Pentagon's transportation system will allow the Air Force to use C-17 or C-130 transport planes to carry up to eight patients on stretchers or 12 able to walk, said Charles Bass, a Pentagon chemical engineer working on the project. Elzea said she couldn't provide the cost of the units because the contract for the project is still under negotiation.

Bass, a former Army officer, said the units provide peace of mind to U.S. troops in Africa.

"It's important when you're on deployment that you feel that someone has your back," he said. "(It) adds confidence to the people who are deployed."

Phoenix Air, which currently offers the only medically approved means of carrying Ebola patients at a cost of $200,000 a flight, has flown more than a dozen missions since late July, said Dent Thompson, company vice president of operations.

That includes flights carrying three people infected with Ebola - - physician Kent Brantly, missionary Nancy Writebol and cameraman Ashoka Mukpo -- from Africa to the United States. The company also has carried other patients or those exposed to the virus to Europe and within the USA, Thompson added.

Phoenix Air handles emergency Ebola flights through a contract with the State Department.

The Pentagon isolation units will be similar but smaller than the ones used by Phoenix Air. Those units, created four years ago, were developed in response to emerging diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory System.

The containment system is a tent-like structure held up by a metal framework within the jet. The single patient is attended to by a doctor and two nurses in flight, Thompson said.

In the Pentagon's version, patients will be divided between two isolation units.

A connected structure will allow medical personnel leaving the units to remove potentially contaminated protective gear, Bass said.

To decontaminate the plane after each flight, Phoenix Air uses a process of fogging and spraying toxic disinfectant inside the module before removing and incinerating it. Similar procedures will be used for the military's isolation units, Bass said.

God is not to blame for Ebola outbreak ; Religious leaders should allay fears

There's been a lot of talk about God's role in the Ebola outbreak. Kent Brantly, the American physician who contracted the disease while helping patients in Liberia, concluded after his recovery that "God saved my life."

In sharp contrast, Monrovia's Daily Observer reports that the Liberian Council of Churches, representing mainstream Episcopalians and non-denominational evangelicals, agreed in a resolution that "God is angry with Liberia. Liberians have to pray and seek God's forgiveness over the corruption and immoral acts that continue to penetrate our society."

This is not the first time religious leaders have blamed plagues and other catastrophes on God's anger.

Remember when the Rev. Pat Robertson linked Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to America's laxness with abortions? And the Rev. Jerry Falwell claimed that the Sept.11 attacks were caused by God's wrath at "pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians, the ACLU (and) People for the American Way."

I understand why some faith leaders interpret these catastrophes as God's punishment. Many passages in the Old Testament say that. The most familiar passage is about the 10 plagues visited on Egyptians in Exodus.

But there are phrases that say the opposite about God's role. How about:

Job's theology, which severs the connection between sin and suffering. At the beginning, Job is called "a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil."

Yet Job suffers terribly. At the end, when God finally talks to Job about his afflictions, God never even mentions sin. At best, says God, the reasons are unfathomable.

Genesis tells how all humans are interconnected because we all descended from Adam and Eve. In our time, the Internet illustrates that interconnectedness. So does a global economy. On the scary side, so does Ebola.

Isaiah's message tells us what humans should do about Ebola victims. "On your fast day you see to your business and oppress all your laborers. This is the fast I (God) desire. It is to share your bread with the hungry, and to take the wretched poor into your home; when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to ignore your own kin."

The Rev. Demetrius Carolina Sr., pastor to many Liberians of Staten Island, N.Y., told me: "The greater sin is the sin of inhumanity. God is merciful, and he expects human beings to love his creation. The response to natural disaster is a matter of human will and choice."

As religious leaders, let's help calm this crisis by selecting from the complete biblical menu and not just a part. Job, Genesis and Isaiah tell us that Ebola's spread is not a response to our sinfulness but a challenge for our resourcefulness.

Uber's one-shot deal: Flu vaccine

The Uber driver had just turned on his cellphone when the call came in. Someone five minutes away wanted a flu shot. The SUV limo carried nurse Kate Dicker to the address, and she gathered her gear and went inside.

Dicker and a few dozen other nurses spent the day Thursday delivering on-demand flu shots to homes and offices in Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. Customers who normally use the Uber cellphone app to call for a ride instead used it to get a free flu shot.

Uber, which has done similar promotions with less vital products such as ice cream, paid the drivers.

The nurses' pay and the cost of the vaccine were covered by Passport Health, a Baltimore-based provider of travel medicine and immunization services, and Pager, a New York-based health care provider.

"I called because I am very serious about getting a flu shot every year," said David Cohen-Tanugi, who saw an e-mail about the one-day promotion by the car service Thursday morning and tried a few times before Dicker arrived at Embr Labs, the company Cohen- Tanug co-founded. Juggling a start-up and his Ph.D. dissertation leaves little time to make it to a clinic, he said, and his co- workers don't have health insurance.

"I'm really happy Uber is exploring creative and alternative uses for their platform, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes," Cohen-Tanugi said.

The idea for the promotion, called UberHEALTH, came from John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

He said he's long been troubled by how inconvenient it is to get a flu shot -- and how important.

Every year anywhere from 3,000 to 49,000 Americans die from the flu, depending on the strain, severity and length of season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Flu shots aren't perfect, but they can prevent or lessen most infections.

Flu shots are particularly recommended this year because of fears of Ebola, which shares the flu's early symptoms.

CDC caught in Ebola Catch-22 ; One new case could undermine public's newfound confidence

The Ebola situation is testing the world's best infectious disease team, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at its ability to perform crisis management. While the immediate threat in the United States appears to be receding, it is far from clear that we're up to facing a stronger test.

The CDC is one of the great institutions of our federal government. Microbiologists, such as myself, idolize the scientists who have dedicated their careers and lives to making the planet safer. But the CDC has made some major missteps. Some understandable mistakes are clearly from inexperience in dealing with Ebola, but others are harder to explain. For instance, effective communication is a vital part of all crisis management, which should be a core function at the agency.

Inevitable criticism

But that's also harder than it looks. CDC has found itself in a Catch-22. It's a nearly impossible balancing act to provide accurate information without unnecessarily frightening the public. Whether CDC said too much or too little, it was going to be criticized by the news media. The outbreak spread, so the CDC was condemned for being unprepared. But if the outbreak had fizzled, it would have been chastised for fear mongering.

Likely aware of this, the CDC chose the worst possible action: In an effort to keep the public calm, the CDC pretended to know more about Ebola than it actually does.

First, the CDC insisted that Ebola is very difficult to transmit from person to person. But, that is clearly not true. This particular Ebola strain appears to be more infectious than others. In an interview with Vox, virologist Peter Jahrling worried that this strain exhibits a higher "viral load," which means it produces more virus particles. That could explain why the current outbreak is the largest in history, more than 20 times bigger than the previous record-setter, and in a worst-case scenario, without new mitigating measures, the epidemic could become 3,000 times as large.

Second, the CDC insisted that Ebola is not airborne. That is probably mostly true, but it may not be entirely true. While airborne transmission is unlikely to explain more than just a few cases, it is still theoretically possible. Research published in 2012 suggested that infected pigs could transmit Ebola to monkeys through the air. However, as epidemiologist Tara Smith explains, pigs are thought to be particularly nasty disease spreaders. Just because pigs can pass Ebola through the air does not necessarily mean humans can, too.

Finally, the CDC has relied on a 21-day quarantine period for people who may have been exposed to Ebola. But, a new study by Charles Haas from Drexel University suggests that this may not be sufficient. His research shows that a person has about a 12% chance of being infected with Ebola after the 21-day quarantine period expires.

Not clueless

The CDC is not clueless. It is definitely capable of containing Ebola. But the agency, specifically its chief, Tom Frieden, has conveyed a sense of confidence that is not completely convincing. Frieden's credibility was shaken when nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson contracted the disease, despite CDC reassurances that this was unlikely to occur.

What will happen if another person becomes infected, especially if it occurs outside the 21-day quarantine time frame or via the airborne route? Even though fears are fading now, a single new case could completely undermine public confidence.

New voice

The solution for the CDC is straightforward. It needs to find a spokesperson who can properly spell out exactly what scientists do and do not know about Ebola. If Frieden is unable or unwilling to do so, then the CDC should find somebody who is. Explaining nuances and embracing uncertainty are never popular public relations strategies, but they are far better than pretending to have all the answers.

As if it hadn't isolated itself enough, North Korea closed itself off more Thursday by shuttering its borders to tourists because of the threat of the Ebola virus.

Travel companies based in China that specialize in the small but growing business of taking tourists to North Korea were notified of the ban Thursday by their partners inside the country. It takes effect today.

"The reason given was Ebola, and I can't think of any other reason, as they don't arbitrarily close the border," said Simon Cockerell, managing director of Koryo Tours, one of the largest operators.

North Korea has long been cut off from outside influences -- both by its authoritarian regime and through sanctions imposed by the international community. The last such closure was a four-month ban in 2003, when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was seriously affecting Beijing. China's capital is the main gateway for travelers to North Korea.

Cockerell said the new ban "seems a bit arbitrary as there have been no reported Ebola cases in Beijing."

In 2013, 5,000 to 6,000 Western tourists traveled to North Korea, according to Cockerell. At least one-quarter were from the USA, he said. The majority of visitors come from China.

The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea and warns Americans against visiting a nation known for its belligerent posturing and nuclear ambitions.

"It's a pity we must cancel many tour groups in the following days," said Gao Fuying at the China Youth Travel company in Dandong, a city on the Yalu River, which separates China and North Korea. "I think it's just because of Ebola, not other political reasons."

What a day. Stocks got a major boost Thursday from a slew of strong earnings reports from companies ranging from heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar to automaker General Motors.

The Dow Jones industrial average came close to having its best day of 2014, but news about a New York City doctor being rushed to a hospital on Ebola fears trimmed a 300-point gain to 216.58 points for the day. Preliminary tests on the doctor came back positive, it was disclosed late Thursday, long after markets closed. The blue- chip benchmark ended up 1.3% at 16,677.90.

The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 23.71 points, or 1.2%, to close at 1950.82, while the Nasdaq composite ended up 69.94 points, 1.6%, to finish at 4452.79. The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to 2.27% from 2.22% as investors jumped back into stocks.

Today's rally on Wall Street is part of a larger recovery story for the stock market that began late last week when intense selling pressure suddenly reversed course amid a drop in so-called "headline risk," says Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial.

Lamb points out that the S&P 500 and Dow have been able to climb back above their average price levels over the past 200 days after dipping briefly below that closely watched 200-day moving average last week. Stocks are considered in an uptrend when the major stock indexes are above that trend line.

Better-than-expected profit reports in the transportation sector, where Southwest and United Continental topped forecasts, and the media space, where Comcast beat expectations -- set up the market for a good day. The batch of strong earnings is easing fears that slowdowns in Europe and China will have a meaningful impact on U.S. growth.

"Wall Street is taking the earnings news as a signal that the global slowdown that everyone was worried about is unlikely to be as pronounced as feared earlier," says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.

Warne stresses that earnings reports that will flood the market the next two weeks will drive the direction of stock prices. Lamb calls the recent market swoon, which knocked the S&P 500 down 9.5%, a "little squall" that hits from time to time.

Investors also reacted Thursday to the latest weekly reading on initial jobless claims, which rose 17,000 to 283,000. But the less- volatile four-week moving average came in at 281,000, lowest since May 2000, UBS said.

Shares of banana giant Chiquita Brands International surged about 8% after a group of Brazil-based suitors raised their takeover bid by 50 cents to $14.50 a share. Shares closed at $13.76 Thursday. The second sweetened offer by Cutrale Group and Safra Group in about a week came on the eve of a shareholders' vote today on Chiquita's proposed purchase of Irish rival Fyffes. The new offer values Chiquita at nearly $680 million.

NUMBER OF THE DAY: $100,000,000

That's Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's latest pledge for battling Ebola. He said on his website that it will go to the State Department for containment units to evacuate health professionals from West Africa. It is one of several donations he's made toward fighting Ebola. Other tech billionaire Ebola donations: $50 million from fellow Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' foundation, and $25 million from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan.

GM SAYS RECALL CHARGES DONE, EARNINGS RISE

General Motors CFO Chuck Stevens said the company foresees no more special charges against earnings for its massive recalls this year as GM posted third-quarter earnings of $1.4billion, about double the profit a year ago. The automaker wrote off $2.5 billion the first two quarters for repairs to about 30 million vehicles called back for repairs this year. Shares closed at $30.93, down 1.2%. Ford Motor reports earnings today before the market opens.

Nurses face obstacles on front lines against Ebola

In the fight against Ebola, nurses are on the front lines, risking their own health to care for others. They want hospitals to have their backs.

After two U.S. nurses have been stricken, several nursing groups and safety advocates argue that the risk at hospitals across the USA is higher than necessary because of widespread problems with preparedness training, infection control gear, workplace culture and nurse staffing levels.

The threat of Ebola lays bare these larger issues while underscoring the overall danger of working in health care.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration reported 653,900 on-the-job illnesses and injuries in the health care and social assistance industry in 2010, more than in any other field, even manufacturing and construction.

OSHA inspected only 138 of more than 5,000 U.S. hospitals in 2011, and state safety agencies inspected 233, according to the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, a Massachusetts- based coalition of worker safety advocates.

"In some respects, the Ebola outbreak has highlighted the need to have better safety programs in place in hospitals," says Mary Vogel, the coalition's executive director.

Hospital officials insist they're doing all they can. The American Hospital Association, along with the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association, pledged in a statement to ensure "all front-line health care providers have the proper training, equipment and protocols to remain safe."

Some nurses say they do feel fully prepared. Ashley Britt, a charge nurse at the University of Louisville Hospital, says nurses there frequently care for infectious patients while wearing protective equipment. They take part in Ebola-preparedness drills, gather for "safety huddles" at the start of each shift and get the latest Ebola information from their hospital system, KentuckyOne Health.

That isn't true across-the-board, some nurses and nurse groups say. In a national survey of nearly 3,000 nurses by the California Nurses Association, 84% said their facility hadn't educated them on responding to Ebola beyond a handout or sending them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

"There's a lot that's lacking," said Deborah Burger, co- president of the National Nurses United union. "In Liberia, Ebola is called 'the nurse killer.' Nurses (everywhere) are more at risk."

Burger says some nurses lack proper equipment. Dallas nurses treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of Ebola, said their gear left some skin exposed.

Monday, the CDC released guidelines, including wearing gear that exposes no skin and being supervised while putting it on and taking it off. A day later, a survey of 1,900 nurses by the networking site allnurses.com found only 23% said their facility can implement them within a month.

Safety advocates say hospitals must ensure there are enough nurses to provide safe care. "Many hospitals are down to bare bones as far as nurse staffing," says Kevin Kavanagh, an infection control activist who leads the watchdog group Health Watch USA. "Studies point out that nursing staffing, when it becomes stressed, is related to more (overall) infection."

John Kauchick, a traveling operating room nurse who works mostly in Texas and New Mexico, says workplace culture can present challenges. Some managers resist even science-based suggestions by front-line nurses, and whistle-blowers are often punished. The bottom line, he says, is nurses need support as well as equipment and training.

Health officials prepared Thursday for what appears to be the first Ebola case in New York City as the World Health Organization warned that the infectious disease is spreading through West Africa faster than it can be contained.

In New York, officials said a doctor who recently returned from West Africa underwent tests for the Ebola virus at Bellevue Hospital after developing a fever and other symptoms. The organization Doctors Without Borders said the patient had treated patients in West Africa.

The Associated Press identified the patient as Craig Spencer and said that preliminary results showed he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Health officials are retracing his steps to determine whom he may have come in contact with before and after showing symptoms.

Spencer works for NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which released a statement Thursday night saying "he has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas."

Officials tried to reassure city residents. Mayor Bill de Blasio says there's no reason for residents to be alarmed by the diagnosis. He said all city officials followed "clear and strong" protocols in handling the doctor.

The city "is taking all necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of all New Yorkers," a statement on New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation's website said. "The chances of the average New Yorker contracting Ebola are extremely slim. You cannot be infected simply by being near someone who has Ebola."

City officials say Spencer acknowledged riding the subway and taking a cab to a Brooklyn bowling alley in the past week before showing symptoms.

His Harlem apartment was cordoned off, and his fiancee, who was not showing symptoms, was being watched in a quarantine ward at Bellevue. The Department of Health was on site across the street from the apartment building Thursday night, giving out information to area residents.

As the World Health Organization put out a plea for more action against the West Africa outbreak, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen pledged to give at least $100 million to the fight.

Allen said the money will go through the State Department to develop containment units for the evacuation of health professionals in West Africa, and through the University of Massachusetts Medical School for training and equipment in Liberia.

The United States is in a perpetual state of national emergency. Thirty separate emergencies, in fact.

An emergency declared by President Carter on the 10th day of the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 remains in effect almost 35 years later.

A post-9/11 emergency declared by President George W. Bush -- and renewed six times by President Obama -- forms the legal basis for much of the war on terror.

Tuesday, Obama informed Congress he was extending another Bush- era emergency for a year, saying "widespread violence and atrocities" in the Democratic Republic of Congo "pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States."

Those emergencies, declared by the president by proclamation or executive order, give the president extraordinary powers -- to seize property, call up the National Guard and hire and fire military officers at will.

"What the National Emergencies Act does is like a toggle switch, and when the president flips it, he gets new powers. It's like a magic wand. and there are very few constraints about how he turns it on," said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University.

If invoked during a public health emergency, a presidential emergency declaration could allow hospitals more flexibility to treat Ebola cases. The Obama administration has said such an emergency for Ebola is unnecessary.

In his six years in office, President Obama has declared nine emergencies, allowed one to expire and extended 22 emergencies enacted by his predecessors.

Since 1976, when Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, presidents have declared at least 53 states of emergency -- not counting disaster declarations for events such as tornadoes and floods, according to a USA TODAY review of presidential documents. Most of those emergencies remain in effect.

Even as Congress has delegated emergency powers to the president, it has provided almost no oversight. The 1976 law requires each house of Congress to meet within six months of an emergency to vote it up or down. That's never happened.

Instead, many emergencies linger for years or even decades.

In May, President Obama rescinded a Bush-era executive order that protected Iraqi oil interests and their contractors from legal liability. Even as he did so, he left the state of emergency declared in that executive order intact -- because at least two other executive orders rely on it.

broad powers

Invoking those emergencies can give presidents broad and virtually unchecked powers. In an article published last year in the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, attorney Patrick Thronson identified 160 laws giving the president emergency powers, including:

Reshaping the military, putting members of the armed forces under foreign command, conscripting veterans, overturning sentences issued by courts-martial and taking over weather satellites for military use.

Suspending environmental laws, including a law forbidding the dumping of toxic and infectious medical waste at sea.

Bypassing federal contracting laws, allowing the government to buy and sell property without competitive bidding.

All these provisions come from laws passed by Congress, giving the president the power to invoke them with the stroke of a pen. "A lot of laws are passed like that. So if a president is hunting around for additional authority, declaring an emergency is pretty easy," Scheppele said.

In 2009, Obama declared an emergency for the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. That emergency, which expired a year later, allowed for waivers of some federal regulations -- for example, permitting hospitals to treat an infectious illness off-site -- and to waive medical privacy laws.

The White House said an Ebola emergency isn't necessary. "I'm not aware of any consideration that currently is underway (for) any sort of national medical emergency," spokesman Josh Earnest said last week. "I wouldn't rule it out, but frankly that's not something that we're actively considering right now."

Presidential emergency powers are hardly new.

President Franklin Roosevelt declared a state of emergency in 1933 to prevent a run on banks, and President Truman declared one in 1950 at the beginning of the Korean War. After President Nixon declared two states of emergency in 17 months, Congress became alarmed by four simultaneous states of emergency.

It passed the National Emergencies Act, requiring the president to cite a legal basis for the emergency and say which emergency powers he would exercise. All emergencies expire after a year if not renewed.

Three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Bush issued Proclamation 7463. It allowed him to call up the National Guard and appoint and fire military officers under the rank of lieutenant general.

That proclamation has been renewed every year since 2001, including by Obama last month.

As of Sept. 30, about 25,700 Guard and Reserve forces remain involuntarily called up to federal service on the authority of Bush's proclamation, the Pentagon says. Canceling the state of emergency would allow them to go home.

Eight generals and admirals have been appointed to their positions despite laws limiting the number of general officers in each service. That's because the state of emergency allows the president to bypass the law and appoint an unlimited number of one- and two-star generals.

The Pentagon is reviewing its staffing needs should the president fail to renew the emergency, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman.

Bush's Proclamation 7463 provides much of the legal underpinning for the war on terror. Bush cited that emergency in his military order allowing the detention of al-Qaeda combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and their trial by military commission.

The post-9/11 emergency declaration is in its 13th year. Eleven emergencies are even older.

OLDEST EMERGENCY

For Mohamad Nazemzadeh, that state of emergency isn't an academic debate. He's on trial because of it and could get up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

Nazemzadeh, an Iranian-born Ph.D. biochemical engineer, was a research fellow at the University of Michigan where he did research on new radiation therapies to cure cancer.

In 2011, he attempted to broker the sale of a $21,400 refurbished MRI coil to an Iranian hospital.

That's illegal under a string of executive orders dating to the Carter administration. Carter, invoking his emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, imposed an embargo on trade with Iran in 1979. That emergency has been renewed every year since.

The executive order has an exception for medicine -- but not medical equipment.

In 2010, Congress tightened sanctions against Iran but included broader exceptions, including for medical equipment such as the MRI coil.

"The congressional exemptions trump the executive order," said Nazemzadeh's lawyer, Shereen Charlick. "I did not prevail on that argument. I still think I'm completely right."

Judge James Lorenz rejected that argument. "It is undisputed that the plain language of IEEPA vests authority to the president to declare an emergency and implement economic sanctions," he said in his ruling in January.

"The president, as well as his predecessors, have declared a number of national emergencies in the context of IEEPA in order to impose economic sanctions, including with respect to the situations in Iran, Syria and in order to address terrorism and proliferation concerns," said National Security Council spokesman Ned Price.

OVERTURNING EMERGENCIES

The National Emergencies Act allows Congress to overturn an emergency by a resolution passed by both houses -- which could then be vetoed by the president. In 38 years, only one resolution has ever been introduced to cancel an emergency.

"The Congress hasn't done much of anything," said Harold Relyea, who studied national emergencies during a 37-year career at the Congressional Research Service. "Congress has not been the watchdog. It's very toothless, and the partisanship hasn't particularly helped."

Ebola overwhelming rural parts of Africa ; Lack of medical facilities, limited access make it nearly impossible to stem the spread

As infectious Ebola patients in this country's remote northern region were being transferred for treatment, the ambulance moving them overturned on a narrow, dirt road, injuring the driver and patients and exposing the area to the deadly virus.

The eight patients were rushed to a nearby government hospital for treatment after the accident Oct. 10, but the staff wasn't prepared to deal with Ebola. After cursory first aid, they were placed back in a vehicle for the drive to a treatment center more than 100 miles away.

While much of the fight against Ebola in West Africa focuses on populous cities, often overlooked are rural areas where inadequate infrastructure and health care fuel the virus' spread. A lack of medical facilities for hundreds of miles in Sierra Leone's remote regions -- like in neighboring Liberia and Guinea -- is a main reason the country is failing to gain control of the crisis.

In addition, poor tracking and limited access mean health officials don't know exactly how many residents are being infected in these rural areas, making it nearly impossible to curtail the spread of Ebola.

"The whole of the northern region has no treatment center -- this is terrible," said Alhassan Bakarr Kamara, program manager at Health for All Coalition, a civil society organization working on health issues in Sierra Leone. "How can we eliminate this disease when patients have to be driven long distances to access medical help?"

Along Sierra Leone's west coast and its eastern border with Guinea, makeshift emergency centers have cropped up as aid workers scramble to keep up with the rate of infection. Ebola has cut a path of devastation through the vast land in between, where there is little hope of help.

Bombali in the north serves as the headquarters of the biggest region in the country, covering five districts -- but it's without an Ebola treatment center. To access care, ambulances must drive more than 100 miles on roads covered in mud and potholes.

"The distance in transferring patients to treatment centers far away is killing our people," Emilia Kamara, head of the Bombali District Human Rights Committee in the north, said in a radio interview. "We are in dire need of an Ebola treatment center."

The facilities that do exist are ill-prepared and underequipped. In the northern city of Makeni, nurses at the government hospital have threatened for weeks to go on strike if conditions don't improve.

"We're getting frustrated because we are not equipped to respond to cases," said Alimatu Sesay, a nurse who has seen more than 10 of her colleagues succumb to the virus.

The shortage of beds is just the first obstacle. The lack of gloves, masks, aprons and disinfectant cripples health workers' ability to protect themselves, their family and other patients.

"We also have families and we're scared," Sesay said.

Expertise -- trained doctors and nurses -- is sorely needed. More than 15 major health centers have been forced to shut down because of a lack of expertise in responding to Ebola cases. That means other diseases are also going untreated.

"Sicknesses like common colds, malaria are untreated. Sick, pregnant women are left to suffer in pain because of a lack of medical personnel and drugs to respond to their plight," Alhassan Bakarr Kamara said.

Sierra Leone issued a nationwide lockdown in September in the hopes of stemming the spread of the virus, becoming the only country to take such a step. That tactic appears to have failed: Two weeks ago, Sierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola deaths on one day -- 140. More than 3,400 people have been infected and 1,200 people have died in the country as of Oct. 17, the World Health Organization reported.

Mohamed Koroma, vice president of the Makeni Union of Youth Groups, said the lack of facilities is too much for families to bear. "When our relatives are taken to the center in other areas there is no one to comfort and support them -- a few days later they will tell us of their death."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that it will monitor the health of anyone entering the USA from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa.

Passengers will be monitored for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. The program goes beyond the airport screening that passengers arriving from Ebola-affected countries have been getting at five airports since Oct. 11. It will begin Monday in the six states where 70% of travelers from Ebola-affected countries arrive - - New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey -- then expand nationwide, said Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.

Countries in West Africa screen air travelers before they leave.

"We're checking at exit. We're checking at entry. We're checking each of the 21 days," Frieden said. "We will continue to do whatever we can to protect Americans."

A suddenly famous dog is being monitored, too.

Bentley, the pet of Dallas nurse Nina Pham, tested negative for the virus. He will be monitored until Nov. 1. When Pham, who was upgraded from fair to good condition Tuesday, fell ill with Ebola, her Cavalier King Charles spaniel was quarantined.

Glib assertions mar debate over Ebola travel ban

With Ebola ravaging West Africa, an infected Liberian traveler dead in Dallas and confidence in government assurances shaken, it's no wonder people are grasping at anything that looks like it might provide a measure of safety. And what they're grasping at now are proposals to ban travel to the USA from the three West African countries hardest hit by Ebola.

At first glance, a travel ban looks like a quick, easy answer. With elections looming, politicians of both parties have rushed to embrace the idea, even as many public health specialists insist it would hurt more than help.

The problem is, much of the debate has been fought on glib generalities from both sides.

Supporters of a travel ban started with a simple slogan: Stop the flights. That was before they discovered that no airlines fly directly to the U.S. from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. So a travel ban would require halting connecting flights from Europe or any place where West Africans could reach the USA. That's a non- starter. More realistically, a travel ban would take the form of visa restrictions designed to prevent people from the stricken countries from entering the USA.

Opponents of a travel ban, meanwhile, undercut their case by contending that such bans never work and that visa restrictions would be easy to evade. The first assertion is largely untested; the second is largely untrue.

Few U.S. precedents for travel restrictions exist over the past century. The most recent -- a 1987 ban on HIV-positive travelers -- is a poor comparison because AIDS was already widespread in the USA by then.

Visa restrictions, meanwhile, would indeed be hard to evade. Visas, already required for anyone traveling from the three affected countries, are checked at all U.S. entry points. A traveler would need fake documents that could pass inspection -- or to fly to Mexico or Canada, then somehow sneak over the border, all while suffering from Ebola. None of that sounds very plausible.

Once the misinformation is stripped away, the remaining questions are: How big is the problem? Would some sort of ban actually make the U.S. safer? And, if so, at what cost?

At least for now, the scale of the travel threat appears manageable. According to a study by infectious disease specialists published this week, an average of about three infected travelers from the stricken countries will embark on overseas travel per month. Of those, fewer than one would come to the USA.

And that study did not even take into account the exit screening underway in West Africa and stepped-up entry screening in the United States. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Obama administration added useful new layers of protection, ordering all travelers coming from the three West African nations to arrive at the five U.S. airports that have enhanced screening and then requiring that they be monitored for 21 days and report daily to local public health officials, who'll have their names and contacts.

The reality is, in an era of globalization, the United States can't wall itself off from the world. The best protection against Ebola is defeating it at the source in Africa. Anything that might impede the flow of aid workers and doctors, as a travel ban could, hurts that effort.

At this point, enhanced screening and monitoring at both ends is preferable. Such screening could include blood tests that, while not foolproof, would at least identify would-be travelers who have active Ebola infections.

A travel ban might make a marginal difference, but it creates more of an illusion of safety than the real thing.

En garde! In the battle of the dueling swords, er, pens, Cary Elwes has outscored Neil Patrick Harris by a few notches in this week's match-up of celeb memoirs. Elwes' As You Wish lands at No. 20 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list. Meanwhile, next year's Oscar host makes his debut at No. 48 with Neil Patrick Harris: Choose Your Own Autobiography. Elwes, who starred as Westley in The Princess Bride, recounts the making of the 1987 family classic. Harris lets readers live his life in his "adventure" book. Both actors have made media rounds and done book signings around the country.

First look: Neil Gaiman is here to warn you, literally. His new short story collection (due Feb. 3 from William Morrow) is Trigger Warning, a phrase often used online to warn readers about content that might upset them. Warning features previously published work, along with a new American Gods story, "Black Dog." USA TODAY has an exclusive excerpt from the introduction, as well as a first look at the cover. Read the excerpt at books.usatoday.com.

'Hot' stuff: With Ebola panic gripping the world, Richard Preston's 1994 non-fiction thriller The Hot Zone is again a best seller. The book, subtitled The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus, peaked at No. 3 on USA TODAY's list in July 1995. It returned to the top 150 this year at No. 112 on Aug. 14, and now leaps to No. 29. (Publisher Anchor says it has sold 150,000 copies since late July.) One difference from 20 years ago: the digital version is outselling the paperback by more than 2-1. Preston is writing a new foreword and updating the book, but no date is set for the new edition.

Is U.S. 'stuck on stupid' with Ebola?

Let the finger-pointing begin! With the increasing fallout after the second domestically transmitted case of Ebola in Dallas, all parties involved -- local, state and national -- have been staking out their territory, assuming defensive positions to explain their performance (or lack thereof) in the midst of growing concern.

A hemorrhagic fever with a track record of leaving fear and death in its wake has been loosed on the American homeland. That's scary. What's even scarier is how this outbreak is pulling back the curtain on a seemingly endemic institutional inability to respond quickly and competently to a serious public threat.

Whose fault is it? Depends upon whom you ask: It is the computer software at the Dallas hospital. It is two nurses ignorant of appropriate protocols. It is the Republicans because they cut funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is President Obama because he hasn't hermetically sealed our borders. It is the news media for hyping the crisis.

The list of potential fall guys is limited only by the failure of one's imagination.

It was a failure of imagination that the 9/11 Commission suggested was responsible for the American national security complex's inability to connect the dots between warning signs before the 2001 terror attacks. Are the institutions today tasked with safeguarding American security any better prepared than they were 13 years ago? It seems not.

Watching the U.S. Ebola story develop might well cause Hurricane Katrina flashbacks. Consider the multitude of institutional failures laid bare by the much-delayed official reaction to a flooded New Orleans after that 2005 storm. I know. I was living in Baton Rouge during Katrina, and I'm struck by the many parallels.

Recall the political posturing, the news conferences from operations centers, the impassioned news coverage, the official reassurances that the situation was under control. Recall emergency and medical officials lacking appropriate communications or rescue equipment. Recall the mayors, governors and members of Congress with their declarations of outrage about how the situation was being mishandled.

Flash forward to the response to Ebola's arrival in the USA. It is similarly shameful, seemingly more concerned with passing the buck than addressing what is, apparently, a growing public health threat. On Friday, Obama appointed Ron Klain as the administration's Ebola "czar." Described by The Washington Post as a "longtime Democratic operative" who has served as chief of staff to both Vice President Biden and former vice president Al Gore, Klain undoubtedly knows his way around the nation's capital. But is he equipped to tackle a growing public health crisis unfolding in places well beyond The Beltway?

After Katrina, it took a Louisiana native, Army Lt. Gen. Russel "Ragin' Cajun" Honore, to slap some sense into dithering officials and the overwrought journalists. Former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin described him as "one John Wayne dude" who got stuff done. Once on the job, Honore quickly talked sense into the news media, responding to a reporter's question on the matter of blame with "you are stuck on stupid." He was focused on the task at hand: getting the situation under control. Apportioning blame could (and did) come later.

Similar singularity of purpose is needed now. The story of the U.S. Ebola outbreak is already a litany of failure.

Klain's appointment is at least an acknowledgment that better coordination is needed. I hope he's up to the task. It's certainly well past time for an appointed John Wayne dude to ride onto the scene, to get things under control, to reassure Americans and to ensure that those whose job it is to secure the public's health aren't stuck on stupid.

With Ebola in the news and flu season ramping up, USA TODAY's article "5 myths about germs on aircraft" prompted a discussion (News, Oct. 14).

Aircraft are, for the most part, quite clean and in a very satisfactory condition when they are boarded. The cleaners do mostly a good job, and I don't worry about hygiene when I fly. However, I do think the toilets have a tendency to get dirty after a while on long-haul flights.

Suhail Shafi

I spent 16 years in the airline industry, and I can tell you that the larger aircraft do not get cleaned like you think they do. There is not enough time.

Stu Templeman

I already clean our area when we fly. People think I am crazy, but my husband has a chronic form of leukemia, and those nasty bugs will kill him. I always travel with alcohol based antibacterial wipes and lots of hand cleaner. I won't trust my husband's health to an airline.

Vicki Ballinger

LETTERS

Specific to the idea that a flight attendant is supposed to help passengers stow carry-on bags, with all due respect, "little old lady" or not, if one cannot place his or her bag in the overhead compartment, then the individual shouldn't bring it on ("5 myths about flight attendants," Life, Friday).

People with carry-on luggage have a responsibility to be able to manage it; otherwise the bag should be checked. If passengers would stick to that simple guideline, the boarding process would be much smoother and faster.

The Department of Homeland Security, whose airport Ebola screening policy has been criticized as too lax by some lawmakers, tightened the rules Tuesday. It did not accede to demands for restrictions such as denying travelers from Ebola outbreak countries entry to the USA.

Starting today, all travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be funneled through one of five U.S. airports with enhanced screening: New York's John F. Kennedy, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, New Jersey's Newark and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta.

Those airports already were supposed to screen 94% of the average 150 people per day arriving from the three countries.

"We are working closely with the airlines to implement these restrictions with minimal travel disruption," said Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security.

Katie Cody, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, which serves Europe from hubs such as Philadelphia and Charlotte, said the airline is not unsettled. "We don't have any concerns because the numbers are so small," Cody said.

Some lawmakers still pressed for stricter restrictions. "In addition to requiring all travelers from at-risk countries to fly through airports with enhanced screening measures in place, I continue to call on the administration to suspend all visas from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea," said Rep. Michael McCaul, R- Texas.

Also Tuesday, TV cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, 33, evacuated from Liberia after becoming infected with Ebola last month, has been declared free of the virus. Mukpo, who was working with NBC News, will be allowed to leave the bio-containment unit at Nebraska Medical Center today, the hospital said.

From a distance, the small group of Haitian immigrants at the public library looks like a prayer meeting or political gathering. Dressed colorfully but comfortably, the women speak in heavily accented English and sit every day for hours around a small wooden table studying to be nurses.

The library sits at the heart of one of the most diverse counties in the USA. More than 50 languages are spoken in the public schools, and this is what more and more communities across America will look like soon -- very soon.

Racial and ethnic diversity is spreading far beyond the coasts and into surprising places across the USA, rapidly changing how Americans live, learn, work and worship together -- and even who our neighbors are.

Cities and towns far removed from traditional urban gateways such as New York, Miami, Chicago and San Francisco are rapidly becoming some of the most diverse places in America, an analysis of demographic data by USA TODAY shows.

Small metro areas such as Lumberton, N.C., and Yakima, Wash., and even remote towns and counties -- such as Finney County, Kan., or Buena Vista County, Iowa -- have seen a stunning surge in immigrants, making those places far more diverse.

The USA is experiencing a "great wave" of immigration -- call it a "second great wave." The first, which stretched from the 1880s to the 1920s, coincided with the opening of Ellis Island and the social and political transformation of the nation.

The people in this second wave, arriving roughly since 1970, are more likely to be middle-class and, because of improved transportation and technology, can assimilate more quickly.

The result: For the first time, the next person you meet in this country -- at work, in the library, at a coffee shop or a movie ticket line -- will probably be of a different race or ethnic group than you.

USA TODAY used Census data to calculate the chance that two random people are different by race or ethnicity and came up with a Diversity Index to place every county on a scale of 0 to 100. The nationwide USA TODAY Diversity Index hit 55 in 2010, up sharply from 20 in 1960 and 40 as recently as 1990. In South Orange, the index is 59.

This is just the beginning. Barring catastrophe or a door-slam on immigration, the Diversity Index is on track to top 70 by 2060, according to a USA TODAY analysis of population projections by ProximityOne of Alexandria, Va. That means there will be less than a 1-in-3 chance that the next person you meet will share your race or ethnicity: white, black, American Indian, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Hispanic.

As people from varying cultures and races come together or collide, local governments and other institutions deal with a host of new issues, from conflicts over spending and diverse hiring to violence in the streets and language barriers. This month, health workers in Dallas going door-to-door at the 300-unit apartment complex that housed the first U.S. patient with Ebola had to translate leaflets about the disease into eight languages. Among the tenants, the complex's owner said, were many resettled refugees.

Students witness the changing face of the country firsthand: Public schools began the 2014-15 school year with an unprecedented profile: For the first time, non-Hispanic white students are in the minority, according to Education Department projections.

Almost half of Americans, 49%, polled by USA TODAY say the country will be "better off" as communities diversify, racing toward where no racial or ethnic group has a majority; 25% say the country would be "worse off."

The fastest change is happening in regions such as the upper Midwest, where there was almost no diversity 30 years ago. Minnesota's Diversity Index rose from 7 in 1980 to 31 in 2010. Diversity has sprouted in many places because of local factors.

In Finney County, Kan., the Diversity Index rocketed from 46 to 60 from 1990 to 2010. Two big meatpacking plants employing 2,500 drew immigrants. The county is 47% Hispanic. The same pattern has made Buena Vista County, Iowa, pop. 20,000, the most diverse in the state. Its Diversity Index soared from 6 in 1990 to 49 in 2010.

In Monroe County, Pa., in the Pocono Mountains, the Diversity Index jumped from 9 in 1990 to 48 in 2010 as minorities from Queens and Brooklyn, N.Y., came looking for a home they could afford to own.

Just 3% of counties had a Diversity Index that topped 50 in 1990, but today, 14% do. At the top end, hyper-diverse counties whose index tops 67 have nearly doubled since 2000, from 33 to 60. They, too, are spreading. They're located in 17 states, up from 10 states in 2000.

An inner-ring suburb of Newark, South Orange has struggled for decades to maintain its racial, ethnic and economic diversity, even as rising housing prices have squeezed moderate- and low-income families out of neighboring suburbs. Here, the index was just 8 in 1970. It soared to 59 in 2010.

Like Newark, it's part of Essex County, where the index has hit 72, up from 69 in 2000. Librarians increasingly find themselves not just checking out books but providing space for groups of immigrants -- and for a growing corps of volunteers who tutor English and run conversation groups.

Nearly a third of the library's patrons speak a language other than English at home, and among the most requested products is an online language tutoring program, library Director Melissa Kopecky says.

"I've always said that the public library is the living room of the community," says Keisha Miller, who runs the library's teen programs. "This is where you come -- you have conversations, you meet people, you see your neighbors, you make new friends, you see old friends." Miller, 32, attended school here as well. She's the daughter of immigrants from Trinidad and Jamaica.

"Everybody's coming in here, whether English is their first language or not."

New neighbors

Bringing a little 'downtown' into every community

For decades, much of South Orange's diversity has been driven by effective "fair housing" laws that opened up affordable housing beyond Newark city limits. Activists have also pushed to keep these suburban neighborhoods diverse, working with Realtors to persuade them to show prospective buyers a broader swath of properties. In many cases, activists have taken newcomers on a kind of "outsiders' real estate tour" of their own.

"We wanted to see if we could actually encourage people to live in all parts of the community," says Nancy Gagnier, executive director of the South Orange-Maplewood Community Coalition on Race.

After a commuter rail line directly connected the area with Manhattan in 1996, diverse families increasingly began settling here from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Jersey City and Hoboken, Gagnier says. "They're looking for that step out into the suburbs that doesn't fully remove them from an urban feel and has a level of diversity."

The change had many locals worried about white flight to more far- flung suburbs. The coalition hired the same consultant who helped Shaker Heights, Ohio, stay integrated. They offered home improvement loans in at-risk neighborhoods and aggressively marketed South Orange and nearby Maplewood as appealing places to live.

"I guarantee you, you ask any person walking down the street, 'Why did you move here?' or 'What's the community's best asset?' and they'll use the term 'diversity,'" Gagnier says.

In addition to housing policy, much of the shift to suburbs by immigrant groups can be traced to a subtle change in attitude, says David Dante Troutt, founding director of the Rutgers Center on Law in Metropolitan Equity.

As cities gentrified and urban housing grew more expensive, immigrants whose forerunners had long settled in cities began to rethink that idea, deciding "the city is no longer the place to be," Troutt says. Add troubled urban schools to the mix, he says, and the result is an explosion of ethnic enclaves, comprised of new immigrants, outside central cities.

Troutt says much of the diversity of places such as South Orange will depend on how strongly local attitudes support diverse kinds of housing. "Let's not kid ourselves. Even discussion of building workforce housing in some of these progressive towns will meet with a vitriol and an opposition that you can expect from the most affluent, conservative places."

In nearby Montclair, N.J., he says, residents fought to block four lower-cost units from being built in one neighborhood. In Marin County, Calif., in 2011, filmmaker George Lucas decided to sell some land to a developer of affordable housing, but neighbors fought the move, saying they feared it would bring in "lowlifes," "drug dealers" and "criminals."

At the time, a household income up to $88,000 qualified buyers for affordable housing, Troutt says. "The public commenters who came in and railed against these prospective tenants in these vitriolic terms were talking about people who were making as much as assistant district attorneys, who were in fact prosecuting criminals and lowlifes and drug dealers," he says.

Not every corner of the country is changing rapidly, or even in the same direction. Nearly 200 counties, saw their Diversity Index fall in the past decade.

For a glimpse of what the USA looked like in 1970 and still looks like in some places, drive around Idaho, South Dakota or Wisconsin. If you want to see what the USA might look like in 2040, when the Diversity Index is projected to reach 65, look at Denver, Albuquerque or Phoenix, which already have reached that level.

'Second great wave' of immigration

Securing our ideals AND labor force

The second wave of immigration is putting its own stamp on the makeup of communities across the country.

Access to transportation and a wider geographical swath of jobs means immigrants are not just showing up in big coastal cities and staying for generations. They're moving to "new destinations," as demographer Jacob Vigdor calls these places -- not just suburbs but rural parts of the South, Midwest and West.

The black American experience, forged early on by slavery that brought millions from Africa, also is diversifying. Almost 10% of blacks are new immigrants from Caribbean or African countries, especially Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. Some must learn English as a second language and face other immigrant challenges.

While this second wave brings tensions and battles over school districts, religion, public spaces, law enforcement and affordable housing, it also brings new energy: The immigrants have higher birth rates, ensuring a steady supply of workers for future generations. They bring new role models, new foods and traditions, a tremendous entrepreneurial energy and, perhaps most significantly, intact, religiously devout families that place a heavy emphasis on education.

In other words, true Americans.

"We should be really happy that we have this large minority growth in the United States," says Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, author of the upcoming book Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics Are Remaking America.

Frey says "new minorities" -- Hispanics, Asians and multiracial Americans -- are arriving as the white population is growing quite slowly and actually declining for the younger part of the population.

With the new growth in diversity, Frey says, should come a new attitude about ethnic and racial minorities. "This is everybody's business to make sure we have a productive multi-ethnic population in the United States," he says. "And we should be so thankful that they're here, because if we didn't have the immigration and the fertility of these groups in the last 20 years, we would be in the same situation as Japan or a lot of European countries, which are facing a declining labor force and an aging population."

Frey puts it rather bluntly, noting that in about 10 years, the USA's white population will not only be crowded out -- it'll start to shrink. "A lot of people don't realize this," he says. "It's the full-scale demographic scope of all this that's really important for us to get our arms around because it's really important for our future as a country."

How Obama can tidy up a messy world ; President must shift approach from a culture of crisis to problem solving

Henry Kissinger once quipped, "There cannot be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full."

No doubt that statement resonates today with President Obama, who faces a slew of difficult challenges at home and abroad. The breadth and depth of these challenges, from the transmission of the Ebola virus on U.S. soil to the rise of the Islamic State terror group, have caused concern about an unraveling world order. At a recent fundraiser, Obama reflected on public opinion, saying "there's a sense possibly that the world is spinning so fast and nobody is able to control it."

In an attempt to put things into perspective, the president told supporters earlier that "the world has always been messy." While the term "messy" was infelicitous, it wasn't wrong. One can go back in time and find moments of great tumult. Take 1979, for example.

35 years ago

Presidential leadership was weak. The U.S. was only several years out of the Vietnam War in which 58,000 Americans died along with millions of other military and civilian casualties. Vietnam invaded neighboring Cambodia, but only after the Khmer Rouge had effectively killed off a quarter of its population. China and Vietnam squared off in a nasty war. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. A revolution took place in Iran, and Americans were taken hostage. The Cold War was in full swing, and the seeds of the Contra wars were planted in Central America. At home, Americans faced another energy crisis with skyrocketing gasoline prices and severe shortages. Three Mile Island suffered a partial nuclear meltdown.

In all, 1979 proved to be a messy year that tested the patience of the American public. They sought more from the Carter administration and the U.S. government. In the face of a 28% approval rating, President Carter went on national television in July to deliver his "Crisis of Confidence" speech, exhorting Americans to break out of their malaise.

Obama's effort to flat-line worry among Americans over today's challenges has a tinge of the same message. What would be more helpful from the president would be a change in approach from a culture of crisis response to one of problem solving.

Although almost every challenge the U.S. faces today could be cast as a crisis, mostly they are problems that need to be dealt with and overcome, mitigated or managed.

While this can be viewed as a matter of semantics, it is not. It is a matter of how the vast resources of the U.S. government are led and managed.

Reagan a good model

The president must show greater leadership. He should take a page out of President Reagan's playbook and delegate. He should empower the entire bureaucracy. Cabinet officers should be intimately involved in the policymaking process and held to account for the execution of that policy.

They also should be judged on the leadership of their department or agency, not only for their individual contributions.

Cabinet officers, in turn, should seek to empower political appointees and career bureaucrats, and hold them to account. It is not enough for the president to rely so fully on a small, trusted cadre of officials in the White House. Experience and skill resident in the bureaucracy must be put to work for the benefit of the nation. It always has been an irony that a president who believes in big government employs it so little.

Further, the president should develop a worldview from which to address the problems we face. The U.S. cannot continue to take each challenge as a one-off crisis. All must be placed in context.

Not every event is an existential threat. In our view, core issues facing the United States today involve China and Iran. These should be prominent in our approach worldwide.

Finally, there is Congress. The president has half-heartedly attempted, and largely failed, to work with Congress. He should take the occasion of the midterm elections to encourage an era of cooperation and compromise. Members of Congress should respond accordingly because they are part of the problem this nation faces.

Together, we should become a nation of problem solvers, not crisis responders.

Richard Armitage was deputy secretary of State from 2001 to 2005. Kara Bue was deputy assistant secretary of State for political military affairs 2003-05.

Obama critics off-base over Ebola travel ban

Sen. Ted Cruz, the Tea Party Republican who has little experience running anything bigger than his mouth, showed up Sunday on national television to hawk his call for President Obama to ban people in Ebola-plagued African countries from traveling to the United States.

"For over two weeks, I've been calling on the (Obama) administration to take the common-sense stand of suspending commercial air travel" out of the three West African countries that are hard hit by the Ebola virus, the Texas senator said on CNN.

When asked why the president should ignore the advice against the travel ban he received from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical experts, Cruz's responded by, in essence, calling them political hacks.

"The doctors and the experts that are saying this are working for the administration and repeating the administration talking points," said Cruz, who probably gets his medical advice from Keith Ablow, the psychiatrist and Fox News contributor.

During a recent appearance on John Gibson's Fox News radio show, Ablow implied that Obama hasn't imposed a travel ban on flights from the Ebola-afflicted countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone because of his race.

"His affinity, his affiliations are with them. Not us," Ablow said.

When it comes to Republicans' attempt to reap political gain from the Ebola crisis, Cruz is the ying and Ablow is the yang. These guys are political wing nuts.

The president's opposition to a travel ban, for now, makes good sense. Like all decisions of great consequence, Obama has to weigh the pluses and minuses of a travel ban. And he must keep open the possibility that he might have to alter his position, if events dictate.

But with just one known carrier of the Ebola virus having entered this country, it makes more sense now to continue with the health checks on people when they board planes leaving Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and when they arrive at U.S. airports.

Because there are no direct flights between those African countries and the USA, a travel ban might panic travelers into denying that they've visited the Ebola hot spots before boarding a flight in a third country to fly here.

Cruz contended that, under a travel ban, people who've been to those African countries won't be issued a visa to enter the U.S. But such a ban likely will increase the chance that many people will avoid airport screening in the affected areas by using other means of departure to exit those countries. Once out, they will be harder to detect or to track.

"We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa," Obama said in his weekly radio address. Not while the efforts at containment seem to be working far better than a travel ban might.

That's a sensible approach to managing this crisis that Cruz and Ablow don't understand.

Investors head into the new trading week a lot less fearful and a lot less poorer -- but still a bit on edge -- after the stock market recouped most of its big losses with a strong rebound rally Friday that capped off another turbulent week on Wall Street.

And while it's impossible to play down the potential headline risk that is still out there, markets this week will instead be focusing on a fresh batch of incoming profit reports from U.S. companies and a rash of new economic data.

Analysts estimate that existing home sales rose modestly in September after slipping the previous month and that new home sales moderated after surging to a 61/2-year high in August.

Meanwhile, inflation is projected to show just a slight rise last month after declining in August as gasoline prices continued to drift downward.

"The U.S. economy remains strong despite weak global growth," Barclays Capital wrote in a research note. Chief U.S. economist Dean Maki added that falling gasoline prices should boost consumer spending and economic growth this year.

High-profile companies reporting earnings this week include iPad maker Apple and computer giant IBM on Monday; fast-food giant McDonald's and soft-drink seller Coca-Cola on Tuesday; automaker General Motors on Wednesday; heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and online retailer Amazon on Thursday; and Ford Motor and consumer staples behemoth Procter & Gamble on Friday.

The stock market, which for most of last week was trading on fear and emotion in the face of wild stock price gyrations set in motion by a global growth scare and panicky reactions to the Ebola virus scare, showed signs of stabilization Friday. The Dow rallied 263 points to trim its weekly loss to 1%, leaving it down 5.2% from its September record high.

The market's violent swings the past two weeks "felt worse than it is," mainly because traders had grown unaccustomed to them, says Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at Blackrock.

"I still think you can get massive market swings, but I don't think this is the start of something more dire," says Koesterich, adding that he doesn't think the slowdown in Europe is a "precursor to a global recession."

He adds that Ebola is "incredibly hard to handicap" so you have a "lingering black swan out there."

On the upside, a Wall Street "fear gauge" index is also heading back down after it doubled since the end of September to its highest level in three years. And crude oil, which had plunged more than 20% in price before bottoming out around $80 a barrel earlier last week, has suddenly found buyer interest.

David Bechtel, money manager at Barrow Funds, says there is potential for more roller-coaster days on Wall Street but says the volatility "creates opportunities for level-headed people to put money to work."

He's been buying some of his favorite names, including defensive- type stocks such as tobacco giant Altria and chicken producer Pilgrims Pride, viewing them as "bargains" after they got walloped like the rest of the market in the recent downdraft.

Asked if a bear market is looming, Bechtel responded: "I think that might be stretching things."

For a city weary of Ebola, a very welcome 'D-Day'

This Ebola-rattled metropolis observed a milestone in its battle with the disease Sunday, which marked the end of a 21-day observation period for some people who were in contact with Thomas Eric Duncan before his case became the first diagnosed in the United States.

"We can breathe a sigh of relief," said Mark Wingfield, associate pastor at the church attended by Duncan's girlfriend, Louise Troh. Unlike most of those exposed to Duncan, Troh, 54, was under a mandatory isolation order.

"We give thanks for the passing of the quarantine period," Wingfield told the congregation at Wilshire Baptist Church's worship service. But earlier, he said, "We won't celebrate, out of respect for the two patients."

He referred to two nurses who became infected with Ebola while treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. They're being treated at special hospital units in Atlanta and outside Washington.

It can take up to 21 days for Ebola symptoms -- fever, sore throat and muscle pain, followed by severe vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding -- to develop. The period that expired Sunday applied to about 50 people, including those Duncan lived with at an apartment complex on the northeast side of the city.

Scores of hospital workers and others in the area will still be monitored, either because they were exposed to Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital Sept. 28 -- three days after he was first treated and released -- or because they were exposed to the two infected nurses. Duncan died Oct. 8.

The hospital workers have been told to stay around home and away from public places, or stay at Texas Health Presbyterian until their 21 days are up. They're monitored regularly for symptoms.

"This Sunday is a milestone," said Dr. Joseph McCormick, a University of Texas School of Public Health virologist who first studied Ebola in 1976 with the federal Centers for Disease Control and prevention. He said the expiration of the period "really supports the fact that this disease is not easily transmitted," especially since four of the quarantined -- Troh, her son, Duncan's nephew and another youth -- lived with him in the same apartment.

Clay Jenkins, Dallas County's top elected official, called it "a critical weekend." John Wiley Price, a county commissioner who has criticized Duncan's initial release from Presbyterian, called Sunday "D-Day."

Relief was tempered with worry about possible new cases.

"We've taken so many turns with this," said Jennifer Staubach Gates, a City Council member whose district includes the complex where Duncan was staying.

Many remain vigilant. The Roman Catholic diocese of Fort Worth urged worshipers not to hold hands during the Lord's Prayer. Priests were told to place the communion bread in worshipers' hands rather than on their tongues, and there was no sharing of communion wine.

U.S. ramps up fight on Ebola ; Military unveils 2-pronged plan to fight virus

WASHINGTON Pentagon officials outlined a two-pronged approach to the Ebola crisis Sunday, offering details about treatment centers to be built in Africa and announcing a rapid-response military medical team for any new cases diagnosed in the U.S.

The first of 17 U.S.-built Ebola centers in West Africa will open in a few weeks, the top commander of U.S. troops in the region told USA TODAY on Sunday.

Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams said new mobile laboratories have cut the time it takes to process blood samples of suspected Ebola victims to two or three hours from three days. "They are making a huge dierence," Williams said.

The commander of U.S. troops battling Ebola in West Africa said his forces have made significant progress in Liberia, the country hardest hit by the deadly virus. Williams leads the efforts of 571 U.S.

troops in Liberia and Senegal. He spoke from his headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia.

U.S. troops are helping the Agency for International Development build the mobile hospitals and other facilities to fight Ebola, which has affected almost 9,000 people in West Africa and killed almost 4,500.

Also on Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the Pentagon will create a 30-person, rapid-response Ebola support team to aid civilian health care workers should additional cases be diagnosed in the United States.

The effort was requested by the Department of Health and Human Services, a Pentagon statement said.

In Liberia, Williams said, a mobile hospital for health care workers built by Air Force personnel will open in a few weeks. Soon after, the first of up to 17 Ebola treatment units will receive patients, he said. The units, essentially a series of tents, will have as many as 100 beds, Williams said.

Medical personnel are also preparing to train as many as 500 people per month.

The military has established procedures for U.S. troops who could be infected, although Williams stressed that there are no plans for them to have contact with patients.

Williams acknowledged that there is anxiety among some troops. To address that, he holds town-hall meetings and relies on his commanders. "There is anxiety here, but the morale is very, very high because I have great leaders," Williams said.

In a few weeks, he'll turn over the U.S. military mission to the 101st Airborne Division.

Best retirement investing advice in volatile market

The recent volatility of the stock market has many investors worried about their retirement savings and wondering what to do.

USA TODAY's Nanci Hellmich asked three experts about this issue: Marc Doss, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank; Catherine Golladay, vice president of 401(k) participant services at Charles Schwab; and Steve Utkus, head of Vanguard's Center for Retirement Research.

Q: What are you telling people who are worried they're losing money in their 401(k)s and other retirement savings?

Doss: Take a deep breath because there are some challenging issues ahead, such as Ebola and the slowing global growth. But most people's time horizons on investments are quite long. You can't make decisions based on short-term market movements, or it will derail your long-term plan.

Golladay: You should develop a strategy based on your personal situation and risk tolerance, then stick with it. Focusing on your long-term goals can help you keep a clear head during volatile markets. Use this time to make sure you are taking advantage of important plan features like professional investment advice. A recent Schwab survey found that 70% of participants said they'd feel more confident in their ability to make the right investment decisions if they enlisted the help of a financial professional.

Utkus: Actually, most people in retirement and regular investment accounts see none of the intra-day volatility in the market. So most people aren't really worried they are losing money. In the case of 401(k) plans, regular contributions have more than offset a flat market for the year, so, in fact, 401(k) participants are sitting on more wealth. When they log on and look at their balance, they wonder what all of the noise in the headlines is about. Our general message remains the same: Ignore the short-term fluctuations in the headlines, and base investment decisions on your long-term objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance and your overall financial situation.

Q: Are your clients interested in buying or selling?

Doss: Clients left to their own devices are considering selling, but our job is to keep them focused on their longer-term goals, and we are telling them that this is not a selling opportunity but rather a buying opportunity. We recommend buying over a period of a few days rather than buying all at once.

Utkus: On any given day, including volatile and ordinary days, there are small fractions of clients both buying and selling stocks. If it is a down market day, more often than not, reflecting the overall trend in the market, there are fractionally higher numbers of clients selling than those buying. And the opposite is true on "up" market days. By and large, most people make no changes to their investments in response to short-term market moves. And those moving change a small percent of their portfolio, for example, less than 10%.

Q: How should people invest their money if they can't stomach the market volatility?

Doss: There are other options such as bonds, CDs or bank accounts, but that safety means you'll be hard-pressed to grow your money in this environment because rates are so low.

Golladay: First of all, it's important to set up a diversified portfolio that is aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. You want to keep your money working for you. Don't be tempted to reduce or cease 401(k) contributions just because the market is going down. Missing out on the effects of compounding could greatly hurt your retirement savings over the long term. Make sure you are contributing at least enough to take full advantage of your employer's match. The match is an automatic return on your investment that you can't get anywhere else.

Q: What if you're retired? How much should you have in the stock market? How much in cash?

Doss: How much retirees have in the stock market depends on their individual circumstances, but most people should have some exposure to stocks because they still need to maintain their purchasing power over the next 20 to 30 years. They should have enough cash so they can sleep at night and still keep their long-term investment plan in place. Other investments might include some conservative fixed- income investments such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, CDs or bank deposits.

Utkus: Our general recommendation is that retirees should begin with a portfolio divided evenly between equity or stock investments (generally broadly diversified stock funds or ETFs, both domestically and internationally) and bond investments (including broadly diversified U.S. and foreign bonds). Over time, as they enter their 70s, retirees will want to reduce risk exposure to around 35%. Adding inflation-adjusted bonds to your portfolio as you get older also makes sense. These are general guidelines, and individuals will want to tailor them to their specific needs.

Q: How much of their retirement savings should people have in the market if they're in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s?

Golladay: Generally speaking, the younger you are, the more risk you can take on. But be careful. Every investment plan, including a 401(k), requires periodic maintenance regardless of your age. Make sure your portfolio is properly diversified. That's always your first line of defense. Now is also a good time to make sure you are allocated properly.

Utkus: Our general rule is that younger investors should have 90% of their retirement assets in equities. Gradually as investors enter their 40s they should begin to taper down allocations to where they are 50/50 in stocks/bonds at retirement. Again, these are general guidelines and should be evaluated in light of individual needs and circumstances.

Prices plunge at the pump, opening an opportunity

If you're looking for good news amidst the torrent of trouble from Ebola, ISIL and a shaky stock market, there's this: Oil prices are tumbling, and you can see the impact at the gas pump. From more than $100 a barrel in July, they're now in the low $80s. The price of a gallon of regular gas has dropped more than 20 cents in the past five weeks alone.

The plunge -- brought on by increased oil production, particularly in the United States, and softening demand -- brings many advantages.

Money consumers don't spend at the pump gets spent or invested elsewhere, creating a kind of economic stimulus. Meanwhile, the economies of troublesome petro states such as Russia and Iran are undermined.

There are minuses, as well. Lower prices have a way of begetting higher ones as people buy vehicles that are less fuel efficient. They also make it harder to deal with climate change. And, as people drive more, lower prices put more stress on a highway system already in grave need of repairs and upgrades.

To deal with some of these issues, there is an obvious if unpopular answer: Raise the federal gasoline tax. And do it soon while the price of oil is so low that people would barely notice.

If the tax were hiked from its current rate of 18.4 cents a gallon to 30.3 cents, gas would still be cheaper than it was on Labor Day. The higher rate would only restore the tax to where it was in 1993 (the last time it was raised) on an inflation-adjusted basis.

It would be the most painless way to begin addressing a problem that cannot be avoided much longer. As the increasing fuel- efficiency of cars has shrunk revenue from the gas tax, the government has been unable to maintain the nation's roads and bridges, let alone expand them to keep up with population growth.

To fill the breach, Congress has relied upon borrowing and troubling budgetary gimmicks. The last temporary fix to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent involved encouraging corporations to set less aside for employee pensions so they'd pay more in corporate taxes. It's hard to imagine a less responsible approach to public policy.

By taking action in a lame-duck session of Congress after the Nov. 4 elections, lawmakers would shield themselves from the political cost. No member of either chamber would be up for election for at least two more years, and many are retiring.

Such an increase would only be a modest, partial fix to a series of problems. It would not provide anywhere near enough to build the roads and rails necessary to foster economic growth. But it would tend to a few of the basics, and it would do so at a time when virtually no one would feel any pain -- unless, of course, they're in Moscow or Tehran.

Ebola is a deadly virus with a high mortality rate. Health care professionals need to take proper precautions before, during and after treating an Ebola patient. Patients need to be treated in a safe manner, and the virus needs to be contained. Nothing else will do. Health care professionals have standards. They should be prepared and know how to handle any infectious disease without having to call someone.

Dallas is not a Third World city that lacks the means to treat and successfully contain Ebola. Medical professionals at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas have shown that they are incompetent. We should not tolerate the hospital's failure. National, Texas and city authorities should hold the hospital leadership fully accountable. Authorities need to investigate what's going on inside America's hospitals. There will not be a second chance for anyone if Ebola gets out of control due to incompetent health care professionals.

Ray Taft

Bacliff, Texas

As a lifelong Democrat, I think the selection of Ron Klain as Ebola czar is an odd choice for two reasons: First, he has no medical experience; second, he is a partisan Washington insider. I don't doubt Klain is smart enough for the position; however, his background is simply red meat for the GOP.

Over the course of the last two weeks, we have seen how slowly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health care agencies reacted to the brewing Ebola crisis. More than likely, it is going to get worse before it gets better. That said, plenty of doctors on TV could fill the shoes of Ebola czar more effectively than the president's pick.

Denny Freidenrich

Laguna Beach, Calif.

Things are getting out of hand with the recent failures in the protocol to control Ebola in the USA. The time has come to ban all flights from West Africa to the U.S. This plague must be put down before it becomes a global outbreak. American medical technology cannot be allowed to be overwhelmed by the inept actions of feckless health care administrators and politicians through their continued advocacy for non-restricted travel from Ebola-affected regions.

Right now is not a time to apportion blame but to take drastic actions. If Nigeria can contain it, U.S. can do better!

A new poll of corporate travel managers has found that the Ebola outbreak is not keeping businesses from sending employees on the road, but they are keeping a close eye on the crisis.

Of the 421 North American corporate travel managers who took the online survey this week, 80% said trips abroad had been either affected very little or not at all over the past month, says the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation which conducted the poll. More than 90% said that the Ebola crisis had little or no impact on domestic corporate trips.

But among those who have business dealings in West Africa, where the three countries hit hardest by the Ebola virus are located, 52% of travel managers said that they were restricting trips to the region.

And a majority of the travel managers overall said they are, or will be, instructing employees going on work trips on how to protect themselves.

"While Ebola continues to be (a) fluid, ever-changing situation, our poll showed it's business as usual for the majority of our road warriors," said Mike McCormick, GBTA's executive director. "We understand, however, that safety is paramount, and our members are monitoring the news to ensure they can provide their employees with the most up-to-date information."

Another survey found that travelers were very concerned about the Ebola outbreak. A Reuters/Ipsos poll that questioned 1,577 Americans found that 80% were worried about Ebola, and 45% of those surveyed said that they were avoiding flying abroad.

But some airlines echoed the GBTA Foundation's findings, saying that they had not seen a dip in traveler demand because of the Ebola crisis.

Delta Air Lines officials, as well as representatives from American and United, said Thursday that they had not seen concerns about the virus affect bookings.

Tourism officials in Dallas, where a Liberian man who was visiting died from Ebola and two health care workers who attended to him have been infected, said that they have fielded questions from some groups scheduled to visit the city. "The groups were not overly concerned or canceling their meetings, an indication that people are paying attention to the medical facts," Frank Librio, a spokesman for the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, said in an e-mail.

For smallest victims, a double whammy ; Kids lose parents to Ebola, then are rejected by relatives

Ever since Frank Mulbah's mother died of Ebola in August, no one will go near him.

"I went to my relatives after my mother died, but they chased me away, even after I told them that I didn't have Ebola," said Frank, 12, who tested negative for Ebola at the hospital where his mother died.

As Ebola continues its rampage across Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa, thousands of children are taking a double hit: losing parents to the fatal virus and then being shunned by relatives who fear they will catch the disease.

The United Nations estimates the virus has orphaned nearly 4,000 children across the region, and that number could double in coming weeks. Aid groups, such as Doctors Without Borders, fear the orphans are at risk of starvation and disease.

The children also could pose a risk to others by spreading the disease if they are allowed to roam free without being tested for the virus.

Most children orphaned by Ebola are tested and found to be free of the virus, said Laurence Sailly, a coordinator of an Ebola Treatment Center here run by Doctors Without Borders. But some are not tested.

"These children are supposed to be quarantined for 21 days before they are declared Ebola-free," she said. "But this does not take place because there's not enough facilities to cater to these children."

In Liberia, the hardest hit country, with nearly 1,000 deaths from Ebola as of last week, about half of all mothers in the country are raising their children alone because thousands of men died in a 1999-2003 civil war. So when these mothers catch Ebola and die, their children have nowhere to turn.

Frank, whose father died in the civil war, said he found no one to care for him -- neither in northwest Liberia, where he lived before dropping out of school, nor here in the capital, where he traveled in a desperate search for food and shelter from relatives who refused to take him in.

So he scavenges for food. "A day can pass without eating anything," Frank said. "A few people will listen to you and give you food to eat, but the majority will chase you away."

Some residents said they are sympathetic to the plight of orphans like Frank, but they have to first look out for the safety of their own families.

Faith Teta, 33, a mother of four, watched as two neighbors died a few months ago from Ebola, leaving behind five children. Their youngest child died a short time later, because everyone in the neighborhood was too scared of being infected to care for the 1- year-old, she said.

The remaining four children now wander Monrovia's streets, dependent on the kindness of strangers, which is in short supply, Teta said. More often, the children encounter fear, horror and even death threats.

"As parents, we all want to help them," Teta said, "but people are endangering their own lives when they take in these children, and the lives of our family members."

Teta blamed the government for being slow to respond to the disease and implement preventive measures to stem it. "The public didn't have any information about Ebola," she said. "The government should take responsibility for its failure to stop this and help these kids."

Sailly said the majority of people dying from the Ebola outbreak are ages 25 to 45, and have children 12 or younger.

"These children are now forced to drop out of school and work (to survive)," Sailly said. "It's very painful to see them roaming in streets in search for food as their sole caregivers have already died."

ChildFund, an international charity, started taking care of Ebola orphans this month by keeping them isolated for 21 days.

"The government should support such centers so that they can be able to provide a protective environment for these children," Sailly said.

Frank hopes his relatives will change their minds, but he isn't hopeful. He tries not to think about getting home-cooked meals or an education.

"I don't know when I'll go back to school," he said. "Right now I'm just looking for food and a place to live."

Calm down about Ebola already ; You're more likely to die of a horse kick to the head

You are not going to die of Ebola.

America needs to take a deep breath. Ebola is a terrible disease -- often fatal and gruesome whether you die or not. While it is spreading in Africa at an alarming rate, there have been three cases diagnosed here in the United States.

That's no reason to be afraid. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, there is no significant risk of a real outbreak here. The disease is not that easy to get because it spreads through direct contact with body fluids only after symptoms have appeared, making it relatively easy to contain.

A lot of attention has been paid to the three cases in Dallas, but it's important to remember that is still only three people in a country of more than 316 million.

Even in Africa, where Ebola is a real problem, it's minor compared with malaria, which has killed hundreds of times as many people.

Early resignation talk

It's understandable that Ebola is making you afraid, however. To turn on the cable news, you'd think that the zombie apocalypse is upon us. Fox & Friends argued that we need a special Ebola "czar" just to handle the disease. CNN ran the absurd headline "Ebola: The ISIS of Biological Agents?" CNN also brought fiction writer Robin Cook on to speculate that Ebola is about to run rampant through the country. Stacy Dash of Fox News argued that each state should have a special quarantine hospital for Ebola patients, though such centers would be empty, except for two people.

Bill O'Reilly is demanding the resignation of the CDC director, over an epidemic that is not actually happening.

Just to make the hysteria worse, conspiracy theories are starting to take hold in the news media. In most cases, it's right-wing media trying somehow to suggest that the Ebola plague they fear is about to grip the U.S. is the fault of the president.

Laura Ingraham suggested that President Obama's "core ties to the African continent" prevented him from fighting the disease. Sean Hannity said he doesn't trust the CDC to be honest about the extent of the disease. Rush Limbaugh argued that "some people" refuse to fight the disease because they "think we kind of deserve a little bit of this."

Smelling a story that grabs headlines, Republican politicians are sleazily glomming onto all this panic in order to score political points. While some Republicans such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry have responsibly reminded the public that there's no reason to be afraid, as Politico reports, plenty of GOP politicians are sounding the alarm and even hinting that Obama bears some responsibility.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have all suggested draconian travel restrictions that would either unfairly imprison people for three weeks in an unnecessary quarantine or bar them from traveling to this country altogether. Sen. John McCain of Arizona has joined the call to create an office for an Ebola czar.

All this to handle a disease so rare in the USA that you're more likely to die from being kicked in the head by a horse.

Even some liberals have gotten involved. The Agenda Project Action Fund ran ads insinuating that Republicans are to blame for research cuts, though all evidence suggests that the CDC has the Ebola situation under control.

Things are getting preposterous.

Non-existent threats

In Louisiana, Attorney General Buddy Caldwell got a judge to file a restraining order blocking the disposal in a hazardous waste landfill of the belongings of Thomas Duncan, the sole person to die of the disease here. Duncan's belongings have already been incinerated and pose no threat to anyone, especially considering that Ebola is not transmitted through the ashes.

Fear-mongering about Ebola is an easy way to get ratings or score political points, all without having to talk about, much less, do anything about the real problems that face our country. Never mind that it stresses people out and creates unnecessary problems for health officials who are just trying to do their job.

So please, politicians and pundits, stop trying to rile people up.

Reserves on call in Ebola battle ; Obama also leaves door open to 'czar' to oversee response

President Obama issued an executive order Thursday allowing the Pentagon to call up Reserve troops to combat the Ebola crisis in Africa.

Obama also opened the door to an Ebola "czar" to coordinate the response, saying that an additional official may be helpful as his advisers juggle threats of terrorism and the upcoming flu season.

Though he said he had no "philosophical objection" to barring West Africans from traveling to the U.S. from western Africa, he said he would listen to experts who say "a flat-out travel ban is not the best way to go."

The Pentagon said it had no immediate plans to send reservists or National Guard troops to Africa, saying that the order simply allows the military to begin planning for those forces in its overall response.

It "doesn't mean that we are deploying these forces, but it gives us the option to do so if we need to," said Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Crosson, a Pentagon spokesman.

Meanwhile, the first nurse to test positive for Ebola in the United States was transferred from a Dallas hospital to federal care at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.

NIH Director Anthony Fauci said Nina Pham, 26, will be treated in a special unit "designed to provide high-level isolation" with staff trained to handle infectious diseases and critical care. Officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said the move was made out of concern the crisis had left it overwhelmed. "We felt it was in the best interest of the hospital's employees," hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said.

The Pentagon is identifying gaps that active-duty troops cannot fill, said a Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Among specialists that might be tapped: technical engineering, communication systems, logisticians, comptrollers and religious specialists. At least eight engineers have been identified as possible call-ups. All reservists called to duty will be given training and medical-threat briefings, the official said.

The president notified Congress of his order Thursday after calls with top congressional leaders of both parties and to the governors of Ohio and Texas. Obama canceled a second day of political events Thursday to deal with the crisis from the White House.

Expert: Dallas hospital did things right – and wrong

Doctors and nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas caring for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan did many things right, including donning proper equipment early, isolating the patient and meticulously disposing of soiled sheets and other waste.

But they also took potentially lethal risks, like peeling off gloves and gowns without proper supervision and connecting Duncan to a dialysis machine while he was in the throes of the virus, said Pierre Rollin, an Ebola specialist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who is consulting the hospital in its fight against Ebola.

Rollin, a top CDC specialist with more than 25 years of experience in special pathogens and who recently returned from fighting Ebola in Liberia and Guinea, has been at the Dallas hospital round-the-clock since Sunday reviewing the facility's Ebola response. He has spoken with dozens of nurses, assistants and doctors involved and is coordinating improvements.

Rollin said it's hard to pinpoint what, exactly, made nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contract the deadly virus, despite wearing protective gear. But lack of experience and proper training was evident, he said.

"On the one hand, they did everything they should have done for someone who was very sick," Rollin told USA TODAY. "On the other hand, they were doing things that we, because of our experience with Ebola, would never do."

The hospital's response to Duncan, a Liberian who traveled to Dallas last month and began showing signs of Ebola, has come under intense scrutiny since Pham and Vinson tested positive for the disease this week. Duncan died at the hospital on Oct. 8, becoming the first Ebola casualty in the U.S. An additional 118 people are under close watch by CDC staffers for having had some contact with Duncan or the two nurses.

National Nurses United, a nurse's union, released a scathing report this week of the hospital's response, alleging its nurses were ill-prepared and lacked adequate protection while caring for Duncan, who arrived by ambulance Sept. 28.

In a statement released Thursday, hospital officials gave a detailed response to those allegations, stating how hospital staff wore appropriate protective gear while caring for Duncan, including face shields, N-95 masks and Tyvek suits.

Local and county officials, as well as medical groups such as the Dallas County Medical Society, have defended the hospital, calling its staff "heroic" in the face of a lethal pestilence. "They were trying hard," said Robert Haley of the Medical Society. "But the best-laid plans had a flaw."

Rollin said, early on, the hospital seemed to closely follow CDC guidelines for treating an Ebola patient. Nurses wore protective eyewear, gloves and gowns, and trash was being tripled bag and disinfected, he said. But nurses removed their gloves and other equipment without supervision or guidance from others. Personal protection equipment, known as PPE, should come off in the exact order it was put on to avoid the virus slipping into a worker, he said.

Later, as Duncan's condition deteriorated and his diarrhea and vomiting increased, hospital officials called on federal agencies and other hospitals for advice on what to do next -- and received multiple responses, adding to the chaos, Rollin said. One source recommended respirator masks, another said they needed full-body Tyvek suits.

Rollin said he was also concerned that doctors ordered Duncan placed on a dialysis machine as his liver began to fail -- a risky venture for an Ebola patient because it involves large needles or catheters and exchanges of bodily fluids.

"We never recommend, in Africa, to do that type of thing," Rollin said. "It's very risky and the likelihood of saving someone is very low. When every organ starts to fail, you're not going to save them."

Overall, the hospital staff did the best they could with the guidelines they had against an unknown and terrifying enemy, Rollin said. Recommendations for improvement include assigning a "watcher" with a checklist to help staff put on and take off their personal equipment and more overall training.

Despite the early stumbles, Rollin said America's vast resources and medical infrastructure will prevent an African-like Ebola outbreak from taking hold here.

"There will never be a big Ebola outbreak like that," he said. "The conditions you have in the U.S. will never allow it."

Over the past week, people around the world have been incensed at the prospect of euthanizing dogs belonging to nurses infected with Ebola.

One of these dogs was even the focus of a hashtag campaign on Twitter.

If only the world could muster that sort of compassion on behalf of human beings.

I have yet to see any petitions in support of Abrahim Quota. He's a beautiful 5-year-old boy who survived Ebola but lost both of his parents.

Abrahim's eyes stare blankly into space in a photo taken Monday outside an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, even as an aid worker attends to him.

Ebola has made orphans of nearly 4,000 children in West Africa. The virus has afflicted nearly 9,000 people, killing at least half. I'm starting to wonder if Ebola needs a poster child like Abrahim. There's just something about the human brain that allows us to feel profound sympathy for an individual, even as we turn our backs on the masses.

Pope Francis asked the world to care for "our brothers and sisters struck by the Ebola epidemic" back in April, one month after the outbreak was first detected. By then, the disease -- which had first appeared in Guinea -- had already spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

In June, USA TODAY reported that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest ever reported. Bart Janssens of Doctors Without Borders warned that the disease was already "totally out of control."

Yet the world didn't really awaken to the danger of Ebola until July, when an Ebola patient was healthy enough to board a plane bound for Nigeria. That's when many people realized, for the first time, that Ebola and other infectious diseases are only a plane ride away.

Instead of responding with compassion -- and committing to stopping Ebola at its source -- the world mostly reacted defensively, closing international borders, canceling flights, pulling ships out of port.

It's as if everyone was hoping that, if the world could just hide from Ebola long enough, we could wait out the epidemic ravaging West Africa with no ill consequences for Western countries.

Now, with two Dallas health care workers hospitalized with Ebola, many Americans are again reacting with fear, terrified that they will become infected.

People seem more interested in the latest titillating conspiracy theory than learning the science behind Ebola. That science clearly shows that the risk to the general population -- basically, anyone who isn't caring for a critically ill patient -- is incredibly low.

But the longer that Ebola rages in West Africa, the longer the USA will be at risk.

The first patient with Ebola showed up at a U.S. emergency room after the number of Ebola cases topped 7,000. How many cases will show up here when, as some estimates predict, cases top 1 million?

It is our failure to care about Africa -- unless our own safety is at stake -- that puts us in danger. People think they can ignore Ebola unless it turns up in Dallas. But ignoring Ebola is what allows it to turn up in Dallas.

Americans may think it makes sense to turn away from Ebola. After all, the average person runs away from a burning building, not toward it. But as every firefighter knows, someone has to put out the flames.

That realization is finally changing the way world leaders are responding.

The U.S. is sending 3,000 troops to West Africa, and other nations are providing support. As U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power recently said, "Instead of isolating the affected countries, we call for flooding them, flooding them with resources."

Consider what American compassion can accomplish. In 2003, President George W. Bush launched the landmark President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That program has not just prevented the spread of AIDS; it has built public health systems across Africa, saving more than than 1 million babies.

It took a long time for people to change the way they felt about AIDS and to embrace those suffering from the virus, rather than shun them.

For the sake of kids like Abrahim, I hope it won't take as long for Americans to understand why we need to care about Ebola.

Candidates call for travel ban ; Ebola crisis 'is not a partisan issue'

Ebola has hit the campaign trail.

Republican candidates locked in tight Senate contests across the country are calling for a ban on travel to the USA from West African countries stricken by Ebola.

The call for travel restrictions grew this week after it was revealed a second nurse in Dallas who cared for Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan had contracted the disease.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, is the highest-ranking member of Congress to ask President Obama to consider imposing a travel ban. Though the call for travel restrictions has come largely from Republicans, some Democrats are embracing the idea.

A recurring theme has been criticism of the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak. Iowa's Joni Ernst, who is locked in a battle with Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley for an open U.S. Senate seat, said the Obama administration "should have made Ebola a priority months ago."

At a House hearing on the government's Ebola response Thursday, Braley criticized the Obama administration's handling of the cases in Dallas. "I am greatly concerned that the administration did not act fast enough in responding in Texas," he said.

At the same hearing, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is running against Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, said the new Ebola screening efforts at five major U.S. airports -- where 94% of the people from the affected West African nations enter the USA -- is not enough. "So if 94% are being covered, that means somewhere between two and three thousand people a year are coming into this country without being screened from the infected areas?" Gardner demanded of federal officials testifying at the hearing.

Udall said at a debate with Gardner Wednesday night it is best to take the lead from doctors and health care professionals. "If they believe we ought to close our borders, we ought to restrict flights to and from West Africa," he said, according to The Denver Post.

In North Carolina, House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is challenging Sen. Kay Hagan for her Senate seat, said the Democratic incumbent is "waiting for direction" from the Obama administration. He criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for failing to prevent the spread of Ebola in the USA.

"This is not a partisan issue. We need to stand together and keep the American people safe by immediately implementing a travel ban," Tillis said.

Hagan countered that a travel ban is only one tool and should be looked at as part of a broader array of issues. A travel ban "is not going to help solve this problem," she said. "That's not going to contain the epidemic that we see happening in Africa."

Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., was among the first politicians to raise the issue of Ebola in the campaign. In an ad in August, Pryor criticized Rep. Tom Cotton, his Republican challenger, for voting against funding for various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs.

Cotton said in a statement Thursday that Obama should implement "additional safeguards" to protect the USA, including a travel ban, additional screenings for those who have traveled to or from countries affected by Ebola, and suspensions of non-immigrant visas for people from any country dealing with Ebola.

Growing concerns about the Ebola virus do not appear to be discouraging travelers from flying, Delta Air Lines executives said Thursday.

"We monitor it on a daily basis, and we have not seen any changes in the booking trends," said Glen Hauenstein, the airline's chief revenue officer, during a conference call with investors about Delta's third-quarter earnings results.

Two U.S.-based health care workers have been infected with the potentially deadly Ebola virus, which has devastated parts of West Africa. And airline stocks have struggled in recent weeks amid concerns the virus might deter people from traveling.

But investors seemed heartened Thursday by Delta's third-quarter results. The carrier earned $357 million, or 42 cents per share, during the three-month period. Not counting special charges, the airline earned $1.6 billion before taxes, or $1.20 a share, topping analysts' expectations by 2 cents a share.

Delta shares closed up 2.9% to $33.32 on Thursday.

Delta executives said steps have been taken to make sure employees and passengers are protected.

"This isn't the first communicable disease that we faced as an airline or an industry," said Gil West, Delta's chief operating officer. "We are well versed in managing these types of events."

The airline's corporate safety and security staff members are talking regularly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, he said, and they are following all recommendations.

In addition to screening procedures set up at some U.S. airports and those in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which have been hardest hit by the virus, "We've also got well-established hygienic cleaning procedures and use disinfectants prior to every flight," West said. There is "ongoing dialogue" with flight crews, and planes have been equipped with kits "in case they do encounter anything unusual."

While news about Ebola as well as slowing economies in parts of Europe and Asia escalated during the third quarter, Delta saw strong results. The airline's operating revenue of $688 million in July through September was 7% higher than during that period in 2013. Capacity or available seat miles rose 3.2% in the third quarter, and passenger revenue increased $522 million, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago.

Delta added that it earned nearly $50 million more than it did last year from products like its extra-legroom option.

"We are on a long-term path to consistently deliver top-quality results," Delta CEO Richard Anderson said in Thursday's call.

Responsibility for risk

A recent letter to the editor on the Ebola virus stated, "We don't need the death, grief and expense of inviting the problem here," especially when someone travels at his or her own risk ("Ebola fears prompt calls to ban West Africa flights," Your Say, Monday).

That should also apply to reporters and Americans who travel to dangerous areas when they fully know and realize the risk. The barbaric beheadings by the Islamic State are tragic for the families, but those events have created much of the call for getting our nation into another Mideast mess. We have plenty of problems in out own nation, if reporters or human rights workers wish to address them.

Biased treatment

The lead article in the Money section on Tuesday notes "Abby takes charge at Fidelity" to describe Abigail Johnson becoming the CEO of Fidelity Investments.

Why not say "Eddie steps down at Fidelity" to describe Edward Johnson III?

Would you headline an article referring to "Billy" for Bill Gates, "Larry" for Larry Ellison or just plain "Warren" for Warren Buffett? I don't think so.

I expected more from USA TODAY and am very disappointed in your failure to treat women in the workplace with the same professionalism offered to men.

Nurses cite Dallas hospital missteps ; They say they lacked proper training and protective equipment

A national nurses group says a Dallas hospital's handling of the nation's first Ebola case was sloppy, putting health care workers and patients at risk of infection from the deadly virus.

At a news conference Wednesday, leaders of National Nurses United recited examples of how they say Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas mishandled the care of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person with Ebola diagnosed in the USA.

The group called on President Obama to use his executive authority to issue uniform standards for treating Ebola patients.

Two health care workers in Dallas who cared for Duncan before he was diagnosed with Ebola have been diagnosed with the virus. A Spanish nurse caring for an Ebola patient in Madrid also was diagnosed with Ebola.

In Dallas, nurses assigned to care for Duncan, who died last week, weren't given proper training or proper personal protective equipment, said Deborah Burger, co-president of the nursing group, who said she has spoken with nurses at Texas Presbyterian. Those nurses also were assigned to care for other patients, potentially exposing them to Ebola, she said. Duncan was left in an area with other patients for hours after he was diagnosed, not immediately isolated, she said.

Blood samples taken from Duncan were sent through the hospital's general tube delivery system, rather than hand-delivered to a lab, Burger quoted the nurses as saying. That could contaminate blood shipped around the hospital.

The hospital failed to promptly remove waste contaminated with Ebola, which was stacked "to the ceilings," Burger said.

"We want to make sure this does not happen ever again," Burger said.

Wendell Watson, a spokesman for the Dallas hospital, said in a written statement, "Patient and employee safety is our greatest priority, and we take compliance very seriously. We have numerous measures in place to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting. Our nursing staff is committed to providing quality, compassionate care, as we have always known, and as the world has seen firsthand in recent days."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will send "go teams" of Ebola experts to any hospital with an Ebola case within hours of the diagnosis, said Tom Frieden, the agency's director. He said CDC staff members observed problems at the Dallas hospital.

"Some health care workers were putting on three or four layers of personal protective equipment," Frieden said, which makes the gear harder to put on and take off -- raising the risk of contamination.

As public health authorities race to assess the U.S. medical system's ability to contain Ebola, the track record of the nation's hospitals in controlling other infections suggests a lot of them aren't prepared.

From small, rural hospitals to sprawling urban medical centers, infection control has been a persistent and vexing problem in U.S. health care for decades.

Many hospitals handle these cases without incident. But lapses in procedures to isolate contagious patients, to protect health care workers from dangerous bacteria and viruses, and to clean contaminated equipment consistently rank among the most common deficiencies cited in hospital inspections and accreditation reviews.

The hospital system's capacity to control infections has become a focal point in the response to Ebola, underscored by news that a second nurse at a Dallas hospital contracted the disease after caring for a man who died from the disease last week. Investigators are trying to determine how protective measures failed to prevent the nurses' contamination.

About one in every 25 patients get an infection while being treated in a U.S. hospital, which translates to more than 700,000 hospital-associated illnesses each year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2011, about 75,000 patients died from those infections, or more than twice the number killed in auto accidents.

Virtually all those infections are transmitted via contaminated equipment, rooms or caregivers -- problems that would pose grave threats in treating patients with Ebola, which is both more deadly and more contagious than many of the bugs commonly spread in hospitals.

"I definitely worry" about most hospitals' ability to handle Ebola cases safely, says William Jarvis, former head of the health care infection division at the CDC. "You can get away with breaks in (infection control) technique a lot of the time with other blood- borne pathogens that are not that readily transmittable; with something like Ebola, there's no room for error."

DIRTY HANDS, EQUIPMENT

Hospital inspection records reviewed by USA TODAY show a wide range of problems.

Many violations involve health care workers failing to disinfect their hands or use protective gear properly -- gloves, gowns, masks and other items that must be donned and removed in very precise ways. In one case, more than 60 personnel at a single hospital were cited for failing to use face masks properly.

In other instances, surveyors observed personnel tracking blood across floors, wiping down equipment with dirty rags, using blood- testing equipment on successive patients without proper disinfection and failing to change "high-touch" room curtains for more than a year.

"There is very little discipline in a lot of hospitals around infection control," says Leah Binder, president of the Leapfrog Group, a consortium of corporations and other health care purchasers that tracks hospital quality. "If an Ebola patient walks into a hospital that has a high rate of infection for other (illnesses) they are going to be woefully unprepared."

USA TODAY reviewed inspection and accreditation data, academic studies and reports by medical associations to assess how hospitals handle infected patients. Many have driven down infection rates substantially with improved staff training, proven housekeeping protocols and quality assurance regimens. But many others still have problems:

More than 250 hospitals surveyed by state and federal regulators from January 2011 through June 2014 were cited for deficiencies in infection control, according to data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Those hospitals accounted for nearly 15% of 1,815 that were cited for any sort of violation.

In the first half of this year, infection control deficiencies were cited in about half of the hospital reviews conducted by the Joint Commission, which accredits more than 75% of the nation's hospitals. Those deficiencies, among the top five issues cited in the commission's reviews, related to hospitals' failure to adequately reduce infection risks linked to medical equipment, devices and supplies.

In a 2013 Leapfrog survey of more than 1,400 hospitals, more than 30% reported that they did not meet the group's standards for hand- washing education and compliance policies. Though hand hygiene is widely considered to be the most important component of infection- control programs, studies repeatedly have shown that compliance at many hospitals is below 70%.

More than a third of all U.S. hospitals do not have a certified infection prevention specialist on staff, according to a study this year in the American Journal of Infection Control.

"We know that health care-associated infections are something that U.S. health care facilities continue to struggle with," says CDC spokesman Abbigail Tumpey. "So, when we're talking about the complexities of caring for a patient with Ebola, we have to make sure facilities treating them are fully prepared."

GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS

Plenty of hospitals do a good job with infection control, and many others have improved substantially in recent years. Medical literature is full of accounts of hospitals that cut infection rates through training and oversight.

The 722,000 infections acquired in hospitals during 2011 represented a decline of 58% from a decade earlier, when the annual number stood at 1.7 million. The number of deaths linked to those infections dropped nearly 25% over the same period.

"The challenges, in some cases, with (infection control) is that we don't know the perfect strategy," says Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association's vice president for quality and patient safety. "The success we've exhibited over the last couple of years has really been the effect of learning from each other, where hospitals are sharing (strategies) to drive down infection rates."

But even where everyone knows the rules, such as hand-washing and room disinfection, not everyone abides by them.

In some cases, weak compliance is a matter of inadequately trained staff or limited resources, says Ana Pujols McKee, the Joint Commission's chief medical officer. But even when all the right equipment and procedures are in place, she adds, infection control is a constant challenge.

"There are a lot of highly technical processes that require precision, each and every time, and there is absolutely zero room for variation," McKee says. "There are high-performing organizations (and) there are some organizations that struggle."

Hospital surveys by regulators offer plenty of examples:

More than 60 staff at Kansas Surgery & Recovery Center in Wichita were observed using surgical masks improperly during a 2012 survey, with most leaving them dangling around their necks as they moved between public and sterile areas. The center provided additional training; a follow-up visit found no violations.

Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital in Ashland, Ky., was in jeopardy of losing its Medicare accreditation in 2012 after inspectors found staff failing to properly disinfect glucometers between uses on successive patients. Within days, the hospital retrained more than 100 nursing staff on glucometer cleaning.

At Bakersfield Memorial Hospital in California, surveyors in 2013 observed a technician fail to use shoe covers, tracking blood through an operating room. He and another technician used a bloodstained cloth to clean an equipment cart. Hospital officials said they retrained staff and strengthened protocols.

At Houston Methodist Willowbrook Hospital, a 2013 survey found that curtains at the entrance to patient rooms hadn't been cleaned for over a year, despite being "high-touch" areas. After the inspection, the hospital wrote a new policy for curtain cleaning and disinfecting.

"It seems a bit shaky to base our defense against Ebola on an industry sector that frankly does not seem up to the challenge," says John Santa, a physician and former health system administrator who now heads the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center.

"It is likely a subset of hospitals can provide optimal care to an Ebola patient and optimal protection to their employees," he adds. The challenge is "to get patients with Ebola or at risk of Ebola to those hospitals."

Oil, Europe, Ebola spook the markets

News of another U.S. Ebola victim rattled markets Wednesday, adding to mounting economic worries fueling a steep selloff that almost erased Wall Street's 2014 gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 460 points, before it recovered to a 173-point loss to close at 16,141. Likewise, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq ended off less than 1% after big slumps earlier in the day.

Big point swings have become common lately, but Wednesday was marked by a drumbeat of Ebola news that, when added to growing uncertainty over the economy, unnerved investors.

"Ebola equals fear," says Ann Miletti, senior portfolio manager for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds. "The fear is that it may not be as contained as we all wanted to believe."

"I suppose we have to factor into our investment strategy this new 'Fear Factor,'" said strategist Edward Yardeni. "The stock market is now driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. (And emotion) rapidly switches from greed to fear on Ebola news."

Beyond the worries about disease, however, were well-founded worries about economic health. Disappointing retail sales figures, released Wednesday morning, sparked concerns the economy could be slowing. Other factors:

Europe: European stock markets started out badly and stayed that way as investors fretted about the odds of a triple-dip recession. "Europe's issues are the things wearing on the minds of markets," says Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust.

Oil. Benchmark Brent crude oil fell again Wednesday to a new four- year low, while West Texas Intermediate, off earlier, closed unchanged. Lower crude prices are welcome news for consumers, but also a sign of global economic weakness and abundant supply. Energy stocks are off almost 14% from their Sept. 18 high.

Interest rates. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.873%, the lowest since May 2013, before settling at 2.13%. Yields fall when investors are scared and economic activity is slowing.

For investors, the big hope is that good earnings will pull stocks back up. Another 42 companies will report this week, and 132 next week, says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&PDow Jones Indices.

Naturally, Wall Street found ways to capitalize on fear. Shares of Lakeland Industries, a maker of hazmat suits, soared $2.17, or 10%, to $23.60 on Wednesday. Chimerix, the company developing what was one of the most promising treatments for Ebola, rose $3.13, or 11%, to $32.18.

Experts: U.S. could best treat Ebola at regional hospitals

The decision by federal authorities to transfer a nurse from the Dallas hospital where she contracted Ebola to one of four specially designed hospitals with biocontainment units represents a shift from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's position that Ebola patients can be successfully treated at hospitals around the country.

CDC Director Tom Frieden said Wednesday that Amber Vinson, 29, the second health care worker to contract Ebola after treating Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, was flown to Emory University Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit in Atlanta. The hospital has successfully treated other Ebola patients, including the first Americans diagnosed with the disease, missionaries Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, both of whom arrived from Africa.

No health care workers at Emory have contracted the virus.

The policy shift comes as momentum grows for a system of treating such patients at one of the four biocontainment hospitals -- the others are St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Mont.; Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha; and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. -- and at large regional hospitals. The Nebraska Medical Center has treated two Ebola patients who contracted the virus in West Africa, a missionary and a television news cameraman.

Public health experts across the nation are in "active discussion" about how to handle Ebola patients, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

"This is a clear, urgent decision to be made," he said. "Every hospital, health care facility and medical clinic has to be prepared to see an Ebola patient because we don't know where they will show up. But once they arrive, where do we send them?"

Nina Pham, 26, the first Dallas nurse diagnosed with Ebola, is improving and will remain at Texas Health Presbyterian for now, Frieden said.

The four hospitals with biocontainment units could accommodate a total of eight to 13 Ebola patients.

Just as hospitals around the USA have created regional trauma centers -- one or two hospitals in a large metropolitan area that concentrate on treating the severest injuries -- the nation could create regional Ebola centers, Osterholm said.

Jeffrey Duchin, chief epidemiologist for public health in Seattle and King County, Wash., said Ebola patients should ideally be treated "at health care facilities that have the most experience using the appropriate infection control and personal protective equipment and that have experience managing medically complex infectious disease cases and the associated legal issues or challenges."

Duchin, who chairs the public health committee for the Infectious Disease Society of America, said establishing regional centers for treating Ebola could be done in several weeks. "It would require voluntary participation (from private hospitals), and that would mean the corresponding need for a huge amount of technical support," he said. "And it would require making sure of the financial security for the facilities that participate."

Why Ebola drug seems so elusive ; Problems go beyond budget cuts at NIH, but creative solutions exist

The emergence of a third case of Ebola in Dallas shows us that the deadly infection, while less transmissible than viruses such as the flu, is still highly contagious.

Though the U.S. health care system will prevent Ebola from becoming epidemic here, we could still face large outbreaks. At some point, the only thing that will reverse the global tide could be a vaccine or a drug that can treat infected patients.

The good news is that there's nothing inherently complex about the Ebola virus that should make it an elusive target for modern medicines. The bad news is that developing such a drug or vaccine, as National Institutes of Health chief Francis Collins said this week, has been woefully slow.

In large part, Collins noted, this owes to failures of policy, not science. In NIH's case, Collins blamed cuts to its $30 billion budget. He said those cuts forced NIH to take its eye off of developing a promising Ebola vaccine.

A broad problem

This lack of political focus is a problem that plagues not only drugs aimed at rare diseases such as Ebola, but also medicines targeted to more immediate maladies, say antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Scan the doctor's bible of medicines, the Physicians' Desk Reference, and you'll find 33 drugs to treat high cholesterol, 71 to help you sleep and more than 200 to treat high blood pressure. But why aren't there more drugs that can thwart deadly bugs?

In the case of Ebola, I wrote a column on these pages in October 2002 discussing two drugs that are now being used experimentally to treat some of the Ebola-infected Americans. One is an anti-viral medicine called cidofovir. The other is a class of drugs that mimic certain immune cells, called antibodies, and can directly target Ebola virus.

At that time, my focus was on developing therapeutics for the potential agents of would-be bioterrorists. Ebola was on that list. Why, 12 years later, have drugs that were easily identified as potential remedies for Ebola in 2002 still languishing?

Regulatory barriers are one reason. In the case of very rare and deadly pathogens, the procedure for testing new drugs is painstakingly slow and expensive. It's hard to test a drug against a deadly disease in conventional "placebo" trials, where patients are randomly selected to receive a medicine. It's harder still to get regulators to adapt these traditional requirements.

But economics is an equally profound impediment. For a rare disease such as Ebola, there's little economic incentive to invest an estimated $1.2 billion to develop a new drug. In fact, most of the money that supported development of the Ebola therapeutics has come from government grants such as those supplied by NIH. But the grants were never enough to advance these drug programs.

What to do

The failings go beyond Ebola. We haven't developed a new class of antibiotics since 1987. By asking doctors to constrain the use of the most potent and novel antibiotics to treat resistant organisms, we also limit the economic incentive to develop the drugs.

There are solutions in which government can help. One idea is to use lucrative prizes to lure drug developers. If someone creates a therapeutic that meets certain uncommon but pressing public health needs, he or she could earn a prize equal to the return on a drug that successfully treats a more common malady.

Another option is to change the way we pay for medicines. Instead of paying a defined price for each unit of the drug, purchasers such as hospitals can pay for a license to use however many doses they might require. The license can afford a market-based return. The economic return to the drug maker is detatched from selling more doses of a drug when public health needs dictate holding a drug in reserve.

We're ill-prepared to deal with Ebola and a host of other dangerous bugs. We shouldn't be. The technology exists to defeat these organisms. We just need to find new economic and political ways to fund these public investments, and muster the appropriate sense of urgency to advance them past regulatory hurdles.

Unsettling secrets surface in 'Resurrection' ; The drama of the dead mixes things up early

Not much stays buried in Resurrection's Arcadia.

Dead people, known as the Returned, come back to life in the ABC drama (Sundays, 9 p.m. ET/PT), renewing residents' interest in long- hidden secrets and stirring up feelings that had been put to rest for decades.

The resurrected complicate everyone's lives, says Devin Kelley, whose Maggie Langston sees her world turned upside down by the return of her mother, Barbara (April Billingsley), her cousin, Jacob (Landon Gimenez), and, most recently, her grandmother, Margaret (Michelle Fairley).

"The people returning have dug up things from the past that everyone wanted to forget. The living people are dealing with each other and things they tried to ignore," she says.

Margaret, dead for more than three decades, stirred the pot when she arrived in the season premiere, surprising her two sons, former factory owner Henry (Kurtwood Smith) and town sheriff Fred (Matt Craven).

"She causes all kinds of ramifications throughout the family and ultimately, the town," Smith says.

Margaret's influence is apparent in a scene from a November episode that features a bizarre three-generation tableau in the Langston home: Henry's wife, Lucille (Frances Fisher); their 8- year-old son, Jacob, who died 32 years earlier; and her mother-in- law Margaret, now younger than Lucille, who stands strategically between mother and son.

Historically, "you can feel there hasn't been that great a relationship between Lucille and Margaret," who wants to take over the household, Fisher says. "There's a bond between Jacob and Margaret that I don't share because they're both Returned. He's just come back and I feel I'm losing him again."

Jacob is having a more difficult time with his mother. "When Jacob is talking to Lucille, he's being mean or sassy," Gimenez says. Jacob is "nice, creepy and mysterious all in one, which is what I like."

Resurrection, which has seen declining ratings since premiering to big numbers last spring, ended its first season by revealing that government agent J. Martin Bellamy (Omar Epps), who transported Jacob to Arcadia and stayed to protect him, is one of the Returned, too. In the 14-episode second season, Bellamy finds himself in the middle, having bonded with Arcadia residents while secretly reporting to a mysterious woman (Donna Murphy) who's keeping track of the Returned.

"He became an extended family member of not only the Langstons but (other) people in the town," Epps says. "He's still an outsider but (also) a part of the town. He feels he's the reason this is all happening. He's the one who brought this boy here."

Margaret adds to the Missouri town's mystery when she unearths bones at the Langston factory, which eventually shut down after Henry stopped running it in the wake of Jacob's death. The closing remains a sore point between Margaret and Henry.

"Mom turns out to be a little bit different than my or Fred's recollection of her, because we remember her from a different time," Smith says. "She's 15 years younger than I am and yet I still treat her like she's my mom."

Besides the mysteries, Arcadia soon will have to deal with a strange illness striking some of the Returned.

"When people come back from the past, sometimes they bring not- so-good things, including viruses that haven't been around for a while," executive producer Aaron Zelman says, acknowledging echoes of the Ebola virus. "It may not be true that they are spreading something all over the place, but (there is) the fear that they could. What does that do to how people feel about the Returned?"

They could bring hope, too, Zelman says.

"A big part of the show is the resurrection of the town itself. When this town was under the aegis of this powerful family, it was doing quite well, (but) Henry lost his son and he let the factory go down, and the town to a certain degree went with it. Can he bring it back?" Zelman says. "There are ways in which the past being now present in the town can breathe new life into the town."

"Winter is coming" is the motto of House Stark in Game of Thrones, the George R.R. Martin fantasy novel and HBO series. It's also a warning about climatic disaster and otherworldly forces threatening the story's imaginary continent of Westeros. It's a warning for us as well.

Supernatural elements usually take center stage in fantasy but seem secondary in Game of Thrones. Yet their seeming marginalization makes them all the more significant and provides an unsettling, real- world parallel.

Most of the story focuses on the brutal political machinations of the human characters vying for control of Westeros. They dismiss as fairy tales such things as the White Walkers -- ancient, malevolent beings on the move beyond Westeros' wall in the far north.

As clans slaughter one another, the supernatural forces draw closer. Wiser parties raise the alarm, but are largely ignored. You can imagine where this is ultimately headed.

The story works as a parable for our own world. We face our own climatic catastrophe -- not a supernatural threat, but one substantiated by science. But for many Americans, science is no more believable than magic is for the Westerosi, so global warming is ignored.

In the July Ipsos MORI survey of people in 20 nations, the U.S. ranked last in agreement with the statement, "We are heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly." A March Gallup Poll found that only 36% of Americans believe climate change will seriously threaten their way of life during their lifetimes. A Gallup Poll last month has climate change last among 13 issues registered voters were asked to rank in importance.

At work could be how Americans tend to equate nature with wilderness, something outside civilization, like the distant waste beyond Westeros' wall. We view environmental change as external to society, as at best secondary to seemingly more pressing issues such as the economy or national security -- though climate change has serious implications for both.

The undeniable urgency of unemployment, terrorism and Ebola do not mean climate change is any less important. Yet we act that way more often than not. On the very same day that the huge People's Climate March marked the culmination of years of activism, the Sunday political talk shows ignored it. Climate change was not even mentioned during the 2012 presidential debates.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., criticized likely presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton when she rightly called climate change "the most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face." Paul remarked, "I don't think we really want a commander in chief who's battling climate change instead of terrorism."

Barack Obama hasn't been that much different. Despite doing more than any other U.S. president to address climate change, he has stood to the side, sometimes cheering, during a vast expansion of fossil fuel production in the U.S. now reshaping world markets. High gasoline prices that once spurred alternative fuels and electric vehicles might not be back for a long time.

Even as emissions and temperatures rise, the Arctic melts, methane bubbles up from the sea floor and oceans acidify, many still regard climate like the weather, an external phenomenon beyond human influence. Thus the common, dismissive refrain, recently echoed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.: "Our climate is always changing."

The longer we remain focused on seemingly serious short-term concerns while ignoring what is just on the other side of the wall, the more we'll wish "winter is coming."

For us, a long hot summer is on the way.

Hospital's blunders feed doubts about Ebola defense

Let us count the ways that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has screwed up since encountering the nation's first case of Ebola three weeks ago:

When Thomas Duncan, 42, first arrived at the hospital's emergency room feeling ill and feverish, he told a nurse that he had been to Liberia, epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Yet the hospital kept him waiting for hours with other patients. When he was finally examined, doctors missed the Liberia connection, rejected a nurse's pleas that he be isolated, misdiagnosed his Ebola-like symptoms and sent him home with antibiotics -- all despite massive news coverage about the threat.

When Duncan returned three days later, his illness was finally diagnosed and he was isolated, but the hospital botched containment protocols -- if it even had protocols to botch. An organization representing the hospital's nurses says it did not. The protection failed, infecting at least two workers.

The hospital and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moved quickly to identify people who had been exposed. But, incredibly, those people were left free to travel around the country. One boarded an airplane with a mild fever, and the hunt is now on for others whom she might have infected.

If you think hospital administrators are shamed by all this blundering, you'd be wrong. At a news conference Wednesday, Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer for the hospital's parent company, Texas Health Resources, said he sees no "systematic institutional problem."

Even more implausibly, he insisted that the most recent case shows the hospital's "ability to intake those folks, get them into isolation, and manage them has been very effective."

Sure it does. And the moon is made of green cheese.

The point of this is not to flog Presbyterian, though a few lashes might help snap Varga and other administrators back to reality. Rather, it is to probe whether the hospital's dismal performance exposes more widespread weaknesses that could turn a few inevitable, isolated cases of Ebola into something much worse.

From the earliest days of the crisis, CDC Director Tom Frieden has been relentlessly reassuring. He has insisted, among other things, that the nation's hospitals could identify and isolate Ebola patients -- the indispensable first line of defense against an outbreak.

The Dallas experience raises doubts. Texas Presbyterian is a big institution in a big city, so there's little reason to believe it's uniquely ill-prepared.

Frieden and his agency have belatedly come to recognize this. They've sent a highly trained team of outbreak specialists to help the hospital straighten itself out, and in the wake of the nurse's misbegotten plane ride, they're tightening rules for people who have been exposed.

This is progress, but the holes in the system are not something the CDC can magically fill. The threat is too diffuse. Rather, the primary responsibility lies with each hospital. Every one of them should be reacting aggressively to Presbyterian's travails, under intense local news media scrutiny -- and tapping the CDC's knowledge and resources.

Frieden, meanwhile, would be well advised to make his optimism less blind. You'd be hard-pressed to find medical authorities who disagree with his assessment that the Ebola crisis can be contained, and that there's time to prepare. But it's time that the nation's hospitals and CDC need to spend more effectively than they have so far, lest the bravery of nurses and doctors on the front lines go for naught.

Excerpts from remarks at a news conference on Wednesday by Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer and senior executive vice president of Texas Health Resources, parent company of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital:

Today's development (of a second hospital worker diagnosed with Ebola), while concerning and unfortunate, is continued evidence that our monitoring program is working. We continue to monitor 75 health care workers in conjunction with the state. And while I cannot discuss patient specifics, I can tell you this new patient was involved in the care of Mr. Duncan, the original patient whose passing we still mourn.

Our interests at this time, first and foremost, is making certain both our current patients receive the care they need. That will remain our focus. The health and safety of our patients and employees remain our highest priority, and we will continue to coordinate with officials at all levels to meet the challenge that Ebola presents to our hospital, our community and our country.

A lot is being said about what may or may not have occurred to cause some of our colleagues to contract this disease, but it's clear there was an exposure somewhere, some time, in their treatment of Mr. Duncan. Let's be clear, we're a hospital that serves this community incredibly well, and we have for nearly half a century.

We're a hospital that may have done some things differently with the benefit of what we know today, but make no mistake, no one wants to get this right more than our hospital, the first to diagnose and treat this insidious disease that's now attacked two of our own.

After several weeks of great emotion and great effort, our team spirit is tried and tested, and the support of so many is really helping everyone to rise to continue to meet this challenge.

I don't think we have a systematic institutional problem. I think the biggest challenge we have right now is, obviously, first and foremost, the care of the two patients that we have, and the ongoing screening of folks in the community.

Our emergency department has continued to have folks come in. It's a tribute to the information that's been out there in the community. I think the case of this (latest) patient again shows that the ability to intake those folks, get them into isolation, and manage them has been very effective.

But we're looking at every element of our personal protective equipment and infection control inside the hospitals. We don't have an answer for this right now, but we're looking at every possible angle.

Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire, recently said that the spread of the Ebola virus should prompt the U.S. government to seal the border with Mexico.

Never mind that Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian national who was the first to die of the virus in the U.S., flew to Dallas on a plane. Never mind that two people with Ebola-like symptoms are being monitored in Canada, pretty far from that Mexican border.

In using the Ebola scare to call for a sealing of the Southern border, Brown became just the latest Republican politician to use the foreign threat of the day as an excuse to close off the Southern border once and for all.

Worried about members of the Islamic State that's operating in Syria and Iraq sneaking into the country, as Rep. Duncan Hunter, R- Calif., claims is happening? Seal the border with Mexico.

Worried about the H1N1 swine flu spreading into the country, as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and others did? Seal the border.

There are many rational reasons for increased border security. Any sovereign nation should be able to control the flow of people into its territory. And with the U.S. a target for terrorists, it only makes sense to improve the government's ability to detect potential threats.

Improving border security is incredibly difficult work. It requires technological improvements to better track people flying into the country; a smarter combination of Border Patrol agents and motion-sensing technology along the Southern border; and more effective screening of cargo at ports.

Even though raising the alarmist flag anytime something scary is happening abroad may help some of these Republicans come election time, it also makes it that much more difficult to have the nuanced discussion that's needed to improve our nation's security.

In most cases, the scaremongering is also difficult to disprove. Yes, it's technically possible that an al-Qaeda operative could hop a flight into Mexico City and traverse the deserts and mountains into the U.S. But however unlikely that is, such alarm bells are difficult to silence.

In some cases, it's possible. Three years ago, I was sitting in a congressional hearing examining our nation's borders. Several GOP members of the committee were panicking about the threat of that era -- Mexican drug cartels. As they told it, the deadly violence that was gripping the northern states of Mexico was spilling into the U.S. They painted a picture of armed bands of drug runners marauding through America's Southwest, guns blazing, with bodies piling up in the streets. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said decapitated heads were showing up in the desert.

Fed up with the lack of any real data in that debate, I got together with a couple of colleagues at USA TODAY. We spent weeks crunching crime data. We compared the rates of violence for border towns with state and national averages and found something amazing: The closer you live to the Southern border, the safer you are.

Cities such as El Paso and San Diego were far safer than cities farther north. Rather than terrorizing people, cartel couriers were more interested in slipping into the country undetected.

In that case, we were able to silence one ridiculous excuse for sealing the border. Too bad we can't do the same this time.

With a second U.S.-based health care worker diagnosed with Ebola on Wednesday, businesses are grappling with how to manage workplace concerns about the virus.

They range from whether employers can legally ask workers who've visited the countries at the epicenter of the epidemic to stay home, to what plans they need in place to protect or evacuate employees working overseas.

"Unfortunately, Ebola is going to be around," said Myles Druckman, senior vice president of the Americas for International SOS Assistance, during a webinar Wednesday presented by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. "Organizations need to figure out what they're going to do and how they're going to respond to this crisis situation."

Druckman said businesses are holding town hall-style meetings, Web-based talks, and even discussions with the families of traveling workers to let employees know there are plans in place if health- related problems arise -- including overseas evacuations if required.

"This is an issue of organizations really getting a handle on how they prepare travelers before they go," Druckman said, "and ultimately how you can alert them during the trip if things do escalate."

Howard Mavity, a senior partner at the Atlanta-based national management labor firm Fisher & Phillips, says he has received a flurry of calls from clients with employees who have returned from personal trips to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the countries hardest hit by the Ebola virus.

"The most common question is, 'Can I tell them to stay home for 21 days?' And what I'm recommending is no," Mavity says. Doing so could set the employer up for a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, says Mavity.

Instead, some employers are having workers who may have visited the afflicted countries on vacations regularly check themselves for fever.

As concerns about Ebola grow, businesses may confront other legal issues. For instance, some workers may refuse to do their jobs because they say they are fearful of contracting the virus. In recent days, some workers who clean plane cabins have briefly walked off the job at New York's LaGuardia Airport. And National Nurses United has said members are not being told how to properly protect themselves when dealing with Ebola-infected patients.

"There are legal protections for people who choose to refuse," Mavity says.

The Ebola epidemic in West Africa could reach 10,000 cases a week, and U.S. health officials are promising dramatic response to any new domestic outbreaks that signal intercontinental spread of the deadly virus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will send a rapid- response team to any hospital in the nation that diagnoses another Ebola patient, Director Tom Frieden said Tuesday.

He voiced regret that the agency had not done so sooner, with the death of the first patient in Dallas last week and the infection of Nina Pham, a nurse who cared for him. "That might have prevented this infection," Frieden said. "We should have put an even larger team on the ground immediately, and we will do that anytime there is a confirmed case."

Pham, 26, was reported in good condition as a patient at the hospital where she works. In a statement from her bed at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, she said, "I'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers."

Her dog, Bentley, a King Charles spaniel, has been on the receiving end of a groundswell of support as well, particularly after Spain put to death Excaliber, a pet dog belonging to an infected care nurse there.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Bentley would be reunited with Pham when she recovers. "He's wagging his tail, eating, drinking water," he said.

Frieden said he doesn't know how Pham contracted the virus during treatment of Thomas Eric Duncan. Pham used protective clothing and equipment.

The World Health Organization warns that West Africa could see up to 10,000 new cases a week within two months. It said the death rate is now 70% for those infected with Ebola.

The nature of the Ebola virus can make it a grave threat to those who have the most intimate contact with patients' bodies -- health care workers in intensive care units, family caregivers and mortuary workers.

Those caring for patients at the end of their lives are at high risk of infection because the virus replicates wildly as the disease becomes more advanced, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston.

"When you are first infected, you are actually not contagious," because levels of the virus in blood are too low, Hotez says.

Ebola shuts down the body's production of interferon, "the body's first defense against viruses," Hotez says. The substance fights viruses before antibodies begin to shut them down.

Without those chemical police to stop it, Ebola "has the ability to just replicate and replicate and replicate," Hotez says. Because the virus attacks platelets -- which help the blood to clot -- patients infected with Ebola can bleed profusely and vomit blood.

Even a small amount of blood is teeming with Ebola virus, so the disease can spread easily at this point to caregivers, Hotez says.

Are U.S. hospitals prepared for possible Ebola battle?

The fact that Dallas health care worker Nina Pham contracted Ebola even though she wore protective gear while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of the deadly disease on U.S. soil, is spurring demands for better training of health care workers and prompting calls for all U.S. Ebola patients to be cared for at one of the nation's four specially designed hospitals with biocontainment units.

If necessary, some future Ebola patients could be transferred to one of four hospitals in the USA with specialized biocontainment units, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Thomas Frieden said Tuesday.

Officials from two of those facilities say the super-hospitals won't be able to handle all future Ebola patients. Every hospital in the USA needs to be prepared to diagnose and treat patients with Ebola, said Bruce Ribner, medical director of the infectious disease unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which treated the first two Ebola patients in the USA, who contracted the disease in West Africa.

"It's not going to be possible, if this outbreak continues in West Africa, for a select number of institutions to care for patients," Ribner said.

Altogether, those four hospitals can accommodate from eight to 13 patients, said Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, which has treated a U.S. missionary and is treating a TV news cameraman, both of whom contracted the virus in West Africa. He said Nebraska has one or two Ebola beds; Emory, two beds; St. Patrick Hospital in Montana, one to two beds; and the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, from four to seven beds. "But I don't know if they (NIH) have the staffing," he said.

Smith said the State Department decides which patients get beds at the biocontainment units.

The nation's largest nurses' organization says most registered nurses at hospitals around the USA have not been given adequate training to handle an Ebola patient. Many hospitals have been slow to provide the proper training because it's expensive, said Charles Idelson, spokesman for National Nurses United, which has 185,000 members.

"Part of the problem with relying on the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is that they don't have an enforcement mechanism," he said. "What we see happening is the CDC can issue a thousand guidelines, but hospitals can choose to follow or not follow whatever guidelines they want. That's been a major roadblock to developing a national coordinated response to Ebola. For weeks, we heard assurances that the hospitals were prepared."

But he says his group's survey of over 2,100 registered nurses at some 750 facilities in 46 states and Washington, D.C., found that just 15% had received Ebola education where nurses could interact and ask questions. "What's happening is they're being given a CDC handout and directed to the CDC's website," he said.

BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS

The goal is to give blood from an Ebola survivor to a patient in hopes that the donor's antibodies could help a patient's immune system fight the virus.

Ebola survivor Kent Brantly, a missionary doctor, received a blood donation from a teenage survivor. Brantly survived and has donated blood to three other Americans: missionary doctor Richard Sacra, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo and Dallas nurse Nina Pham. Sacra recovered. Mukpo and Pham are hospitalized.

There is great potential for immune globulin, or purified antibodies, said Peter Hotez of the National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston. Purified antibodies could be given to anyone, regardless of blood type.

VACCINES

Two vaccines are being tested. One developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada began testing Monday at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md. A second vaccine is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline.

A trial began at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., last month and another trial began in the West African country of Mali last week.

ANTIVIRAL DRUGS

Japanese company Fujifilm said it has 20,000 doses of influenza drug fabipiravir. The drug was given to a French nurse who has recovered, but as with any experimental treatment, doctors can't say whether the drug is responsible for curing the nurse.

Brincidofovir is an antiviral drug that has been given to Mukpo as well as Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian national who died in Dallas.

MAN-MADE ANTIBODIES

ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, contains man- made antibodies. Brantly received ZMapp, as did missionary Nancy Writebol, who also survived. A Spanish priest and a Liberian health worker who received ZMapp died. Mapp Biopharmaceutical said supplies of ZMapp are exhausted.

PREVENTING EBOLA REPRODUCTION

TKM-Ebola, made by Canadian company Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, has been given to Ebola patients, including Sacra. The drug keeps Ebola from reproducing and protected 100% of monkeys tested. The FDA put a hold on early human trial.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are giving $25 million to the CDC Foundation to help fight the Ebola epidemic.

In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said the viral outbreak is "at a critical turning point."

"It has infected 8,400 people so far, but it is spreading very quickly and projections suggest it could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed," he wrote.

"We need to get Ebola under control in the near term so that it doesn't spread further and become long-term global health crisis that we end up fighting for decades at large scale, like HIV or polio. We believe our grant is the quickest way to empower the CDC and the experts in this field to prevent this outcome," he continued. "Grants like this directly help the front-line responders in their heroic work. These people are on the ground setting up care centers, training local staff, identifying Ebola cases and much more."

The donation will go to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ebola response effort in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and in other spots in the world where Ebola is a threat, the foundation said Tuesday.

Zuckerberg and Chan are making the grant from their fund at the non-profit Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

Zuckerberg has a net worth of about $29.7 billion. He has pledged to donate at least half his wealth to philanthropic causes. In 2013 he was the largest donor to charity.

Last month, Bill Gates' foundation pledged $50 million to fight the epidemic in West Africa.

Eugene Robinson, The Washington Post: "The war against the Islamic State can be seen only as failing. Intervention by the world's mightiest military force has produced no shock and no awe. To be sure, U.S. and coalition airstrikes are inflicting some damage. But the bombing has done virtually nothing to alter the strategic balance of power -- or to boost the fortunes of our ostensible allies on the ground, the 'moderate' Syrian rebels and the hapless Iraqi military."

Gary Anderson, New York Post: "Few military professionals think the war can be resolved by aerial bombardment alone. What's needed is a series of large-scale raids that would let the Iraqi army and Western-aligned Syrian rebels reoccupy the (areas). In an invasion, you come to permanently occupy the terrain. In a raid, you destroy the enemy and leave. President Obama is correct: We are the indispensable nation in this effort. And while we may be able to recruit a posse, a global marshal has to lead from the front."

Bill Cowan, Fox News: "(Obama says) he wants to 'degrade' and 'destroy' ISIL. His words are cheap to the military men and women who are prepared at this moment to engage fully and deliberately in the fight. Frankly, it's embarrassing. Instead of striking fear in the heart of the enemy, we're showing ISIL and the rest of the world that the best we can do under this president's lackluster leadership is half-hearted. At some point, like it or not, we'll be forced to respond more decisively."

Max Fisher, Vox: "(Obama) has two choices. Keep the status quo strategy, accepting that it will leave ISIL pretty capable of attacking the U.S. or partner with Syrian President Bashar Assad and help him win the war. Both of those options are disasters for Obama's legacy. But only one of them actually achieves Obama's narrow objectives in Syria."

Matthew Continetti, The Washington Free Beacon: "What Obama fails to grasp: It's not enough to deploy the minimum amount of force -- increased airstrikes, detachments to secure government facilities or treat Ebola patients in order to prevent imminent massacres, and to salve guilty consciences. You have to be ready to assume the responsibilities of hegemony, commit to the unpopular necessities in a 30-year-war against jihadism."

Fear spreads faster than Ebola

When contagion breaks out -- whether it's AIDS in the 1980s, SARS a decade ago or Ebola today -- fear invariably spreads faster than the virus.

Vivid imaginations, intense news media coverage, ignorance and natural human fear of the unknown all conspire to defeat reasoned analysis of the facts, which for now at least are these: Only two cases of Ebola have been diagnosed in the USA, one linked to the other and confined to a tiny part of Dallas. Hardly anyone outside the proximity of those two people has any reason for concern, much less panic, until and unless there are more.

Yet the Ebola script is playing out as if it had been written by the authors of Hollywood hits World War Z and Outbreak, or the recent TV drama The Strain.

In Atlanta, fear of the unknown was so thick in August that one pizza driver wouldn't deliver to Emory Hospital, where American Ebola patients brought back from Africa were fighting for their lives inside a special isolation unit. Couriers initially refused to deliver blood test samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab a few blocks away. And in Dallas, some residents of the apartment complex where a Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, was visiting family before he died of Ebola were told not to come to work.

Those people, at least, have an excuse. Not so politicians who have been rushing to exploit the crisis for their personal benefit rather than leaning in to help people through it.

The prize so far goes to Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell, who on Monday got a court order to block the ashes of Duncan's belongings from going to a Louisiana landfill, despite CDC assurances that fire destroys the virus. Caldwell fits a familiar Hollywood stereotype, too: the infuriating character who panics under pressure and endangers everyone else.

Maybe Ebola will be harder to contain here than the nation's leading health officials believe. It's just too early to know for sure. But amid the dreary news Tuesday that the disease is killing 70% of its victims and could produce 10,000 new cases a week by December, there are some striking success stories, even in the African epicenter of the outbreak:

In 2000, Uganda had the worst Ebola outbreak ever until this year. It killed more than 400 people. But that nation has since learned how to contain the disease, and the last three flare-ups have been contained to 18 cases and eight deaths.

Nigeria has managed to stop the spread of Ebola from neighboring countries after a handful of cases turned up there.

And in the middle of hard-hit Liberia, a huge rubber farm reacted so quickly when Ebola struck there that its 80,000 residents are now free of the disease, according to The Wall Street Journal. And that's without the sophisticated medical care available here.

This isn't reason to relax, but it is reason for a calm, deliberate focus on containment -- both in Africa, where the U.S. and other nations are belatedly mounting an offensive against the disease, and at home, where the Dallas case has exposed holes in the nation's front-line defenses: emergency rooms and clinics.

The experience so far in Dallas argues for transporting Ebola patients to the four hospitals (in Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska and Montana) specially equipped to handle them. This will work only as long as the number of victims is small, but it could provide breathing room to train hospital staff and ramp up capacity to handle Ebola patients elsewhere.

The needs are more mundane than high-tech: more protective suits, more hands-on training, better protocols for hazardous waste disposal and, with flu season right around the corner, better ways to separate incoming patients.

As for the inclination to panic, the nation would do well to look toward those who have instinctively responded to the crisis with bravery: the medical professionals who have taken mortal risk to fight the contagion in West Africa, the infected nurse in Dallas who risked her life to help Duncan, and leaders such as Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who set a remarkable example for the country by publicly visiting Duncan's quarantined family and fiancee and helping to take them to a new home.

When people complained, medical experts said because the family had exhibited no signs of the disease, what Jenkins did was safe. But it was a display of courage and decency, which is exactly the right antidote for an outbreak of fear.

It's nervous time again on Wall Street.

A late-day sell-off on Wall Street sent stocks careening sharply lower again Monday, dashing hopes for a rebound rally after last week's plunge, pushing the major U.S. stock indexes closer to an official 10% correction and causing fresh worries for investors.

Investors got another frightful dose of market volatility Monday when a steep, late-day dive left the Dow Jones industrial average down 223.03 points, or 1.4%, to 16,321.07. It was the Dow's fifth- straight day of triple-digit point moves, with only one a positive close. The blue-chip index is down more than 950 points, or 5.5%, from its Sept. 19 record close of 17,279.74.

The Dow has plunged 673 points in the past three sessions, its worst three-day sell-off since August 2011.

The market has been in a tailspin since last week when fears of a global growth slowdown, despite strong growth in the U.S., forced investors to rethink their bullish stance after a long period of calm in financial markets.

"There is this nervous cloud hovering over Wall Street that I haven't seen since the S&P ratings downgrade (of the USA's AAA- credit rating) in August 2011 as traders try to assess global economic vulnerabilities," says Todd Schoenberger, president at J. Streicher Asset Management.

Anxiety has been exacerbated on Wall Street by continued uncertainty about markets' reaction as the Federal Reserve nears the expected end of its market-friendly bond-buying program this month and plots its first interest rate hike next year. The geographic shift of the Ebola crisis to U.S. soil in recent days has also put investors on edge, as concern about the spread of the virus and its potential impact on economic growth mounts.

The rising fear is evident in the sharp rise in a closely watched Wall Street fear gauge, dubbed the VIX. The fear gauge jumped 16% to 24.64 Monday, hitting its highest level in 28 months.

Other major U.S. stock indexes also took big hits Monday, adding to the increasing financial pain.

One reason for the late-day sell-off is the S&P 500 failed to hold its long-term trend line, known as the 200-day moving average, says Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments.

Often, when key market indexes plunge below key support levels, computer trading kicks in, creating a more intense burst of selling.

Wall Street will focus on corporate earnings today, hoping reports from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo come in strong and CEOs offer upbeat guidance about the future.

Health officials scrambled to learn how a Dallas health care worker caught Ebola at a hospital where she had cared for a man who died from the deadly virus.

The woman was identified Monday as nurse Nina Pham, her family confirmed.

Pham, 26, became infected while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient to die in the USA. Pham, who graduated from Texas Christian University's nursing program in 2010, is the first person known to contract the disease in the USA.

Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday that Pham was "clinically stable." He apologized to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, saying his comments Sunday that Pham's infection was the result of a "breach of protocol" did not reflect on Pham or the hospital's efforts.

"I apologize if people thought I was criticizing the hospital," Frieden said at a news conference. "And I feel awful that a health care worker became infected while helping an Ebola patient."

Frieden said investigators have yet to determine how Pham was infected. He stood by the protocols -- including the use of masks, gloves and other equipment -- saying they have proved safe for health care workers for decades.

"The existence of the first case of Ebola spread in the U.S. changes some things, and it doesn't change some things," he said. "It doesn't change the fact that we know how Ebola spreads. It doesn't change the fact that it's possible to treat Ebola safely. But it does change substantially how we approach it."

Father Jim Khoi, Pham's pastor, says she has received a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor. The identity of that survivor was unknown.

More than 4,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, the vast majority of them in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Frieden urged U.S. hospital workers to watch for patients with fever or other Ebola symptoms who have traveled from those nations.

Duncan's medical records provided by his family to the Associated Press indicate there may have been more than 70 hospital staffers involved in the care of the highly contagious man who died Oct. 8. The CDC has said it is monitoring 48 potential contacts.

There is even concern for Pham's beloved pet. In an interview with WFAA Monday, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Pham's dog - - a King Charles Spaniel named Bentley -- will not be killed, despite speculation that the dog could pose a health risk.

"When I met with her parents, they said, 'This dog is important to her, judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog," he said. "If that dog has to be the boy in the plastic bubble, we're going to take good care of that dog."

Owens also reports for WFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth

5 Myths about germs on aircraft ; Cabin air is safe, but wash your hands often, especially if you use the tray table and armrest.

The clamor over Ebola is rising, but at 36,000 feet, MRSA and E. coli may be a bigger health concern. As fliers in confined cabins seek to protect themselves, here are five myths about germs in aircraft.

1The most dangerous health hazard in the air is the cabin air itself.

"That's wrong," says Michael Zimring, director of travel medicine at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore and author of Healthy Travel. "The cabin air is fine, and aircraft are outfitted with HEPA filters to clean it."

The real problems lie on the chair upholstery, the tray table, the armrests and the toilet handle, where bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and E. coli can live for up to a week on airplanes that aren't properly cleaned. These findings are the result of a two-year study by a team of microbiologists and engineers at Auburn University in Alabama, who presented it at the American Society for Microbiology's annual meeting.

"I can't say I was surprised by the findings," said James Barbaree, professor associate and director of the Auburn University Detection & Food Safety Center and a 20-year veteran of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study.

Tray tables had the highest levels of bacteria, and seat belts and armrests were also singled out as places where bacteria can survive. The study tested six types of bacteria. The findings: MRSA could last 168 hours on the back pocket of a seat; E. coli could remain active for 96 hours on the armrest.

2 Bagged pillows and blankets are OK to use.

It may be tempting to grab a blanket and a pillow when boarding, especially on long flights, but the sage advice is to give them a pass.

"I don't use any of them," says John Gobbels, vice president and COO of Medjet Assist, which arranges air medical transport for its members. "If I ever use a blanket, it's one sealed in plastic but then only for my lower legs."

As for pillows, "never" is the operative term. "No one is changing the pillow cases," Gobbels says.

3 The aircraft is cleaned between flights.

How often and well an aircraft is cleaned is something of a secret. Removing trash and magazines is one thing, but most industry watchers say a proper cleaning doesn't occur that often.

The FAA doesn't regulate cleaning, so frequency and thoroughness are left to the airlines. Gobbels says as a rule of thumb, an aircraft is supposed to be completely wiped down after every 30 days of service or at 100 flying-hour intervals, but that means an aircraft can be used for dozens of flights between deep cleanings.

"There's a lot of cost-cutting and cleaning is one area that gets cut," says Gobbels.

Southwest Airlines, however, says it keeps up with cleaning. "We thoroughly clean and disinfect our interiors nightly in accordance with industry regulations," says Brandy King, communications director of the airline. "This includes a top-to-bottom cleaning, covering a detailed checklist that includes all items in the cabin, lavatories and galleys. The aircraft is also refreshed between flights."

4 Airlines have taken steps to ensure that passengers can't contract diseases like the Ebola virus in the aircraft.

There have not been any reported cases of the Ebola virus spreading within the confines of an aircraft cabin. Ebola, Zimring points out, is not an airborne virus but is spread through bodily fluids. Still, passengers should adhere to rigorous hygiene practices, says Gobbels.

"Ebola can be transferred through open wounds and mucus membranes such as the mouth and eye," says Gobbels, "so cover exposed areas of skin and be mindful of the method of transmission. Wash your hands often. If you travel to or with people who may have come from Ebola-infected areas, watch your health for signs and symptoms of Ebola for 21 days after travel and seek immediate medical attention if required."

5 Let's face it, there's not much I can do to protect myself when I'm trapped in an aircraft cabin.

Not true. There are multiple steps that every flier can take to prevent the spread of bacteria when they fly. First, they should travel with and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. They should also travel with a pack of disinfectant wipes. Gobbels says that "the first thing I do when I sit down is to wipe down the armrest and tray table."

Staying hydrated also helps, says Zimring. So does using a tissue or a paper towel to open bathroom doorknobs and touch toilet handles. The most vulnerable area may well be your eyes, and medical professionals advise not going anywhere near them with your hands, as tear ducts are a fast route for germs to the nose and throat.

Drugmaker's only focus: Ebola ; Kentucky company ramps up production of ZMapp medicine

As Ebola continues to ravage West Africa and spreads for the first time in the United States, a Kentucky company is putting all other work aside to concentrate solely on producing the experimental medicine ZMapp.

The goal: to ramp up production of the drug and get it approved more quickly.

Kentucky BioProcessing, contracted by privately held drugmaker Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego to produce ZMapp, makes the drug using tobacco plants, which act as "photocopiers" to mass-produce proteins.

"We have essentially put all of our resources around the ZMapp compound," says David Howard, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., which acquired Kentucky BioProcessing in January. "It's our entire focus."

Howard says the company is hiring more staff and working on the compound 24/7 at its Owensboro facility, which has 32,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Although the compound takes about three months to make, he said, limited supplies are available now, and he expects to continue producing more to speed the drug-approval process.

Working toward U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval is also the federal government's goal. In September, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to accelerate development of ZMapp under an 18-month, $24.9 million contract with Mapp, which could be extended to $42.3 million.

Gretchen Michael, spokeswoman for HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, says the government agency is also in talks with Texas-based Caliber Biotherapeutics about producing more ZMapp, along with Kentucky BioProcessing. Caliber says on its website it has the "world's largest plant-made pharmaceutical facility." Caliber officials wouldn't comment on how discussions are going.

ZMapp was untested in humans when it was used on American aid workers Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly, who contracted Ebola and received the medication while still in Liberia, according to Samaritan's Purse, the faith-based organization for which Brantly worked.

While both recovered, doctors say it's unclear what role ZMapp played. Both patients received supportive care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Still, scientists agree ZMapp is promising. Researchers announced in August that the compound cured 100% of monkeys treated in a Canadian study.

Meanwhile, the toll continues to rise. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 8,376 cases of Ebola and 4,024 deaths had been reported as of Oct. 8 in the African countries with the widest transmission of the virus. The first person diagnosed in the United States was Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, and a second patient tested positive over the weekend -- a nurse who cared for Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Ungar also reports for The (Louisville, Ky.) Courier-Journal.

Americans are short on reasons for trust ; CDC, Secret Service seem overwhelmed

There's a connection between the Secret Service's Colombian hooker scandal and Americans' increased worry about Ebola. Both have to do with trust.

Until recently, if you asked Americans to pick government institutions characterized by efficiency and professionalism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Secret Service would likely have been at the top of the list. In both cases, recent evidence now suggests otherwise.

In the case of the Secret Service, the story comes in two parts - - first, the 2012 scandal involving agents boozing and carousing with prostitutes in Cartagena, ahead of a visit by President Obama, and second, the apparent coverup that gave favored treatment to a White House worker who was the son of an Obama donor.

Big security issue

Secret Service agents aren't supposed to be getting drunk and cavorting with hookers while on official business. It poses an obvious risk to security. After the scandal broke, nearly two dozen Secret Service agents and members of the military on the advance team were fired or punished.

But one person got a pass -- a White House advance team employee. According to investigators, they got pressure from the White House to delay the report until after the 2012 election, and to "withhold and alter certain information in the report of investigation because it was potentially embarrassing to the administration."

As National Journal's Ron Fournier writes, this stinks for two reasons. First, the working stiffs got punished while the White House insider got a pass. Second, this kind of nepotism and dishonesty undermines the necessary bond of trust between the president and the people who protect him.

Meanwhile, the CDC's bungles on Ebola have also undermined trust. The CDC has been unclear on how Ebola is transmitted, and has looked clumsy and untrustworthy. Despite the CDC's assurances, Ebola fears persist. As Matthew Continetti writes: "Again, the authorities behave irresponsibly and inscrutably. Again, the faces on our televisions say there is no cause for alarm. These dangers are real, and pressing. It is not Ebola I am afraid of. It is our government's ability to deal with Ebola."

CDC's many missteps

The CDC's spate of problems with handling other dangerous pathogens such as anthrax, smallpox and deadly influenza samples doesn't inspire much confidence either.

As George Will observed on Ebola, Americans want to trust the government, but can't.

And as Meet the Press' Chuck Todd commented, the problem stems not just from the CDC but also from the administration: "One of your challenges, though, is a trust deficit that has been created over the last 18 months."

Todd listed a litany of government defaults: The IRS scandal with its mysteriously crashed hard drives and erased e-mails, Veterans Affairs' lies about wait times, the Secret Service's failures, and more. And he's right.

The problem is, we're heading into what looks like a dark period, one in which trust in government will be very important to dealing successfully with the many challenges we face. But trust in government comes primarily from one thing: a government that is worthy of trust.

Keep that in mind, come November.

The Flash CW, 8 ET/PT

TV's latest superhero series got off to a fast start last week. Now we'll see if it can maintain that momentum, as a setback leads Barry (an excellently cast Grant Gustin) to question whether he's cut out for the life of a hero. He'd better not ask Joe (Jesse L. Martin), because the answer is certain to be "no" -- and then where would the show be?

About a Boy NBC, 9:30 ET/PT

When we left this promising if wildly uneven adaptation of the popular movie, Will had moved to New York to be with his girlfriend. In the Season 2 opener, he returns to San Francisco for a visit he intends, at least for now, to be temporary. Odds are that "temporary" will turn to "permanent" fairly soon, but who knows? Maybe the show will surprise us.

Frontline: The Trouble with Antibiotics PBS, 10 ET/PT (times may vary)

Want something to worry about that, at the moment, is far more of a health risk here than Ebola? Frontline examines the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, tonight's documentary says, infect an estimated 2 million people here a year, killing at least 23,000. The issue debated tonight is whether the use of antibiotics in food animals has any link to antibiotic resistance in people -- and whether the government is doing enough to find out.

Texas worker contracts Ebola ; 'Breach in protocol' blamed; virus spreads for first time in U.S.

A health care worker who cared for the Ebola patient before he died last week tested positive for the virus, sending health officials scrambling Sunday to find a "breach in protocol" that resulted in her infection.

The woman was among caregivers for Thomas Eric Duncan, who died Wednesday at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. A state test finding that she had Ebola was confirmed Sunday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making it the first known case transmitted in the United States. The caregiver's name was not released.

CDC chief Thomas Frieden said his agency will investigate how a worker in full protective gear contracted the deadly virus. "At some point there was a breach in protocol," he said. President Obama directed that the CDC "investigation into the apparent breach at the Dallas hospital move as expeditiously as possible."

Dallas police officers stood sentry outside the two-story apartment building Sunday in the leafy East Dallas neighborhood where the patient lived as workers cleaned common areas.

"It's scary," said neighbor Lynda Edwards.

City and county officials will be increasing the number of people monitored in Dallas, Rawlings said. At least 19 hospital staffers who dealt with Duncan during his two hospital visits were monitoring themselves for signs of Ebola. Now that group will be closely monitored by the CDC team, which includes taking their temperature twice a day, daily visits by CDC staff and restrictions on their movement, he said.

"I was disappointed but not surprised," Dallas Mayor Rawlings said of the latest case of infection. "The odds were we would have another one."

In Boston, health officials said a man who recently visited Liberia was being assessed Sunday at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for possible Ebola infection. Kenneth Sands, senior vice president at the hospital, said staff would assess the man's symptoms over the next few hours, the Boston Globe reported.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., speaking on CNN's State of the Union, said the U.S. needs "some kind of czar" to take charge of the Ebola response.
