A DOCTOR infected with deadly Ebola virus has refused the only dose of a potentially life-saving serum.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, has insisted the experimental drug goes to missionary Nancy Writebol, who has also caught the virus.

Both Americans are in a "stable but grave" condition after contracting Ebola while treating sufferers in Liberia. Dr Brantly's charity Samaritan's Purse said his condition was getting worse, but he had still demanded that the serum went to Mrs Writebol, 60. Charity head Franklin Graham explained: "Yesterday an experimental serum arrived but there was only enough for one. Dr Brantly asked that it be given to Nancy Writebol."

Another spokesman added: "Even as he battles to survive Ebola, this heroic doctor is still focused on the well-being of others."

The Texan doctor, married with two children, has been given a blood transfusion from an African boy of 14 whose life he helped saved.

VOICE OF THE

IN an era of mass movement of people it is not scaremongering to warn that the Ebola plague will spread.

Globalisation means people travel more regularly to other countries and the most dangerous response would be to shut our eyes and pretend it is just an African problem.

It is in our national interest to help fight the virus in infected regions and invest in research to eradicate what is now a virtual death sentence.

We have some of the world's best scientific minds and Ebola is a challenge we cannot shirk.

Border guards: We can't stop killer bug outbreak in Britain

BORDER guards are not prepared for the arrival of Ebola in Britain, union chiefs warned yesterday.

The Immigration Services Union said that official claims the UK is ready to cope are wide of the mark.

General secretary Lucy Moreton said: "There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility. And until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all."

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has announced precautionary measures, with border staff and health workers said to be on the lookout.

Public Health England has issued guidance on symptoms to watch for.

But the ISU said its members have flooded its phone lines with queries on the correct procedures to take and how to best protect themselves.

Ms Moreton said: "They are concerned it appears Public Health England believe that they have had some form of training on how to recognise the symptoms of Ebola at the border. That simply isn't the case."

She said border guards she has spoken to have no idea about what procedures they should follow.

Ms Moreton added: "They are the first point of contact usually for people coming off an aircraft. The concern is what do they do if they're confronted with someone that doesn't appear well."

Among those most at risk are health workers who have travelled to West Africa to help.

Obstetrician Benjamin Black, 32, of Manchester, has been working 24-hour shifts in Sierra Leone's second largest city Bo, in the Southern Province.

He described operating on pregnant women ill with the virus. He said: "I couldn't believe this was my first shift, on my first mission. I kept thinking I was going to drown in the pressure. The main challenge here is the authorities are overwhelmed."

EBOLA PANIC GROWS€75m response plan to fight outbreak

PANIC grew yesterday as the worst recorded Ebola outbreak in history claimed 729 victims.

In Sierra Leone, president Ernest Bai Koroma vowed to quarantine sick patients at home and have authorities conduct house-to-house searches for others who may have been exposed.

Families have been resisting treatment at isolation centres and some have kept loved ones at home.

His announcement came as neighbouring Liberia also ramped up its efforts to slow the virulent disease's spread, shutting down schools and ordering most public servants to stay home from work.

The US Peace Corps is evacuating hundreds of its volunteers in the affected countries.

Two Peace Corps workers are PROTECTION Health isolation under isolation outside the US after having contact with a person who later died of the Ebola virus, a State Department official said.

Ebola has shown no signs of slowing down particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The World Health Organisation announced 57 new deaths yesterday - 27 in Liberia, 20 in Guinea, nine in Sierra Leone and one in Nigeria.

Among the deaths this week was that of the chief doctor treating Ebola in Sierra Leone.

The government said Dr Sheik Humarr Khan's death was "an irreparable loss of this son of the soil". The 39-year-old was a leading doctor on hemorrhagic fevers in a nation with very few medical resources.

Ebola cases first emerged in the nation of Guinea back in March, and later spread across the borders to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The outbreak is now the largest recorded in world history, and has infected three African capitals with international airports.

Officials are trying to step up screening of passengers, though an American man was able to fly from Liberia to Nigeria, where authorities say he died days later from Ebola.

Ebola has no vaccine and no specific treatment, with a fatality rate of about 60% in this particular out-break.

But experts say the risk of travellers contracting it is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. Ebola cannot be spread like flu through casual contact or breathing the same air.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation is launching a €75million response plan.

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said: "The scale of the Ebola outbreak, and the persistent threat it poses, requires WHO and Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to take the response to a new level."

Scale of the outbreak requires us to take the response to a new level. WHO BOSS MARGARET CHAN YESTERDAY

BRIT DOC

A BRITISH doctor who went to treat Ebola victims in Africa has told how medics put their lives at risk to tackle the virus.

Dr Hannah Spencer, 29, volunteered to work for charity Doctors Without Borders after hearing of the outbreak earlier this year.

Dozens of health workers have died treating Ebola patients and Dr Spencer said more resources were needed. She added: "Every day we'd hear of the numbers of cases going up and up. That makes you feel powerless."

She said she had to will herself to feel safe while wearing a boiling-hot air-sealed Hazmat suit she had to wear while caring for patients.

Dr Spencer said: "It's difficult working in the protective clothing - it's very hot and you can't spend more than an hour inside it.

"So when you've got a large number of patients, it's hard to feel you spend long enough with each one.

With the mask and the goggles and layers of protective clothing, it took much longer than normal to build relationships with patients."

Dr Spencer, from Surrey, said medics lose five litres in sweat during a shift and have to spend two hours rehydrating afterwards.

Medics are allowed to work for only up to six weeks in the field because conditions are so gruelling. They also go through multiple decontamination sessions after they have finished a day's work.

Staff are given a buddy to watch out for symptoms. After Dr Spencer returned to the UK she had to stay within a short driving distance of a hospital in case she discovered that she had been exposed to the disease.

Recalling her time in Foya, Liberia, she said: "One day, four children aged around three and four were brought from another health facility, sick with fever.

"They were from two different families but lived in the same house, where two adult family members had died of the disease. The children arrived in the ambulance accompanied by a mother and an aunt.

"The mother refused to let them out. She didn't believe they had Ebola. She was convinced they had been poisoned. It took an hour to persuade her to leave the ambulance."

HUNT FOR 30,000 EBOLA 'VICTIMS': WORLD ALERT

Search escalated to all in contact with dead man

Ministers play down risk to UK after Cobra meeting

THE hunt for people in contact with deadly Ebola was dramatically escalated last night as the risk of infection spread across the globe like a "giant spider's web".

Initially health officials wanted to trace only a few hundred passengers on two planes which had carried victim Patrick Sawyer, 40.

But - as Cabinet ministers held an emergency Cobra meeting in London - the search was widened to find up to 30,000 people who could be hosting the virus which kills 90% of sufferers.

The list includes anyone at one of four airports visited by American dad-of-three Sawyer, and those in contact with him in Nigeria's capital Lagos, home to 17 million, where he died five days ago.

Mike Noyes, of Action Aid, said: "This is the worst Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen. The most worrying thing is not just the numbers of people dying, but how long it is going on for.

"Most outbreaks last six weeks to two months. This one began in February and is speeding up."

"If anyone could answer the question 'Why?', we might be able to stop it. Instead, the reach of the spider web of infection is growing."

Nigeria's Special Advisor on Public Health Dr Yewande Adeshina said: "We're actually looking at contacting over 30,000 people."

A total of 672 have so far been killed in the outbreak which has spread across four borders in Western Africa. A team of public health experts plus £2million in emergency aid have been sent to the region by the UK.

Several airlines have now stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone over concerns about the spread of the disease from Guinea.

Global medical charity Doctors Without Borders has warned the crisis is "unprecedented, absolutely out of control". Bart Janssens, the charity's director of operations, warned there was no overarching vision of how to tackle Ebola.

He said: "This epidemic can only get worse, because it is still spreading in some key hotspots.

"We are extremely worried by the turn of events, particularly where there is a lack of visibility of the epidemic. If the situation does not improve quickly, there is a risk of new countries being affected.

"It is difficult to predict, because we have never known such an epidemic."

An isolation unit for Ebola victims in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, had become overrun last night and patients had to be treated in their homes. Dozens of local health workers have died treating patients.

Every school in Liberia shut yesterday and public events carrying a risk of passing the virus, including football matches, were cancelled.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired the Cobra meeting said the NHS could cope with any threat posed by the virus.

Ministers discussed measures to be taken if any UK nationals in West Africa became infected.

He said the threat to the UK came from someone contracting the disease abroad and only becoming unwell in this country.

Earlier this month Public Health England issued an alert to UK doctors to be aware of Ebola.

But Mr Hammond confirmed the disease had not yet "directly" affected Britain.

He added: "In terms of the UK, the issue is not about the disease spreading in the UK because we have frankly different standards of infection control that would make that most unlikely. We do not think that this is an issue affecting the UK directly."

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was also at the meeting, said the experience of NHS staff meant "the risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower".

He added: "We are looking at our capability but we are very confident we have very good people in the NHS, very experienced people, who will be ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive."

The Department of Health yesterday confirmed a test for Ebola on a man in Birmingham was negative. Another man visiting London's Charing Cross Hospital was also given the all clear.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Poc Public Health England, said the outbreak was "clearly not yet under control" in West Africa.

He added: "The risk to UK travellers and people working in affected countries of contracting Ebola is low but we have alerted UK practitioners about the situation in West Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the area."

Since the outbreak began in February, some people looking after the sick and carrying out burials, could have helped to spread the virus.

Fears of the global spread were raised after two Patrick Sawyer was allowed on two ASKY Airlines flights on July 20.

Despite vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, he was allowed to get on a plane in Liberia, stop over in Ghana, change planes in Togo and then fly on to Nigeria.

The Liberian government official - whose sister was killed by the virus just before he set off - eventually died five days after arriving in Lagos.

He had planned to return home to Minnesota in August for two of his three daughters' birthdays His wife Decontee said: "My girls will never get to know their father. People think Ebola is a problem on the other side of the world.

"But Patrick could've easily come home with the virus."

A Department of Health spokeswoman said yesterday: "Any patients with suspected symptoms can be diagnosed within 24 hours and they would also be isolated at a dedicated unit to keep the public safe. Our staff are also working with the World Health Organisation to tackle the outbreak in Africa."

Health campaigners yesterday called on US authorities to speed up approval of a new drug TKM-Ebola hoped to be the first effective measure against the virus, passed by human contact.

How disease has began to spread

Q WHAT is Ebola?

A Ebola is one of the world's deadliest diseases. Up to 90% of cases result in death.

Q WHERE does it occur?

A Outbreaks are mainly in remote villages in central and west Africa. The most recent outbreak stretches across four countries - Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

Q WHEN did Ebola first appear?

A It was first recorded in two simultaneous outbreaks in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the Ebola river.

Q HOW does the disease spread?

A It is passed on as a result of direct contact with an infected person's blood, organs or other bodily fluids. Health care workers are most at risk. Burial ceremonies at which mourners have contact with a body contribute to it spreading.

Q WHAT are the symptoms?

A Patients are often overcome by a sudden fever, weakness, muscle pain and headaches. Vomiting, diarrhoea, kidney and liver problems and rashes follow. The time between infection and the onset of symptoms ranges from two days to three weeks. There is no vaccine or cure.

Q Is this the worst ever Ebola outbreak?

A Yes. Latest figures show 672 people have died of it since February, compared to 280 in 1976.

Q HOW did the virus emerge?

A Pteropodidae fruit bats are thought to be the natural hosts. Documented cases have included transmission after also handling chimps, gorillas, monkeys and porcupines.

Health chiefs last night confirmed the last time new measures were put in place was earlier this year, despite warnings the disease has since spread on international flights.

Earlier this week a senior doctor warned of the threat the disease posed to Ireland.

Dr Graham Fry, of the Tropical Medicine Bureau, told the Irish Mirror there was a real risk the "horrific" disease that "dissolves" human flesh could arrive at ports.

An HSE spokesman said: "Ireland is well equipped and its doctors and nurses supplied with specialist knowledge to deal with a case effectively in the unlikely event of such a case appearing in Ireland."

Fears infected flyer has started world spread

DOCTORS fear Ebola victim Patrick Sawyer may have sparked a worldwide spread of the killer disease after being allowed on two flights while infected.

And last night a desperate race was on to find dozens of passengers who flew on the same jets as the 40-year-old American.

Doctors and border officials have been warned to be on the lookout for people showing signs of the disease.

Mr Sawyer was allowed to board an ASKY Airlines flight in Liberia, where Ebola is rife, despite vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea. His sister recently died from the virus.

He had a stopover in Ghana then changed planes in Togo and flew to the international travel hub of Lagos in Nigeria. The dad-of-three died five days after arriving in the city.

Lancaster University virologist Derek Gatherer said passengers, crew and airport ground staff who came into contact with Mr Sawyer could be in "pretty serious danger". Ebola is fatal in 90% of cases.

SYMPTOMS Doctors have identified 59 people who were near him and have tested 20. But they are scrambling to reach everyone he may have had contact with since he contracted the disease.

They could have flown to anywhere in the world from Lagos.

There were questions yesterday over how Liberian government worker Mr Sawyer was let on flights while clearly showing symptoms of Ebola - which has killed 672 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone since breaking out in February.

Doctors around the world have been advised to "remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area".

Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea, fever, weakness, headache and sore throat.

Those struck down can also suffer internal and external bleeding.

The virus is spread through human contact. There is no cure.

Global health expert Dr Brian McCloskey described the Ebola outbreak as the most "acute emergency" facing international health agencies.

He added: "When these things start to escalate we work with everybody to ensure they are aware of what needs to happen."

Last night, it emerged one of Sierra Leone's top doctors, Sheik Umar Khan - who has treated more than 100 Ebola patients - had died from the disease.

ASKY airline, which operates from West Africa, said it was halting flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone because of the crisis.

And Liberian football chiefs banned all games in a bid to stop Ebola spreading.

His grieving widow Decontee said his death should act as a wake-up call as to how easily the virus could become a global problem. She added: "Patrick could have easily come home with Ebola. Easy. Easy. It's close, it's at our front door. It knocked down my front door."

AS the Ebola death toll rises, here are some other diseases you do not want to catch.

NAEGLERIA FOWLERI: A brain-eating amoeba found in fresh water lakes or springs that can kill unsuspecting swimmers. The warmer the weather, the more it multiplies. Symptoms include seizures shortly followed by coma and death in 97% of cases.

RABIES: Passed on by the bite of an infected animal, most often a dog. Left untreated, it attacks the nervous system and usually kills. Advanced symptoms include delirium, hallucinations and raging, violent behaviour. NECROTIZING FASCIITIS: A flesh-eating bacteria usually caused by naturally occurring skin flora. Onset is sudden and it can only be cured by intravenous antibiotics and surgery on infected tissue. Early symptom is intense skin pain, usually around a cut or scratch. CHOLERA: Cholera is one of the most rapid killers known. Untreated, a previously healthy person can die in two hours. Transmitted in infected water or food, it causes severe diarrhoea, fever and delirium.

SARS: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is caused by an airborne virus. Early symptoms include fever, lethargy and sore throat. In eight months in 2003, an outbreak in southern China killed 775 people. MAD COW DISEASE: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is an infection in cows which is passed on to meat eaters as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (VCJD). It causes serious neurological degeneration with symptoms including dementia, loss of muscle control before death. LEPROSY: Contrary to popular belief, leprosy does not cause limbs to drop off. It is passed on through nose and mouth droplets. Symptoms include a reduced ability to feel pain, sores, muscle weakness and poor eyesight. Left untreated this bacterial infection can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.

A DOCTOR who treats patients with the Ebola virus is "terrified" after catching the disease himself.

US medic Kent Brantly, 33, fell ill despite wearing full protective gear. He wrote in an email to a former colleague in Texas: "I'm praying fervently God will help me survive this disease."

Dr Brantly is being treated in an isolation unit in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. He moved to the country in October to work with a Christian group.

Wife Amber and their two young children had returned to the US for a trip last week before he found out about his condition. They have shown no signs of the highly contagious viral infection.

His proud mother Jan, 72, said: "Kent prepared to be a lifetime medical missionary. His heart is in Africa."

Is killer virus on way to the UK?

EBOLA IS WORSE THAN ANTHRAX & HAS NO CURE

A fast-spreading virus that liquifies internal organs and kills six in 10 victims. Ebola is the stuff of nightmares - and horror movies.

British acadmics have even talked about it being responsible for the Black Death plague epidemics of the Middle Ages which killed millions across Europe and Asia.

Now doctors across the UK have been sent letters warning them to to lookout for Ebola Hemmorrhagic Fever, one of the most deadly and infectious diseases in the world.

It has killed hundreds in the world's worst outbreak. Experts now fear it could spread beyond the borders of West Africa. More than 1,200 people have caught the virus and over 670 in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have died as a result.

On Friday a man died after flying 1,000 miles from Liberia to Nigeria, heightening concerns international air travel could speed up its spread. And experts admit the virus could find its way to Britain.

Cambridge University's Dr Peter Walsh, a lecturer in archaeology and anthropology and Ebola expert, says: "It's possible someone infected will fly to Heathrow having infected other people sitting next to them or by using the toilet.

"This strain of Ebola is probably the second most deadly virus in the world after canine rabies. If you get canine rabies, you're going to die, but we also have vaccines for that.

"This is worse than anthrax, but there are vaccines and treatments for anthrax, too."

There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola. Even the frontline doctors have started falling victim to the disease they are trying to treat.

Last week a Liberian medic, Dr Samuel Brisbane, died after contracting the disease and Kent Brantly, a US doctor from a medical charity working in the region, has fallen ill with the disease. The infection, spread via bodily fluids, begins with symptoms including a fever and sore throat then develops to vomiting, diarrhoea and profuse internal and external bleeding.

Victims may die of multi-organ failure within days of first contact with the bug. Some strains can kill up to 90% of sufferers.

But Dr Walsh says any cases that reached Britain would be far more manageable. He says: "Ebola is pretty containable with modern methods in modern countries. You won't see a major outbreak in the UK." But, as a precaution, British doctors have been sent letters from the Government's Public Health England telling them to watch for anyone with strange illnesses who have travelled in West Africa.

The body deals with potential outbreaks and Dr Brian McCloskey, its director of global health, said: "There is the recognition this is a problem that is not under control… At the moment its preparatory thinking rather than alarm."

PHE also has a phone line telling doctors what tests to do on patients who may have symptoms.

The disease was first documented in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, and was named after the river that runs through the country.

It is known to be carried by bats but usually only affects people, and primates such as monkeys, living near the creatures on the edge of the tropical rainforests.

Although conspiracy theorists will tell you that Ebola - along with Aids - was man-made, developed in a lab as a weapon by the CIA and tested in Africa, where it escaped into the wild.

However ludicrous this sounds, Dr Walsh believes the virus does have huge potential as a weapon.

He says: "The bio-terror people are worried about somebody weaponising Ebola and being able to deliver it in an aerosol form.

"In that case it could be seriously nasty, because it would be just as deadly - but this way they'd have a means to really spread it."

The first report of the current Ebola outbreak was in south-east Guinea in February, and infections levels steadily grew.

These are the first cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

INFECTED Location of Ebola cases

Health experts from the World Health Organissation are trying to educate Africans on the dangers of burial rites, such as touching and washing dead bodies, which may increase the spread of the disease.

Efforts to contain Ebola have also been hampered in areas of Sierra Leone where a distrust of Western medicine and belief in faith healers have seen locals ignore attempts at isolating infected patients.

Dr Walsh believes medics should start using vaccines for Ebola even though they are in the early stages of development.

He says: "They haven't been licensed for human use but they work very well on lab monkeys.

"If we have the " te sawda technology to save these people why aren't we doing it? The answer is that it's Africa."

DEADLY VIRUS COULD SPREAD TO IRELAND

THE deadly Ebola virus sweeping across parts of Africa could reach Irish shores, a leading doctor has warned.

Dr Graham Fry, founder of the Tropical Medical Bureau, said infected people could easily board flights bound for Ireland and spread the disease that "dissolves" internal organs from the inside.

He warned the results could be horrific as the virus has a 60%-90% death rate.

Dr Fry, who also lectures in tropical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, added: "The real problem is with international flights and how easy it is to travel.

"The incubation period of the virus is three or four days."

He said this means by the time symptoms have started to show carriers could have spread Ebola to other passengers and anyone they came into close contact with on the ground.

Once infected little can be done other than treat their horrifying symptoms.

Dr Fry told how the disease "dissolves" people. He added: "It's like swallowing a bottle of bleach.

"All of your internal organs begin to ooze and you dissolve from the inside out." The World Health Organisation has branded the outbreak in Africa as the largest ever recorded, with around 700 confirmed deaths so far.

It started to spread in the African nation of Guinea in February, before moving to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Over the weekend it was confirmed the virus has also spread to Nigeria through a passenger on a flight from Liberia.

Medical workers including an American doctor have been struck down with the disease as the battle to contain it continues.

The Foreign Affairs Department has issued travel warnings for the affected countries but Dr Fry said this didn't stop people flying in or spreading the virus to passengers on connecting flights.

He added the consequences of further outbreaks were terrifying. Dr Fry said: "This is one of the most horrific viral infections known to mankind.

"Despite the fact that it's been around for decades and a vast amount of research, not much is known about it or how to fight it at its source.

"The SARS outbreak killed 10% of people who got infected. This is hugely worse."

ORGANS 'DISSOLVE'

The Ebola virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and can be spread from human to human through close physical contact, particularly through bodily fluids.

The symptoms include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. Vomiting, diarrhoea, rashes, malfunctioning kidney and liver and bleeding soon follow as the disease "dissolves" internal organs.

There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment available for people or animals.

AN American doctor who works for a medical charity in Africa has tested positive for the Ebola virus.

Kent Brantly, 33, who moved to Liberia with his family in October, is being treated at an isolation centre in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.

His wife and two children were in America when he fell ill with the disease, which is feared to have killed 672 people in West Africa in the deadliest outbreak on record. Ebola has no known cure and leads to organ failure.

Dr Brantly's work as medical director for Samaritan's Purse required him to work in an isolation unit. An ex-colleague from Texas, Robert Earley, said: "This is the kind of individual he is. They go into the worst situations and try to save lives."

Last week Nigeria confirmed its first Ebola case when Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance, died after flying into Lagos.

Heading Liberia's Ebola efforts, Dr Lance Plyler, said screening passengers may help stop Ebola's spread but "initial signs imitate other diseases like malaria".

Nations hit by the deadly bug include Guinea and Liberia.

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the epidemic has reached crisis point and is urging people to heed WHO guidelines.

The WHO said it believed cultural factors were contributing to the spread of Ebola in the region.

Mistrust is driving dozens of victims to evade treatment, frustrating doctors trying to contain the virus.

London Mining took the decision after five deaths in the west African country since last week.

Fears grew that the virus, fatal for up to 90% of victims, could spread fast after some families took victims from a rural clinic so they could have traditional remedies.

Ebola, highly contagious and causing internal bleeding and vomiting, has killed 100 in Guinea where the outbreak began.

Flat on my back from coffin' and taking the water

This week I've not been well. I haven't been flat on my back for this long since they released all five seasons of The Wire on DVD. Worse still, after two weeks in bed with a chest infection, I've got flat hair syndrome.

It started over Easter, so I didn't have access to the doctor for antibiotics and the usual lecture on how they probably won't work and we're all going to hell in a handcart of drug-resistant infections.

This meant I had a coughing fit so violent, I damaged my back. As I only had a wine bottle cooler as an ice pack and Jesse's teddy bear hot water bottle to apply heat, I ended up with teddy's face imprinted in my bottom, and the words "Just chillin" frosted into my back.

It's also been tough on Jesse. Thankfully her auntie Joce moved in. If she hadn't, Jesse could have ended up in the workhouse. Actually, there's been lots of people dropping in - some to help, some just to stare.

One in particular, Jesse's godmother Ali, came to deliver a prescription. Sitting on the edge of the bed, sending toast crumbs flying everywhere, she pointed at my empties (San Pellegrino now that gin is on ice): "Blimey old bird," she brayed, "talk about taking the waters. After all those bottles of fizzy water you should be on the approved list of miracles."

My mum came to dispense food and wisdom. Well, one out of two is OK. Seeing the Ventolin inhaler on my table, she sniffed: "You don't have asthma."

"Mum, a chronic disease like asthma is not due to genetics," I explained.

"Well there's nothing of that sort in my family. Or heart problems," she huffed.

"Amazing, really, how they all died so young!" I snorted, sparking a 10-minute coughing fit.

Spotting Lola lying on my bed, she changed tack. "Cats have amazing healing qualities, you know." This was said with the air of someone who feeds quinoa to hers.

"Who? Nurse Ebola, as I call her now," I croaked. "She's just waiting for me to die so she can eat me."

When I finally got to the GP, it became clear why there was a lack of urgency in my treatment. My new practice can't access my records due to incompatible computer systems - the records that show I had pneumonia last year. Don't be surprised if my gravestone reads "Here she lies, because they couldn't access her files".

EASTER REFLECTIONS HERE & ABROAD

ALMOST 150,000 people flocked to the Vatican yesterday as Pope Francis celebrated Easter Sunday mass.

The Pontiff called for calm and peace in the Ukraine as he delivered his second Easter sermon as Pope.

Catholics young and old, in the city for Christianity's most joyous and hopeful day, watched as he celebrated Mass on a n altar set up under a canopy on the steps of the St Peter's Basilica.

People overflowed from the huge square, which had been decked out with rows of potted daffodils and large bunches of white roses.

Mass-goers included followers from the Pope's native Argentina - who waved the country's flag - while other flags on display included ones from Brazil, Mexico, Britain, Poland and many other countries.

Pope Francis noted this year the Catholic Church's celebration of Easter coincided with that of Orthodox churches, which have many followers in Ukraine.

He offered prayers for peace in Ukraine, Syria and Nigeria.

Pope Francis said: "We ask you to enlighten and inspire the initiatives that promote peace in Ukraine, so that all those involved, with the support of the international community, will make every effort to prevent violence." Tensions between pro-Russian supporters in the country and those loyal to the interim government in Kiev have sparked bloodshed there in recent days.

The Pope also prayed all sides in the Syrian conflict will be moved to "boldly negotiate the peace that is long-awaited and long-overdue".

Since March 2011, it has been racked by a civil war that has cost 150,000 lives and forced millions to flee the country.

Next month Francis will make a pilgrimage to Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Israel.

The Pope said he prayed that the hopes sparked by the resumption of Middle East peace negotiations be sustained.

He also recalled those suffering in Africa from an outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease and also urged a halt to what he called "brutal terrorist attacks" in parts of Nigeria.

In the English language version of his speech, Francis declared: "Love is more powerful, love gives life, love makes hope blossom in the wilderness. With this in our hearts, we turn to you, risen Lord."

Francis also called for an end to hunger, which is aggravated by the immense wastefulness for which we are often responsible.

He added: "Help us Lord to protect the vulnerable, especially children, women and the elderly, who are exploited and abandoned.

"And comfort all those who cannot spend Easter with their loved ones because they have been torn from their affections, like the many persons, priests and laity who have been kidnapped."

diary of a single mum

The prospect of a Cinderella Law recently prompted a ripple of excitement in our house when Jesse got the wrong end of the stick. "No," I told her, "it doesn't mean going to a ball will now be a legal requirement. It's a law to stop parents emotionally neglecting their children.

"Anyway, I've got work to do, so consider yourself neglected for a few hours. If you manage to avoid setting fire to the ball gown you're wearing, I'll take you for a kiddie manicure this afternoon."

Neglect, bribery and light-hearted mockery - the usual parenting tools available to a busy mum over the Easter holidays. I don't want to add lawbreaking to that list but, if an offence of emotional cruelty to children is created, I'll be thrown in the slammer.

If the NSPCC says making fun of a child could be defined as abuse, half the joy of family life will be removed, along with most parents.

That includes my mother, whom I fully intend to grass up for making me wear that disgusting brown and cream hand-knitted sailor top in the 70s. I gained two stone when it rained on my way to school, as I never fail to remind my therapist.

I expect Jesse to harbour such vengeful feelings, especially as her new nickname is Poo Poorri after I caught her throwing handfuls of pot pourri down the loo because I told her it made it smell nice.

Now she's embarrassed - and hates her new name - but I fully intend to bring it up at every family occasion, possibly even her own wedding. That's if I get day release from jail.

I'd love to write more but I have to go and lob a few dry crackers at my daughter before she passes out from not snacking every hour.

I don't expect the TV remote to be anything less than red hot from overuse these holidays, but at least I know next week's column is in the bag as it's already cost me a set of Hello Kitty perfumes.

Apparently, the five mini scents are based on "Hello Kitty's favourite smells", one of which must be "baby vom after eating violet creams". While I was neglecting Jesse, she managed to drench the cat in the stuff and now Lola is called Ebola, because she has to be avoided like the plague.

I expect the RSPCA will have something to say about that, too.

Borders closed as death toll hits 83 in 'the worst outbreak ever'

AN outbreak of ebola in West Africa has reached unprecedented levels, aid workers warned yesterday.

Up to 83 people have been killed by the deadly virus in Guinea, while it has also spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Senegal reacted to the threat by closing its border with Guinea, while other neighbours have imposed travel restrictions. Mariano Lugli, of aid group Medecins San Frontieres, said: "We're facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases. This geographical spread is worrisome as it will complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic."

A six-week delay in identifying the disease - which can kill 90% of victims - means it has spread from remote locations to populated areas such as Guinean capital Conakry. There were also fears it was creeping towards the country's airport.

Guinea's president Alpha Conde said: "My government and I are very worried."

There have been 83 deaths in Guinea from 122 suspected cases since January.

Sierra Leone has reported five suspected cases while Liberia recorded four deaths from seven confirmed cases.

EBOLA is a deadly haemorrhagic fever spread through contact with infected animals such as monkeys or human body fluids. It causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and other orifices.

Victims can suffer swelling of the eyes and genitals and fall into a coma. There is no cure or vaccine for ebola, which is caused by one of four viruses. It kills up to 90% of patients.

It was first identified in Sudan and Zaire in 1976 when it infected 318 people and claimed the lives of 280.
