Prime Minister Tony Abbott has lauded Australia's "lead-by-example" approach, listing four challenges facing the world - but conspicuously leaving out climate change - in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Mr Abbott spoke of what he called "darkening times" facing the world, listing in particular the "murderous rage" of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq; Russian "aggression" in Ukraine; the Ebola crisis in West Africa and a stubbornly flatlining global economy. Climate change by contrast, was mentioned only in the context of being easier to fix once higher economic growth is achieved.

He said Australians had "never believed we can save the world single-handedly, [but] nor have we shrunk from shouldering our responsibilities".

However, when it came to his naming government priorities to support his arguments, he nominated scrapping the carbon price as his number one example.

This was despite an apparently emerging global consensus in favour of tough new co-ordinated action to cut emissions, and despite the fact that US President Barack Obama had opened the climate summit by warning that climate change, ahead of terrorism, was the "urgent and growing" existential threat to the world in the longer term.

In his General Assembly address, Mr Abbott offered a different perspective.

"Rather than preaching, we're trying to lead by example," Mr Abbott told the mostly empty UN General Assembly chamber. "Australia has abolished the carbon tax, abolished the mining tax, provided environmental approvals for $800 billion worth of new projects and begun the task of eliminating our budget deficit within four years."

The mostly pedestrian speech covered off the main areas of concern to Australia including pre-G20 agenda-setting to emphasise the need for countries to build their economies up through structural efficiencies, freer trade, and targeted investment in economic infrastructure.

"Our G20 goal is to boost output by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years to create millions of jobs and to generate trillions in wealth right around the world," he said.

"Likewise the post-2015 Development Agenda should focus on economic growth because growth makes every other social goal, even tackling climate change, easier to accomplish.

"To people who don't know where their next meal is coming from, talk of economic growth can seem ignorant or indulgent, but economic growth is really just economists' shorthand for more jobs, higher pay, new industries, and the better life that only greater wealth can provide."

Australia has jumped from the vanguard of developed nations battling climate change, and is now an international pariah on the issue. As the Marshall Islands Foreign Minister, Tony de Brum, had reason to note this week, Australia's "backsliding" on climate change does not make sense and "goes against the grain of the world".

The Abbott government says it plans to spend $2.55 billion on an emissions reduction fund and that, like the previous Rudd/Gillard government, it is committed to reducing Australia's emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. In that context, Tony Abbott's decision not to attend this week's United Nations Climate Summit was wrong. The Prime Minister should have joined the 120 leaders at the summit in New York to discuss the best ways to work together to tackle climate change. He may have learnt something.

Instead, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was assigned the task. She sought to gloss over Australia's new-found recalcitrance on the issue. It was a dereliction of international leadership from Australia, all the more noticeable because on so many other matters the Abbott government has represented the nation well on the global stage. Mr Abbott and Ms Bishop have displayed admirable leadership with regard to the MH17 air disaster, the continuing conflict in Ukraine and the refocused challenge of Islamist terrorism. So why go missing from the climate summit?

Even if Mr Abbott still believes the science of climate change is "absolute crap", as he reportedly once quipped in 2009, most of the rest of the globe takes the threat seriously. US President Barack Obama, who is co-ordinating a new military campaign in the Middle East, responding to the Ebola outbreak in Africa and facing congressional elections in weeks, thought the climate summit important enough to attend. In his speech, Mr Obama acknowledged those other challenges - terrorism, instability, inequality, disease - but nominated climate change as the "one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other". The President declared that "nobody can stand on the sidelines any more". Mr Abbott should heed the call.

Taking an almost hostile attitude to combating climate change will have ramifications for Australia far beyond the damage caused to our international reputation. While other countries are gearing their economies towards a low-emissions future, innovating and developing technologies to support domestic and international markets, Australia, it seems, will be planting trees and cleaning up tips. In the same week that Ms Bishop was at the UN summit seeking to persuade the world that Australia really was committed to the task, Trade Minister Andrew Robb was celebrating Victoria's brown coal industry at a mining conference in Melbourne. The world is moving in an opposite direction to the Abbott government and this is dangerous for Australia's economic and environmental future.

Australia is now famous for being one of the few jurisdictions in the world to have removed a price on carbon, but at some point we will need to rejoin the rest of the world in tackling climate change. The danger is that when that happens, we will be poorly prepared because our industry will have reduced research and innovation focused on low energy use and renewable energy sources.

Human-induced climate change is an existential threat. Rather than arranging his diary so that he missed the UN summit, Mr Abbott should have remembered his words from earlier in the year: "We have only got one planet and we should pass it on to our children and grandchildren in at least as good shape as we found it."

Geneva: The number of Ebola infections will triple to 20,000 by November if efforts are not significantly stepped up to stop the outbreak, the World Health Organisation said. The current outbreak in West Africa has claimed more than 2800 lives and infected more than 5800 people. A study by the organisation forecasts that if no significant action is taken, the number of confirmed and probable cases by November 2 "will be 5925 in Guinea, 9939 in Liberia and 5063 in Sierra Leone".

Victoria has passed its first test of dealing with an Ebola scare, the government and health authorities say.

Last Friday, a toddler was suspected of having the deadly disease, which activated the state's response plan for Ebola. But tests at the Royal Children's Hospital proved negative.

A one-year-old child from West Africa, who had returned to Australia early last week, was tested for the disease at the children's hospital after being initially treated at Frankston Hospital with diarrhoea-like symptoms on Friday night.

Chief medical officer at the children's hospital Dr Peter McDougall said the system - including placing the child into isolation and ensuring staff were well protected - had worked well.

"We have a very careful plan in place for managing a child with suspected Ebola virus," he said.

"The teamwork was wonderful."

The testing, which involves blood tests and a throat swab, only takes four hours.

Health Minister David Davis said it was Victoria's first Ebola scare.

A moral failure in fighting Ebola

For many months, the world's most respected aid agencies have warned in the strongest possible terms that the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus in western Africa could escalate into a devastating health crisis. It is now much worse. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says it has become a full-blown emergency.

The governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which struggle anyway to deliver public services, have been overwhelmed by the multiple and complex demands of this disease. They lack disease-containment facilities, proper sanitation, protection equipment and staff with the expertise to deal with the escalating number of victims.

The World Health Organisation says the number of victims is increasing exponentially in Liberia. Almost 5000 cases have been identified - double the number of three weeks ago - and about 2500 have died. Early estimates that it might affect 20,000 people are considered overly optimistic, with the WHO now hoping there will be not hundreds of thousands of victims. That hope, however, is predicated on there being an immediate and properly co-ordinated international effort.

The WHO says this health crisis is "unparalleled in modern times", and the United Nations warns it may prove to be an economic and social crisis, too. While Ebola has not yet taken a firm hold in major urban centres in the affected countries, efforts to limit its spread, by putting in place roadblocks or isolating communities, for example, have disrupted the flow of goods - and that, potentially, will damage economies.

Medecins sans Frontieres, which laments the consummate failure of the richest and most capable countries to assist western Africa in this crisis, is correct when it says money alone won't fix the problem. Other nations must deploy people with all sorts of expertise if there is to be any hope of stemming the outbreak. Disease containment and health support infrastructure in the region is rudimentary. Many Ebola victims are still living in their communities or are being cared for at home; they have not been quarantined and, as a result, the disease is spreading further. While $US100 million ($A110.6 million) might have been sufficient a few weeks ago, the UN and WHO expect the effort will now cost closer to $US1 billion. Only $US300 million has been promised so far.

The United States, whose military forces boast a highly sophisticated logistics-deployment capability, has agreed to send 3000 military personnel to Liberia to construct disease treatment centres and train health care workers. US President Barack Obama unabashedly explained the effort in terms of US self-interest. He argued Ebola presented a "threat to global security" because it could lead to economic collapse in western Africa, and "that has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease". The world is looking to the US for action, he said. "And it's a responsibility that we embrace." A little belatedly, we say.

The Abbott government, which was eager to promise Australian military support to the US-led effort against militants in Iraq, has pledged $8 million to the fight against Ebola. Australia could be so much more generous with funding and medical expertise.

Maybe those in the Western world who could have made a difference were too distracted by events in Iraq and Ukraine, or by domestic political squabbles and economic stresses. Or perhaps the spread of this rarely-seen virus, from countries that struggle to rate a mention in dispatches, was considered only a remote risk to Western countries and, therefore, not a matter of urgency. Either way, there has been a woeful complacency that exposes a moral failure. The lack of action may have dire consequences. It all depends how swiftly and effectively Ebola is controlled from now.

Liberia

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has appealed to US President Barack Obama for urgent aid in tackling the worst recorded outbreak of the Ebola virus, saying that without it her country would lose the fight against the disease.

The outbreak, which was discovered in March, has now killed more than 2400 people mostly in Liberia, neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone, as understaffed and poorly resourced west African healthcare systems have been overrun.

The World Health Organisation has warned that the epidemic is spreading exponentially in Liberia, where more than half of the deaths have been recorded.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has set up several treatment centres in the affected countries but has also repeatedly warned it has reached the limits of its capacity and appealed for foreign governments to intervene.

In a letter dated September 9 seen by Reuters, Ms Johnson Sirleaf appealed to Mr Obama to build and operate at least one Ebola treatment unit in the capital Monrovia, saying that US civilian and military teams had experience in dealing with biological hazards.

With the Liberian government due to open a 100-bed treatment centre and MSF scaling up its Ebola facility in Monrovia to 400 beds, Ms Johnson Sirleaf said there was still a shortfall of 1000 beds in the capital.

The US government has committed around $US100 million to tackle the outbreak by providing protective equipment for healthcare workers, food, water, medical and hygiene equipment.

On Friday, Cuba said it would deploy 165 medical personnel to Sierra Leone next month.

Ebola alerts reveal global gap in medical aid

Several suspected cases of Ebola have presented at Australian hospitals since the virus took hold in west Africa, including one in Wagga Wagga last month, but all were tested negative before panic broke out.

All that changed on Thursday when a 27-year-old man presented at Gold Coast Hospital with Ebola-like symptoms and the health system went into full alert. Michael Walsh became the centre of widespread fears that the virus had reached Australian shores within days of his return from the Congo.

His case also illustrated the fundamental force driving the Ebola crisis: not the infectiousness of the virus itself but the sharp split between the medical help available to the (largely unaffected) West, and those who need it most.

In the single day Mr Walsh lay in his Gold Coast hospital bed, roughly 50 Ebola victims would have died across the affected areas of Africa, if trends reported this week by the World Health Organisation continued.

Research published on Friday in the online medical journal eLife found there are currently 22 million people living in areas of Africa where environmental patterns and animal movements could allow the virus to spread, particularly in poorer areas where the consumption of bush meat is more common.

Mr Walsh was arrested for trespassing on Wednesday night and spent four hours in police custody before mentioning he felt unwell. It was then the Gold Coast Bulletin overheard on their ambulance tracking system that a suspected Ebola patient was en route to hospital.

Pandemonium ensued. By the time the hospital's head of infectious diseases, John Gerrard, reviewed the patient, television cameras were stationed outside.

Dr Gerrard's told the waiting press it was "exceedingly unlikely" the patient had been infected with Ebola.

But the anxiety continued. Reports on social media suggested people were cancelling their holidays to Queensland, and pulling their children out of school.

In the afternoon, Queensland's chief Health Officer, Jeanette Young, issued a call for calm.

NSW virologists said suspected cases cropped up occasionally. A woman presented at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital's emergency department with a fever last month after travelling to west Africa, and she was immediately isolated, but diagnosed with malaria within 45 minutes.

Guidelines for the containment of infectious diseases were drawn up after the SARS outbreak and updated about a month ago.

Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, of the University of Sydney's Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, said his research, published on Thursday in The Medical Journal of Australia, found that the risk of Ebola spreading here was small.

"Ebola isn't easily transmissible," he said. "With Ebola, good fluid management and good intensive care goes a long way.

"We wouldn't see mortality rates like we're seeing in Africa. In Africa, part of the problem is they don't have the infrastructure to treat it."

Organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres have called with increasingly desperate voices for the basic tools they need to help them treat, and contain, the virus.

University of Sydney virologist Eddie Holmes will present research next week that claims a pandemic is inevitable and we need a central centre for infectious diseases to co-ordinate an efficient response.

"A dangerous strain of flu can just get everywhere so quickly," Professor Holmes said.

"I think the assumption has been that distance protects us. That's correct for a disease like Ebola, but for a respiratory pandemic like SARS or flu that's just wrong."

Staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital have been running drills to prepare for an Ebola case in the unlikely event that the frightening disease reaches Victoria.

The hospital has isolation rooms and protective equipment ready for trained staff to treat patients suspected of carrying the fatal virus, which is spreading rapidly in West Africa.

It is understood that infectious disease experts at the hospital are on standby, and that if the hospital receives a case, specialist staff would have to enter and exit treatment areas through shower rooms, and all laboratory clothing and materials would be decontaminated to prevent spread of the disease.

A hospital spokeswoman confirmed it had been appointed the state's "receiving centre" in the event of a suspected case.

"We've been working to ensure relevant staff are fully trained and processes are in place to ensure the safety of staff, other patients and the community," she said.

No confirmed cases of Ebola have been reported in Australia, but on Thursday Queensland doctors were caring for a man who recently returned from Africa and had some symptoms of the disease.

After examining the man, Gold Coast Health's head of infectious diseases, John Gerrard, said it was "exceedingly unlikely" the 27-year-old had the virus.

"We now believe the chance he has Ebola virus disease is extremely small. However, we are managing him in accordance with national and state protocols," Dr Gerrard said.

ISIL, Ukraine? No, Australia can truly punch above its weight by tackling Ebola.

Australia is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. That is because Australia is a long way from the North Atlantic.

That did not deter the Prime Minister from offering the Ukrainian government military support and military advice in its struggle with Russian-backed separatists.

What vital Australian interests are at stake in Ukraine has not been explained. What useful military advice Australia has to offer has not been spelled out.

Tony Abbott has been equally eager - pantingly eager, it must be said - to join a new coalition, put together by US President Barack Obama at NATO's recent summit in Wales, to "degrade and destroy" the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

None of the 10 nations that have so far joined the coalition is willing to commit ground forces. The degradation of ISIL will be carried out from the air. How that will be done without risking massive casualties among the long-suffering civilians of northern Iraq and eastern Syria has not been clarified.

But we are assured it must be done. ISIL poses a real threat to Australia's own security, because, like a virus, its ideology will be carried home by those deluded Australians who have volunteered to fight in its ranks. Terrorism and jihad will return to our shores.

That is less likely to happen, it seems, if Australia joins in the aerial bombardment of northern Iraq. Even though, as Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop confusingly told us over the weekend, ISIL cannot be destroyed. As the Americans say, go figure.

Meanwhile, there is another deadly virus loose in the world. A real virus that poses, I would have thought, at least as serious a threat as the jihadists of ISIL to the health and security of Australians - and the citizens of every other nation on Earth.

On September 2 - just two days before the leaders of 28 of the world's wealthiest and most militarily powerful nations met in Wales - the president of Medecins Sans Frontieres International made a desperate plea at a briefing to the United Nations in New York.

"Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it," said Dr Joanne Liu. The international response had been "lethally inadequate". What was needed now, she declared, was the sort of expertise in dealing with biological threats that only advanced nations' armed forces possessed.

In a moving interview on RN's Breakfast last Friday, the president of MSF Belgium, Dr Meinie Nicolai, repeated Liu's call. MSF was being overwhelmed in West Africa, she said. "We cannot do this alone."

In other disasters, she pointed out, advanced nations had been quick to respond. "If we have an earthquake, for example ... there's a lot of armies who come with their surgeons, with their capacity to quickly set up a field hospital; that capacity we need now in West Africa for Ebola ... funding alone is not enough. We need people who take the responsibility to open new treatment centres, help us deal with the dead bodies, help us inform the population, to do contact tracing; there is so much work to do."

So, what was the response to MSF's plea in Newport, Wales, last week? There was none. So far as I can see, no one at the NATO summit had a word to say about Ebola.

Over the weekend, it is true, Obama promised the deployment of "military assets" to West Africa. The French government is sending 20 experts in infectious disease control. The British government has committed £5 million ($8.5 million) to help charities such as MSF.

But it is not exactly an overwhelming response. And Abbott has been nowhere to be seen.

Of course, any government would think twice before ordering its military forces to deploy field hospitals to West Africa. The heroic doctors and nurses who man MSF's Ebola clinics right now are putting themselves at far greater risk of death - and a horrible death, at that - than the pilots who will soon be dropping bombs on ISIL, or the "rapid response force" that NATO has decided to set up as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.

Can any head of government, in good conscience, order the men and women in their nation's military medical corps to take such risks? What kind of backlash could those leaders expect when the first body bags come home?

And yet, if Abbott had stood up in the past few days and committed an Australian field hospital - perhaps manned by volunteers ready to face the risks - to the fight against Ebola, what an effect that might have had.

To be sure, West Africa is a long way from Australia. But so is Ukraine. The task of containing the Ebola outbreak grows tougher by the day - but no tougher than the task of destroying ISIL; and at least the attempt will save lives, not take them.

Above all, such an initiative might have shamed those nations who are closer, and richer, into doing what they should be doing already. How about it, Mr Abbott? You seem to want us to "punch above our weight" on the global stage. Well, here is your chance.

The heroic volunteers of MSF - and the hard-pressed health workers of impoverished West African nations - should not have to carry this burden alone.

In the face of unprecedented global emergencies, Australia has the capacity to give more.

The world is registering some unwelcome milestones.

Four nations - Iraq, Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan - are each going through "Level 3" emergencies, the highest crisis classification. Aid officials say it's the first time the world has experienced simultaneous emergencies of that calibre in the post-war ear. Then there's the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, mass displacement in Gaza and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

This welter of emergencies is taking a heavy toll on children. UNICEF, the UN's children's agency, shipped 1000 tonnes of provisions to those caught up in the world's most urgent crises in August - the largest emergency supply operation in a single month during the agency's 68-year history.

The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance worldwide has swelled from 81 million to 102 million since the start of the year - a rise of 26 per cent.

On World Refugee Day in June the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, drew attention to another troubling marker: the number of refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people worldwide exceeded 50 million people for the first time since World War II.

The UN has called on world governments to donate a record $17.3 billion to fund the extraordinary relief effort required this year. But the multiple crises coincide with an era of budget stress and fiscal austerity among traditional donor countries. Less than half the UN's appeal has so far been met.

Non-government aid agencies are also struggling to raise money. World Vision's head in Australia, Tim Costello, thinks people are turning inward in response to an overload of bad news. "The humanitarian system is being pushed to breaking point but it seems people just don't want to know," he says.

The strain on the global humanitarian system is becoming increasingly obvious. In early July, the World Food Program revealed a lack of funding meant food rations would be cut for nearly 800,000 refugees in Africa, threatening to worsen already high levels of malnutrition and stunting in children. A few days later Oxfam was forced to cut aid to 6500 Syrian refugee families in Jordan. On Monday UNICEF said a "critical shortage" of funds was depriving almost 30 million children in crisis-hit regions of their right to an education.

Global spending on humanitarian assistance has grown strongly over the past decade. But the needs have grown even faster. Climate change, population growth and the rise of extremism is making many of the world's regions more vulnerable to humanitarian emergencies. During the mid-'80s about 150 natural disasters were recorded annually but that had risen to over 350 by the late-2000s. Storms and floods are also becoming more destructive. Typhoon Hiyan, which triggered a "Level 3" emergency after it devastated the Philippines last November, was strongest cyclone ever recorded to make landfall.

You might not realise it, but Australia has become a significant contributor to the global humanitarian system. As our overseas aid spending was ramped up under the Rudd Labor government, our role in the delivery of worldwide emergency assistance grew. Australia's contribution to international emergencies doubled in 2008 and reached a peak of nearly $500 million in 2011. Even though funding for emergencies dropped by 21 per cent last year, Australia was still the world's 10th biggest humanitarian contributor.

There is strong voter support for the government's humanitarian assistance abroad. An Australian National University poll released last week showed 75 per cent believe that foreign aid should be allocated primarily on the basis of "humanitarian need", rather than to serve commercial or political interests.

So what humanitarian contribution should Australia be making this year, as the world grapples with an unprecedented flurry of big emergencies?

A "fair share analysis" done by aid agency Oxfam sheds light on that question. It calculates what wealthy donor countries, like Australia, should contribute to UN emergency appeals based on their relative Gross National Income. Australia's current share of all donor nation GNI is 2.38 per cent.

On Oxfam's measure, in the 2014 calender year, Australia has contributed 105 per cent of its 'fair share' to Iraq, 48.5 per cent of its 'fair share' to South Sudan, 46 per cent of its 'fair share' to the Central Africa Republic and just 27 per cent of its 'fair share' to Syria. (The calculation only includes government assistance, not donations by the public). There are always reasons not to fund humanitarian work in far away places. Budgets are finite and humanitarian demands apparently limitless. But we can do much better. If a country with the wealth, resilience and experiences of disaster that Australia has, will not shoulder its fair share in a year of unprecedented emergencies what hope is there for the global humanitarian system?

We must honour the heroic first responders

The world cannot allow the horrific deaths of journalists in Syria and medicos in Africa to be in vain.

In the wake of 9/11, the world developed a special appreciation for first responders, the men and women who ran towards danger when they saw it. They risked all to help others, and fittingly there was a surge of recognition for cops and firefighters and paramedics.

Neither James Foley nor Steven Sotloff wore a badge or a uniform. Nor did Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Alice Kovoma, Mohamed Fullah or Sheik Umar Khan. But they embodied the first-responder spirit as truly and fully as any of those whose courage inspired us and whose sacrifices broke our hearts at the World Trade Centre. For precisely that reason, out of respect for them and their contribution to the world, it is essential we not make the same errors we did amid the anger and grief that marked the earliest days of what we once called the War on Terror.

Foley and Sotloff, the two American journalists who were recently brutally murdered by terrorists, chose to run into the flames of Syria even as the rest of the world looked away. They, like other journalists covering that country's civil war, knew that the risks they faced were grave. But they made a calculation that letting the slaughter go unrecorded would be compounding those battlefield atrocities with indifference. That would be inhumane and was so intolerable to them that they made their way into a country that many of the world's great and powerful leaders were doing their best to avoid and ignore.

What does it say about a person who chooses to go on their own into mayhem that has already claimed almost 200,000 lives and do so without a weapon, without an army, without a congressional resolution? How deep must be their conviction that bearing witness is essential, the only possible human reaction, the one that might motivate others to action, to actually caring?

Fonnie, Moigboi, Kovoma, Fullah and Khan were all health-care professionals, doctors, nurses, and technicians who were affiliated with the Kenema Government Hospital's Lassa fever facility in Sierra Leone. All five were

co-authors of an important new Ebola study who died of the disease before their work could be made public. By virtue of their work, they were more acutely aware of the risks they faced from the current outbreak, the worst by far of its kind to date, one that has claimed more than 1500 lives and may infect as many as 20,000 before it has run its course. But it was precisely because they knew the risks better than others - better than those who were infected and spreading the disease - that they chose to remain on the front lines of the efforts to combat the epidemic. Like other first responders, they too felt that the right response to a crisis is to run towards it rather than away from it.

Of course, Foley and Sotloff were not the only journalists to die in Syria, nor were they the only ones to be lost to the depravity of terrorists. Because they were Americans and because their murders were so gruesomely fed to the media and the grotesque appetites of the internet, their stories have gained the most attention. But estimates as to the number of journalists lost in Syria alone range from 71 to more than 150. And, according to the World Health Organisation, the number of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers to have succumbed to this current Ebola outbreak was, as of late August, more than 120.

Both of these totals pale to insignificance when weighed against the greater tolls of the crises that claimed the lives of these heroes. And other wars and genocides and epidemics are claiming their own fair share of such heroes, the first responders to these humanitarian catastrophes that many would prefer to ignore. All deserve the kinds of thoughts, attention, and prayers that we have offered on behalf of Foley and Sotloff, as well as our gratitude, because these are the people who, by risking their lives, make it impossible for the rest of us to look away. These are the people who risk their lives in order to offer a human touch to those whom most of humanity has abandoned. These are the people who demand that we cut through the impotence of high-minded political rhetoric and the incomprehensible mountains of statistics to reveal and serve the human beings at the heart of these problems.

That is why out of respect for their lives and for the spirit of what they do, we must consider our reactions carefully. It is easy for tabloid newspapers to offer up headlines demanding revenge or promoting scare stories. But an appropriate response to these tragedies lies not with the empty rhetoric of politicians going through the motions of seeming to care or with the histrionics of hotheads and opportunists. It lies with the ideas that motivated all of these first responders to action: compassion, getting to the facts - and then taking action even when the risks were high. In the case of Sotloff and Foley, is it not enough simply to target Islamic State. The entire Middle East and much of Africa and Asia are now at risk because of the spread of Islamist extremism, and as we learned with our too-narrow focus on "core al-Qaeda", targeting one group only ensures that others will assume its place. We need a comprehensive strategy to confront all such groups and to cut off their sources of funding and those who would give them comfort. And we must recognise that only through finding successful alternative political solutions to the problems on the ground can we fill the governance void that currently is the breeding ground and preferred environment for extremists.

In the case of the Ebola battle, we must similarly not only contain and treat this disease, but recognise that the infrastructure, education, and resource gaps that enable an epidemic like this one to spread as it has threaten the world in ways that are greater than any one disease could.

Indeed, in both cases, what these first responders have shown are the costs of our indifference and inaction to date. And in both cases they demand a response that is not the narrow, crowd-pleasing "deliverables" of a political class that just wants ugliness off the front pages.

Both crises are symptomatic of greater threats that demand long-term, global commitments to contain and eliminate them. Both require, in fact, governments, international institutions, and their leaders to act with something like the courage and humanity that defined the lives of Foley, Sotloff, the other journalists who have been lost bearing witness, the healthcare workers fighting Ebola, and their colleagues fighting less well known but equally serious battles worldwide.

Dakar: Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres criticised Sierra Leone's proposed countrywide "lockdown" to control an Ebola outbreak, saying the measure could lead to the disease spreading further as cases are concealed. The government of Sierra Leone plans to order citizens not to leave the areas around their homes for three days from September 19 in a bid to halt new infections and help health workers track people suffering from the disease.

Asylum seekers - Incoming commissioner points to rights violations

Australia has been accused of a "chain of human rights violations" in its treatment of asylum seekers by the incoming United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein.

In his maiden address to the UN Human Rights Council, the Jordanian prince has also challenged plans to resettle those found to be refugees in "countries that are not adequately equipped".

In a copy of the address, to be delivered early on Tuesday (AEST), Prince Zeid castigates Australia over the policy of offshore processing of asylum seekers and the interception and turning back of vessels at sea. He says the policy has led to human rights violations including "arbitrary detention and possible torture following return to home countries".

A career diplomat, Prince Zeid took over the role from Navi Pillay of South Africa last month. His rebuke of Australia comes in a speech that begins by addressing human rights violations in Syria and Iraq.

When he turns his attention to asylum seekers, Prince Zeid expresses alarm at reports of children being detained in the United States and in Cyprus. "Human rights are not reserved for citizens only, or for people with visas," he declares in the speech, obtained by Fairfax Media. "They are the inalienable rights of every individual, regardless of his or her location and migration status.

"A tendency to promote law enforcement and security paradigms at the expense of human rights frameworks dehumanises irregular migrants, enabling a climate of violence against them and further depriving them of the full protection of the law."

Prince Zeid also addresses the situation in Sri Lanka, urging officials to co-operate with an inquiry by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

"I am alarmed at threats currently being levelled against the human rights community in Sri Lanka, as well as prospective victims and witnesses," he says. "I also deplore recent incitement and violence against the country's Muslim and Christian minorities."

Australia's Human Rights Law Centre seized on the address, saying it is "embarrassing". Australia's inhumane policies were listed in the speech alongside global human rights challenges like the humanitarian crises in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine and the spread of Ebola in west Africa.

"In his very first speech to the United Nations, addressing the most serious human rights issues in the world right now, the new High Commissioner devoted an entire paragraph to condemning Australia's treatment of asylum seekers," said the centre's director of legal advocacy, Daniel Webb.

Mr Webb said the speech demonstrated the seriousness with which Australia's "flagrant breaches of international law" were regarded on the world stage.

He said the policies of the current and the former government had clearly damaged Australia's international reputation - at a time when there are more displaced people in the world than since the end of the Second World War.

Lagos: Nigeria has confirmed a fresh case of Ebola in a doctor whose husband died from the virus, adding to a growing list of healthcare workers in West Africa hit by the epidemic. The woman's husband, also a doctor, died in the city of Port Harcourt in August after treating a patient who had contact with the Liberian man who brought the virus to Nigeria. The woman was in a stable condition in a Lagos isolation unit. The disease has killed 1552 people and infected 3062, according to WHO figures.

William Pooley, 29, is being treated with ZMapp after being flown out of Sierra Leone on Sunday. Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer nurse in Kenema in Sierra Leone's east, one of the areas worst hit by Ebola, when he was infected. There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, which is transmitted through bodily fluids.

It is the member nations, not the UN, who should be taking responsibility for global crises.

Normally a man of such steady-state emotion, Ban Ki-moon became unusually demonstrative when, facing questions from reporters in New York last week, he was pressed about the ineffectiveness of the UN in dealing with multiple crises in the Middle East. "It's not the question of effectiveness or efficiency of the United Nations or international community as a whole," protested the secretary general, in a voice of rising exasperation. "It's the lack of the will of the parties concerned."

Not only is the mild-mannered South Korean struggling to deal with the bloodiest confluence of global crises in recent memory - Gaza, Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, South Sudan, Central African Republic and even an outbreak of Ebola. He is also fending off persistent criticisms that the UN is failing in one of its most elemental duties, to protect civilians caught in the crossfire of war, not to mention preventing those conflicts from erupting in the first place.

Dag Hammarskjold, the Swedish diplomat widely viewed to be the UN's greatest secretary general, once said that the world body "was not created to take mankind to heaven but to save mankind from hell", an avowal that has become something of a mission statement.

In Gaza, however, even civilians who sheltered at UN schools, a supposed safe haven, ended up being killed by Israeli shells.

Rarely has there been such a mood of diplomatic despondency at the UN's tombstone-like headquarters on the banks of the East River in New York. No headway has been made towards ending the three-year war in Syria, despite the UN deploying two of its most seasoned problem-solvers, Kofi Annan and the veteran Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi.

The divided UN Security Council has been deadlocked not just on Syria, but also Ukraine and the Gaza conflict. Though the 15-member council, which includes Australia, has gathered around its famed horseshoe table in emergency session after emergency session, it has little to show for its efforts. It is routine now for the chamber to revert to its Cold War default setting, a forum to trade accusations and barbs rather than to engage in constructive diplomacy. So severe has been the global slide that senior UN diplomats have even talked about convening an extraordinary world summit to take stock.

Yet for all the criticisms levelled against him personally and the UN institutionally, Ban Ki-moon is right. Unfashionable though this view has become, it is not the United Nations that is at fault, but rather the nations and parties. When the international community is divided, as it has been with Syria, Ukraine and Gaza, UN diplomats are impeded in their work. As Richard Holbrooke, a former US ambassador to the UN once memorably put it, "blaming the United Nations when things go wrong is like blaming Madison Square Garden when the Knicks play badly".

Blanket condemnations ignore or downplay the work of UN agencies that remain true to the Hammarskjold doctrine of preventing the descent into hell. In Iraq and Syria, its humanitarian arm, OCHA, has co-ordinated the relief effort. The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has cared for more than 600,000 refugees who have flooded over the border into Jordan. Its tented encampment at Zaatari in northern Jordan is the home to 81,000 refugees. The World Health Organisation has led the effort to contain the Ebola outbreak. UN peacekeepers are stationed in 16 countries, from dormant conflict zones like Kosovo to Haiti, to hot wars like South Sudan. Most recently in Gaza, the UN sheltered more than 200,000 people on the ever-shifting frontlines of the conflict. Try telling the families of the 11 UN staff members killed during the most recent conflict that the world body is a bystander.

Because their work is often shrouded by a haze of acronyms - OCHA, UNHCR, WHO, UNICEF, UNRWA to name but a few - it is easy to overlook that these agencies operate beneath the UN's flag or its sky-blue helmets. Many of them also operate under the radar. Earlier this month, the UN successfully repatriated 120,000 people into the Democratic Republic of Congo, but this massive population movement went virtually unreported.

In a scalding putdown, the former US UN ambassador and leading neo-conservative John Bolton once remarked that its 38-storey headquarters building in New York would not suffer from losing 10 floors. But the skyscraper houses some of its most effective agencies with "far more expertise and experience than other organisations in the world", in the view of the eminent American economist, Jeffrey Sachs.

Yet these very agencies are often thwarted by the inaction of member nations. This year already the UN has requested $17.3 billion for humanitarian causes, a record figure, but only about 40 per cent of that amount has been pledged by donor nations. In delivering humanitarian aid to Syria, the UN has also been hamstrung by gridlock in the Security Council, for which Russian obstructionism is often to blame.

The UN is a large and easy target, but it is often intellectually lazy to fix it in the cross hairs. Those seeking the causes of the present global malaise might be better off looking elsewhere: in Washington, where President Obama has proved a reluctant interventionist; in Moscow, where Vladmir Putin has flouted international laws; in Brussels, where the European Union has struggled to forge a common foreign policy; or any number of capitals in the Middle East or Africa. More deep-rooted causes are to be found in the continuing aftershocks of this century's three major global convulsions, the destruction of the Twin Towers, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the toppling, or attempted toppling, of authoritarian leaders during the Arab spring.

Unquestionably, the UN can be frustrating and dysfunctional. It can take months, for instance, to insert peacekeepers into troublespots, even as blood continues to be shed. Its figurehead Ban Ki-moon, though well-intentioned, is hardly a thrusting presence on the global stage. Ultimately, however, the UN is the sum of its parts, its member nations. They, alas, are often far from united.

CSIRO cuts leave 'nation exposed'

The CSIRO will cut the number of infectious disease researchers at its Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, the country's only facility capable of working with live samples of some of the most deadly diseases, including Ebola and MERS.

As the world's health authorities grapple to contain the largest outbreak of Ebola, infectious disease experts warned cuts to research would leave the country vulnerable to new and emerging diseases.

The CSIRO staff association said up to eight researchers would lose their jobs at the facility.

Director of CSIRO's Biosecurity Flagship Kurt Zuelke said the changes would affect scientists studying food-borne pathogens and infectious viral enteritis in poultry. He said researchers looking into Hendra virus and avian flu were safe from the restructure.

The CSIRO also said Ebola researchers would not be directly affected and that the organisation's response to emerging infectious diseases would be protected.

Director of Queensland University's Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre Mark Walker said CSIRO's AAHL was a world-leading research facility and the only laboratory in the country operating at level four, the highest biosafety level possible. "Funding cuts will leave the nation exposed to new and emerging infectious disease agents," he said.

"The country requires this type of expertise, as we don't know which new virus will be a major health threat. It could be Ebola, or is could be something completely different," Professor Walker said.

Nobel laureate Peter Doherty expressed concern at the impact the staff cuts would have on research continuity.

Professor Doherty, jointly awarded the 1996 Nobel prize for physiology or medicine, said the laboratory should be prized for its rare capacity to work with large animals, using live samples of some of the most dangerous viruses.

"They are an absolutely unique facility in south-east Asia," he said. "You can work on large animal models, be it a cow, a sheep, a goat or even a llama and you can do that under level-four security conditions."

The former Australian of the Year noted that if Prime Minister Tony Abbott wanted to make his name as the infrastructure prime minister then, scientifically speaking, that included staffing federally funded outfits such as CSIRO.

Professor Doherty said given science was a global discipline, Australia's "scientifically illiterate government" risked losing talent to other countries, such as Singapore, which were investing in research. If or when conditions in the sector improved, they might not be willing or able to return to Australia.

The Abbott government cut CSIRO's funding by $111 million over four years in the May federal budget, at the cost of 500 jobs.

Liberia

Overwhelmed west African nations have called states of emergency as the death toll from the Ebola epidemic neared 1000, and the World Health Organisation considered global travel restrictions to halt its spread. Liberia's Foreign Affairs Minister, Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan, said the country's health system was collapsing, with hospitals closing down and medical workers fleeing the epidemic. Soldiers set up road blocks to limit travel to the capital, Monrovia, where politicians gathered to ratify a 90-day state of emergency as bodies reportedly lay unburied in the city's streets.

Deadly virus A- ustralian health officials, medicos on alert

Customs officers are looking out for sick people in Australian airports who could be carrying Ebola, as fear mounts about the world's largest outbreak of the deadly disease.

A spokeswoman for the federal government said that while the chance of Ebola coming to Australia was "very low", all border protection agencies had been told to look out for the possibility of it when identifying sick people entering Australian ports.

GPs and other clinicians have also been briefed to stay vigilant when meeting people who show symptoms after recent travel.

"A meeting has also been convened of the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia, consisting of the key infectious diseases doctors, with all state and territory health authorities represented to discuss the possibility of the disease coming to Australia and ways to respond," the spokeswoman said.

While experts say Europe and the Middle East are more vulnerable to imported cases from Africa, where the outbreak remains, the spokeswoman said Australia's Chief Medical Office,r Professor Chris Baggoley, and the Office of Health Protection were closely monitoring the outbreak and Australia's domestic response.

"The Australian government Department of Health assesses the likelihood of Ebola being imported to Australia as very low," the spokeswoman said.

"To assist with ongoing analysis of that risk, [the Department of] Health is actively monitoring the epidemiology of the outbreak, with a particular focus on the potential spread of the disease."

If there is a suspected case, she said, Australia had sophisticated laboratory space, testing facilities, diagnostic methods, and highly trained virology and medical science staff capable of handling Ebola and other viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever.

Professor Cameron Simmons, an expert in emerging infectious disease who has worked on SARS and avian influenza in Asia, said although the Ebola outbreak was the largest ever seen, the chance of someone with the disease reaching Australia was "very remote".

"The reality is that those [African] countries are now rapidly catching up and putting in immediate restrictions and quarantine around cases. These communities are not the sort of communities who are hopping on long-haul international flights anyway, these are poor countries and poor rural communities that tend to be affected by Ebola," he said.

"Transport hubs in Western Europe, the Middle East and Africa are far more likely to come across an exported case of Ebola. But even then, I think the chances of that are low."

Professor Simmons, of Melbourne University's department of microbiology and immunology, said if the epidemic did not move into larger cities in Africa, it would probably "grumble along" for a few months before coming to an end. He said it was encouraging the death rate appeared to be lower than the 90 per cent of previous outbreaks. This was likely due to early diagnosis and treatment.

People travelling to Africa should follow Australian government travel alerts, he said.

The outbreak of the disease is already the largest and deadliest ever, according to the WHO, which previously put the death toll at 399 as of June 23, out of 635 cases. The 17 per cent rise in deaths and 20 per cent jump in cases in the space of a week will add urgency to an emergency meeting of 11 West African health ministers this week.

Liberia

Liberia says it is dealing with its first suspected Ebola case thought to be unconnected to the epidemic raging in Guinea and to have originated separately within its borders. If confirmed, the case in the eastern town of Tapeta would mark a worrying development in the fight against the Ebola virus, as cases so far have been attributed to people returning with the infection from neighbouring Guinea, where 84 people have died. Meanwhile, Mali says it has detected three suspected victims of Ebola. "Samples have been taken and sent abroad for analysis," the country's health minister, Ousmane Kone, said on Thursday. The fruit bat, thought to be the host of the highly contagious virus, is a delicacy in the region straddling Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and experts suspect hunters may be the source of the outbreak.
