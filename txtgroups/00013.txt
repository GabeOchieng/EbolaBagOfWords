FOUR members of Ebola victim Thomas Duncan's family were confined to their home under armed guard last night.

Authorities in Dallas, Texas, posted the sentries after they refused to leave the shabby property. The move came as health officials are faced with monitoring up to 100 people Thomas may have had contact with before being admitted to hospital in Dallas on Sunday. None has so far has shown any sign of the deadly disease. Liberian authorities say they plan to prosecute Duncan for bringing Ebola from Liberia to America.

It is claimed he lied on a health form allowing him to board a flight out of the country in West Africa, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak.

THE first Ebola patient to be diagnosed in America may have had contact with 100 people there - far more than the 12 to 18 sought when he was admitted to hospital in Dallas on Sunday.

The figures have emerged as Liberian authorities revealed plans to prosecute patient Thomas Eric Duncan for bringing Ebola from Liberia to America. It is claimed he lied on a health form allowing him to board a flight out of the country. Mr Duncan, who is in his 40s, arrived in Dallas on September 20. When he fell ill he went to hospital.

Those identified as having had contact with him in the US are being "monitored" by health workers. None has so far has shown any sign of the deadly disease.

IRISH GOAL WORKER BRAVES EBOLA EPIDEMIC Warning 'desperate' situation will get worse unless aid is stepped up

EBOLA could kill a MILLION people by Christmas if help is not stepped up, an Irish aid worker warned yesterday. GOAL's Darren Hanniffy said desperate conditions are getting worse in African states.

The infection toll could top 1.4million by January, potentially wiping out 10% of Liberia and Sierra Leone's populations.

After spending a week in Liberia, Darren told the Irish Mirror international help had arrived too late for thousands.

He said: "It's a desperate situation. In Liberia Ebola cases are doubling every 20 or so days. That's not 20, 40, 60 - it's 20, 40, 80, 160. Every 20 days."

Months after the outbreak first hit headlines, he added not enough was happening to save innocent lives in the poverty-stricken states affected.

The West has failed to deliver on its promises, he said, and people in the Liberian capital of Monrovia were crying out for real assistance.

Following Irish Government cash injections and a huge shipment of aid equipment, the UK government has stepped in with €6.4million due to follow.

But Darren, from Co Offaly, revealed only six treatment centres were running in Liberia - at least 14 short of the number needed. He said: "The problem we are facing is there are not enough agencies operating. We don't have the luxury of time.

"This is something that's going to keep growing if we don't do something about it. Money is coming in now but it's very, very late for this to be happening. More help is needed now.

"I can see that things will definitely improve - late but it's a positive step.

"We have to be successful or we are going to face 1.4million cases of Ebola by January."

The disease swept across western Africa without warning, taking countries by surprise.

Body counts now total more than 3,300, six months after the outbreak was confirmed in Guinea. Nearly 7,000 have now been infected - more than all the previous cases combined since Ebola was discovered in 1976.

And Darren said GOAL had been fighting an uphill battle to help stem the disease, following cases of aid workers accused of spreading it by suspicious villagers.

He added life on the ground was continuing as normal for many, but a chilling atmosphere confronted aid workers who travelled away from big cities.

He said: "There has been a great deal of misinformation around the country. Markets and transport have been very badly affected, and hospitals are not running as normal at all.

"People are reluctant to visit with normal illnesses because they fear being infected.

"I think the issue is Ebola hasn't existed in western Africa previously.

"People didn't know what it was, and they were dying in communities from this mysterious disease.

"People started wondering who had brought it in - was it the hospitals or health workers?" DARREN said the Ebola epidemic was a complex fight, with resources carefully targeted to tackle the problem at its root.

He added: "The reality is when people understand what it is there's a greater confidence. People think that we go into Africa and we are handing out stuff, but we're not. What we actually do is empower communities.

"When you look at Ebola what we are doing is giving people information. When we tell them they can do something about it they realise they have a power to stop it in their community." And their tactics to cut off the disease's spread by stopping it at the source was beginning to pay off, he said, with infected victims helping themselves.

He said: "I saw a man who contracted Ebola, but he recognised the symptoms and isolated himself immediately. He got himself to hospital and, luckily, he survived. But more importantly, he didn't infect other people.

"This is how Ebola will be beaten. It will be beaten by people learning about it."

GOAL will be funding one of Liberia's desperately needed new treatment centres, but the United Nations has warned just a 20th of the people needed in the fight are currently on the ground.

Darren said a massive recruitment drive to find volunteers had been launched, with more than 500 applications to Goal currently in the pipeline. Visit goal.ie.

ACTIVISTS are demanding more needs to be done to tackle Ebola before it's too late - but it's already far too late for thousands of Africans.

An Irish aid worker has estimated one million people globally could be affected by the virus in the next 12 weeks.

The world must take notice of a deadly disease which poses such a massive threat to all of us.

Sadly, it's only when Ebola reached the US that the West really stood up and took note.

In the minds of the ignorant it is an African disease borne out of poverty but its spectre is looming over the same American lawmakers who chose to ignore it.

The clock is ticking on a virus which has the potential to wipe out millions of people.

Doctors monitoring schoolchildren

CHILDREN in America have been in contact with the Ebola virus after doctors failed to spot the disease and gave a patient antibiotics.

Thomas Eric Duncan was sent home by a hospital in Dallas and mixed with family and friends - including "children of school age" - for two days before he was finally admitted and placed in isolation.

Five youngsters from four schools are being monitored.

Mr Duncan reportedly came into contact with Ebola when he helped to take pregnant victim Marthalene Williams to a hospital in Liberia in a taxi.

Family friend Ms Williams, 19, was turned away due to a lack of space and died at home three days later. Mr Duncan, who is said to be in his 40s and from Liberian capital Monrovia, arrived in Dallas, via Brussels on September 20. He saw a doctor six days later.

As he fought for life in intensive care yesterday, bosses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital launched a probe.

Clinical director Dr Mark Lester said the patient was asked about his travel history and he told them he had flown in from Liberia. But the information was not "passed up the chain of command" and medics allowed him back with his family.

His symptoms persisted and he was taken to hospital with severe vomiting on Sunday. Up to 18 people are in now in quarantine, including three medics who tended to him.

News of the hospital error was tweeted by an American TV reporter. He said: "Hospital reviewing why patient wasn't properly diagnosed on Friday when evaluated and sent home. Dismissed with antibiotics."

Staff are trying to identify everyone else the man met before he was admitted.

Experts dismissed concerns he could have infected other passengers on the flight or anyone in Belgium during his stop.

An infected person can develop symptoms including sudden fever, headache, joint and muscle pain in two to 21 days.

Mr Duncan's case is the first diagnosis of Ebola outside western Africa in the current outbreak. The mortality rate can hit 90% but the average for this attack, which has killed 3,338 people, is 70%.

CHILDREN in the US have been in contact with the Ebola virus after doctors failed to spot the disease and sent a sufferer home with antibiotics.

The man was admitted to a Dallas hospital and placed in isolation two days later after he met family and friends - including "children of school age" - when he was possibly at his most contagious.

Five schoolchildren from four schools in Dallas are being monitored after possible contact.

The victim had arrived in Dallas from Ebola hotspot Liberia - via Brussels - on September 20 and first saw a doctor six days later, on Friday.

As the man fought for life in intensive care yesterday, bosses at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital launched a probe.

Clinical director Dr Mark Lester revealed the patient was asked about his travel history and he told them he had flown in from Liberia.

But the information was not "passed up the chain of command" and medics allowed him back with his family. His symptoms persisted and he was rushed to hospital with severe vomiting on Sunday. Up to 18 people are in quarantine, including three medics who tended to the patient.

Staff are trying to identify everyone else the man met before he was admitted.

Experts dismissed concerns he could have infected other passengers on the flight from Africa's worst-hit country, or anyone in Belgium during his stop.

According to the NHS an infected person can develop Ebola symptoms including fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, suddenly, in 2-21 days, but usually after 5-7. News of the hospital error was tweeted by an American TV reporter. He said: "Hospital reviewing why patient wasn't properly diagnosed on Friday when evaluated and sent home. Dismissed with antibiotics."

The case in Dallas is the first diagnosis of Ebola outside western Africa in the current outbreak.

The mortality rate can hit 90% but the average for this attack, the world's deadliest with over 3,000 victims, is 70%.

Former Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, 58, is pumping in an emergency £31million donation to fight Ebola in west Africa.

Patient falls ill after flying from Liberia

THE first case of the deadly Ebola virus on American soil was confirmed last night.

Health officials said a patient had tested positive for the killer bug after he fell ill in Dallas, Texas, 10 days after he arrived from Liberia.

He was being kept in isolation at the city's Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, while the crew that brought him in the ambulance were being monitored as a precaution.

The patient is said to have come into contact with family and a "few members of the community" who health workers were trying to locate.

Centres for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Tom Frieden insisted he was confident there would not be an Ebola outbreak in the US.

He said: "There is no doubt in my mind we will stop it here.

"We will control this importation, or this case of Ebola, so that it does not spread widely in this country."

Officials said the victim arrived in Texas from Liberia to visit family on September 20 and had no symptoms at the time.

Four days after his arrival he began feeling unwell and he sought medical attention on Friday before admission to hospital on Sunday.

Dr Frieden moved to allay fears the victim may have spread the disease during his flight to the US.

He said: "You have to remember with Ebola until the disease manifests properly, it is very difficult to spread. There is zero risk of transmission on the flight."

He refused to give details of the plane or confirm the patient's nationality, but he said there were no other suspected Ebola cases in Texas.

A team of disease control specialists was last night heading to Dallas to help local health workers.

America's National Institutes of Health recently admitted another American doctor exposed to the virus while volunteering in Sierra Leone.

Four other patients have been treated in Georgia and Nebraska after being diagnosed in Africa.

The incubation period for Ebola is between two and 21 days.

Symptoms include fever, bleeding and central nervous system damage.

The fatality rate can reach up to 90% but the mortality rate for the current outbreak - the world's deadliest with 3,000 victims - is 70%.

THOUSANDS of children who have lost their parents to Ebola are being shunned by their relatives over fears of infection.

Some were discovered alone in the hospitals where their parents had died. Unicef's Manuel Fontaine said: "Orphans are usually taken in by other relatives but fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties. These children feel abandoned."

The death toll is more than 3,000 with fears infections could hit one million.

THE Government will provide €600,000 to combat the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

The pledge came yesterday as the death toll from the deadly virus increased to more than 2,500.

Speaking from West Africa, Plan Ireland's Damian Queally said: "As well as the ever-present threat of the virus, basic food items and commodities are now also running dangerously low."

Borders are closed in the affected areas, meaning traders are unable to bring food into the area.

Mr Queally added: "The establishment of quarantine zones to contain the spread of Ebola have led to panic buying, food shortages and price hikes.

"Supplies of food are running so low citizens fear many could die of hunger if the virus is not contained."

Efforts by the United States and other countries to tackle the increasing Ebola epidemic continue to fall worryingly short.

Despite labelling the deadly disease as a "national security priority" two weeks ago, President Obama has only now seemed to grasp the seriousness of what the world faces.

Too little too late it may yet still prove for many of the 20,000 potential victims the virus could still infect.

As the US scrambles to deploy 3,000 troops, train thousands of health care workers, establish a military control centre for co-ordination and build 17 treatment centres, the death toll rises day-by-day.

Figures released this week by the World Health Organisation showed Ebola has already killed more than 2,500 people while another 5,000 have been infected.

However, serious questions remain over whether the efforts are moving fast enough to keep up with increasing rates of infections and deaths.

The answer is simply no. New cases are outpacing the capacity to treat victims while isolation and treatment facilities still need to be built in days, not weeks or months.

But the epidemic blighting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone has also highlighted the growth of another, if not more worrying disease - the decay of the WHO. Ever since its inception in 1948, the global health agency within the United Nations has provided a reassuring comfort blanket for the world.

Whenever major epidemics broke out teams of doctors and other specialists would be dispatched across the globe, tasked with ensuring the necessary drugs and equipment would be made quickly available.

The speed at which they intercepted killer diseases helped saved ten of thousands of lives, including the Ebola outbreak in 1976 and the Sars virus in Asia 11 years ago. But that was then. Today is entirely different.

For no longer does the WHO have the staffing or ability to tackle this latest outbreak as they did previously.

It is now a fantasy to see the organisation as a first responder, ready to lead the fight on behalf of the world.

For the first time we have witnessed how a catalogue of budget cuts has left the WHO needing the sick bay itself.

Over the years the emergency response and outbreak units have been decimated while countless positions, the kind of people that would have been sent to tackle such epidemics, have been axed.

The global financial crisis led to a billion pounds being slashed off the budget and as a result key staff had to go.

Last year the WHO budget showed "a shift away from infectious diseases," cutting almost €55million from that section.

The Geneva office, where the organisation is based, took a significant hit with the team specialising in managing cultural differences as the outbreak responses dissolved.

Before this latest epidemic struck, there was only one remaining Ebola expert in the unit tasked with pandemic diseases.

It is a sad indictment on the world's governments to see so many people lose their lives to Ebola through a lack of funding - a point compounded further when you consider Bill Gates donated more to the WHO last year than any other single country.

Sadly, to prevent such a travesty from happening again, the most effective way of combating an unexpected epidemic is to have it occur in a relatively prosperous country.

Only then will it truly get the funding that is needed.

The world would do well to learn a lesson or two from the Microsoft billionaire - health not wealth is the more important thing in the world.

Mum-of-two helps with £2.8m trial

A FORMER nurse has become the first volunteer to receive a trial Ebola vaccine in a bid to save thousands from the killer virus.

Healthy mum-of-two Ruth Atkins, 48, took part in the experiment at Oxford University yesterday. The vaccine contains a small amount of protein from the virus to make the body produce antibodies.

If the £2.8million fast-track trial involving 60 healthy people aged 18 to 50 is a success, the vaccine could be used to immunise health workers within months.

GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health, who have produced the vaccine, hope to have 10,000 doses available by the end of the year. Ms Atkins, an NHS Communications and Engagement manager in Oxfordshire, had an injection and was then monitored for an hour before being released.

She said: "I volunteered because I thought being part of this vaccination process was something small I could do to hopefully make a huge impact."

The vaccine was rushed through urgently due to the worst-ever Ebola outbreak, which has seen 2,261 people die in West Africa so far this year.

The UK trial came as President Barack Obama announced 3,000 troops would be sent to the Ebola-hit areas.

He warned: "It's spiralling out of control. The outbreak must be stopped now."

William Pooley, 29, the British nurse who beat Ebola, has flown to America to give blood to a pal struck down by the virus. Mr Pooley, of Eyke, Suffolk, can help the infected person as his blood now carries antibodies to Ebola.

Sick passenger is tended to by crew member in full protective suit

A FORMER junior minister was caught up in a deadly Ebola scare as he travelled back to Ireland from Africa.

Charity boss Barry Andrews was on a plane from a diseaseridden part of Sierra Leone when a passenger fell ill, prompting fears he may have been infected with the dangerous virus.

Mr Andrews, a former Junior Children's Minister who is now chief executive of GOAL, was one of four Irish passengers on the Royal Air Maroc plane.

The charity's media officer David Williams told the Irish Daily Mirror he woke up mid-flight to see a crew member don a spaceman-like suit. Speaking after his flight landed in Casablanca, Morocco, he explained: "I lifted my head up and there was a guy coming down the aisle in full protective equipment.

"That would be the gear they would use for people working with Ebola patients.

"It gave me a start. "We found out there was a guy at the back of the plane with a very bad temperature.

"They were taking every precaution necessary. It was a bit of a shock."

One of the early symptoms of this virus which has already killed more than 2,400 people in western Africa, is a fever.

The two countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak have been Liberia and Sierra Leone.

For this reason, stringent measures have been put in place for people travelling from these countries.

Airlines have halted many flights into and around the region and each potential patient has to be isolated as soon as symptoms start showing.

It is understood the man who took ill one hour into the flight from Freetown to Casablanca, had a temperature of 39C.

Mr Williams added that while some crew members wore face masks no protective equipment was handed out to other passengers.

He explained: "They said at one point, 'Remain in your seats for security purposes' but no other announcement was made.

"It was not something people would have missed when the crew member in the protective suit walked on. Word got around quickly but there was no panic.

"We weren't given anything.

"The guy was at the back and we didn't feel nervous in that respect.

"Ebola is not an airborne virus."

Mr Williams and Mr Andrews were last night on their way back to Ireland via Brussels.

GOAL has been helping partners in Sierra Leone contain the spread of Ebola and handle its consequences.

I can remember when MPs were paid very little. They went into politics because they wanted to serve their country. Today, they are all in it for themselves and nothing more, so perhaps we should cut MPs' pay and expenses? It would be interesting to see which of the rats abandoned ship the fastest!

Geoffrey Newman Durham People need to stop moaning about the royals. William and Kate are just an excited couple having a baby who happen to be members of the Royal Family.

Our monarchy is hundreds of years old and makes Great Britain what it is. Congrats to William and Kate on their happy news.

Lisa Axtell, Bolton I can understand why nurse William Pooley, who contracted ebola while working with sufferers in Sierra Leone, wants to go back and help (Mirror, Sept 10) and good for him.

But if he goes back and gets the virus again then he should not be flown back to Britain for treatment. It seems he has a death wish.

THE Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation yesterday gave £31million to help battle the Ebola epidemic in Africa.

The US philanthropic foundation's cash will go to UN agencies and international organisations to boost the emergency response.

It is hoped it will also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines, as Ebola has killed more than half its 4,300 victims.

The philanthropists said they wanted to identify the "most effective ways to save lives" in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

THE British nurse cured of Ebola plans to go back to Sierra Leone and help fight the lethal virus.

William Pooley, 29, was flown home and treated at London's Royal Free Hospital after catching the disease during an aid mission.

Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, said: "While I'm happy to be recovered, there's a lot on my mind with what's going on there.

"It would be relatively safe to go back and return the favour to some other people and it's the least I could do having received all this amazing care. The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick."

His mother Jackie said: "In a way we don't want [him] to, but I can see I would feel very proud of him if he decided he was going to, because he knows what it is going to be like."

BRITISH troops are being sent to Sierra Leone to help combat Ebola virus.

The soldiers and aid experts will set up a 62-bed treatment centre near the country's capital Freetown.

It is thought around 100 troops will be sent to the new hospital in a bid to stop the spread of the disease, which has so far killed more than 2,100 people in West Africa.

The UK's support follows a direct request from the World Health Organisation and the government of Sierra Leone for assistance in containing the outbreak. The cost of the operation is not known.

BLOOD taken from Ebola survivors such as British nurse William Pooley should be used to treat others, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.

And the global health body announced that Ebola vaccines could be used on the front line by November.

More than 1,900 people have died in the world's biggest outbreak.

WHO experts have met to discuss new therapies which could contain the virus.

Assistant director general Dr Marie Paule Kieny said: "There is a real opportunity that a blood derived product can be used."

She added: "There are also many people now who have survived. They can provide blood to treat the other people who are sick."

Mr Pooley, 29, left hospital this week after recovering.

Out of hospital but will must stay in UK

BRITISH nurse Will Pooley told yesterday of his amazing recovery from Ebola - but revealed he cannot return to Africa to help the fight against the killer disease.

The brave 29-year-old had talked about going back to Sierra Leone almost immediately - but his passport has been destroyed along with other possessions to stop the spread of the deadly infection.

Will, as he was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in North West London, admitted he had been "very lucky" and added: "I was worried I was going to die."

The volunteer medic was flown back to the UK on August 24 for emergency treatment after becoming the first Briton to catch Ebola in the current lethal outbreak in West Africa.

But he insisted he had no regrets about his decision to travel to help people stricken with the virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people. Yet when asked if he would return, Will said he currently had no plans to do so, explaining: "They incinerated my passport.

"So my mum will be pleased to know I cannot go anywhere at the moment."

He also told how fortunate he felt to be alive. "I was very lucky in several ways," he said. "Firstly, in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in West Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.

"I had amazing care, which was one difference. The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - I have seen people dying horrible deaths.

"I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying." Yesterday, he headed home to the village of Eyke in Suffolk to continue his recuperation.

William is a true hero who risked his own life to help those struck down by the deadly virus. And his discharge from hospital is a tribute to the NHS which nursed him back to health.

Drugs are being developed to defeat a disease that was once considered as a death sentence.

Nurse Will leaves hospital after beating the deadly virus but he must stay in UK

BRITISH nurse Will Pooley told yesterday of his amazing recovery from Ebola - but revealed he cannot return to Africa to help the fight against the killer disease.

"I was very lucky in several ways," he said. "Firstly, in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in West Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.

"I had amazing care, which was one difference.

"The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - I have seen people dying horrible deaths.

"I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying."

Will did not suffer Ebola's trademark vomiting but did have high temperatures and stomach problems.

He recalled his time in Sierra Leone, saying: "I have mixed memories, some great memories and some horrible memories - lots of people dying.

"But I have also some wonderful memories of people going home, people showing massive spirit and cheer, despite the horrible conditions, the truly heroic people that I worked with, people that went on to get sick. It is a massive mix of memories."

Will said he had blood tests after initially feeling unwell.

He went to bed feeling sick and was woken by a World Health Organisation doctor in a personal protective equipment suit after tests came back positive.

"He was in PPE, so I knew it was bad news," recalled Will. "It was a bit disturbing to get that diagnosis but I had been half expecting it because I had been feeling sick."

He admitted: "I was worried about my family, I was scared."

Will said coming out of the isolation tent at the hospital had been a "special moment".

Yesterday, he headed home to the village of Eyke in Suffolk to continue his recuperation. Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Will, said he posed no contagion risk to members of the public.

He was treated at the Hampstead hospital with the experimental ZMapp drug which was used successfully to treat two US victims.

Virus victim improving, say parents

BRITAIN'S first Ebola victim is getting better by the day and is even tucking into bacon butties for breakfast.

Speaking for the first time about their son Will Pooley's recovery in a London isolation unit, parents Robin and Jackie said they can't wait to get him home.

Robin said: "He seems to be pretty well, actually. And his appetite's back, it came back with a bacon butty one morning for breakfast.

"He's a lot better than we thought he might have been, we've only got what the medics tell us, but he's got a little step in there so he can rebuild his strength, that in itself is a good enough sign."

Hero Will, 29, was volunteering as a nurse in Sierra Leone when he was infected but did not tell his parents until it was confirmed he was being flown home.

Jackie, said: "We were at our niece's wedding when he phoned. We assumed he'd phoned to wish his cousin luck."

But Robin thought Will sounded "flat" and something was wrong. He said: "Fairly soon I rang him back and he told me."

Jackie said it was very stressful as "worst case scenarios" ran through her mind while they waited for him to return. They feared he would not make it to the plane as he had to travel 160 miles, through checkpoints to the airport in Freetown.

She recalled: "It wasn't until the plane took off that we breathed a sigh of relief."

He was flown back to the UK on an RAF plane last month and transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.

His family speak to him through a telephone link and see him "indistinctly" through glass and polythene, designed to stop the disease spreading.

Doctors have treated him with experimental drug Zmapp, which has proved effective in curing Ebola in monkeys.

More than 120 health workers have died and w over 240 others infected in West Africa. The disease has killed 1,552 and infected 3,062 in a Guinea, Senegal, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, says the World Health Organisation which predicts 20,000 will die.

Jackie said: "Will's very aware of what he left behind. We're very glad he's here because the care is second to none."

She added that for now the family just wanted him home, saying: "We'll be delighted when that day comes."

Drug hope as monkeys recover

SCIENTISTS claimed last night that they have found a cure for killer virus Ebola.

They published research showing the 100% success of experimental drug ZMapp as a treatment on monkeys.

Professor Thomas Geisbert, of the University of Texas, hailed the performance of ZMapp as a "monumental achievement".

Researchers infected 21 monkeys with Ebola. All 18 of the animals given ZMapp made a full recovery but the three untreated monkeys died.

The study led by Dr Gary Kobinger, of the Public Health Agency of Canada, was published on the Nature journal's website. The scientists said: "ZMapp exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far." Two US medics given the drug after contracting Ebola in Africa have recovered. British nurse Will Pooley, 29, who was infected with the virus in Sierra Leone, is being treated with the drug in a London hospital.

Professor David Evans, of the University of Warwick, called the ZMapp research "encouraging" but pointed out that some Ebola patients have died after receiving the drug.

Senegal yesterday confirmed its first Ebola case, making it the fifth country where someone has caught the disease during this outbreak in West Africa. The official death toll stands at 1,552.

THE Ebola epidemic could infect more than 20,000 people, world health chiefs warned last night.

The World Health Organisation said the outbreak "continues to accelerate" as a doctor in Nigeria became one of its latest victim.

The death toll stands at more than 1,500 and 40% of the 3,069 cases have occurred in the past three weeks.

Bruce Aylward, of WHO, said: "This is a global health security issue. The number of cases may be two to fourfold higher than reported in some areas. However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities."

VACCINE He said that tackling the epidemic could cost £300million and added the possibility of 20,000 cases was "a scale I think has not ever been anticipated".

British-based pharmaceutical giant GLAXOSMITHKLINE said an experimental Ebola vaccine was being fasttracked into human studies at Oxford University.

It plans to produce up to 10,000 doses for emergency use if results are good. Sixty people are being recruited to take part in the study.

A doctor who treated US victim Patrick Sawyer, 40, who died after arriving in Lagos, Nigeria, has also died in the city of Port Harcourt.

Meanwhile, Britons have been advised against all but essential travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Ms Sellu said: "Pooley and other nurses fell in love with the boy and would play with him in their free time."

The news emerged after it was revealed that Mr Pooley was "very lucky" to be treated with experimental drug ZMapp, because it is in such short supply.

Doctors treating Mr Pooley at the Royal Free Hospital in North London said he was "in good spirits".

The specialist registrar, who has volunteered across the world, said: "Ebola is probably the most devastating disease I've seen. There can be nothing worse than to die alone, in pain and frightened. I went to help prevent some of the suffering."

But she spoke of her delight when an ill 12-year-old boy called William did survive. Dr MacDermott said: "We were feeding him lots of biscuits. It was a great day in a very hard period of time."

Back in the UK she spent 21 days isolated in her Cardiff flat as a precaution after two colleagues fell ill but later recovered in the US. She had no physical contact with family but could order food and chat online.

She is back working at Singleton Hospital in Swansea but wants to return to Liberia. The medic: "It's hard being here and knowing I can help."

WILL Pooley, the heroic British nurse struck down by deadly Ebola, is being treated with the experimental drug Zmapp.

The drug is credited with saving the lives of two desperately ill American sufferers.

Last night doctors described Will, 29, as a "resilient and remarkable young man".

He was flown by the RAF from Sierra Leone, where he contracted the disease while working as an unpaid volunteer, and is in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Michael Jacobs, consultant and clinical lead in infectious diseases, said: "We have had the opportunity to give him the ZMapp treatment. It is an experimental medicine, we made that absolutely clear in our discussions with him.

"What has become apparent is that he is clearly a resilient and remarkable young man."

Staff said he was given a first dose of ZMapp on Monday with further doses expected "in due course".

Dr Jacobs added: "We are giving him the very best care possible. However, the next few days will be crucial. The disease has a variable course and we will know much more in a week. Will is in a stable position and we are very pleased, we couldn't hope for more.

"He is sitting up and talking to the nurses and doctors who are looking after him".

PRECAUTIONS

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Will was being treated by "world class" doctors.

He said: "The risk level from transporting Mr Pooley to London remains very low. I'm really proud of what the NHS has been able to offer a very, very brave man."

He went on: "I think the public can be reassured, not just by the precautions that we're taking but by the superb care that he's received."

Up to 90% of people who catch Ebola die from the virus which has no known cure. The World Health Organisation says 1,500 people have died in the West Africa outbreak.

ZMapp, not yet been tested for safety or effectiveness, has been rushed into service and stocks have already run low.

Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, which started developing it early this year, said it is working with US agencies to increase production.

It was given to the aid workers Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol after they were flown to a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, from Liberia.

Both have since been discharged from hospital after recovering. But a Liberian doctor and a Spanish priest who received the plant-derived drug in Africa both died.

DEADLY Ebola could take another six months to get under control, it was warned yesterday.

The World Health Organisation has confirmed 120 health workers have died trying to tackle the lethal virus.

The disease has claimed around 1,500 lives so far.

UN health chief Dr David Nabarro said yesterday the war against Ebola had been hampered by airlines axing flights, making relief work harder.

Dr Nabarro, who is co-ordinating the global response, added: "The effort to defeat Ebola is not a battle but a war which requires everybody working together, hard and effectively.

"I hope it will be done in six months but we have to do it until it is completed."

Last week fears the disease had spread to an Irish worker were lifted after samples proved negative.

But over the weekend the first confirmed victim from the UK was flown home for treatment in a specialist isolation unit.

Medical experts have warned the number of healthcare workers being infected was increasing as the disease spread across western Africa.

Alistair Short, director of the Concern in Liberia charity, said: "One of our problems with the high number of healthcare worker deaths in Liberia is they were not well trained, they were not well resourced."

VOICE OF THE

EBOLA sufferer William Pooley is an inspiring young man.

You cannot have anything but huge admiration for a nurse who knew the risks yet still went to Sierra Leone to help victims of a deadly virus and who now deserves our sympathy and best wishes as he fights the disease.

And we can take immense pride in a National Health Service that is able to treat him in a North London hospital's isolation unit with an infinitesimal risk of the contagion spreading in the UK.

The accolade "hero" is over-applied by most of us in our daily lives. Too often we label as heroes pampered footballers on obscene salaries who score winning goals. Or put pop acts and actors on pedestals when they really don't deserve the accolade.

But William Pooley is a genuine hero, hitherto an unsung hero like the thousands of Britons who put their lives on the line to save others.

We wish him a full and speedy recovery. He's in good hands. The survival of two US doctors is encouraging. And now Ebola threatens the Western world, resources are being pumped into finding a cure. It's both regrettable and shameful that when Ebola killed only poor Africans, research was neglected.

If there is any justice in this world, William Pooley will soon be well and back on his feet.

INCREDIBLE COURAGE OF THE BRITISH EBOLA VICTIM

PROUD friends have spoken of the extraordinary courage of British nurse Will Pooley who contracted Ebola while treating victims in Sierra Leone.

He had been warned about the risk of infection but still volunteered to work with patients suffering from the killer virus.

And he stayed at their bedside at a hospital in the West African country even after local doctors had fled, scared for their own safety.

A colleague in Sierra Leone said: "When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to go and work at the hospital.

"He told me he had a calling to go there. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave."

The friend added that Will was upbeat about his odds of surviving Ebola.

As Will waited in Sierra Leone to be flown home in an RAF plane on Sunday, he told the colleague he was confident about his chances.

The pal said: "He told me he was feeling very unwell but he was sure the British doctors would be able to cure him."

Will, 29, was struck down with the virus at a hospital in the Kenema region.

He has been having round-the-clock treatment at an isolation ward in a London hospital since his return to the UK.

RISKS

Dr Oliver Johnson, who worked with him in Sierra Leone, said: "Will's a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave.

"From the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could, not just help patients but I think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at Kenema."

Dr Johnson, programme director of King's College London's Sierra Leone partnership, added: "He and I spoke about the risk and I think he absolutely understood there were risks involved.

"He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.

"But where he was in Kenema a number of staff had become sick.

"He was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one, so he understood those [risks] but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues he had there."

Colleagues said Will arrived as a volunteer in Sierra Leone in March.

He worked at a hospice in the capital, Freetown, before deciding to help at the hospital after he heard about the Ebola outbreak there about five weeks ago.

Gabriel Madiye, the executive director of the hospice, said: "We consider him a hero. He was somebody who is sacrificing to provide care in very difficult circumstances - when our own health workers are running away."

Will's family last night said he was receiving "excellent care" at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North West London.

Led by his mum Jackie, they also spoke of their relief at him being returned to Britain.

The family said: "We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.

"We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home."

Their statement added: "We ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will."

In an interview filmed days before he contracted Ebola, Will spoke of his experiences helping patients with the disease. The interview took place this month but was aired for the first time yesterday.

Looking happy and relaxed, and wearing a light blue nurse's tunic, he spoke with pride about helping sufferers.

He said: "It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state. To see them recover and walk out the door, it's great."

There is no known cure for Ebola - and most patients have died during this outbreak - but with treatment and proper hydration, patients have a better chance of survival.

The US manufacturer of ZMAPP, an experimental drug given to two American Ebola patients, said they have run out.

But the Department of Health said it was trying to obtain any remaining doses. The Mirror has learned that doctors treating Will have not ruled out the use of monoclonal antibody therapies such as ZMAPP and lesser known alternatives.

After receiving medical care, including ZMAPP, in the US the two Americans survived the virus.

A Spanish priest infected with Ebola also received the treatment but died.

After Will, of Eyke, Suffolk, was flown to RAF Northolt, in North West London, at the weekend then taken to the hospital, it emerged he had spoken of his life in West Africa in an email to his mum.

The message revealed that at a village meeting he had been confronted with armed guards.

Will also sampled the hospitality of the locals made rich from the country's controversial diamond mining industry.

In the email - published in a village newsletter called Inside Eyke - he said: "After pushing through a crowd outside the house we were ushered inside by police with AK47s. The host, rich and influential thanks to diamonds, had his house boys serve us cans of ice-cold European lager."

He also told how he was treated to a show from the "devils" - people dressed in an assortment of costumes, their faces painted or covered with wooden masks.

Will said: "The devils danced wildly to drums... and they drew quite a crowd. As the only white face in the crowd, the devils singled me out for harassment.

"In order to escape from under their hay and frock skirts I had to give them small change. It was all in good humour." He also talked about the poverty that blights so many lives there, saying: "The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity."

It has emerged that an Ebola scare on a flight from London to Aberdeen on Sunday was a false alarm.

Health officials wearing biohazard suits boarded the plane on the runway amid fears a young girl on board had the disease after she was taken ill.

More than 100 passengers were kept on the tarmac for more than two hours. Tests showed the girl did not have the disease.

Yesterday a UN delegation to Sierra Leone promised more help for countries battling the disease which has killed more than 1,400 people across West Africa. A separate outbreak emerged over the weekend in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

WILLIAM Pooley is being nursed in a specially designed plastic bubble at the UK's only ward equipped to cope with Ebola.

He was taken into the quarantine area at the Royal Free Hospital in North London through a separate entrance.

He will live for weeks, if not months, in the isolation tent to stop contaminated vapour escaping. His £25,000 bed will be burned after he leaves.

Air from the tent will be filtered before being pumped out. Cool, fresh air will circulate around his body. A pot similar to a pressure cooker is fitted to the bed for human waste which will be decontaminated and disposed of.

Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses are allowed to enter the ward. An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop organs failing until his immune system is strong enough to fight the virus.

Stephen Mepham, a senior doctor at the unit, said previously: "The reason behind the unit is to protect health workers from highly contagious infections. Everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so air is constantly added and removed."

Dr Nick Beeching, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said "good, basic medical care" will improve Mr Pooley's chances. Ebola can be fatal in 90% of cases.

But it could be weeks before doctors know how bad the infection will get. He said the nurse is likely to be "very frightened" and doctors will do their best to reassure him.

Ebola is spread through sweat, blood and vomit but not via air.

FRIENDS have spoken of the courage of British nurse Will Pooley who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone.

The 29-year-old had been warned about the risk of infection but volunteered to work with patients who had the killer virus.

And Mr Pooley stayed at their bedside at a hospital in West Africa country after local doctors had fled.

A colleague said: "When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to work at the hospital.

"I advised him not to go but he pleaded with me. He is very brave."

The friend claimed Mr Pooley was upbeat about his chances of surviving after flying home on Sunday.

The pal said: "He told me he was feeling very unwell but was sure the British doctors would be able to cure him."

DEADLY VIRUS IN THE UK: VICTIM LANDS AT RAF BASE

Victim kept in high-level isolation unit at UK hospital

FHe went out to Africa as a volunteer to fight epidemic

AS Ebola continued to spread at an alarming rate, a British man was placed in what experts called a protective bubble as he was returned home last night.

The healthcare worker, who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, was flown back to the UK by the RAF.

The nurse, 29, has been described by loved ones as a "remarkable and amazing young man".

He is the first Briton confirmed to have contracted the virus during the outbreak that has killed 1,429 people.

There is no known cure for Ebola which is spread in humans through contact with infected bodily fluids.

The nurse is understood to have been a volunteer at a clinic in the Kenema district of Sierra Leone.

He was seen yesterday being wheeled on a medical trolley at an airport in the West African country and placed on to the waiting aircraft by several staff.

A source said yesterday: "The porters moved him along the runway and then on to the plane. They tried to make him as comfortable as possible for the journey home."

PROMPTLY

He arrived at RAF Northolt, North West London, in a specially equipped C-17 air force carrier.

The craft remained on the tarmac while medics prepared to carefully move the man to an ambulance.

In a meticulous operation, he was expected to be taken from the isolation tent onboard the plane and whisked to North London for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital's high-level isolation unit - the only one of its kind in Britain.

Professor Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said the man would be transported "in what is effectively a bubble" to reduce any chance of him spreading the virus.

The patient is "not currently seriously unwell", a Department of Health spokesman said yesterday. Health chiefs said the risk to people in the UK from the virus remained "very low".

Dr Paul Cosford, the director for health protection at Public Health England, said the man was being transferred with "all appropriate protocols promptly activated" by British health agencies.

He added: "Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of trans-mission to staff transporting the patient to the UK and healthcare workers treating the individual.

"UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible."

Sidie Yayah Tunis, director of communications at Sierra Leone's health ministry, said the British nurse had been flown out of the country's main airport in the town of Lungi on Sunday.

The man is understood to have been staying at a guest house in Sierra Leone. Some sources said the man may have made the journey to Kenema under his own steam, rather than as part of an aid or health organisation.

The speed and extent of the outbreak has been "unprecedented", according to the World Health Organisation. And yesterday authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said two people had died from Ebola in the country's northwest region.

They are the first reported Ebola cases outside West Africa.

Although last night it was not clear if the two cases are directly linked to the West Africa outbreak. Several people had been reported killed in the past month by a fever in the Equateur region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Yesterday health minister Felix Kabange Numbi said eight of these victims had been tested for Ebola. "The results are positive. The Ebola virus has been confirmed in DRC," he said.

In a separate case, it also emerged yesterday that a worker with the World Health Organisation has also fallen ill from Ebola. Nothing else is known yet about the victim's identity.

The WHO has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus at 2,615 since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

The 1,429 deaths make it the worst Ebola outbreak yet. Rigorous quarantine measures are used to stop the spread of Ebola, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who comes into contact with sufferers.

Symptoms of the virus are a fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding.

Usually, symptoms appear between two and 21 days after infection.

The virus kills more than half of the people who contract it.

Dr Bob Winter, national clinical director for emergency preparedness and critical care for NHS England, said preparations have been made over the past few weeks to ensure any patient being repatriated to the UK receives the best possible care.

The Foreign Office has urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

DEADLY VIRUS IN THE UK: VICTIM LANDS AT RAF BASE

Nurse kept in high-level isolation unit at UK hospital

He went out to Africa as a volunteer to fight epidemic

COCOONED in a protective bubble, the first British victim of the Ebola outbreak that has claimed 1,429 lives was last night flown back to the UK by the RAF.

The 29-year-old nurse - described by colleagues as "a brave and amazing young man" - is believed to have contracted the deadly virus in Sierra Leone while working as a volunteer at a clinic in the Kenema region.

He was seen yesterday being wheeled across the tarmac in his special isolation tent at an airport in the West African country and placed aboard a waiting aircraft by several staff.

A source said: "The porters gently moved him along the runway and then on to the plane. They tried to make him as comfortable as possible for the journey home."

The healthcare worker arrived at RAF Northolt, North West London, in a specially-equipped C-17 air force carrier and was immediately transferred to an ambulance.

In a meticulous operation, he was then whisked, still under quarantine, to North London for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital's high-level isolation unit - the only one of its kind in Britain.

BEGGED

A friend and co-worker of the victim told last night how the nurse, who had been trained in Britain, put his life on the line to fly out to try to help sufferers of the disease.

The colleague said: "When the Ebola outbreak occurred, He begged me to let him to go and work at the hospital.

"He told me he had a calling. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave."

Before leaving, the young medic told pals: "I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I will actually be helping."

Government ministers agreed on Saturday to fly him home after deciding there was no risk of causing an outbreak in Britain.

The man's hospital bed will be surrounded by an isolation tent with its own ventilation system and only speciallytrained medical staff will be allowed inside the unit.

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said strict measures would be maintained to avoid anyone else being infected.

He said: "For Ebola to be transmitted contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and as such, the risk to the general population remains very low."

He said the nurse had been transported "with all appropriate protocols" in place. He added: "Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of transmission.

"UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible."

Professor Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, revealed that the man was "not currently seriously unwell".

Sidie Yayah Tunis, director of communications at Sierra Leone's health ministry, confirmed the British patient had been flown out of the country's main airport at Lungi on Sunday. He is thought to have been staying at a guest house in Sierra Leone. Some sources suggested he may have made the journey to Kenema alone, rather than as part of an aid or health organisation.

His repatriation came as airline passengers in Scotland found themselves at the centre of an Ebola scare last night after their plane was quarantined at Aberdeen airport. Travellers on a British Airways flight from Heathrow were kept on the aircraft for more than two hours after a young African woman complained of feeling ill on the flight.

Environmental health officials and specialist medics immediately quarantined the aircraft until the sick passenger, who may have travelled from an infected region of West Africa, could be safely removed. The flight landed at 7pm and medics in protective suits and masks were seen boarding the plane while passengers looked on anxiously.

A man whose pregnant daughter was on the flight said: "They weren't told anything other than the girl was sick and quarantine measures were needed."

It is understood the woman was been transferred to the infectious diseases unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where further tests were being carried out.

The details of every passenger have been taken and they have all been advised of the symptoms of Ebola.

Aberdeen airport confirmed the plane was quarantined for just over two hours. BA apologised for the delay but said standard procedures had been followed.

The speed and extent of the latest Ebola outbreak has been "unprecedented", according to the World Health Organisation.

And yesterday authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo said two people had died from Ebola in the country's north west region.

They are the first reported Ebola cases outside West Africa, although it was not clear last night if the two cases are directly linked.

The number infected in the latest outbreak is estimated at 2,615.

THE last British man to survive the Ebola virus nearly 40 years ago said the public must be warned of its dangers.

Geoffrey Platt contracted the virus when he accidentally pricked his finger while taking a sample from an infected guinea pig at the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire.

The former laboratory technician suffered from vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash when he fell ill in November 1976.

He said: "I was in a tent in quarantine for 40 days by myself and I really don't want to bring up what happened to me."

Mr Platt, 80, of Salisbury, Wilts, added that steps must be taken to stop the virus reaching the UK.

He said: "There are people with much more expertise than me who will know how to warn of the dangers. It happened a long time ago to me and you would need to speak to someone else about warning of the dangers from this outbreak."

The Porton Down military installation was founded in 1916 and is the oldest chemical warfare facility in the world.

It wasn't until the 1960s that the government admitted the existence of the 7,000 acre site near Salisbury.

Grieving family distraught as relatives not told of virus fear

THE family of a man whose death was being treated as a possible Ebola case yesterday branded the Irish health authority as "disgusting" for releasing details without telling them.

Dessie Quinn, 43, was struck down with malaria after returning home for a holiday from Sierra Leone, where he works.

The civil engineer was found dead in a bedroom of a pal's home in the early hours of Thursday.

His devastated family only learned that his death was being treated as a possible case of Ebola AFTER the HSE issued a statement to the media that evening.

Yesterday, health bosses confirmed the deadly virus did NOT kill him.

Now the family want the official who released the original press release named and shamed.

Speaking to the Mirror at their home near Mountcharles, Co Donegal, Mr Quinn's family told of their outrage.

A brother of the deceased father of one, who asked not to be named, said: "Nobody needs to know what he died of. It's none of their business, it's our business.

"Who exactly in the HSE gave out this? You need to find out who sent it out and you need to put their name in the paper."

Mr Quinn's mother added: "It's disgusting what was done. We want an apology on the front page tomorrow of every paper that it was in today.

"We want privacy, we are in a state of shock and we don't want s**t like that turning up."

The HSE responded to the criticism last night with a spokeswoman saying: "The HSE was in contact with some family members from the outset of the tragic situation.

"The story broke in the media just before 6pm [on Thursday], at which point the HSE had to make a public statement on the matter, given the urgency and nature of a public health issue such as this."

Mr Quinn, the father of a five-year-old boy, was working with telecoms firm KN Network Services in the west African country, where his brother Martin had also been based.

The company has brought all expat staff out of Sierra Leone as a precaution following the outbreak of Ebola.

Mr Quinn, whose girlfriend and son live in Dublin, had returned to his family home in Doorin, Mountcharles, Donegal, to spend time with relatives and friends. Although he was being treated for malaria on his return, he was not an inpatient in hospital and was well enough to be out socialising with friends in the evenings before he died.

He had attended the Monte Charlo festival at the weekend and also watched his beloved Donegal beat Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter final in Dublin.

He had gone to bed at a friend's house on Wednesday night after complaining of feeling unwell. He was discovered dead at the home early on Thursday and his remains were later moved to Letterkenny General Hospital where they were kept in isolation while tests for the incurable virus were carried out.

Parish priest Father Adrian Gavigan said the family was given no information about fears over the Ebola virus before a statement was issued to international media on Thursday."

A WOMAN quarantined with suspected Ebola has been given the all-clear.

The woman was feared to be Britain's first case after she believed she had been exposed to the deadly virus on a trip to west Africa.

Officials confirmed the Cardiff woman did not have the disease - which has killed hundreds in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - after a 21-day incubation passed.

Irish health chiefs said Dessie Quinn, 43, who died at home in Co Donegal after working in Sierra Leone did not have Ebola.

YOU may have noticed recently that people who do my job have become about as popular as members of the National Union of Satanists, Cannibals and Traffic Wardens.

We've always been viewed with scepticism, but after the fall-out from the phone-hacking scandal your average journalist is now seen as the scum in the lining at the bottom of a scumbag.

Organisations like Hacked Off, lobbying for a State-regulated press, use articulate, high-profile actors to persuade the public into believing journalists should only be allowed to probe the lives of the rich and powerful when it suits Westminster politicians (aka the rich and powerful).

Had that been the case in recent times, journalists would not have been allowed to tell you how you were paying to renovate MPs' third homes on expenses, or how multi-millionaires were siphoning their earnings into tax-avoidance schemes. Because top-dollar lawyers would have convinced Parliament of the need to protect nt of the need to protect privacy. Do you think the families of Stephen Lawrence, the Hillsborough 96, or the thalidomide victims would have justice without journalists relentlessly fighting the Establishment to unearth the truth? The same Establishment that would administer state regulation.

Hacked Off say journalists need to be held legally to account. Well, apart from Britain having some of the most stringent Press laws in the world, the Met has launched its biggest-ever investigation into practices arising out of phone-hacking, which has so far resulted in 63 journalists being arrested, five convicted, three jailed, 28 awaiting trial, six on bail, 19 cleared of any offences and three found not guilty by a jury. Plus the newspaper at the centre of the scandal closed down. Which sounds to me like being held to account.

Talking of the Establishment, anyone notice its silence over Israel's atrocities in Palestine? How do you think you'd know what is really going on in Gaza without courageous reporters out there telling the story?

Did you read my colleague Tom Parry's brilliant frontline despatches from Ebol Wed tear-Mtm from Liberia on Monday about the Ebola tragedy. Or Chris Bucktin on Wednesday describing how he was tear-gassed during the race riots in Missouri. Both journalists risking their lives to bring you a truth you may not otherwise learn.

Just as those reporters out in Ukraine and Syria are doing. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 70 reporters have been killed in Syria since the conflict began. Indeed the CPJ claims that, worldwide, two journalists die every week in war zones. Professionals who are brave beyond the call of duty, like the Sunday Mirror's Rupert Hamer, killed in Afghanistan's Helmand, four years ago.

I wanted to know what Hacked Off made of James Foley, the journalist who literally had his head hacked off in Iraq while doing his job, so I checked out the latest news section on their website but found only blogs complaining about the press coverage of Robin Williams' death and why we need a royal charter to control our newspapers.

I also came across a long rant from Hugh Grant which ended with this assessment of tabloid journalists: "I see them as cowards and bullies."

And I wondered how many times Grant has been forced to dodge real bullets in his films, or his fellow foot soldier in the great war against truth and justice, Steve Coogan, has run the risk of bleeding to death in between takes?

Here's a deal, luvvies. You carry on whining about the Press invading your lives, while the bravest among my profession carry on laying theirs on the line.

FAMILY OUTRAGE AT HSE EBOLA SLUR

It's no one's business what Dessie died from, it's our business. We need to find out who sent that information out and they need to be named and shamed. It's...

THE distraught family of a man whose death was being treated as a possible Ebola case yesterday branded the HSE as "disgusting" for releasing details without telling them.

Dessie Quinn, 43, was struck down with malaria after returning home for a holiday from Sierra Leone, where he works.

The civil engineer was found dead in a bedroom of a pal's home in the early hours of Thursday.

His devastated family only learned that his death was being treated as a possible case of Ebola AFTER the HSE issued a statement to the media that evening.

Yesterday, health bosses confirmed the deadly virus did NOT kill him.

Now the family want the official who released the original press release named and shamed.

Mr Quinn's mother added: "It's disgusting what was done. We want an apology on the front page tomorrow of every paper that it was in today.

CRITICISM

"We want privacy, we are in a state of shock and we don't want s**t like that turning up."

The HSE responded to the criticism last night with a spokeswoman saying: "The HSE was in contact with some family members from the outset of the tragic situation.

"The story broke in the media just before 6pm [on Thursday], at which point the HSE had to make a public statement on the matter, given the urgency and nature of a public health issue such as this."

Mr Quinn, the father of a five-year-old boy, was working with telecoms firm KN Network Services in the west African country, where his brother Martin had also been based.

The company has brought all expat staff out of Sierra Leone as a precaution following the outbreak of Ebola.

Mr Quinn, whose girlfriend and son live in Dublin, had returned to his family home in Doorin, Mountcharles, Donegal, to spend time with relatives and friends.

Although he was being treated for malaria on his return, he was not an inpatient in hospital and was well enough to be out socialising with friends in the evenings before he died.

He had attended the Monte Charlo festival at the weekend and also watched his beloved Donegal beat Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter final in Dublin.

He had gone to bed at a friend's house on Wednesday night after complaining of feeling unwell. He was discovered dead at the home early on Thursday and his remains were later moved to Letterkenny General Hospital where they were kept in isolation while tests for the incurable virus were carried out.

Parish priest Father Adrian Gavigan said the family was given no information about fears over the Ebola virus before a statement was issued to national media on Thursday.

He added: "Truthfully I was angry. When I heard this report I went back down to the family home for the very reason that you'd wonder what are they thinking when they hear this. They were telling me that they were hearing this for the first time. It angered me, it did anger me.

"I don't know where the information was given and who was giving it. I know the immediate family didn't know.

"I am amazed by the approach. It is distracting for the family and it worsens their grief."

Independent Donegal TD Thomas Pringle echoed this anger, adding the first they knew about the investigation was when they heard it on the 6.01pm news on RTE. He raged: "It's disgraceful that the family weren't alerted before the statement was made public.

"They are very annoyed with the HSE. They are also annoyed with the media coverage of the event."

The HSE originally said it was investigating the death for suspected links to Ebola as a precaution and added that the risk of transmission was considered to be "extremely low".

It added appropriate infection control procedures were put in place in the community as a precaution. Scores of locals in the townland of Doorin called at the family home throughout Thursday to offer condolences, and relatives were not informed of any restrictions or precautionary measures.

The family had a nervous wait after details of the investigation emerged and it was only shortly after 12 noon yesterday that the tests returned negative for the virus.

Mr Quinn's mother said: "The doctors have just confirmed that it is not Ebola. Tell the papers to pull back a bit. Let them publish tomorrow that it was not what was suspected."

The HSE later said: "Laboratory test samples for an individual, who had recently returned from Africa, has proved negative for Ebola virus.

"Infection control procedures, which had been put in place as a precautionary measure, will now be stepped down.

"The HSE expressed its condolences to the individual's family and friends for their loss."

Bosses also denied they hadn't told the Quinn family and pointed out they didn't identify the man nor the country he had travelled from.

Mr Quinn's brother Martin had also worked in Sierra Leone for a number of years but left late last year. It is understood the engineer told people he was tested for the Ebola virus on leaving the west African country.

He has nine brothers, two of whom are returning from Australia for the funeral, and three sisters, one of whom has come home from New York.

KN Network Services issued a statement expressing its deepest sympathies. The firm said: "Dessie was an extremely hard-working and valued member of staff and was very popular with all his colleagues and he will be missed by everybody who worked with him,."

The company added it has offered support to the family in Donegal and is liaising with Mr Quinn's colleagues from Sierra Leone about the necessary support, updates, precautions and company contacts ahead of the blood test results.

It said: "KNNS have also had ongoing discussions with HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The company had already returned all staff from Sierra Leone as a precaution."

So far, 2,473 people are known to have been infected with Ebola. Around 1,350 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March.

HSE statement on Thursday... The HSE is currently assessing a suspected case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Donegal. The public health department was made aware earlier today of the remains of an individual, discovered early this morning, who had recently travelled to the one of the areas in Africa affected by the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. The appropriate national guidelines, in line with international best practice, are being followed by the public health team dealing with the situation. This means that the body of the deceased has been isolated to minimise the potential spread of any possible virus. Blood samples have been sent for laboratory testing to confirm whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease.

Grieving mum distraught as relatives not told of virus fear

FURIOUS relatives of a man the HSE publicly suggested may have been killed by Ebola slammed health chiefs yesterday.

Dessie Quinn's distraught family hit out as tests revealed he did not have the virus. The 43-year-old's grieving mum said: "It's disgusting what was done. We are in a state of shock."

The HSE issued a statement on Thursday evening saying Mr Quinn's body was in isolation amid fears Ebola killed him.

It claimed it had told his relatives "from the outset" but Donegal priest Fr Adrian Gavigan, who gave Mr Quinn the last rites, said: "It was told to the public, it was not told to the family." FULL STORY: PAGES 4 AND 5

WHEN I was in Guinea in March, I witnessed the initial spread of the Ebola virus.

But at the time none of us thought we were seeing the start of the most deadly outbreak on record which has claimed 1,350 lives.

As Plan Ireland's deputy regional director for West Africa, I am helping to direct our response in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

We have been working for four months to contain the disease's rapid spread.

In Liberia for instance, people have claimed the outbreak is "worse than war".

Part of a sound effort to halt the outbreak is to tackle the misconceptions people have towards the virus.

Some are not seeking medical attention as they believe Ebola can be attributed to witchcraft.

With weak health systems and a fast-spreading illness, this outbreak is one step ahead of the under-resourced response to combat it.

With no effective treatment, raising awareness of Ebola and the measures people can take are some of the ways to reduce infection and death.

Aid worker released from hospital as suspicious Irish death is probed

A DOCTOR who contracted Ebola while fighting the epidemic in West Africa was released from hospital yesterday after successful treatment with an experimental drug. Kent Brantly, 33, said "thousands of prayers" had helped him beat the virus.

A suspected Ebola case in Ireland is being investigated after a dad was found dead in Co Donegal yesterday.

The country's health authority said medics suspect the man - understood to be Dessie Quinn, 43 - was infected with the virus while working in Africa.

Neighbours said he may have been getting treatment for suspected malaria after returning from Sierra Leone within the past few weeks.

One source believed he had been working for a telecommunications company in the West African country.

Dad-of-one Dessie is thought to have been living with his partner in Dublin but was visiting his family in Donegal when he was taken ill. Health chiefs said the risk of transmission was "extremely low".

Dr Brantly and fellow American aid worker Nancy Writebol were flown to the US separately this month and given the pioneering drug ZMapp.

They spent three weeks in the isolation unit of an Atlanta hospital and Nancy was released on Tuesday. Dr Brantly, who was struck down by the virus in Liberia last month, thanked wellwishers.

Standing hand-in-hand with wife Amber and fighting back tears, he told a press conference: "Today is a miraculous day, a direct answer to thousands of prayers."

Dr Brantly, who had been in Liberia for two years with Christian aid group Samaritan's Purse, said his team took every precaution to protect themselves but as the epidemic worsened last month he sent Amber and their two children home.

He fell ill the next day but refused the only vial of drugs available in Liberia, insisting Nancy should have it.

Dr Brantly, of Fort Worth, Texas, was given an Ebola survivor's blood, which some docs believe contains antibodies able to fight off the virus. Both patients were then given ZMapp in the US.

In Liberia, riot police fired live shots and tear gas during the quarantining of capital Monrovia's slum area West Point to try to stem the spread of the virus.

South Africa yesterday banned noncitizens travelling from Ebola-hit Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from entering the country. More than 1,350 people have died from the virus in West Africa.

In Sierra Leone, a herbalist claiming to be able to cure Ebola was blamed for bringing it to the country as patients flocked to her from Guinea. She was killed by the virus, which was spread further at her funeral, officials said.

THE earliest symptoms of the Ebola virus are rising temperature as the body gears up to fight the disease.

In most cases crippling headaches then set in as the virus takes hold of its human host.

Early symptoms can begin from between two and 21 days of infection, but most start after between five and seven days.

Stomach pain then ensues as the condition begins to dissolve internal organs.

Medical experts have described its devastating effects as like "swallowing a bottle of bleach".

As the integrity of cells inside the body is worn away water seeps out of the blood and spreads through the body, triggering a drop in blood pressure. This often leads to a yellowing, jaundiced appearance in the eyes and skin, along with diarrhoea, vomiting and joint and muscle pain.

Some victims will experience a sore throat, with virus-laden lesions lining its inside in the later stages of the disease. Skin rashes are common and tissue will sometimes begin blistering, peeling and bleeding.

As the body struggles against the disease weakness sets in and a loss of appetite follows.

In the final stages before its host is killed massive internal bleeding can start as tissues fail.

Blood will also seep from the eyes, ears, mouth and other orifices.

This will eventually lead to death through multiple organ failure.

LIBERIA has quarantined slums housing at least 50,000 people in a desperate bid to control the Ebola outbreak.

President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ordered the area sealed by police as she admitted the deadly virus is rife in capital Monrovia.

She said: "We have been unable to control the spread due to continued denials, cultural burying practices, disregard for advice of health workers and disrespect for government warnings."

Ebola has killed 1,229 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria - but the death toll is rising fastest in Liberia, where 466 have perished.

SIX hundred people were quarantined inside a job centre in Berlin yesterday after a woman collapsed showing signs of contracting the deadly Ebola virus.

An employee notified authorities and the woman, a West African national, was taken to hospital where she was put in isolation.

The capital's fire department, which oversees medical emergencies, said: "The patient was showing symptoms of Ebola."

All 600 people quarantined within the job centre were in the suspected victim's vicinity.

Ebola cases in West Africa have risen to 2,240, including 1,229 deaths, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.

It added that it was working with the UN to get food to a million people in quarantine zones.

The 48-year-old who was found dead at her apartment in Austria at the weekend had visited Nigeria where at least four people are known to have died from the incurable disease.

Urgent analysis of blood, hair and urine samples from her body showed that she died from a viral infection.

The Tyrol's regional health chief Franz Katzgraber said the risk of her having had the Ebola virus was "at the lower end of the scale".

But he said it was vital to implement emergency measures even when there was just a suspicion.

Hundreds of people have died from Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and many more are suffering from its effects.

A BRITISH Nigerian woman died of a viral infection after it was feared she had contracted Ebola virus when her body was found in her home in Austria.

The 48-year-old was discovered at her apartment in the Tyrol at the weekend after she returned from a trip to Nigeria.

Blood, hair and urine samples have been sent to a tropical disease centre in Hamburg for urgent tests.

But last night the results cleared her of suffering from the killer disease, for which there is no cure.

The woman had travelled from Nigeria to Germany where she then flew back to her home in Vomp.

Her body was discovered at her flat on Saturday.

Austrian officials confirmed yesterday they implemented emergency measures following the suggestion she might have died from the Ebola virus.

The doctor who attended the scene where the body was found gave the cause of death as a viral infection.

Health bosses said they regarded the risk the woman had died from the Ebola virus as being at the lower end of the scale.

But they ordered precautionary tests, vital to implement emergency measures even when there was just a suspicion.

But the tests came back negative.

NOBODY can fail to be moved by the Mirror's heartbreaking reports from inside West Africa's Ebola zone.

Nobody can ignore the horror of what is now unfolding. The haunting tale of Layson Wilson, who sacrificed her life as she battled to save others, brings a human face to a tragedy which often seems far removed from life here.

Her story should be uppermost in our minds as we quicken our response.

Fears Ebola could soon spread to these shores appear well-founded, and it is essential every precaution is taken. But it is equally important the international community acts swiftly to halt the suffering at its source.

For Layson's story is already one of more than 1,000 fatal cases which have torn apart families and wrecked lives across four nations. And experts fear the spread of the disease is quickening. It is clear Africa is struggling to cope. Every Western government has a moral responsibility to do all it can to stop this crisis.

It is the very least that Layson's family, and so many more like them, deserves.

This came as a female detainee from Sierra Leone who fell ill at Dungavel immigration centre in Scotland was last night having tests for the virus.

NHS Lanarkshire said: "It is precautionary.

"It is highly unlikely the patient will test positive." World Health Organisation officials, meanwhile, said "extraordinary measures" were needed to halt the disease, which has killed 1,069 people.

The disease has spread through West Africa and Medecins Sans Frontieres president Joanne Lui said of the fight to control it: "We need six months. And I'm being, I would say, very optimistic."

THE Ebola crisis is destroying trade in one of the poorest countries in the world, it was warned yesterday.

Irish aid organisation GOAL says the state of emergency in Sierra Leone means there are no goods or services moving in or out of Kenema.

Aid workers in the stricken region are caring for more than 50 children orphaned by the virus, which has also claimed the lives of key medical staff and a police inspector.

GOAL said the deepening mistrust between health services and poor communities will take a huge toll on the country and the health system will likely take years to recover.

Since March, there have been 1,975 cases, of which 1,069 have died.

Many of the dead are health care staff but Canada has offered fresh hope as it is giving 800 to 1,000 doses of its experimental vaccine to protect some workers.

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland virologist Dr Christopher Logue will go to Guinea on Sunday to help fight the outbreak.

He works for Public Health England and will lead lab tests to check if people with symptoms have the virus.

Dr Logue will stay for a month and told the BBC: "It is slightly worrying."

Priest dies in isolation ward

A SPANISH priest who was the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola died in hospital yesterday.

Father Miguel Pajares, 75, had a fatal heart attack less than 48 hours after receiving the experimental US-made drug ZMapp.

He caught the deadly virus in Liberia, West Africa, and was flown to Madrid less than a week ago on a specially-adapted plane. There will be no postmortem examination because of the risk of spreading the virus. Instead the missionary is to be cremated in a sealed zinc coffin.

Spain's health ministry flew supplies of ZMapp from Switzerland at the weekend to Madrid's Carlos III Hospital where the priest was in an isolation ward.

He had been infected with Ebola while treating patients with the virus at a hospital run by the Catholic San Juan de Dios aid group. He is the first Ebola victim to die on European soil. So far the virus has claimed 1,013 lives and sparked a medical emergency across West Africa. Father Miguel's brother Gregorio, fighting back tears, said last night: "We're terribly upset.

We were hoping he would pull through because the reports we had were that he was stable and improving."

Father Miguel's home village of Iglesuela has declared three days of mourning.

Around 60% of those infected with Ebola have died in the current outbreak.

Two aid workers repatriated to the US are being treated with ZMapp. Liberia, one of the four countries in the front line of the outbreak, is being sent stocks of the drug.

Liberian president Ellen Sirleaf appealed to Barack Obama for the medicine and the US Food and Drug Administration approved the request last night.

A spokesman for Mrs Sirleaf said the drugs would be brought into the country by a US official later this week, along with further doses from the World Health Organisation.

The announcement came as it emerged a nurse in Nigeria has contracted the virus, taking the number of cases in the country to 10.

She had been in contact with Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who died of the deadly bug last month.

And 10 Chinese medical workers have been placed in quarantine in Sierra Leone.

The outbreak has killed 1,000 people in West Africa.

THE first person to be treated in Europe for Ebola is to be given an American experimental drug.

Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, 75, is in isolation in Madrid after being flown back from Liberia, in West Africa, on Thursday.

Doctors were yesterday given the go-ahead to treat him with ZMapp.

The drug has never been tested on humans but has already been used to treat US health workers Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. They are both improving.

Supplies of ZMapp were flown from Geneva to Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, where Mr Pajares is being cared for around the clock.

EPIDEMIC He was stable yesterday and not bleeding, which would be a sign the virus had reached an advanced stage.

His brother Emilio said: "We have scant news and are just waiting."

President Barack Obama has said it is too soon to send the ZMapp drug to West Africa - and very few doses are available.

The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has killed nearly 1,000 people. Last week, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak an international emergency.

A British Ebola vaccine developed by GlaxoSmith-Kline will start clinical trials "later this year" following promising results from tests on chimpanzees, the company said yesterday.

Unity call as virus spreads fast

THE killer Ebola outbreak will "get worse before it gets better", health chiefs admitted yesterday, as it was declared an international emergency.

At least 961 people have died from the virus and 1,779 have been infected since it took hold in February. The toll is expected to soar and World Health Organisation Director General Margaret Chan admitted: "It is moving faster than we can control."

The worst epidemic in almost 40 years has hit people in West African countries Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

After a summit in Switzerland, WHO said the chance of a further international spread was "particularly serious".

Ebola causes severe dehydration through vomiting, bleeding and diarrhoea. It has no proven cure and there is no vaccine. Head of Health Security Keiji Fukuda warned the outbreak could be "at a high level for months" and said: "Things will get worse before they get better."

Ms Chan added: "If we do not in global solidarity come together to help these countries, they will be set back for many years." Liberia now has emergency powers which let police and the army impose quarantines on affected communities. Yesterday Nigeria also declared a national state of emergency.

American doctor Kent Brantly, 33, last night spoke for the first time since catching Ebola while treating patients in Liberia.

Speaking from his hospital bed in Atlanta, Georgia, he said: "I am growing stronger every day. I thank God."

Heroic, selfless doctor deserves better treatment

While in Atlanta last week I watched with great interest Ebola victim Dr Kent Brantly appear gingerly from the back of his ambulance and walk unaided in to a specialist hospital as he battled the deadly virus.

The American, dressed looking like a 1960s astronaut in a biocontainment suit, had arrived back in the US aboard a specially equipped Gulfstream jet sent to medevac him out of Liberia which has been left ravaged by the disease.

The 33-year-old had moved to the west African country with his young family to join a charity dedicated to serving the poor and infirm and saving hundreds of lives in the process before becoming infected.

His selfless actions you would have thought would have seen him receive a hero's welcome as he touched down at Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Georgia.

After all it is difficult to think of anyone in recent times who has been so admired throughout the world for their work while being held up as an example of the good that lives among an increasingly nefarious world.

Even in the face of death Dr Brantly's kindness shone through as he insisted on the only shot of experimental serum for the virus be given to his colleague Nancy Writebol, who was also struck down with the disease. But despite the fact Ebola poses virtually no risk to most Americans, Dr Brantly's arrival back home wasn't what you would expect.

Instead of an army of well-wishers gathering at the hospital he was in fact greeted by anger by many of his countrymen.

Atlanta's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention at the Emory Hospital - one of only four specialist units in the US equipped to deal with such diseases - was bombarded with hate filled emails and phone calls.

Twitter was sent in to meltdown by users demanding he be turned away while several news outlets also questioned his arrival.

Much of the fury was fuelled by billionaire Donald Trump who wrote: "Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days. Now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!" His kind of reaction is nothing new in America.

The ability to think irrationally whenever a disease strikes is commonplace in the US especially when you consider that at least 75,000 people a year die from infections in US hospitals which are unable to handle the likes MRSA, C. diff and VRE.

In the 80s, "AIDS hysteria" gripped the nation with half of the population believing carriers should be placed in quarantine.

Almost the same number said sufferers should be forced to carry ID cards while more than one in 10 demanded they be tattooed so they could be easily identified.

But America knows exactly how Ebola spreads and they are perfectly able to contain it with safe procedures.

Like AIDS, it is not passed from human-to-human unless there is contact with bodily fluids as it is not an airborne virus.

And with that in mind Americans, admittedly often whipped up by their media, need to treat people like Dr Brantly with the same creed US soldiers bestow on their colleagues.

On induction each and every serviceman and woman swears "I will never leave a fallen comrade behind" and the US would do well to adopt the same approach to those who are equally prepared to give their lives in helping others albeit with a stethoscope and not a gun.

Twitter was in meltdown demanding the doctor be sent away

Priest, 75, flown back from Africa

A PRIEST yesterday became the first person carrying the killer Ebola virus to be brought back to Europe for treatment.

Medics and ambulance staff in full protective suits took Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, 75, to a hospital isolation ward in Madrid after he arrived on a military plane from Liberia.

He caught the virus in the West African country as he tended infected patients at a hospital run by his Catholic humanitarian group.

Mr Pajares was flown to the air force base in Madrid with a colleague, nun Juliana Bohi, who tested negative for the virus but has also been quarantined.

Javier Rodriguez, a health official in the city, said: "The patients have arrived well, though a little disoriented."

Despite reports that Mr Pajares's condition was worsening, medics yesterday said he was stable.

The priest and nun are being treated in a building cleared of other patients.

Liberia has declared a state of emergency over the Ebola crisis which has claimed 282 lives there. Some of the bodies have been left in the streets.

The virus, which has no proven cure, kills most of those who contract it.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond last night chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss the outbreak in West Africa which has killed 930 people.

He announced plans for Britain to commit a further £3million to improve health care in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Two US nationals repatriated this week after catching the virus are said to be showing signs of improvement.

THE rest of the world must do more to stop the spread of the Ebola disease.

Aid agencies are doing everything they can to help the terrified victims in some the poorest countries in the world. But they need more support if their efforts are to save lives.

The fear of the unknown and a lack of education and understanding of the Ebola virus is fuelling the terrifying outbreak.

Residents in the countries worst affected need to be taught how to recognise the symptoms and how to stop it spreading.

Education is the only way to contain this virus and the West needs to wake up to the fact that it's not doing enough to help.

EBOLA symptoms can take anything from two days to three weeks to show up.

The World Health Organisation says symptoms include: fever

extreme weakness

muscle pain

headaches

sore throats vomiting

diarrhoea

rash

impaired kidney and liver function

internal and external bleeding.

Once diagnosed, the patient must be quarantined and kept hydrated. There's no known cure or preventative vaccine.

Ebola can be contracted through body fluids and eating infected meat but it is not airborne.

Irish aid worker warning over 'regional crisis'

A LEADING Irish aid worker has described the Ebola outbreak in Africa as a "regional crisis".

Concern Worldwide boss Fiona McLysaght told of her first-hand experience of the horrific disease that has killed almost 1,000 people since February and sparked terror around the world.

And although the charity's head of operations in Sierra Leone said she and her colleagues are at low risk of catching the deadly virus, she urged the international community to ramp up support for the African country.

Qualified nurse Ms McLysaght, from Co Clare, told the Irish Mirror: "It's too big a problem for any one country to deal with.

"The health system in Sierra Leone is already weak and not able to support the health care needs of the population.

"It's important to have international support as this is a regional crisis."

However, ironically a fear of contracting the virus is keeping people with symptoms away from health centres. Ms McLysaght added: "There's a concern more children will die.

"At the moment we're trying to get that statistic on the numbers of child deaths from Ebola."

Concern workers in Sierra Leone are delivering basic protective equipment such as gloves to more than 100 health centres and providing information and training sessions to local communities on how to protect themselves from Ebola and what to do if they come across an infected person.

But speaking from Freetown in Sierra Leone, Ms McLysaght revealed cultural customs such as hand washing a body before a funeral have added to the crisis.

And she said that her dedicated team is warning people corpses can be highly infectious for some time after death.

Ms McLysaght added: "Sadly there's a very strict protocol to follow with an Ebola patient.

"When somebody becomes ill they're isolated and family and friends can't visit and that includes children.

"They're treated by people covered from head to toe in protective clothing, including goggles."

Ms McLysaght said Concern is also warning locals not to eat bush meat, such as that from monkeys and bats.

She added: "Ebola's host is the fruit bat and bat meat is eaten widely in Sierra Leone. It's difficult to change behaviours - one thing is awareness and another to change behaviour."

The Ebola virus has killed 932 people since February, with the latest victim dying in Saudi Arabia after contracting the virus on a business trip to Sierra Leone.

Health experts at the World Health Organisation are meeting in Geneva to discuss new ways of tackling the deadly outbreak.

President's bid to stop bug

AN Ebola-ravaged African nation declared a state of emergency last night.

Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf addressed the nation and warned that some civil rights may have to be suspended to help cope with the spiralling crisis.

She said: "The government and people of Liberia require now extraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people."

The state of emergency will last for 90 days.

In Liberia's capital Monrovia infected bodies are being dumped in the streets by relatives who fear they will be quarantined by the authorities. The Ebola virus outbreak has killed more than 900 people in WestAfrica so far and is out of control in some areas.

A US aid worker who caught the bug in Liberia is improving after being flown home to Atlanta, Georgia. Nancy Writebol, 59, is being treated with an experimental serum.

Spreading virus kills nurse

THE condition of a US aid worker with Ebola was improving yesterday as a nurse became the latest victim of the deadly virus.

Nancy Writebol, 59, who arrived at an Atlanta hospital in a protective suit, has been given a second dose of an experimental drug.

Meanwhile, a Nigerian nurse who helped care for the country's first Ebola patient has died.

Five other people, also thought to be health workers who cared for the man, have been infected with the virus.

Ebola has now killed more than 900 people in west Africa.

In the Liberian capital Monrovia - where Nancy was working with husband David - infected bodies are being dumped in streets as people fear being quarantined.

Government information minister Lewis Brown said: "They are removing the bodies from their homes and are putting them out in the street. They risk being contaminated."

Nigerian con artists target Ebola victims with witch doctor 'cure'

EXCLUSIVE

SCAMMERS are trying to get money out of Ebola victims by offering to cure them using black magic.

The Nigerian con artists are targeting frightened families by inserting messages into websites, including Irish ones, carrying information on the virus.

The epidemic has so far killed more than 700 people in West Africa, including western aid workers trying to tackle the deadly disease.

Scammers are targeting websites based here where articles associated with Ebola have been bombarded with messages promising a quick fix for victims.

Dr Ray Genoe, of University College Dublin's Centre for Cybercrime and Security Investigation, said the fraudsters had form for targeting the vulnerable. He added: "We've seen cases like this coming out for years now.

"Usually it happens with disasters. There was one years ago with the tsunami crisis. They were looking for money to try and help their so-called aid effort."

For €262 a man named Omokhagbon Osemuahu, from Benin City in Nigeria, said he could enlist the services of a witch doctor to cast the sickness out. He promised all it would take was any of the following items:

The heart of a Cobra

A red piece of clothing

The eyeball of a porcupine

The wings of a bat A 14-year-old tortoise

Seven hairs from a lion's private parts.

When contacted by the Irish Mirror, Mr Osemuahu said the disease had been sent by the devil and the only way to cast it out was through the witch doctor's "spiritual cure". And he claimed to have already cured five victims of the fatal virus.

Mr Osemuahu, who dubs himself Dr Zack Balo, also promised if payment was not made people would watch their brother "die in front of you".

Dr Genoe added: "This is just what these people do."

Plan Ireland's international head of disaster preparedness and response, Dr Unni Krishnan, said scams like this could undermine efforts to stop Ebola's spread.

He added: "Raising awareness of risk factors of infection and measures people can take is the only way to stop the disease.

"Simple measures such as hand washing can contribute to stopping the infection and its spread."

Fears for visitors to infected zones

HEALTH chiefs have tested 30 people in the UK feared to have the Ebola virus.

The revelation came as it emerged a Welsh woman has voluntarily put herself in quarantine after returning from an infected country in West Africa.

Public Health England confirmed last night "around 30" people have been tested for the killer bug across the UK but all results were negative. The majority are believed to be British.

Dr Brian McCloskey, the body's director of global health, said: "We have advised all frontline medical practitioners to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas.

"Following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing. In the unlikely event we have a positive case in the UK this information will be made available to the public.

"It is important to remember there has never been a case of imported Ebola in the UK."

Officials said the Welsh woman, who is confined to her home in Cardiff, had been under surveillance for a week and "seems well". She recently visited West Africa where more than 1,600 people have been infected and 887 killed in the latest outbreak.

Experts said people could not be tested before the onset of symptoms. As the woman is not sick she has not been checked.

In its early stages Ebola has flu-like symptoms and the usual maximum incubation period before they emerge is 21 days.

Meanwhile US aid workers Dr Kent Brantly and colleague Nancy Writebol, who contracted Ebola in Liberia, are improving after being given an experimental drug.

ebola virus bodies must be cremated

Burials are blamed for rising toll

THE bodies of Ebola victims must be cremated rather than buried, the government of Liberia ordered yesterday.

Hundreds of troops were sent to the capital Monrovia as fears rose over the killer virus being spread through touching the bodies - the local tradition at funerals.

Fights broke out between health workers and residents trying to bury another 20 victims yesterday. A further 17 bodies have been found dumped on the streets.

The order to burn all victims came as it was revealed that the woman feared to have died from Ebola at Gatwick airport at the weekend did not have the disease. She collapsed after arriving from Sierra Leone, but tests showed she had died from natural causes.

West Africa is experiencing the largest recorded Ebola outbreak in history, with at least 887 deaths blamed on the disease.

The total number of cases in the West African countries affected stood at 1,603 yesterday, according to the World Health Organization.

Liberia's Information Minister Lewis Brown said: "The situation will probably get worse before it gets better. We are over-stretched. We need support, we need resources, we need workers."

Liberia has seen 255 deaths so far, according to the World Health Organization. Sales of buckets have rocketed in its capital as scared people fill them with chlorine to disinfect hands. In Sierra Leone where 256 people have died, 750 soldiers have been moved to the worst-hit areas.

Nigeria has become the latest country to be hit with four cases.

Yesterday a doctor who in 1976 helped to identify Ebola told of his shock at its rapid spread. Professor Peter Piot, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, blamed leaders of states hit by the world's biggest outbreak for "failing to take the bull by the horns".

He said: "I'm really worried about what is going on in West Africa. Why? It's the traditional beliefs and distrust in health services and authority and the rejection of Western medicine."

British Red Cross workers have been sent to help support the relief effort. Spokesman Mandeep Mudhar said: "We are doing everything we can to prevent new infections and help raise awareness."

His work is made harder by having to wear a full-barrier uniform with gloves, mask and goggles.

Benjamin said: "It's incredibly hot and uncomfortable. It also creates a distance to the patient.

EBOLA TERROR AT GATWICK AS WOMAN DIES

AIRPORT staff last night told of their fears of an Ebola outbreak after a passenger from Sierra Leone collapsed and died as she got off a plane at Gatwick.

Workers said they were terrified the virus could spread globally through the busy international hub from the West African country which is in the grip of the deadly epidemic.

The woman, said to be 72, became ill on the gangway after she left a Gambia Bird jet with 128 passengers on board. She died in hospital.

Ebola has killed 256 people in Sierra Leone. A total of 826 have died in West Africa since the outbreak began in February. Tests are now being carried out to see if the woman had disease.

The plane was quarantined as officials desperately tried to trace everyone who had been in contact with the woman.

Airport workers face an anxious wait to see if the woman had Ebola. One said: "Everyone's just petrified.

"We've all seen how many people have died from Ebola, especially in Sierra Leone, and it's terrifying."

SYMPTOMS Speaking of the horrific moment the passenger collapsed, the shocked staff member added: "The woman was sweating buckets and vomiting.

"Paramedics arrived to try and help her. The next thing everybody was there… emergency crews, airfield operations, even immigration.

"They closed down the jet bridge and put the aircraft into quarantine.

"They took everyone's details, even the guy who fuels the aircraft."

The plane carrying the woman came from Freetown in Sierra Leone - a country with the highest number of victims from the disease. It stopped at Banjul in The Gambia before landing in Gatwick at 8.15am on Saturday after a five-hour flight. Public Health England tried to allay fears of an Ebola breakout in the UK.

It said the woman showed no symptoms during the flight. One official added: "Public Health England is aware a passenger arriving on a flight from The Gambia that landed at Gatwick airport on Saturday fell ill shortly after disembarking. The passenger was taken to hospital and sadly died.

"In line with standard procedures, tests are being undertaken to determine the cause of death.

"The patient's symptoms suggest that Ebola is very unlikely but as a precaution this is one of the tests being undertaken. The patient was not symptomatic on the plane and therefore there is no risk of Ebola being passed on to either flight crew or other passengers.

"England has world class health care and disease control systems which are active permanently, regularly tested and proven to be effective.

"As such, if the UK does see a case of imported Ebola, this will not result in an outbreak in this country."

South East Ambulance Service confirmed it had dealt with the sick woman at the airport.

Communications chief Janine Compton said: "We attended Gatwick airport at 8.30am on Saturday to attend an adult female patient who was seriously ill. She was taken to East Surrey Hospital in Redhill where she subsequently died."

A Gatwick airport spokeswoman added: "A passenger collapsed after disembarking a flight from the Gambia. She was treated by airport medical staff at the scene but died later in hospital. The cause of death is yet to be confirmed." There is no cure for Ebola. Symptoms in the later stages include external and internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. At this point the disease is highly contagious.

Victims have a 90% chance of dying, although doctors said in this epidemic the rate is 60%.

The outbreak began in the forests of eastern Guinea in February. It quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

A jump in the number of cases and the death toll has raised international concern and placed under-resourced health facilities in the West African nations under strain.

Last week, the Ebola crisis was described as out of control by World Health Organisation chief Margaret Chan and could be "catastrophic".

At the same time, Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and called in troops to quarantine victims. Liberia also imposed controls.

Ms Chan revealed 60 doctors, nurses and health care workers had now lost their lives trying to save others. She said: "This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it.

"If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socio-economic disruption as well as a high risk of spread to other countries."

Ms Chan met the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast. She told them: "This meeting must mark a turning point in the outbreak response."

BRITAIN'S top public health doctor has accused drugs firms of "moral bankruptcy" for dragging their heels over finding a vaccine for Ebola.

Prof John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, urged the pharmaceutical industry to treat Ebola as if it was taking hold in "Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster".

The professor added: "This is the moral bankruptcy of capitalism."

He compared the response to Ebola to that for Aids, which killed Africans for years before drugs were created once it spread to the West. He said: "The involvement of minority groups has contributed to a tardiness of response."

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, is being treated in a special isolation ward in Atlanta, Georgia. He was able to walk from an ambulance with help.

The father-of-two is being treated by infectious disease specialists at Emory University Hospital.

Dr Tom Frieden said it was too soon to tell if Dr Brantly would survive the infection, but added: "It is encouraging that he seems to be improving."

Dr Brantly, who works for the Christian organisation Samaritan's Purse, had been in Liberia responding to the worst Ebola outbreak on record.

Nancy Writebol, a second US aid worker who contracted the virus, is expected in Atlanta later this week.

Health experts say killer virus threatens global catastrophe

THE killer Ebola virus sweeping West Africa is spreading at an alarming rate and threatening to cross international borders, it was claimed last night.

The stark warning came at an emergency meeting of the World Health Organisation.

Director general Margaret Chan revealed 60 doctors, nurses and health care workers have now lost their lives desperately trying to save others.

She said: "This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If things continue to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives and severe socio-economic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries."

Dr Chan told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast: "This meeting must mark a turning point."

Describing the outbreak as the world's deadliest and largest in area, she said governments may need to impose strict population movements.

She added: "It is happening in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and the virus has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks."

As the death toll rose to more than 1,300 Dr Chan said that while the situation required urgent action experience had shown that "when well managed, an Ebola outbreak can be stopped".

She was speaking as two gravely-ill US charity workers struck down with the virus were being flown back to Atlanta - to the fury of many Americans, who fear they could spread the disease.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and hygienist Nancy Writebol, 60, who worked in Liberia, were being transported on a specially-adapted jet. They are expected to be admitted to an isolation ward at Atlanta's Emory University hospital.

But the move has caused a national outcry, with US tycoon Donald Trump leading the opposition. He slammed the decision to bring the pair home as "incompetent" and tweeted: "Keep them out of here!" But President Barack Obama yesterday denied underestimating the threat.

And he revealed that some delegates at an Africa summit in Washington will be screened for exposure.

He said: "We are taking the appropriate precautions. Folks from countries that have even an infinitesimal risk of having been exposed - we're doing the screening."

The latest outbreak of the virus, for which there is no known cure, began in eastern Guinea in February.

Ebola can kill up to 90% of those infected, though the fatality rate in the current epidemic is around 60%.

HOW politically convenient for Home Secretary Theresa May that the chief inspector of borders and immigration is leaving before the General Election.

With John Vine departing six months early, the Government will hope to be spared future embarrassment. Because Mr Vine used his independence to expose shocking complacency and incompetence.

The Tories talk tough about controlling our borders but, as we know from immigration staff complaining of lack of guidance on dealing with an air passenger suspected of carrying the Ebola plague, the Government's record is poor.

Insiders say Vine was fed up with the way the Tories spun his reports to deflect criticism and how May is sitting on two investigations.

We have a Home Secretary happy to smile for the cameras and blame someone else when anything goes wrong. The Tories will miss their manifesto immigration targets, failing to get the net figure down to tens of thousands from hundreds of thousands.

It's time May, not her staff, carried the can.

BORDER guards are not prepared for the arrival of Ebola in Britain, union chiefs warned yesterday.

The Immigration Services Union said that official claims the UK is ready to cope are wide of the mark.

General secretary Lucy Moreton said: "There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility. And until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff at all."

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has announced precautionary measures, with border staff and health workers said to be on the lookout.

Public Health England has issued guidance on symptoms to watch for.

But the ISU said its members have flooded its phone lines with queries on the correct procedures to take and how to best protect themselves.

Ms Moreton said: "They are concerned it appears Public Health England believe that they have had some form of training on how to recognise the symptoms of Ebola at the border. That simply isn't the case."

FEARS Lucy Moreton " She said border guards she has spoken to have no idea about what procedures they should follow.

Ms Moreton added: "They are the first point of contact usually for people coming off an aircraft. The concern is what do they do if they're confronted with someone that doesn't appear well."

Among those most at risk are health workers who have travelled to West Africa to help.

Obstetrician Benjamin Black, 32, of Manchester, has been working 24-hour shifts in Sierra Leone's second largest city Bo, in the Southern Province.

He described operating on pregnant women ill with the virus. He said: "I couldn't believe this was my first shift, on my first mission. I kept thinking I was going to drown in the pressure. The main challenge here is the authorities are overwhelmed."
