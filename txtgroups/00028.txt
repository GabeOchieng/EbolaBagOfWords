SIERRA LEONE has taken the unprecedented step of ordering the entire population to stay at home for three days as the authorities struggle to contain the Ebola outbreak.

The government has told all 5.8million Sierra Leoneans to stay indoors from Sept 19 to 21.

Soldiers and police will be deployed across the West African country to enforce the order, designed to halt the relentless spread of Ebola.

"The aggressive approach is necessary to deal with the spread of Ebola once and for all," said Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential adviser on the country's Ebola task force, according to Reuters news agency.

The worst-ever outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has claimed at least 2,100 lives in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. The number of recorded cases has risen to almost 4,000 in the four affected countries.

Unless the epidemic is contained, the World Health Organisation predicts that another 20,000 people will be infected in the next three months.

Médecins Sans Frontières, the French aid agency, has urged Western governments to deploy military field hospitals in West Africa to fight the epidemic. Local health systems have been overwhelmed, at least 20 health workers have died of Ebola and many hospitals have been forced to close.

Sierra Leone has suffered 491 deaths from Ebola so far. Its government has become the first to take the draconian step of telling the entire population to stay at home.

Whether the state has the means to enforce the order across the country is open to question.

Pianist James Rhodes goes on the warpath over music in schools

DON'T STOP THE MUSIC

Channel 4, Tuesday, 9.00pm

In trainers and t-shirt, concert pianist James Rhodes greets me with a big smile and a hug. Before he's even put his wallet and cigarettes down on the coffee table he's thanked me very much for coming then launched into a furious, expletive-laden tirade. "Music education is so f----- at the moment. It's such a lottery. I can't bear it - the injustice of it really gets to me."

He has come to tell me about his year-long investigation into how music is taught in state schools across the country for the two-part Channel 4 documentary Don't Stop the Music. In the film he visits schools with neither instruments nor music teachers, and discovers broken promises from the government that he calls "hugely deceptive and manipulative". So depressed and furious is he that he's started a campaign with Change.org to petition newly appointed education secretary Nicky Morgan on the subject.

He's also pioneered an ongoing nationwide "instrument amnesty", calling on us to take our disused instruments to a local Oxfam where he'll arrange for them to be knocked and strung into shape (by volunteers) and, thanks to delivery company Yodel, sent for free to primary schools willing to take part. "This is a call to arms!" he says. "There's a war on music. I know it sounds melodramatic, but if we don't do something soon it's going to fall off the radar." Rhodes talks quickly, his elegant long fingers burying his face when something frustrates him beyond words.

He is open about how classical music saved him from suicide aged 28 when he decided to retrain as a pianist (he'd had just four years schooling in piano from ages 14 to 18). "Music is the only thing that has never let me down," he says. Outspoken about the lifelong effect of abuse he suffered at primary school, about leaving university to go to drugs rehab, and about his time later in a psychiatric ward - the inspiration for the moving Channel 4 series Notes from the Inside last year - he still struggles with depression. "It's a daily reprieve. I don't think it would take much to throw me off balance… but we're all quite fragile however we try to mask it.

Rhodes, now 39 and preparing for his second marriage, to fellow-musician and Telegraph blogger Hattie Chamberlin later this month, says: "We all need something that we believe passionately in, whether it's writing or painting or cooking. Music is such a lifeline. It's so important."

The responsibility of schools to teach grammar and language shouldn't be at the expense of helping young people find a passion, he says. "This is about much more than a clarinet. It's about emotions, confidence, relationships and discipline."

While filming the film Rhodes decided to see if his plan for transforming one school's music department, relying on volunteer teachers and donated instruments, could work. "Naively I thought I'd go into these schools and say, 'Hey! I want to teach music!' And they'd all go, 'Ah thank God!'" The reality was quite different. Harrow-educated Rhodes didn't know what school budgets might look like, or how much red-tape would get in the way. "There were things I hadn't considered - where are the instruments going to be stored, how are you going to find time in a curriculum already stretched too thin?"

Still, his efforts at transforming an orchestra of nine- to 10-yearolds at St Teresa's in Basildon, Essex (where pupils previously played margarine tubs, copper pipes and dustbins), are remarkable. "Like a lot of people in this country, I chronically underestimated the kids. I thought: if it's not a phone app, they won't be interested. They were amazing - kind, funny… And there was genuine talent."

Musical education was one of the signature triumphs of postwar British schools. "Like the NHS it was a brilliant thing. It should be the envy of the world. People left school with an understanding of what music is, how to read it, who Elgar was. In a generation that has been eradicated. In the state sector, it's now pretty much non-existent."

In 2011 the new cabinet promised to "enable every child to have the chance to learn to play a musical instrument for at least a term and ideally for a year". According to Rhodes a minority of schools have made progress but the new system is largely ineffective; it still falls on schools to choose to apply for grants, for which there is little incentive when music is not on Ofsted's agenda. Rhodes says he's been trying to meet with the education secretary "for months" to discuss a plan and hold the government to account for promises made three years ago. "They don't give a s---. It's easy to think music is a luxury, but the legacy that leaves us with is something we should all feel ashamed of."

You might think Rhodes's enthusiasm idealistic - but it may not be unrealistic. To quote Rhodes's school piano teacher's first report: "If enthusiasm equalled talent, James would already rival the greatest pianist alive."

Scott & Bailey

ITV, 9.00PM

Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) and Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) are back for a fourth series of the hugely popular detective drama. At the end of series three, we saw the Manchester murder investigation duo putting aside some big differences in order to save the life of their kidnapped boss DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore). Tonight, though, they're in competition with one another for a promotion that would make one of them the other's line manager. Will their fractured friendship survive it? The answer to that question lies at the heart of the new series, which begins with a tangled investigation into the disappearance of a vulnerable teenager.

For the first time, ace writer Sally Wainwright (who wrote 19 of the 22 previous episodes) has no involvement, the success of Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley drawing her talents elsewhere. But Bullmore doubles up her role as super–efficient DCI Murray with writing four of this series' eight episodes and on the evidence of this engrossing opener (and previous contributions) she is more than up to the job, setting up some deliciously fraught storylines to play out over the rest of the season. (She does have form as a writer, having also written for This Life and Big Train). As ever Sharp and Jones get the chemistry just right, especially when it's veering towards the brittle, and the arrival of major new influences in their lives should guarantee their relationship stays as tricky as fans clearly like it to be.

The spread of the world's worst Ebola outbreak has accelerated, with close to 1,000 deaths in the past month alone, according to the World Health Organisation. The number killed in West Africa since March has risen to 1,850 – a doubling in four weeks. Health experts are meeting in Geneva to discuss experimental therapies and vaccines for the virus.

What are the 10 possible cures and vaccines for Ebola?

Doctors from around the world are meeting in Geneva to discuss ten possible vaccines or cures for Ebola - which has killed 1,900 people - amid warnings from MSF that we are "losing the battle" to halt its spread

Doctors from around the world are gathering in Geneva to discuss the possible usage of ten vaccines and cures for Ebola, as the virus continues to spread with ever-increasing speed.

The World Health Organisation (WHO), which is hosting the conference, said earlier this week that 1,900 people are now known to have died of Ebola – mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Seven people have died in Nigeria, which has counted a total of 22 cases, while one case has been confirmed in Senegal. And at least 30 more people have died in a separate outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

An American doctor, 51-year-old Rick Sacra, has become the third US medic to be infected with Ebola. He was working in Liberia and on Friday was being flown to a hospital in the American state of Nebraska for treatment.

And although this is already the worst outbreak of Ebola in the 40-year history of the disease, experts say that its true scale is far larger than official estimates.

"Many deaths are in the community and are not being reported," said Tarik Jasarevic, WHO spokesman. "It is estimated that there are two to four times as many people infected with Ebola as reported."

The two-day closed-door meeting of some 200 health experts has been convened to discuss eight potential therapies, including ZMapp, as well as two experimental vaccines.

Much attention has focused on ZMapp, the unproven drug which was given to seven patients – two of whom died. William Pooley, the British nurse who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, was released from hospital on Wednesday having been treated successfully with ZMapp.

But the limited supply is now exhausted and its developer says it will take months to make even a modest amount.

"The consultation has been convened to gather expertise about the most promising experimental therapies and vaccines and to consider their contribution in containing the Ebola outbreak," said the WHO in a working document published ahead of the talks.

Aside from ZMapp, seven further treatments are being debated.

One is the use of convalescent plasma – blood transfusions taken from survivors of Ebola, which are given to the victim in the hope that antibodies in the plasma will fight off the virus.

The WHO cautions, however, that more research is needed and "the logistics of blood collection are an issue". It says that the first batch of convalescent plasma might be available by the end of 2014.

Another option is hyperimmune globulin – which can be used to treat rabies, tetanus and hepatitis B. The treatment is created by purifying and concentrating the plasma of immunised animals or previously infected humans.

But the drug is not currently available, and the WHO says that large-scale batches for use in humans is not expected before mid-2015.

A fourth suggestion is using viral genes to stop the virus reproducing.

A single-dose study in healthy volunteers found side effects including headaches, dizziness and chest tightness. It is, however, one of the more advanced treatments being considered, and the US Food and Drug Administration has authorised emergency use in patients. It says there is potential for the production of 900 courses by early next year.

A catchily-named "phosphorodiamidate oligonucleotide" is another option. That is a chemical added to the basic building blocks of DNA, which works by changing the genetic make-up of the virus inside the patient, and destroying it. Scientists say that early studies are encouraging, and that 20-25 courses should be available by mid October.

Perhaps the most widely-available treatment – if deemed effective – would be a drug called Favipivavir, which has been used in Japan to treat influenza. More than 10,000 doses could be available – but it has not yet been tested on humans with Ebola.

Interferons has been shown to delay death of monkeys infected with Ebola, but not increased their survival chances.

And the real wild card of the eight proposed treatments is something called Biocryst, which, the WHO says, has had no human safety studies and needs animal treatment before it can be considered.

Two vaccines are also being discussed.

One uses chimpanzee "adenovirus" – a type of virus which causes a wide range of illnesses in humans and animals – and has been administered to more than 1,300 people for protection against diseases other than Ebola. It is hoped that it could also be used for the virus.

The second potential vaccine is known as rVSV, and has been developed by a Canadian company. On Thursday they won approval to begin first phase clinical trials.

The company describes its vaccine as being "based on attenuated strains of vesicular stomatitis virus, a common animal virus, modified to express an Ebola virus protein that is non-pathologic in primates and mice."

Eight hundred doses are currently available.

The Geneva specialists will debate the relative values of all ten treatments and vaccines, and discuss how best to conduct trials.

"It is critical to balance the need for rapid access to investigational products with the need to gather data on the safety and efficacy of the products," the WHO said, and advised that using drugs in haste to test them was not ideal.

"Therefore, use of clinical trials to evaluate and provide access to these products is recommended over purely compassionate use mechanisms, when possible."

Delegates from West Africa, in particular, said that they were determined to reach an agreement on the medicines.

Medical agency Medecins Sans Frontieres Tuesday that said the world was "losing the battle" to contain Ebola.

"Everybody keeps asking why isn't this medication made available to our people out there?" said Samuel Kargbo, from Sierra Leone's ministry of health.

"Our doctors who have been treating patients are also dying, and it's not made available."

Death toll from Ebola in West Africa hits 1,850, as global health experts meet in Geneva to discuss experimental treatments

The spread of the world's worst-ever Ebola epidemic has accelerated rapidly with close to 1,000 deaths in the last month alone, World Health Organisation (WHO) figures show.

With the overall West Africa death toll since March reaching 1,850, the new statistics show deaths from Ebola have more than doubled in just four weeks.

The surge in cases comes as health experts meet in Geneva to discuss experimental therapies and vaccines in an emergency two-day WHO summit.

The meeting, which began Thursday and ends today, sees experts from the private sector as well as health officials and policymakers discuss eight experimental treatments and two vaccines not yet licensed for standard use.

But "while extraordinary measures are now in place to accelerate the pace of clinical trials", new treatments or vaccines are not expected for widespread use before the end of 2014, the WHO said.

Scientists from Johnson & Johnson this week said they would fast-track tests on an Ebola vaccine into human testing by early 2015.

"Because of the emergency we decided to focus on the Ebola Zaire strain, which is the one in the West Africa outbreak, and that's why we can accelerate the programme significantly," chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters.

The move is one of several accelerated trials, following a decision to begin initial human testing of a GlaxoSmithKline vaccine this month and plans to test one developed by Canadian government scientists, which has been licensed to NewLink Genetics, in the autumn.

Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said there were more than 3,500 cases across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Guinea warned on Thursday that the spread of Ebola had penetrated a new part of the country.

The current outbreak was first detected deep in the forests of southeastern Guinea in March.

Guinea previously said it was containing the outbreak, but yesterday announced that nine new cases had been found in the prefecture of Kerouane, some 470 miles southeast of the capital Conakry.

However the spread has been even more rapid in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, as the above graph shows.

Nurse is declared free ofEbola, and says he won't be returning to Africa in a hurry

WILLIAM POOLEY, the British nurse who contracted Ebola in West Africa, was at home with his family in Suffolk last night after recovering from the virus.

Mr Pooley, 29, who became infected while treating patients in Sierra Leone, said he had no plans to return to the country and joked that his mother would be pleased that his passport had been incinerated.

He was evacuated 12 days ago by the Royal Air Force and underwent treatment in an isolation tent at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Yesterday he was discharged by doctors who said he was clear of the virus and no longer contagious.

Mr Pooley said he had feared he would die and felt "wonderfully lucky" to have survived the disease, which has killed 57 per cent of sufferers in the outbreak sweeping West Africa.

"I am most looking forward to seeing all the rest of my family, seeing friends, seeing people in the village and just relaxing for a few days, and spending some nice time in the Suffolk countryside," he said.

"They incinerated my passport. My mum will be pleased to know that I am not going anywhere at the moment.

"It hasn't affected how I feel about my career. My work in Sierra Leone is a real privilege; to go to look after people when they are suffering. That's what being a nurse is all about.

"I have no regrets. But I need some time. I don't know exactly what the medium term holds."

More than 1,500 people have died from the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria and double that number have been infected. The World Health Organisation has warned that there could be 20,000 victims before the outbreak is brought under control.

Mr Pooley described how he was tested for the disease after feeling sick and was woken by a doctor from the WHO.

"He was in PPE (personal protective equipment) – I knew it was bad news.

"The lowest point was immediately after I was told really. It suddenly hit me that I would have to tell my parents. That was the hardest thing. I was worried that I was going to die."

The nurse was flown back to Britain on August 24 and treated with the experimental drug ZMapp.

He suffered high temperatures and some stomach problems but avoided the worst symptoms.

He praised the "world–class care" he received at the Royal Free Hospital and thanked the Government and the RAF for getting him home so quickly.

He added: "I was very lucky in several ways: firstly in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in West Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.

"The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease – people I have seen dying horrible deaths. I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying.

"The level of care and the level of skilled professionalism and compassion that I received is not the same in West Africa."

Recalling his time in Sierra Leone, he said: "I have mixed memories, some great memories and some horrible memories – lots of people dying.

"But also some wonderful memories of people going home, people showing massive spirit and cheer, despite the horrible conditions, the truly heroic people that I worked with, people that went on to get sick, so it is a massive mix of memories."

After more than a week in an isolation chamber, Mr Pooley appeared in public for the first time yesterday.

Describing the experience of being isolated, he said: "It was really busy, especially for the first few days – there was lots going on.

"I was constantly doing my obs (observations). I was having fluids and blood tests, things like that.

"So I was really busy actually and I didn't have a lot of time to really ponder the full potential of the illness." He said that coming out of the isolation tent had been a "special moment" and expressed his gratitude to health staff who found supplies of ZMapp, which is running out across the world.

Dr Michael Jacobs, the infectious diseases consultant who treated Mr Pooley, said the nurse posed no contagion risk to members of the public. However, the doctor said not enough was known about the disease for him to be able to say whether Mr Pooley was now immune. He said it was likely he could still be infected by a different strain.

Dr Jacobs added: "The virus is clear from the body and there is no risk to the wider community in any way."

Mr Pooley's case provides more evidence that ZMapp may be a cure for the disease.

Last week a study showed that the drug cured 100 per cent of monkeys who were infected with the illness.

Has a cure for Ebola been found?

William Pooley's recovery adds weight to claims that the experimental drug ZMapp can cure Ebola.

The drug is a blend of three laboratory–made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus.

Two US doctors who were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia recovered after being given the drug. The treatment reversed symptoms including excessive bleeding, rashes and liver damage.

However, it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or simply got lucky. About 47 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. Previous epidemics have killed more than 90 per cent of those infected.

Mr Pooley's disease was caught early and he was treated before symptoms could take hold. At least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late.

Research published last week in the journal Nature suggested that 18 rhesus monkeys infected with Ebola all made a complete recovery after being given ZMapp. Three untreated animals died.

Ebola kills by overwhelming the immune system and sending the body into shock as blood pressure drops to dangerous levels. Where ZMapp has been unavailable, management of the Ebola outbreak in Africa has been confined to palliative care and preventing transmission.

Western military teams urged to take up the fight against Ebola

WESTERN countries should send military medical teams to Africa to avoid "losing the battle" against the Ebola outbreak, the head of a leading aid agency said yesterday.

Ebola has swept through four countries in West Africa, claiming at least 1,552 lives in the worst epidemic on record. Local health systems are overwhelmed, particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and doctors and nurses have often been infected. There is a desperate shortage of intensive care beds for people with the virus – and of testing facilities for those showing symptoms. As a result, people who could be infected often feel they have little reason to come forward.

Dr Joanne Liu, the international president of Médecins Sans Frontières, told the United Nations that every government was "failing to come to grips with this transnational threat" and the "world is losing the battle to contain it".

The crisis had reached such proportions that "riots" were breaking out in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, while in Sierra Leone "infectious bodies are rotting in the streets".

The "treatment centres" established for people with Ebola had become "places where people go to die alone, where little more than palliative care is offered", added Dr Liu.

So far, the number of recorded Ebola cases stands at 3,069 in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.

But the World Health Organisation predicts that another 20,000 people will be infected in the next three months.

Dr Liu urged Western countries to escalate their response and dispatch military medical teams. "We have been losing for the past six months: we must win over the next three," she said.

"To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment. I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities."

In Britain's case, this might involve deploying an Army field hospital – or providing airlift or logistical support for others to do so.

During previous Ebola outbreaks, Médecins Sans Frontières has used specialist treatment centres with 30 beds. The aid agency's facility in Monrovia currently has 200 beds – and it needs about 1,000 to cope with the number of cases.

Dr Liu called for a "regional network of field hospitals" to be established in West Africa, supported by "dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment".

She added: "Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control."

The panic caused by the spread of Ebola was illustrated by a scene in Monrovia yesterday. Video footage, which has not been independently verified, apparently shows an Ebola patient walking through a market in the city.

The man had supposedly escaped from a treatment centre. The video shows him being caught by four medical personnel wearing yellow protective suits. He struggles and tries to escape, before being bundled into a waiting vehicle.

British nurse William Pooley will return to his family in Suffolk after being apparently 'cured' of Ebola at the Royal Free Hospital in London

British Ebola victim Will Pooley has been discharged from hospital after apparently being cured of the deadly disease.

Pooley, 29, a volunteer nurse who caught the virus in Sierra Leone, said he had ‘no regrets’ that his work had exposed him to danger, but said he will not be returning to outbreak-stricken country in the near future, because his passport has been destroyed.

He said he was planning to recover with his family in Woodbridge, Suffolk, and added that his mum would be delighted to learn that he would be staying in Britain.

“They incinerated my passport,” he said: “My mum will be pleased to know that I am not going anywhere at the moment.

“I am most looking forward to seeing all the rest of my family, seeing friends, seeing people in the village and just relaxing for a few days, and spending some nice time in the Suffolk countryside."

“I have no regrets. It hasn’t affected how I feel about my career. My work in Sierra Leone is a real privilege; to go to look after people when they are suffering. That’s what being a nurse is all about.

However he said he had no plans to return to West Africa.

“I have no regrets. But I need some time,” he said. “I don’t know exactly what the medium term holds.”

Pooley was flown back to the UK on August 24th and treated with the experimental Zmapp at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

At a press conference at the hospital today he looked visibly thinner, but doctors said he was now clear of the disease.

He said he had feared for his life after being woken by doctors in protective clothing and diagnosed with the disease.

"It was a bit disturbing to get that diagnosis but I had been half expecting it because I had been feeling sick."

"There was no one point when I thought ‘you know? I’m going to die’ he said.

“The lowest point was immediately after I was told really. It suddenly hit me that I would have to tell my parents. That was the hardest thing. "I was worried about my family, I was scared."

“But it just seemed so comic. At the time I couldn’t help but laugh at the craziness.”

Mr Pooley said he had suffered high temperatures and some stomach problems but avoided the worst symptoms.

He praised the "world-class care" he had received at the hospital and thanked the Government and RAF for getting him home so quickly.

He said: "I was very lucky in several ways, firstly in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in west Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.

"I had amazing care, which was one difference.

"The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - people I have seen dying horrible deaths. I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying.

“The level of care and the level of skilled professionalism and compassion that I received is not the same in West Africa.”

Mr Pooley said coming out of the isolation tent at the hospital had been a "special moment".

He said he was extremely grateful to health staff who had worked to find supplies of the drug ZMapp which are running out across the world.

Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Mr Pooley, said he posed no contagion risk to members of the public.

However, Dr Jacobs said not enough was known about the disease for him to be able to say whether Mr Pooley was now immune. He said it was likely he could still be infected by a different strain.

He added: "The virus is clear from the body and there is no risk to the wider community in any way."

Dr Alain Kohl, MRC Programme Leader, MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: “This is fantastic news, but it also shows that with suitable general treatment of the symptoms of Ebola (e.g. treatment for dehydration), infected patients have a better chance of survival (we don’t know whether ZMapp was responsible for this patient’s recovery).

"We must step up efforts to improve general healthcare in the regions affected by the current outbreak but also in other regions that are at risk.”

British nurse described himself as "very lucky" to have survived after catching the deadly virus Ebola while volunteering in a Sierra Leone hospital

Ebola victim William Pooley has been discharged from hospital as he told how "very lucky" he is to have survived the deadly virus.

The volunteer nurse, the first Briton known to have caught Ebola in the current outbreak in West Africa, was flown back to the UK for treatment on August 24 after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone.

Mr Pooley, 29, was being cared for at a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London but the hospital announced he was being discharged on Wednesday morning.

Speaking at a press conference, he said he had been "very lucky" to survive and told how his symptoms had never progressed to the worst stages of the disease.

He said he had "some pretty high temperature for a few days from the day I was evacuated" but "I never had any vomiting".

"I was very lucky in several ways," he said. "Firstly in the standard of care which I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in West Africa at the moment despite a lot of aid organisations' best efforts.

"My symptoms never progressed to the worst stages of the disease. [Compared to] the people that I've seen dying horrible deaths, I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to the worst of the disease."

The nurse, who comes from the small village of Eyke in Suffolk, was airlifted back to Britain in a specially equipped C17 RAF aircraft.

Colleagues said he caught the disease, transmitted through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, because he was working such long hours that he was bound to “make a mistake” in his precautions.

He is credited with saving dozens of lives by making sure a hospital at the centre of the outbreak remained open.

The Department of Health said he was “not seriously unwell” when he arrived in the UK but experts had predicted it could be months before he was cleared.

Mr Pooley was being treated with the experimental drug ZMapp – the same medication credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries earlier last month.

It had been thought that supplies of ZMapp had run out, but doctors at the Royal Free Hospital managed to get hold of some from abroad.

British nurse William Pooley is 'doing well' and eating 'bacon butties' his father Robin has said

The British nurse who contracted the deadly Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone appears to be recovering and is even enjoying bacon sandwiches, his father said.

William Pooley has been in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in London since he was flown back to Britain last month.

His father Robin Pooley said that he son was doing ‘pretty well’ and was even sitting up and eating ‘bacon butties.’

Mr Pooley, 29, is being given the same drug that was credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries .

It had been thought that supplies of ZMapp had run out, but doctors at the Royal Free managed to get hold of some from abroad and Mr Pooley was given the first dose 10 days ago. Further doses are expected to be given to him "in due course".

There is no cure for Ebola, but encouraging results with people who have been given ZMapp suggest it is the nearest thing to a cure currently available. A study last week suggested that it cured 100 per cent of monkeys.

The drug has not yet been tested for safety or effectiveness on humans and its manufacturer, California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, only started developing it at the start of 2014.

In Sierra Leone, where Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer at a hospital in Kenema when he tested positive for Ebola on Saturday, patients are given little more than paracetamol and water, to stave off fever and dehydration.

The current outbreak has killed 57 per cent of people who have caught Ebola.

Mr Pooley's family are at the hospital but will only be able to see him through the plastic tent that isolates him from staff and visitors to stop the virus spreading through bodily fluids.

A suspected Ebola patient caused panic in a market in Liberia [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] ’s capital when he left a clinic to find food.

The man was caught by four medical personnel wearing yellow protective suits and bundled into a vehicle. Video footage, which has not been independently verified, shows a frightened crowd gathered near the scene in the capital, Monrovia.

The man, clad in shorts and a red t-shirt, apparently resists the medics and tries to avoid being taken back to the Ebola clinic. He is eventually overcome and driven away.

At least 1,378 people have been infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia, according to the World Health Organisation, and 694 have died so far.

Rotherham: anger isn't enough – budgets can't be cut

Our outrage is wasted if there is no means to safeguard vulnerable children

It would be nice to think that lessons will be learnt from the scandal that has unfolded in Rotherham. But I wonder if they really will. It would be a mistake to think that the depravity and abuse went on solely in the Yorkshire town.

The real scandal is that the same is undoubtedly happening elsewhere in other towns and cities.

I worry that the issues raised by Prof Alexis Jay’s report, which found that “blatant failures” in the town’s care system led to the sexual abuse of 1,400 children, remain too sensitive for us to deal with.

While the nation is bewitched by grotesque tales of historic sex abuse involving celebrities, the questions raised by Rotherham strike closer to home – a little too close for comfort.

Children are abused by people from all walks of life. But it would be foolish not to accept that there is a minority of men, often Muslim – and, in particular, those from Pakistan – who view women in a different way to the rest of us.

I was brought up in Slough and remember the repeated harassment of my sister and my female friends by young Asian men who viewed white girls as “easy”. A few years ago, I found myself working in child psychiatry and came across exceptionally vulnerable young girls who told me stories almost identical to those we’re hearing from Rotherham.

What is particularly chilling was the organised nature of the abuse – precisely what young girls described to me: meeting men in car parks, being passed around their friends like objects, given drink and drugs, and threatened if they refused sex. This flagrant disregard for morality and the law of our country is the result of the twisted logic of multiculturalism, which thinks two cultures with opposing views on women can exist without repercussion.

Scandals such as Rotherham are the result of a society that for too long turned a blind eye to female genital mutilation, to forced marriage, to honour killings. Such beliefs are promoted by a culture that forbids or discourages women from living independent lives, from even learning English. I, along with every other doctor who has worked in inner-city hospitals, have seen countless Muslim women forced to communicate through a relative acting as a translator, subservient and reliant on their husbands.

Refusing to pander to cultural differences is only the first step in sending a clear message to the minority in those communities who persist in treating women this way.

But our outrage and opprobrium is wasted if there is no mechanism to safeguard the most vulnerable children. And this is where I fear the worst.

As a doctor, there is only so much I can do when confronted on a ward by these wounded girls. I can patch up their self-harm, wipe away their tears and send them back. Beleaguered social workers are inundated with referrals, all equally horrifying and in need of attention.

Yet budgets for local authorities and social services are increasingly cut, and demoralised social workers are leaving in droves.

Earlier this year, the NSPCC warned that cuts to social services are so serious that social workers can do little more than respond to emergencies. Just one in nine children at risk received adequate support. I have nothing against reducing government spending but, surely, there are some areas that must be ring-fenced?

When I reported one young girl in care, who was being passed around gangs of young men for sex, the weary response from her social worker was that she was now nearly 16, so what was the point in investigating?

But if we are really going to stop the grooming of children and sickening rape gangs, we need to accept that being horrified is not enough: it takes money and resources.

E-cigarettes: let’s end the inflammatory claims

The medical profession seems to have it in for electronic cigarettes, doesn’t it? Last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended banning e-cigarettes from indoor spaces, arguing that they emit toxic chemicals that could affect bystanders. But where is the evidence? There isn’t any. So why on earth make such inflammatory and unhelpful statements?

As a former very heavy smoker, I’m amazed that doctors and health professionals struggle to grasp the overwhelmingly positive impact of the e-cigarette on our relationship with smoking.

It is the fear of living without cigarettes that prevents many from trying to quit. For the first time, smokers feel that there is a real alternative without having to give up entirely. It allows them to wean themselves off tobacco and prepare for the day when they give up nicotine entirely. Studies have shown that e-cigarettes are more effective than traditional methods, such as nicotine- replacement gum, patches or sprays, of helping smokers to quit.

The theoretical risks of the chemicals that might – or might not – be present in e-cigarettes are nothing compared to the proven effects of inhaling cigarette smoke. The WHO needs to stop its scaremongering until it has some evidence to back up its claims.

These Ebola volunteers could save our lives

We will never know their names, but there are a group of people to whom we may well owe our lives.

Later this month, the first trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola will be tested on a group of volunteers. The vaccine uses a protein that is a component of Ebola, and so volunteers will not be infected with the actual virus.

However, it’s an incredibly brave thing to agree to do and, even though those given the vaccine will remain anonymous, we should all be thankful for their selfless contribution to helping fight this horrific disease. The trial is being coordinated by Oxford University, and the vaccine developed with a £2.8 million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development.

I’m immeasurably proud that this country is leading the way in finding treatments in the fight against and prevention of Ebola. For such a small country, we can hold our heads up high for the outstanding contribution we have made, and continue to make, to medicine.

Girl had recently returned from family trip Sierra Leone and displayed symptoms of high fever

A Canadian girl who returned recently from Sierra Leone is under observation in a hospital in Quebec after showing possible symptoms of Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/], according to the CTV television channel [http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-headlines/quebec-girl-in-isolation-after-showing-possible-ebola-symptoms-1.1983546] .

It reported that the girl, along with her mother, had been visiting relatives in the West African country which is the epicentre of the outbreak, responsible for the bulk of the 1550 recorded deaths.

On Friday, the United Nations said the true toll may be far higher and could eventually claim 20,000 victims.

So far all suspected cases in North America have eventually tested negative for the deadly virus.

Health officials in Gatineau told CTV say the girl was brought to the hospital with a high fever, and is now in an isolation unit. However, they do not believe the girl was in contact with anyone carrying the disease - the main mode of infection.

A British nurse, William Pooley [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11058052/Ebola-sufferer-William-Pooley-did-not-take-risks-while-working-with-infected-patients.html], 29, from Suffolk, is currently undergoing treatment with experimental drug ZMapp at the Royal Free Hospital in London after contracting the disease in Sierra Leone.

Meanwhile the West African state of Senegal became the fifth country to be hit by the world's worst Ebola outbreak on Friday, while riots broke out in neighbouring Guinea's remote southeast where infection rates are rising fast.

Experimental treatment for disease proves effective for monkeys

A TREATMENT for the Ebola virus may have been found, as scientists reported that a drug cured 100 per cent of monkeys with the disease.

The experimental drug ZMapp is being used to treat infected patients, including William Pooley, the British nurse being cared for at the Royal Free Hospital in London after contracting the disease in Sierra Leone.

But health experts were unsure how effective the treatment was because no trials on humans have yet been conducted.

However, a study has now found that 18 rhesus monkeys infected with the disease made a complete recovery after being given ZMapp.

Three animals that were untreated became seriously ill and died.

Experts said the results were "extremely encouraging" and "better than expected", while the scientist who discovered Ebola in 1976 called for clinical trials to begin. "This well–designed trial in non–human primates provides the most convincing evidence to date that ZMapp may be an effective treatment of Ebola infection in humans," said Prof Peter Piot, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

"It is now critical that human trials start as soon as possible."

ZMapp is a blend of three laboratorymade antibodies that neutralise the virus.

Two US doctors infected in Liberia recovered after taking the drug. But it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or whether they were just lucky. About 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment.

At least two patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late.

The new research was published on the website of the journal Nature.

The World Health Organisation has warned that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa could eventually kill more than 20,000 people.

Latest figures show 1,552 deaths from the 3,069 cases reported so far.

Currently there is no approved vaccine.

The treated monkeys were exposed to a lethal level of the virus before receiving three doses of ZMapp, three, four and five days after infection.

Three weeks after they were infected, no trace of the virus could be detected in the animals' blood.

The untreated monkeys all died by day eight after infection.

Senegal became the fifth west African country to confirm a case of Ebola yesterday after a student arrived from neighbouring Guinea carrying the disease.

Awa Marie Coll Seck, the health minister, said the young man had turned up for treatment at a hospital in the capital Dakar on Tuesday but concealed that he had had close contact with victims in his home country. More than 1,550 people have died in the worst Ebola outbreak in history, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Six people have also died in Nigeria.

E-cigarettes saved my sanity during my recovery, and I bless the people who invented them. I am able to use them in most cafés, pubs and restaurants, although never during a meal, and my wife is delighted that the furniture no longer “stinks”.

David Craddock

Radstock, Somerset

SIR – What a pleasure it has been, since the smoking ban came into effect in 2007, to breathe in clean air and no longer have to gaze at things through a haze of smoke.

Whether or not e-cigarette vapour causes lasting harm to bystanders is a consideration for the experts, but the thought of breathing in visible vapours exhaled from strangers is just as distasteful as breathing in cigarette smoke was.

As a reformed smoker, fortunate enough to have seen the light through the smoke many years ago, I am in favour of banning e-cigarettes from public buildings.

Barry Morris

Bath, Somerset

SIR – I am a seasoned smoker whose lung capacity has greatly improved thanks to e-cigarettes. I am therefore disappointed to discover the World Health Organisation wants proof that e-cigarettes do no harm.

We know inhalation of sulphurous and other gases is bad. To ensure coherence of policy, will they now regulate flatulence to avoid passive inhalation? They could start by prohibiting entry to public places within four hours of eating boiled eggs.

THE number of Ebola victims in West Africa may be four times higher than reported and could exceed 20,000 before the disease is brought under control, the World Health Organisation has admitted.

Figures published by the UN health agency yesterday suggested that 3,069 people have been infected by the virus and 1,552 people have died in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.

The WHO warned that the victims could number 12,000, and announced a road map for dealing with the outbreak that planned for 20,000, and would cost an extra £300 million over nine months.

Dr Bruce Aylward, the WHO's assistant director–general for emergency operations, said the current crisis "far outstrips" any historic Ebola outbreak, and complained that airline restrictions on flying in and out of West Africa were hampering the emergency effort.

William Pooley, the British nurse who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone, is continuing to be treated with the experimental drug ZMapp in London.

Volunteers at Oxford University will be given an experimental vaccine against Ebola in emergency clinical trials to begin in September, it has been announced. Up to 10,000 doses are being made for quick use if trials are successful. The vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health, is being fast–tracked with a £2.8million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Department for International Development.

It will use a single Ebola protein and will not infect the subjects with live Ebola virus.

British volunteers will be injected with an experimental vaccine against Ebola in emergency trials to begin next month

Volunteers in Oxford will be given an experimental vaccine against Ebola in fast-tracked emergency clinical trials to begin in September, it has been announced.

The vaccine will use a single Ebola protein and will not infect the subjects with live Ebola virus.

At the same time that trials are beginning at Oxford University, up to 10,000 doses will be made to ensure that it can be more widely used quickly if the trials are successful.

The vaccine being developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health is being fast-tracked with a £2.8m grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development.

Initially 60 volunteers will be injected with the vaccine at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and if they show a good immune response with few side effects then a further 40 volunteers will be given the vaccine in Gambia.

The team, led by Prof Adrian Hill, will begin injecting volunteers as early as mid-September once they receive ethical and regulatory approval.

The volunteers will not be exposed to Ebola after they have been vaccinated, instead blood tests will show whether their body has developed protection against the virus.

The jab, which has already shown promise in animals, is being developed in response to the biggest ever Ebola outbreak that is gripping West Africa, having claimed more than 1,400 lives already.

British nurse, William Pooley, 29, caught the virus while working with victims in Sierra Leone. He was flown home on Sunday and is said to be sitting up and talking to doctors and nurses caring for him in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Prof Hill said: “The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response. In recent years, similar investigational vaccines have safely immunised infants and adults against a range of diseases including malaria, HIV and Hepatitis C. We, and all our partners on this project, are optimistic that this candidate vaccine may prove useful against Ebola.”

Justine Greening, International Development Secretary, said: “We are co-funding these important clinical trials to find a safe vaccine for Ebola as well as providing critical care on the ground. Britain is a world leader in medical research and mobilising our unique strengths to find a vaccine could be pivotal to containing Ebola and preventing future outbreaks.”

Dr Moncef Slaoui, Chairman of Global R&D and Vaccines at GSK said: “Today’s announcement shows how private and public partners can pull together to respond to this critical public health emergency. Developing a new vaccine is complex with no guarantees of success and it’s still early days for our Ebola vaccine candidate. But we are encouraged by progress so far and will do the best we can, along with WHO and our partners, to speed up development and explore ways in which the vaccine could contribute to the control of this or future Ebola outbreaks.”

If the first volunteers vaccinated in the Oxford study show a good response with no adverse reactions, the trial will, after approval from the relevant authorities, be extended to volunteers at the MRC Unit in Gambia.

A second West African arm of the study will then begin in Bamako, Mali.

The Oxford study will involve 60 healthy volunteers, while those in Gambia and Mali will each involve 40. Each set of volunteers will be split into groups of 20 that will receive different doses of the vaccine so researchers can evaluate the best dose to use in terms of both safety and activity.

Parallel trials are taking place in America, in addition to a related vaccine that is designed to protect against this and another strain of Ebola.

It is hoped that these trials might be finished by the end of 2014, after which deployment of the vaccine could be fast-tracked should it prove to be safe and effective.

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “This epidemic has shown how difficult it can be to control Ebola. How useful drugs and vaccines might be in complementing existing public health interventions can only be assessed in epidemics. The initial safety work we're announcing today with our international partners will hopefully make that possible during this crisis and for inevitable future epidemics.”

Professor Umberto D'Alessandro, Director of MRC Unit, Gambia, said: “Thanks to the long-term collaboration between the UK’s MRC and the Gambian Government’s Ministry of Health, we have the proven capacity and expertise to carry out trials to the highest quality standards including trials for vaccines similar to this one. The proposed trial won’t benefit immediately those currently at risk but we hope that in a not too distant future we may be able to protect people against Ebola.”

Ebola victims in West Africa could hit 20,000

The number of Ebola victims could hit 20,000, the World Health Organisation has warned, as scientists trace disease back to 'patient zero' in Guinea

The number of Ebola victims in West Africa may be four times higher than has been reported and could exceed 20,000 before the disease is brought under control, the World Health Organisation has admitted.

New figures published by the UN health agency today suggested that 3,069 people have been infected by the virus and 1,552 people have died in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.

But the WHO said the outbreak was ‘continuing to accelerate’ and warned that the true number of victims could be already around 12,000.

It comes as new research suggested that the outbreak began with just one infected person in Guinea - 'patient zero' - and rapidly spread between humans.

The Harvard University-led study also found that the disease had jumped to Sierra Leone after 13 women became infected at the funeral of an herbalist – a traditional healer who had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea.

It is customary in African burial rituals for mourners to embrace the body of the deceased, and health agencies have warned that this could spread the disease.

The authors found that the recent strain spread from Middle Africa within the last decade, probably through fruit bats.

The study has also highlighted the high toll that the disease has taken on health workers and scientists. Of the 50 co-authors who helped collect the data, five have since died from Ebola.

Stephen Gire, a research scientist at Harvard, said: “There is an extraordinary battle still ahead, and we have lost many friends and colleagues already like our good friend and colleague Dr Humarr Khan, a co-senior author here.”

The WHO yesterday said that controlling the outbreak would cost an extra £300 million over the next nine months and require more than 12,750 emergency workers.

Dr Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general for emergency operations, said the current crisis ‘far outstrips’ any historic Ebola outbreak.

"What we are seeing today, in contrast to previous Ebola outbreaks: multiple hotspots within these countries - not a single, remote forested area, the kind of environments that have been tackled in the past.

“And then not multiple hotspots within one country, but international disease."

The 20,000 cases figure, said Dr Aylward, "is a scale that I think has not ever been anticipated in terms of an Ebola outbreak."

On Wednesday Air France canceled all flights to sierra Leone by Dr Aylward said airline restrictions were hampering the emergency effort.

"Right now there is a super risk of the response effort being choked off, being restricted, because we simply cannot get enough seats on enough airplanes to get people in and out, and rotating, to get goods and supplies in and out and rotating, so this is a big part of what has got to be sorted."

Meanwhile volunteers in Oxford will be given an experimental vaccine against Ebola in fast-tracked emergency clinical trials to begin in September, it has been announced.

The vaccine will use a single Ebola protein and will not infect the subjects with live Ebola virus.

At the same time that trials are beginning at Oxford University, up to 10,000 doses will be made to ensure that it can be more widely used quickly if the trials are successful.

Aid workers are too often the unsung heroes

It is not just war zones that pose risks to aid and rescue workers

William Pooley has never sought fame and celebrity for himself, and yet his arrival in Britain yesterday aboard an RAF plane was covered by live television. The reason for this interest was that Mr Pooley had contracted the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone, and was being taken to a London hospital for treatment. Some have warned of the risks of importing such a deadly disease; but it is emblematic of the gulf between advanced and developing countries that we can isolate and treat victims without triggering an outbreak here whereas countries such as Sierra Leone and Guinea have no such facilities.

It was to help address this impoverishment that encouraged Mr Pooley to go to Africa as a volunteer nurse, one of thousands of humanitarian workers who travel to the world’s trouble spots or disaster areas motivated only by a desire to help others. He had already been working in a hospice in Sierra Leone providing palliative care before then moving to a hospital to work with ebola patients. An executive with the Christian charity for which he works calls him “a hero”, a word often bandied about but which seems singularly appropriate here.

It is a proper description, too, of the doctors, nurses, engineers, drivers and other aid workers currently working in dreadful circumstances in Syria, Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan – not least because their status is no longer the guarantor of safety that it once was. Last year was the most dangerous on record for humanitarian workers, with 155 killed, 171 seriously wounded and 134 kidnapped. So far this year, 79 aid workers have died, according to figures compiled by the Humanitarian Outcomes partnership.

Ironically, many are the unwitting victims of increased humanitarian spending by state donors. With the extra funds, aid agencies can push further into conflict zones where the needs are greatest, but where staff are exposed to worsening levels of violence. The impartiality of aid workers should be respected by all sides in a war; but such an appeal is unlikely to sway the murderous jihadists in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere who consider anyone fair game for kidnap and killing. Some foreign aid workers are accused of acting as spies; others are targeted because they work for Christian organisations.

It is not just war zones that pose risks to aid and rescue workers. They run the risk of succumbing to disease or injury while helping to find or treat the victims of disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. Or, like Mr Pooley, they voluntarily put themselves in harm’s way, motivated not by the desire to be well known, but by selfless sacrifice.

British Ebola sufferer William Pooley given experimental drug ZMapp and sitting up in bed

William Pooley being given the same drug that was credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries

The British Ebola sufferer William Pooley is being given the experimental drug ZMapp and is sitting up, talking and reading in his hospital bed, his doctors have revealed.

Mr Pooley, 29, is being given the same drug that was credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries earlier this month and was described today as a “resilient and remarkable young man”.

It had been thought that supplies of ZMapp had run out, but doctors at the Royal Free Hospital managed to get hold of some from abroad and Mr Pooley was given the first dose on Monday. Further doses are expected to be given to him "in due course".

The staff looking after him at an isolation unit in the Royal Free had lengthy discussions with Mr Pooley about the possible pitfalls of taking the unlicensed drug before he gave them the go-ahead to prescribe it.

Dr Michael Jacobs, consultant and clinical lead in infectious diseases at the hospital, said: "We have had the opportunity to give him the ZMapp treatment that I am sure you are aware of.

"It is an experimental medicine, we made that absolutely clear in our discussions with him."

Dr Jacobs added: "What has become apparent to us is that he is clearly a rather resilient and remarkable young man."

Mr Pooley’s condition was described as “very stable”, and he is sitting up in bed, talking, reading and is in good spirits.

Dr Jacobs said: "We are giving him the very best care possible. However, the next few days will be crucial. The disease has a variable course and we will know much more in a week's time.

"Will is in a stable position and we are very pleased with where he is. It would be fair to say we couldn't hope to be in a better place today given how far he is into the illness.

"What we want to do is give him the best chance we can and that's why we used the ZMapp. He was very, very keen to go ahead and wanted to do so," he said.

"We thought there was sufficient reason to offer it to him and have the discussion. He considered his options very, very carefully. It is an experimental drug. He wanted to weigh up what we knew about it and he came to the very clear conclusion in his own mind that he would like to go ahead with the treatment."

He said it was "too early" to say what impact the drug has had but added: "Pleasingly, it seems to have had no side effects at all."

Mr Pooley was said to be in "remarkably good spirits given the situation he finds himself in".

There is no cure for Ebola, but encouraging results with people who have been given ZMapp suggest it is the nearest thing to a cure currently available.

The drug has not yet been tested for safety or effectiveness on humans and its manufacturer, California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, only started developing it at the start of 2014.

It was given to the two US aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, after they were flown to a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, from Liberia.

Both have since been discharged from hospital after recovering. But others treated have been less fortunate. A Liberian doctor and a Spanish priest who received the plant-derived drug in Africa both died.

On its website, the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says: "At this time, very few courses of this experimental treatment have been manufactured.

"Since the product is still in an experimental stage, it is too early to know whether ZMapp is effective.

"The manufacturer of this experimental treatment continues to research and evaluate the product's safety and effectiveness.

"It has not yet been tested in humans for safety or effectiveness and much more study is needed."

In Sierra Leone, where Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer at a hospital in Kenema when he tested positive for Ebola on Saturday, patients are given little more than paracetamol and water, to stave off fever and dehydration.

The current outbreak has killed 57 per cent of people who have caught Ebola.

Gabriel Madiye, director of a hospice where Mr Pooley had been working before volunteering to treat Ebola patients in Kenema, said: “From my sources I understand he is doing fine and he is receiving good care.

“He phoned me just after he arrived back in England and said he would call me in another two weeks, when he said he would have recovered.”

Mr Pooley's family are at the hospital but will only be able to see him through the plastic tent that isolates him from staff and visitors to stop the virus spreading through bodily fluids.

Ebola sufferer William Pooley 'did not take risks' while working with infected patients

Nurse William Pooley said 'if you don't make any mistakes and everything is done properly then you will never catch Ebola when you are working'

Will Pooley, the first British person to contract the Ebola virus, ‘did not take the same risks’ as other nurses working with infected patients in Sierra Leone and was concerned about personal safety, it has emerged.

Jo Dunlop, a journalist, said she met Mr Pooley while he was working at Kenema hospital six weeks ago and told how he had saved dozens of lives despite the health risk.

Writing in The Guardian [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/26/will-pooley-ebola-british-nurse-on-work-sierra-leone], she said: “The issue of personal safety and that of his colleagues was a concern for Will. But the possibility of becoming infected just did not seem like an option for him. He assured me at one point that ‘the PPE that we wear protects you against Ebola, full stop really. If you wear it and you don't make any mistakes and everything is done properly then you will never catch Ebola when you are working’.

“He also said that he did not take the same risks that his colleagues had taken and operated very differently to local nurses. 'A simple example is that it's very normal for staff to eat onsite in a moment of going in and out of the ward. I don't do that. So I'm protected by circumstance in some ways and also I'm a lot more afraid than the local nurses so I take more precautions’."

When the close-knit community in Freetown heard of Mr Pooley's positive test result on Saturday it was a devastating blow and cruel reminder that those most at risk of catching Ebola are health workers, Dunlop wrote.

Mr Pooley described patients dying in front of him and then being unable to find help to shift their bodies, which meant leaving bodies lying next to other patients.

He also talked about everyday life at the heart of the Ebola outbreak. There were people up, walking and recovering, children playing, sometimes singing and even rare moments of laughter. He described women in recovery, saying: "They were sitting around singing songs, you wouldn't see that on a ward in England, you wouldn't see people singing like that."

Mr Pooley told of his determination to perform a role that so many simply refused. "I know it's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference, in nursing terms I'm not particularly experienced, or skilled, but in this situation I can really make a difference and make things a lot less bad,” he said.

Yoko, a Sierra Leonean nurse, spent a lot of time on the ward alongside Mr Pooley. She said: "We have a lot to thank William for, he has motivated us, he has encouraged us."

The leader of the hospital, Matron Josephine Sellu, also praised him. "William has come here and offered to help in this war against Ebola, we thank him for that. He has taught us things, he has helped our nurses."

Dunlop added: "The last time I saw Will he told me: 'At the start, especially, I could feel the weight of the horror that is the inside of the Ebola ward but you quickly get used to it. I don't go on to the ward each morning with that same dread of the corpses and blood that I did to start with. It has become a bit routine now'."

Faith can be the perfect antidote to mean spirits

'I am thrilled to be alive," Dr Kent Brantly said, rejoicing at his "miraculous" survival last weekend. The American medical missionary had every reason to be grateful: after treatment with an experimental therapy, he has recovered from the Ebola virus which is killing thousands in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

But Dr Brantly's heartfelt gratitude has struck some as inappropriate – even cruel. They argue that Uncle Sam, not God, saved the young Oregon physician. He was, one commentator sneered, "whizzed home" by the American authorities, to a hospital in Atlanta, where ZMapp, an antibody serum, was administered. Thousands of Africans were not so lucky. They died.

Now Dr Brantly speaks of his gratitude to the same God that has overseen the Ebola outbreak.

The secularist finds this baffling and downright nasty: how can Brantly thank God for saving him, while knowing that men, women and children back in Liberia are dying all around him of the same virus? Surely only a Wasp's arrogance explains Brantly's reaction. He thinks he is one of the chosen few who deserves God's help – in the form of an expensive drug – and damn the rest.

Beyond this sneering, though, the unbeliever wrestles with a question that, ever since Job, has bothered the faithful too: how can an all–knowing, all–loving God allow for horrors like Ebola?

Dr Brantly has faith. And he would answer that it does not help to understand God's ways, but to accept them. Faith means total surrender to the divine will. The young missionary is giving thanks to God, because he believes He has saved his life; but he would have just as readily died with a "praise be to God" on his lips.

This total abnegation of the self requires extraordinary humility and sometimes, as in Dr Brantly's case, extraordinary courage. He displayed both when he left his safe American home and doctor's salary, because "God called us to serve the poor" in Liberia. There, he received his first Ebola patient back in June – "and after her there was a steady increase" in the numbers seeking his help.

Dr Brantly was ready to die for his patients and for his faith. He is not alone. Christian missionaries are combating Ebola in west Africa even now, and also teaching in schools, running orphanages, counselling trauma victims. Their dedication has earned them admirers throughout the continent – and beyond: even the arch–atheist Richard Dawkins was moved to include on his website an article by Matthew Parris (also an atheist) that praised Evangelical missions, and concluded "Africa needs God".

Those of us who have encountered them will agree that Christian missionaries such as Dr Brantly deserve praise rather than snide comments. In the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, my family was befriended by an elderly American couple, missionaries who for more than 30 years had travelled across francophone Africa. The Comorians did not face Ebola but palu, a virulent form of malaria. Dr and Mrs Barnet drove their ancient Jeep around the islands and set up makeshift clinics, handing out tablets and, when these failed, words of comfort. My father, then a very casual Catholic, once asked Dr Barnet how his faith survived such tragedy. "My faith," replied the good doctor, "brought me here, to confront this tragedy."

From Save the Children to the End Fund, plenty of nonfaith organisations are trying to help Africans combat Ebola. Like Kent Brantly, they deserve our support. But I suspect that should one of their doctors or nurses be infected, their survival will not provoke snide commentary. Not that Dr Brantly will let such attacks worry him. Faith does not always guard against illness or death; but it does guard against the meanness of others.

Several drugs are in development to treat Ebola but none have been licensed yet

Several drug companies are in a rush against time to produce experimental medicines that can be used to help Ebola victims.

The World Health Organisation will host a consultation on potential Ebola drugs on 4 and 5 September, in Geneva.

The drugs include:

ZMapp

Made by Mapp Biopharmceutical, is a monoclonal antibody meaning it binds to the surface of the virus. Several are used in cancer and in a similar virus to Ebola. Only a few doses were available and supplies have now run out.

The drug is made from genetically modified tobacco plants and may take months to manufacture.

Six people are known to have been treated with it, the status of two is unknown, two died and two have survived.

Antiviral drugs

These reduce the amount of virus the person is shedding meaning they are less infectious and they can shorten the length of time people are ill.

A company called BioCryst is working to develop an antiviral drug to treat Ebola virus that is expected to begin Phase 1 testing later this year.

Japanese firm Fujifilm Holdings has also an antiviral that has been approved to be used in the treatment of flu which it believes may be useful against Ebola.

The company has sufficient supplies of favipiravir, also known as Avigan, to treat 20,000 people and is offering them to the World Health Organisation

Vaccines

The Canadian government have donated 1,000 doses of an experimental vaccine, called VSV-EBOV, to the World Health Organisation. It has never been tested on humans but a spokesman said it has 'shown promise' in animal trials.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in America is working on developing an Ebola vaccine and trials are due to begin shortly.

The National Institutes of Health is working with the Crucell biopharmaceutical company on an Ebola/Marburg vaccine and with Profectus Biosciences in its Ebola vaccine.

Additionally, NIH and the Thomas Jefferson University are developing an Ebola vaccine based on the established rabies vaccine.

The American Department of Defense is working with a company called Newlink to develop an Ebola vaccine candidate.

Rumours have circulating in Nigeria that drinking salt water can cure Ebola and at least two people have died in this way.

Japan offers flu drug that may treat disease

BRITAIN'S first Ebola victim may be treated with a new flu drug after the medicine was offered to the NHS by Japan.

The drug, called favipiravir or Avigan, its brand name, prevents the virus from multiplying and was made available for treating Ebola patients after experts found similarities with the flu virus.

Several experimental drugs are under consideration by doctors treating William Pooley, 29, a volunteer nurse who contracted Ebola while treating victims in a remote area of Sierra Leone.

He was flown home in an isolation unit on an RAF plane and taken directly to the Royal Free Hospital in north London which has an isolation unit for patients with dangerous infections.

Dr Alain Kohl, of the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: "There are common aspects between influenza and Ebola and a molecule targeting a common step or process may work."

There are no approved drugs to treat Ebola, but pharmaceutical companies are trying to get early medicines into clinical trials. However, there is a risk when a drug is tested on people for the first time, and doctors will be reluctant to chance an untested treatment on a patient, Dr Kohl said.

"Generally, the patient's health would be stabilised by balancing fluids and electrolytes, maintaining blood pressure and treating any other infections, i.e. bacterial, that could worsen the condition. If the patient's condition deteriorates, a decision to test an experimental drug has to be taken," he added.

Patients may recover with supportive treatment alone, such as through provision of intravenous fluids and maintaining of oxygen levels, especially when, as in the case of Mr Pooley, the disease is caught early. Doctors have said Mr Pooley is not seriously unwell.

Fifty–seven per cent of people known to have caught Ebola in the current outbreak have died. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the magnitude has been underestimated, and many more may have been killed without being recorded. WHO said counting new graves has been the only way to estimate deaths in some areas.

The outbreak is the biggest recorded, and experts have warned that experimental drugs are not likely to make a significant impact because they are in such short supply. ZMapp, a drug used to treat two American missionaries, has run out and more will not be available for several months.

US missionaries were cured with wonder-drug, but William Pooley will have to rely on more familiar treatment such as 1p paracetamol tablets to fight off the deadly Ebola virus

In the US, Ebola sufferers have been cured using an experimental wonder-drug, but a British nurse who contracted the deadly virus is likely to be given paracetamol by doctors at a London hospital, it has emerged.

William Pooley, 29, is “doing fine” at the Royal Free Hospital, where he is being kept inside a plastic tent in an isolation unit to stop the virus spreading.

There is no cure for Ebola, so his recovery will depend in part on his body’s ability to fight off the infection, and doctors are concentrating on keeping his strength up to give him the best chance of doing so. Over-the-counter drugs can ease the symptoms of Ebola while the immune system is fighting it.

Dr Emma Thompson, consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: “Paracetamol is used to keep the temperature down and for pain relief [in Ebola cases]. Intravenous fluids, blood products to correct clotting problems and antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, if they occur, are other important aspects of supportive treatment.”

In Sierra Leone, where Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer at a hospital in Kenema when he tested positive for Ebola on Saturday, patients are given little more than paracetamol and water, to stave off fever and dehydration.

The current outbreak has killed 57 per cent of people who have caught Ebola, but Mr Pooley’s chances of survival will be improved by access to western healthcare, such as oxygen to help him breathe and drip-feeding to keep him hydrated if he is vomiting.

In the US, two missionaries recovered from Ebola after being given an experimental drug called ZMapp, but supplies of it have run out and doctors at the Royal Free will only consider other experimental drugs if his life is in imminent danger.

In the meantime, Mr Pooley will rely on rather more familiar drugs such as paracetamol, which costs as little as a penny per 500mg tablet.

Gabriel Madiye, director of a hospice where Mr Pooley had been working before volunteering to treat Ebola patients in Kenema, said: “From my sources I understand he is doing fine and he is receiving good care.

“He phoned me just after he arrived back in England and said he would call me in another two weeks, when he said he would have recovered.”

Doctors at the Royal Free are working "round the clock" to save Mr Pooley's life, sources said, though it could be weeks or even months before he is out of danger.

Mr Pooley's family are at the hospital but will only be able to see him through the plastic tent that isolates him from staff and visitors to stop the virus spreading through bodily fluids.

William Pooley, 29, said he expects to recover from the virus in a fortnight

William Pooley, the British nurse infected with the Ebola virus, is “doing fine” in a London hospital where he is being treated in an isolation unit, a friend has said.

Mr Pooley, 29, was flown back to the UK on Sunday from Sierra Leone, having tested positive for the deadly virus on Saturday.

Gabriel Madiye, director of a hospice where Mr Pooley had been working before volunteering to treat Ebola patients in Kenema, said: “From my sources I understand he is doing fine and he is receiving good care.

“He phoned me just after he arrived back in England and said he would call me in another two weeks, when he said he would have recovered.”

There is no cure for Ebola and Mr Pooley’s survival will depend on his body’s ability to fight off the virus, which has killed 57 per cent of people who have caught it in the current outbreak.

Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in north London will concentrate on keeping Mr Pooley hydrated, maintaining blood pressure and treating any other infections that could weaken his immune system, according to Dr Alain Kohl, of the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.

If he is unable to eat because of vomiting, he will be fed through a drip and he will be given oxygen if he has trouble breathing.

Supplies of ZMapp, an experimental drug used successfully to treat two American missionaries, have run out but doctors will consider using other experimental drugs on Mr Pooley if he proves unable to fight off the Ebola infection himself.

His family released a statement on Monday in which they said he was receiving “excellent” care.

The Department of Health said he was “not seriously unwell” when he arrived but experts said it could be months before he is cleared.

Why is this the worst ever outbreak of Ebola?

The current Ebola epidemic has killed more people than any previous outbreak, and has hit medics particularly badly. A World Health Organisation briefing explains why

The current Ebola outbreak has infected a record number of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.

To date, more than 240 medics have been infected by the virus in West Africa and more than 120 have died.

Peter Piot, the Belgian scientist who co-discovered the virus in 1976, described the current outbreak as a "perfect storm".

"We have never seen an [Ebola] epidemic on this scale," Mr Piot told French daily Liberation.

"In the last six months, we have been witnessing what can be described as a 'perfect storm' - everything is there for it to snowball."

The epidemic "is exploding in countries where health services are not functioning, ravaged by decades of civil war," Piot said.

"In addition, the public is deeply suspicious of the authorities. Trust must be restored. Nothing can be done in an epidemic like Ebola if there is no trust."

The World Health Organisation has cited a number of reasons for the deadly toll of this outbreak of the Ebola virus on medical staff:

- In many cases, medical staff are at risk because no protective equipment is available - even in dedicated Ebola wards, the correct equipment is often scarce. The affected countries, especially Sierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo, are among Africa's poorest.

- Even where the correct equipment is available, it can have a negative impact on staff’s work. The equipment is hot to work in and some members of staff attempt to work beyond their physical limits, meaning they are more likely to make mistakes and further increase their own risk of infection.

- The Ebola virus’s long incubation period (2 to 21 days) means that risk of infection is increased because the host has more time to inadvertently infect others.

- Several infectious diseases endemic in the affected part of West Africa, such as Malaria and typhoid fever, mimic the initial symptoms of Ebola. The medical staff who treat patients displaying these symptoms may not suspect Ebola and may fail to take the correct protective measures.

- Past outbreaks have been mostly limited to remote rural areas, but this latest outbreak has affected capital cities too. These densely populated areas allow the disease to quickly spread as busy areas allow closer contact between hosts of the disease and lead to higher infection rates.

- The loss of so many doctors and nurses has made it difficult for WHO to secure support from sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff, leading the African Union to launch an urgent initiative to recruit more health care workers from among its members.

William Pooley, 29, said he expects to recover from the virus in a fortnight and will go back to the area where he saved dozens of lives

The British nurse who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone told friends that he is determined to return to the West African country to continue treating patients with the disease.

William Pooley, 29, said he expects to recover from the virus in a fortnight and will go back to the area where he saved dozens of lives.

Mr Pooley, who volunteered to help care for Ebola patients because local nurses were too afraid, made the commitment to his former boss in a phone call while lying on a bed on the runway as the RAF was preparing to fly him back to the UK for treatment.

Gabriel Madiye, head of The Shepherd's Hospice where Mr Pooley worked before moving to the Kenema Government Hospital, told The Sun [http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5855144/Will-Pooley-vows-to-beat-Ebola-and-return-to-Sierra-Leone.html] : "I was not able to see Will before he left, but I spoke to him on the phone while he was at the airport.

"He sounded very positive and told me he did not feel very ill and was not seriously sick yet.

"He was very sure that once he was in England, the excellent medical care in Great Britain would help him recover in a matter of weeks and he would come back to us.

"He said he would call us in two weeks to make the arrangements."

Mr Pooley, from Eyke, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital, in Hampstead, north London, after being flown home on Sunday from Lingu airport.

Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley did not know exactly how he had contracted Ebola but had told him "he had a lot of close contact patients while he was caring for them".

"Will was working on the wards, for over 12 hours at a time with just one other nurse, making sure the patients were hydrated, intravenously or orally, and making sure they were taking their medication," Mr Madiye said.

"He was coming very close to them for long hours — that would certainly increase the risk of contracting the disease."

His family released a statement on Monday in which they said he was receiving “excellent” care.

The Department of Health said he was “not seriously unwell” when he arrived but experts said it could be months before he is cleared.

'It's the easiest situation to make a difference'

British male nurse told of help he could give while standing firm to keep hospital open as other medical staff fled in terror from new outbreak

THE British nurse who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone gave an interview days before he fell ill in which he spoke of his joy at seeing patients recover from the virus.

William Pooley, 29, who volunteered to help care for Ebola patients because local nurses were too afraid, is credited with saving dozens of lives by making sure a hospital at the centre of the outbreak remained open.

Colleagues said he caught the disease, transmitted through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, because he was working such long hours that he was bound to "make a mistake" in his precautions.

Mr Pooley, from Eyke, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital, in Hampstead, north London, after being flown home on Sunday by the RAF.

His family released a statement yesterday in which they said he was receiving "excellent" care.

The Department of Health said he was "not seriously unwell" when he arrived but experts said it could be months before he is cleared.

Mr Pooley was interviewed by The Guardian newspaper more than a week ago, before he fell ill.

He said of his patients in Kenema: "It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state, seeing them on the wards, and then seeing them recover and walk out the door is great." In an interview with a local blogger earlier this month, he said: "It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference.

"I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping."

His family can see him only through a plastic tent which prevents the infection from spreading.

They released a statement in which they said: "We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.

"We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.

"Will is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place.

"We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same health care facilities as Will."

Mr Pooley originally went to Sierra Leone as a volunteer for six months in the country's only hospice after hearing about the dire situation during a presentation to nursing students by the charity group UK Friends of The Shepherd's Hospice.

Charity organisers have described the male nurse as a "hero".

His close friend Gabriel Madiye, the director of the hospice in the country's capital, Freetown, said: "We advised Will not to go to Kenema but patients were being abandoned in the hospital.

"There was no one else there to care for them and he decided he must fill the gap. He is not a religious man. He describes himself as a humanist. He believes in helping people.

"But he told me he had been working 12–hour days because the local health care workers were fearful of Ebola patients. Ebola is such a contagious disease that a very small error can lead to infection, especially when there is no running water and hygiene is so terrible."

Dr Robert Garry, an American scientist who worked at the same hospital, said: "When you work hard like that, when you put in so many hours, you're going to make a mistake.

"Unfortunately that seems to have happened in this case."

Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in Freetown, said: "He is an extremely modest guy. He wasn't at all interested in recognition. He would be cringing if he knew the media were talk–ing about him. But in a very quiet way he would work enormous hours to help protect the other staff.

"In the darkest days in Kenema it was really his determination and leadership that motivated others to keep going there and keep the hospital open.

"Kenema was ground zero for the outbreak and he was one of only a handful of nurses helping treat up to 50 Ebola patients that were admitted there.

"He showed enormous compassion for his patients. Will's a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave.

"He and I spoke about the risk together and I think he absolutely understood that there were risks involved.

"He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.

"But where he was in Kenema a number of staff had become sick. He was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one, so he understood those [risks] but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues."

Mr Pooley's father, Robin, is a former teacher who set up a removals business, Pooley Removals, with his wife Jackie.

They later sold the business but still work for it and Mrs Pooley is also the clerk on the parish council in Eyke.

Chris Mutten, a parish councillor in the village, said: "His family are very proud of him. He has been all over the world and his work is all voluntary. He is doing his bit for society."

Mr Pooley tested positive for Ebola on Saturday. There is no cure for the virus and outbreaks have a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent, though that figure is less than 50 per cent for victims who are treated in western countries.

The nurse arrived in Sierra Leone on March 25 and worked at the hospice until early July, when he went to the Kenema Government Hospital.

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "William Pooley demonstrated incredible bravery. We wish him a speedy recovery."

A BRITISH health care worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone was last night flown to London, where doctors battled to save his life.

The 29–year–old, believed to be a male nurse named William, caught the virus while caring for patients at a hospital where 15 nurses have already died of the disease.

It is the first confirmed case of a Briton catching the virus in the recent outbreak.

Colleagues of William said last night he had begged to be allowed to work with Ebola patients, despite being warned about the risk of infection.

He is said to have volunteered after local doctors fled from the hospital. The Briton told friends it was his calling to help those afflicted.

William was flown home by the RAF and taken to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead in a plastic isolation tent. He will be treated in the only isolation unit in Britain designed to deal with contagious diseases.

However, it was unclear how doctors planned to treat him after it was disclosed that supplies have run out of the experimental drug that has been used to treat Ebola patients. The Department of Health said the male nurse was not "seriously unwell". However, patients have been known to deteriorate quickly despite previously appearing well.

Public health experts insisted that the risk to the public from the virus was "very low" despite the first arrival of a confirmed case on UK soil.

Friends spoke in glowing terms about William, who is believed to have been in Sierra Leone for six months.

A colleague in the West African country, where William had worked for five months, spoke to his friend as he was waiting to fly back to Britain.

He said: "Will said he was feeling very ill but he was quite positive about every–thing. He was feeling very unwell but he told me that he was sure the British doctors would be able to cure him."

The colleague said William volunteered to work at the hospital as soon as the disease broke out about five weeks ago.

He said William stayed at the hospital even as fearful doctors deserted their patients. He administered medicine and helped to keep dying patients comfortable and clean.

Since the outbreak began, 392 people have died in Sierra Leone, with 910 confirmed cases. The death rate for Ebola can be as high as 90 per cent, but during the current outbreak it is 57 per cent.

The colleague said: "When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to go and work at the hospital.

"He told me he had a calling to go there. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave."

William trained as a nurse in Britain before leaving for Sierra Leone.

Speaking previously about his decision to travel to Africa, he said: "It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference. I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping."

Government ministers decided on Saturday to fly William back to Britain. They decided there was "no risk" the repatriation would cause an outbreak in Britain. His hospital bed will be surrounded by a specially–designed tent with its own controlled ventilation system. Only specially–trained medical staff will be allowed inside the unit.

Waste is decontaminated and a dedicated laboratory will carry out tests. Air leaving the unit is cleaned to minimise the risk to anyone at the hospital.

Since the outbreak began there have been 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. But it believes the magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are hiding infected friends and family in their homes.

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said measures would be maintained to avoid the virus being transmitted to staff.

He said: "For Ebola to be transmitted contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and as such, the risk to the general population remains very low."

Doctors pin hopes on experimental drugs to treat British Ebola patient

DOCTORS have begun a race against time to secure dwindling supplies of experimental drugs to treat the British health care worker with Ebola who was flown home from Sierra Leone yesterday.

The man, who was treating patients with the disease, was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in north London, which has a dedicated isolation unit for people with contagious deadly diseases.

The patient, known as William, was exposed to Ebola a week ago and became unwell two or three days ago, officials said. William was flown back late last night and doctors insist he poses little to no risk to the public.

But last night it was unclear exactly how UK medics would attempt to treat the man.

There is no cure for Ebola and the only drug ever successfully used to treat it is ZMapp. Two American charity workers who contracted the disease were given the drug and have recovered and been discharged from hospital.

But the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that supplies of ZMapp have run out. Doctors in the UK are trying to source experimental drugs, some of which have never been tested on humans, in an attempt to treat the man. There are other drugs under development which have not been through proper clinical trials, but supplies of them are limited, the WHO has warned.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "Efforts are being made to facilitate use of experimental therapies for this patient, but any decision to use them will only be made with the clinicians and the patient themselves." ZMapp is a monoclonal antibody which takes several months to manufacture from genetically modified tobacco plants. Another drug, an antiviral, is also under development along with several vaccines, but they will not be ready for testing until next year.

Last night public health experts insisted the man's return to the UK would pose no risk to the public.

One senior doctor said he would happily take his family to the hospital treating the man.

Precautions were being taken to ensure the safety of doctors, nurses and Royal Air Force personnel transporting the British patient to the UK last night.

The patient was put into a sealed "air transport isolator" unit in hospital in Sierra Leone, which was loaded on to a specially equipped C17 Royal Air Force aircraft to RAF Northolt, north west London.

Once it had landed the whole unit was loaded on to a special RAF ambulance which was driven directly into the Royal Free Hospital's isolation department.

At no point was the patient outside the isolation unit and all staff looking after him wore protective suits, including full face masks, gloves and hats. They will have reached into the isolator through sealed tubes to treat the patient.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The UK has well established infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission while the patient is in transit and receiving treatment at the Royal Free Hospital." Dr Bob Winter, national clinical director for emergency preparedness and critical care for NHS England, told The Daily Telegraph that staff and patients at the Royal Free should not be worried.

"I would go and drink coffee in the Royal Free with my family. The risk has not changed. There is no need for the general public around the Royal Free to be concerned in any way. The virus is not airborne, it can only be contracted through direct contact with bodily fluids from a patient with the disease."

He said the team at the Royal Free would consider any experimental drugs available and decide with the patient whether to use them or rely on conventional supportive treatments such as fluids, antibiotics for secondary infections, oxygen and electrolytes.

Dr Winter said: "NHS England, together with Public Health England, the Department of Health and other key stakeholders has been working hard over the past few weeks to ensure any patient who contracts Ebola and needs to be repatriated to the UK receives the best possible care and treatment.

"The NHS has a special unit at the Royal Free in London which is well prepared to receive this patient."

Prof John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said: "It is important to be reassured that although a case of Ebola in a British national health care worker residing in Sierra Leone has been identified and is being brought back to the UK, the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low.

"We have robust, well–developed and well–tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts."

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said: "The patient is being transferred to the Royal Free Hospital for appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated by the Department of Health, PHE and NHS England.

"Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of transmission to staff transporting the patient to the UK and health care workers treating the individual."

Yesterday the WHO said one of its health care workers in Sierra Leone had tested positive for the disease and was receiving treatment.

Paul Hunter, professor of Health Protection at the Norwich School of Medicine, at the University of East Anglia, said: "It is well known that health care workers are at particular risk from Ebola when caring for affected patients.

"I have a huge amount of respect for all those health care staff working in affected areas. Without their efforts many more people would die."

The disease has struck more than 2,400 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing almost half of them.

Colleague hails bravery of nurse William Pooley, 29, the first Briton known to have contracted Ebola virus in recent outbreak

A British health care worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone was on Sunday night flown to London, where doctors battled to save his life.

The 29-year-old, a male nurse named as William Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, caught the virus while caring for patients at a hospital where 15 nurses have already died of the disease.

It is the first confirmed case of a Briton catching the virus in the recent outbreak.

Colleagues of Mr Pooley said he had begged to be allowed to work with Ebola patients, despite being warned about the risk of infection.

He is said to have volunteered after local doctors fled from the hospital. The Briton told friends it was his calling to help those afflicted.

Mr Pooley's family said: "Will is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place."

Mr Pooley was flown home by the RAF and taken to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead in a plastic isolation tent. He will be treated in the only isolation unit in Britain designed to deal with contagious diseases.

However, it was unclear how doctors planned to treat him [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/a/11053784] after it was disclosed that supplies have run out of the only drug that has ever cured Ebola patients.

The Department of Health said the male nurse was not “seriously unwell”. However, patients have been known to deteriorate quickly despite previously appearing well.

Public health experts insisted that the risk to the British public from the virus was “very low” despite the first arrival of a confirmed case on UK soil.

Friends spoke in glowing terms about Mr Pooley, who is believed to have been in Sierra Leone for six months.

A colleague in the West African country, where Mr Pooley had worked for five months, spoke to his friend as he was waiting to fly back to Britain.

He said: “Will said he was feeling very ill but he was quite positive about everything. He was feeling very unwell but he told me that he was sure the British doctors would be able to cure him.”

The colleague said Mr Pooley volunteered to work at the hospital as soon as the disease broke out about five weeks ago.

He said Mr Pooley stayed at the hospital even as fearful doctors deserted their patients. He administered medicine and helped to keep dying patients comfortable and clean.

Since the outbreak began, 392 people have died in Sierra Leone, with 910 confirmed cases. The death rate for Ebola can be as high as 90 per cent, but during the current outbreak it is 57 per cent.

The colleague said: “When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to go and work at the hospital.

“He told me he had a calling to go there. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave.”

Mr Pooley trained as a nurse in Britain before leaving for Sierra Leone.

Speaking previously about his decision to travel to Africa, he said: “It’s the easiest situation in the world to make a difference. I’m not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping.”

Chris Mutten, a councillor on Eyke Parish Council, where Mr Pooley's mother Jackie works as a clerk, said everyone is hoping Mr Pooley will fight off the disease.

He said: "He is a good lad. He has been doing a lot of good work, his heart is in the right place.

"His family are very proud of him, he has been all over the world and his work is all voluntary. He trained as a nurse and he is dong his bit for society.

"He went over there to provide palliative care and to help local villagers. He is a very brave man."

Cllr Mutten said the nurse's family are well-known locally and runs Pooley Removals firm in Woodbridge.

Government ministers decided on Saturday to fly Mr Pooley back to Britain. They decided there was “no risk” the repatriation would cause an outbreak in Britain. His hospital bed will be surrounded by a specially-designed tent with its own controlled ventilation system. Only specially-trained medical staff will be allowed inside the unit.

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said measures would be maintained to avoid the virus being transmitted to staff.

He said: “For Ebola to be transmitted contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and as such, the risk to the general population remains very low.”

It emerged that Mr Pooley had spoken of Sierra Leone's poverty and his brushes with the country's political elite shortly before he was struck down by the potentially deadly virus.

In a moving email printed in the local village newsletter, he described in vivid detail his first impressions of the west African country which he had travelled to for a six-month volunteering stint at a hospice in the capital Freetown.

The nurse, 29, from Eyke in Suffolk, was helping to treat locals suffering from Aids, a disease which, according to the UN, 57,000 people live with and remains a lasting legacy of the country's decade-long bloody civil war.

At one village meeting Mr Pooley was confronted with armed guards, singled out by dancing "devils" because of his white skin and sampled the hospitality of the well-heeled locals made rich from the country's controversial diamond mining industry.

In an email printed in Inside Eyke, he said: "After pushing through a crowd outside the house we were ushered inside by police with AK47s.

"The host, rich and influential thanks to diamonds, had his house boys serve us cans of ice-cold, European lager.

"The deputy leader of the APC (All People's Congress) was there, apparently the second most powerful politician in the country."

He told how he was treated to a show from the "devils" - locals in an assortment of costumes, their faces painted or covered with wooden masks.

He said: "The devils danced wildly to drums and gourd shakers and drew quite a crowd....As the only white face in the crowd, the devils singled me out for harassment.

"In order to escape from under their hay and frock skirts I had to give them small change. It was all in good humour."

But it was not all colourful entertainment and Mr Pooley also revealed the poverty and poor sanitation which blight so many lives there.

He said: "The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity."

The account was printed by his mother who said her son had been touched by the tales of "horror" of those caught up in the country's civil war, which ended in 2002.

In a testament to her son's dedication, Mrs Pooley wrote: "Above all, though, he finds the people there friendly, funny and hospitable, and is settling into his work, which is to provide home-based palliative care, generally for cancer and Aids sufferers, a facility which would be absent were it not for the hospice."

If it works for Ebola, it can work for cancer

A new Bill will, in desperate cases, allow doctors to experiment with untested drugs

It is hard, when confronted with pictures and reports detailing the Ebola outbreak in Africa, not to shake one's head in pity. What medical facilities there are, we hear, are overwhelmed by the scale of it. So it is extraordinary to learn that Liberians dying of Ebola have better access to groundbreaking, potentially life–saving new treatments than do people dying of cancer here in Britain.

The Ebola treatment in question is ZMapp, an experimental serum which has not been tested on humans in medical trials, but was none the less given to two American doctors – Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol – who were infected while working in Liberia. Both have now made a full recovery. Three infected African medics who have received ZMapp in Liberia are also reportedly doing well. Now a British doctor, infected with Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, is to be returned to this country for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

The reason that such patients are able to receive ZMapp is because an ethics panel at the World Health Organisation has decided that, given the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak, a departure from standard evidence–based treatments is justified. Potential treatments that have shown promising results in the laboratory but have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans are, in certain conditions, now acceptable on both ethical and evidential grounds, the WHO says.

Few doubt that the gravity of this outbreak of Ebola, which has killed about 1,500 so far, requires a response by all means necessary. Yet in Britain today the toll of another disease – cancer – is 100 times higher, and access to such experimental treatments is not available, even for those desperate patients beyond the help of current medicine.

Some 150,000 British citizens will die from cancer this year, making it the number one cause of untimely death. And while the disease may have a different name, our response should be the same as with Ebola – doctors should be encouraged to try new treatments, and be protected when they do so. Importantly, the Medical Innovation Bill, now before Parliament, will allow doctors and their patients in Britain to try treatments that have not been tested or fully trialled.

Inevitably, there are objections that the Bill's restrictions and conditions placed on doctors are too lax – that they can play fast and loose with vulnerable, dying patients. So it's worth looking at the conditions imposed by the WHO on ZMapp to see how they compare with the conditions set in the Medical Innovation Bill.

First: lethality. On Ebola, the WHO panel agreed that the threat posed by Ebola, with its "high case–fatality rate" was sufficient to warrant the use of experimental therapies. The Medical Innovation Bill is explicitly designed to achieve the very same result. This is why the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said about the Bill that "the Government should do whatever is needed to remove barriers that prevent innovation which can save and improve lives. We must create a climate where clinical pioneers have the freedom to make breakthroughs in treatment." The Secretary of State wisely asked Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS, to devise the legislative safeguards to be included in the Bill.

Secondly, ethics: the WHO rightly sets a high ethical standard for use of ZMapp, including "transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community". The Bill echoes this ethical standard, requiring informed consent of the patient, or the patient's representative, and full transparency. Indeed, the Bill goes further than the WHO guidelines, stating that in order to depart from the existing range of accepted medical treatments, a doctor must also obtain the views of at least one other relevantly qualified doctor, carry out a full risk assessment, and obtain any other consents required by law.

And, of course, while the WHO offers guidelines, the Medical Innovation Bill is backed by the full force of the law.

Finally, WHO guidance requires that all data generated by the use of ZMapp should be collected and shared. If scientific progress is to be made through such experimental use of untested treatments, results must be available to the scientific community. The Bill will secure this. The University of Oxford has offered to create a database to register innovative medical interventions under the Bill and to collect and share the data from them, so that they may inform and inspire clinical trials. As Sir John Bell, Regis Professor of Medicine at Oxford, said: "There will be no cure for cancer until real doctors with real patients in real hospitals are allowed to innovate."

So those of us who have cheered the use of an untested drug to help apparently hopeless cases in Liberia should cheer the Medical Innovation Bill. It will help medical science progress, aid researchers in their hunt for cures for fatal diseases – and offer hope to the 300,000 Britons who will be diagnosed with cancer this year.

A BRITISH person living in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus, the Department of Health said last night.

It is the first confirmed case of a UK citizen contracting the virus, though it was not clear whether the victim, who has not been identified, is working in the former British colony offering medical treatment or is a permanent resident.

Prof John Watson, the deputy chief medical officer, said: "The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low. Medical experts are currently assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided.

"We have robust, welldeveloped and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts."

The virus has killed almost 1,500 people across West Africa.

Ebola serum sent to Liberia

A BRITISH PERSON living in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the Ebola virus, the Department of Health said last night.

The patient is the first confirmed case of a British victim. The department said experts were ensuring that the person was receiving appropriate care.

It was not known whether the victim who caught the disease was treating patients in Sierra Leone or living permanently in the former British colony. Prof John Watson, the deputy chief medical officer, said: "The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be low.

"We have robust, welldeveloped and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases."

On Aug 12 a Spanish missionary, Miguel Pajares, 75, became the first European victim of the disease.

Since then there have been dozens of false alarms in Ireland, Austria, Spain and Germany. In Germany, about 600 people were quarantined for two hours in Berlin after a false alarm about a suspected case of Ebola.

Two American doctors who caught the disease, Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 59, were released from hospital in Atlanta this week after being treated for three weeks. They were given a serum, ZMapp, which had been tested on monkeys but not approved for human use. Since the "miraculous" recovery of the American medics, a small quantity of ZMapp has been sent to Liberia.

There are only limited quantities of the drug.

The Americans were working for Samaritan's Purse, a Christian aid organisation. A spokesman for the charity said the British victim was not working for them. Médecins Sans Frontieres said the patient was not working for them either.

Ebola victim 'poses tiny risk'

A BRITISH MAN who has tested positive for the Ebola virus could be flown to London for treatment.

The Department of Health said last night that the man was the first British victim of the outbreak.

It is understood he is a charity worker who has been helping to treat victims in West Africa.

If he were brought back, he would be flown to RAF Northolt near Heathrow before being taken to the Royal Free Hospital, the only hospital in Britain equipped to treat an Ebola patient and contain the virus, it was reported last night.

Government sources said no final decision had been taken on whether to fly the man home but a medical assessment would take place today to see whether a flight home would be suitable.

Prof Sir Bruce Keogh said in an interview: "We have prepared rigorous plans for this type of situation. This individual will pose no risk to the public, and only the tiniest risk to those who those who come into direct contact with him."

The first British person to contract Ebola in nearly 40 years arrives back in the UK

Officials have confirmed that a British man who has caught Ebola in Sierra Leone is being flown back to the UK for treatment.

The man, thought to be an aid worker, will be transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in north London which has a dedicated isolation unit for such cases.

The patients is not currently seriously unwell and experts said he poses little to no risk to the general public.

He is being flown on a specially equipped C17 Royal Air Force plane to RAF Northolt.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The UK has well established and practised infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission while the patient is in transit and receiving treatment at the Royal Free Hospital."

Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said: "It is important to be reassured that although a case of Ebola in a British national health care worker residing in Sierra Leone has been identified and is being brought back to the UK the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low.

"We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts.

"UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible."

Dr Paul Cosford, Director for Health Protection at Public Health England, said: "The patient is being transferred to the Royal Free Hospital for appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated by the Department of Health, PHE and NHS England. Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of transmission to staff transporting the patient to the UK and health care workers treating the individual.

"For Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and as such, the risk to the general population remains very low."

Dr Bob Winter, National Clinical Director for Emergency Preparedness and Critical Care for NHS England, said: "NHS England, together with PHE, the Department of Health and other key stakeholders has been working hard over the past few weeks to ensure any patient who contracts Ebola and needs to be repatriated to the UK receives the best possible care and treatment.

"The NHS has a special unit at the Royal Free in London which is well prepared to receive this patient."

There have been 2,400 cases reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, of which there have been more than 1,300 deaths. It is the largest outbreak of the disease ever recorded.

A Briton living in Sierra Leone has become the first UK citizen to test positive for the disease

A British person living in Sierra Leone [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/sierraleone/]has tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus, in the first confirmed case for a UK citizen.

The Department for Health confirmed that the victim had tested positive.

But it was not known whether they were working out there treating patients, or living permanently in the former British colony.

Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said: "The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low. Medical experts are currently assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided.

"We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts."

On August 12 a Spanish missionary, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, became the first European victim of the disease [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11028110/Ebola-outbreak-Missionary-priest-with-the-virus-dies-after-being-repatriated-to-Spain-from-Liberia.html] .

Since then there have been dozens of false alarms in Ireland, Austria, Spain and Germany. In Germany, about 600 people were quarantined for two hours in a Berlin jobcentre after a false alarm about a suspected case of Ebola.

Two American doctors who contracted the disease, Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 59, were released from hospital in Atlanta this week [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11049109/Two-Americans-who-had-been-infected-with-Ebola-leave-Atlanta-hospital.html] after three weeks of being cared for in the US hospital. The pair were treated with an untested serum, ZMapp, which had been trialled on monkeys but not approved for human use.

Since the "miraculous" recovery of the American medics, a small quantity of ZMapp has been sent to Liberia for use on patients there [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11030096/Canada-to-donate-own-Ebola-vaccine-to-WHO-for-use-in-Africa.html] . There are only limited quantities of the drug - between 800 and 1,000 doses - however, as it has not yet been approved for mass production.

The Americans were working for Samaritan's Purse, a Christian aid organisation which has been working extensively in Liberia. However, a spokesman for the charity told The Telegraph that they did not work in Sierra Leone and the British victim was not working for them.

Medecins Sans Frontieres, which currently has 66 international and 610 national staff responding to the crisis in the three affected countries, said the victim was not working for them either.

The virus, which first emerged in the 1960s, has killed almost 1,500 people across West Africa in the worst-ever outbreak of the disease [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11021027/World-Health-Organisation-declares-Ebola-outbreak-an-international-health-emergency.html] . The majority of cases have been registered in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – where this outbreak began on April 1.

But it has also spread to Nigeria – Africa's most populous country – and has infected people beyond the original victim and his carers.

Patrick Sawyer died in Lagos after travelling from Liberia, and was due to travel home to the United States.

In all, 213 people are now under surveillance in Nigeria - including six people, all "secondary contacts" like the caregivers' spouses, being monitored in the state of Enugu, more than 310 miles east of Lagos.

Sierra Leone has been hit hard by the current outbreak, recording at least 910 cases and 392 deaths, according to figures released on Friday by the World Health Organization.

A total of 2,615 infections and 1,427 deaths have been recorded across West Africa.

Symptoms of Ebola appear as a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. According to the WHO, this is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The effects of the disease normally appear between two and 21 days after infection.

It is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through person-to-person transmission. Outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 90 per cent.

The WHO says the disease can be passed between people by direct contact - through broken skin or mucous membranes - with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such fluids.

The spread of the infection has been worsened by the fact that many in Sierra Leone fear Western medicine, and have taken their relatives away from care centres. As a result they die in the community unrecorded, leading to "shadow zones".

On Friday the Ivory Coast closed its borders with Liberia and Guinea. A day later the Philippines announced that they were withdrawing their UN peacekeeping troops from Liberia in response to the outbreak.

The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak an "international public health emergency" on August 8.

"Declaring Ebola an international public health emergency shows how seriously WHO is taking the current outbreak; but statements won’t save lives," said Dr Bart Janssens, MSF Director of Operations.

"Now we need this statement to translate into immediate action on the ground. For weeks, MSF has been repeating that a massive medical, epidemiological and public health response is desperately needed to saves lives and reverse the course of the epidemic. Lives are being lost because the response is too slow.”

Dr Janssens said that there needed to be an urgent scaling-up of medical care, training of health staff, infection control, contact tracing, epidemiological surveillance, alert and referral systems, community mobilisation and education.

He added: "All our Ebola experts are mobilised, we simply cannot do more."

Officers at a police station in Exeter were forced to seal off the cell block when an African prisoner displayed possible symptoms of the Ebola virus.

The 29–year–old woman, from Guinea in West Africa, was being held in a cell after being arrested by immigration officials.

Officers decided to shut down the 20–cell custody block when she developed a mild fever late on Thursday night.

She was transferred to a local hospital where she was undergoing tests.

Public Health England said the measures were "precautionary". The organisation later confirmed that the woman did not have Ebola.

A spokesman said: "Public Health England can confirm it received a sample for precautionary Ebola testing, involving an individual in Exeter with a history of travel to West Africa.

"Ebola was considered very unlikely, but testing was done as a precaution, and the results were negative."

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the block had been out of use for around eight hours and newly arriving prisoners were transferred to another station.

Body of Co Donegal man who died suddenly after returning from Sierra Leone is being tested for deadly virus

Health chiefs are awaiting blood test results on a suspected Ebola case in Ireland after a man who recently returned from Africa died suddenly.

The remains of the suspected victim are being kept in an isolated section of a hospital in Co Donegal until experts determine whether or not he had contracted the deadly disease.

Test results are expected on Friday.

Locals named the man as father of one as Dessie Quinn, aged 43, from the Doorin area, outside Mountcharles, Co Donegal. He is thought to have been living with his partner in Dublin, but was visiting his large family in Co Donegal when he was taken ill.

Neighbours said the man may have been getting treatment for suspected malaria after returning from Sierra Leone when he died. However, it is not thought he was an inpatient at any medical facility.

One source believed he was working for a telecommunications company in the west African country and had returned to Ireland within the last few weeks.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) would only say the remains of a person who recently returned from an area of Africa hit by the outbreak were found in Co Donegal yesterday morning.

"Until a diagnosis is confirmed, and as a precautionary measure, the individual's remains will stay in the mortuary pending the laboratory results which are expected late tomorrow," a HSE spokesman said last night.

One local man who knew the suspected victim said he was talking to him last week at a festival.

"I met him at the festival in Mountcharles last Friday," he said. "He was just home and as far as I know he was in Donegal since he came back from Sierra Leone. He could have been back two weeks or three weeks, I'm not sure."

The man added: "Everyone knew him. He was great company to be along with, he was a very nice fella."

Health chiefs have stressed that the risk of transmission of any disease is considered to be "extremely low", but precautionary measures have been put in place.

Dr Darina O'Flanagan, head of the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, said a person would have to be in very close personal contact with an infected individual or their body fluids for there to be any risk.

"We await the outcome of the laboratory tests before we will know whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease," she said. "The appropriate public health guidelines are being followed at every stage in this process as a precaution."

The HSE has refused to give any more details about the case.

Donegal Mayor John Campbell said the county was shocked, but urged people not to panic.

"It is unconfirmed that it is Ebola at this stage, and even if it was confirmed the chances of it being passed on to anyone else are very small. So people shouldn't panic," he said. "It's a big shock in the area. I know the family well and our thoughts are with them."

The suspected victim's body has been transferred to Letterkenny General Hospital.

Donegal TD (MP) Thomas Pringle urged people in the county not to worry until health chiefs carry out their tests.

"This is a sudden tragic death and because this man worked in Africa the HSE have to take precautions," he said. "I think we should wait until the cause of death is confirmed. Given the media attention about Ebola over the last while it is important that people do not panic or worry about it until we hear from the HSE."

The two missionaries, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, became ill with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia

Two American missionaries who fell ill with the dangerous Ebola virus while working in Liberia have recovered and have been released from an Atlanta hospital, doctors said.

Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 60, became sick with Ebola in Monrovia last month, and were airlifted to Emory University Hospital for treatment.

"The discharge from the hospital of both these patients poses no public health threat," said Bruce Ribner, director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit.

Ms Writebol was released on August 19, according to a statement from the aid group for which she worked, SIM USA.

Dr Brantly appeared alongside doctors from Emory University Hospital at a press conference, smiling in a blue dress shirt and holding hands with his wife.

"After a rigorous course of treatment and testing, the Emory Healthcare team has determined that both patients have recovered from the Ebola virus and can return to their families and community without concern for spreading this infection to others," Mr Ribner said.

The current outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa is the largest in history and has killed 1,350 people since March in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

The president of the Christian missionary group for which Brantly worked in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, hailed the doctor's "courageous spirit" as he battled the virus.

"Today I join all of our Samaritan's Purse team around the world in giving thanks to God as we celebrate Dr Kent Brantly's recovery from Ebola and release from the hospital," said Franklin Graham.

"Over the past few weeks I have marveled at Dr Brantly's courageous spirit as he has fought this horrible virus with the help of the highly competent and caring staff at Emory University Hospital."

"I am forever thankful to God for sparing my life," Brantly said during the news conference.

Dr Brantly and Ms Writebol had received an eever perimental treatment called Zmapp. The treatment is so novel that it has not been tested on human beings.

The limited supply of Zmapp also was tried in a Spanish missionary priest, who died, and three Liberian health care workers, who are said to be improving.

Ireland’s health service is carrying out tests on a suspected case of the Ebola virus in a deceased person who recently returned from Africa, the Health Service Executive (HSE) of Ireland said in a statement on Thursday.

“Blood samples have been sent for laboratory testing to confirm whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease,” it said, adding the risk of transmission of any disease is considered to be extremely low.

Leading bioethicists Professor Ezekiel Emanuel, of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Dr Annette Rid, of King’s College London, said experimental drugs should not be limited to wealthy or "well-connected" patients.

In the medical journal, The Lancet, the scientists called for "ethical principles" to be followed when experimental drugs were used such as randomised-controlled trials, in collaboration with local communities and other stakeholders.

There is no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus. Patients are given basic supportive care to keep them hydrated, maintain their blood pressure and treat any complicating infections. Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick people experiencing symptoms.

Meanwhile on Thursday South Africa [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/] issued a ban on all non-citizens travelling from three West African countries worst-affected by Ebola, Agence-France Presse reported.

A health ministry statement said: “A total travel ban for all non-citizens travelling from these high risk countries,” referring to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

On Thursday in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, calm set in one day after residents in a slum that was sealed off in an effort to contain the outbreak clashed with riot police and soldiers. World Health Organisation officials were visiting two hospitals that are treating Ebola patients and struggling to keep up with the influx of patients.

The death toll is rising most quickly in Liberia, which now accounts for at least 576 of the fatalities, the WHO said. At least 2,473 people have been infected across West Africa - more than the caseloads of all the previous two-dozen Ebola outbreaks combined.

Questor says SELL

LONDON Mining slumped to a first–half loss sending shares sharply lower and Questor believes investors would do well to sell now.

The company is weighed down by its debt mountain and iron ore prices are heading in the wrong direction.

The Sierra Leone–based mining group yesterday reported first–half revenue down 22pc to $110.6m (£66.6m), and the loss for the period was $12.6m, more than twice the loss of $5m reported at the same stage last year.

Iron ore prices have fallen sharply during the first six months of the year to around $92 per tonne, having started the year in the region of $140 per tonne.

Management at the Aim–listed miner said production increased 24pc on the same period last year to 2.1m tonnes to the end of June. The company said production in the first half wasn't affected by the outbreak of the deadly virus Ebola, however they reduced full–year production targets to 5.1m from 5.4m tonnes as the outbreak hit the supply chain.

The problem for London Mining is the growing debt pile. The company had net debts of $282m at the end of June, up from $205m at the same stage last year.

The company has tried to bring costs under control by stopping non–essential spending on the mine and delaying some projects for two years.

That said, with iron ore prices weak and the company making losses, the situation doesn't look sustainable with $32m in cash left on the balance sheet.

London Mining shares have almost halved in value since Questor said it was time to cut and run from this high–risk pure play on the iron ore price (Sell, 67p, March 25).

The shares are bombed out and investors should take what they can, there is no value here with the debts so high. If a white knight does appear, they are likely to charge a high price. Sell.

Police in Exeter city centre sent new arrests elsewhere after a woman from Ebola-stricken Guinea fell ill with a mild fever

A police station closed its cells and sent all new prisoners to other stations after an African woman being held there came down with a mild fever that officers feared may be the deadly Ebola virus.

Devon and Cornwall Police were unable to use the twenty-cell custody block in Exeter city centre for at least eight hours while cells were cleaned and staff given health checks.

The closure also disrupted proceedings at the magistrates court next door the following day too.

The 29-year-old woman, who was taken to hospital, had been arrested by immigration services and came from Guinea in West Africa, which has closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia to control the disease.

No other detainees were moved, but new arrests had to be taken to other stations nearby, and only two people appeared from custody at the magistrates’ court next door in the morning.

Police said the cells had been shut at 11:37pm on Thursday and opened some time in the late morning of Friday.

Half a dozen staff worked overnight in the custody block, but but the rest of the station was unaffected.

In a statement, the force said: “At this time the risk of this being an ebola virus outbreak is considered very low but all appropriate measures are being taken as a precautionary measure.

“Other detainees along with custody staff have received health advice.

Public Health England said it was still waiting for test results to come back but that an Ebola infection was “very, very unlikely”.

A spokesperson said: “Public Health England can confirm it has received a sample for precautionary Ebola testing, involving an individual in Exeter with a history of travel to West Africa.

“Based on the evidence-based risk assessment protocol we are confident that all appropriate actions have been taken to ensure there is no risk to public health. It is not possible for PHE to provide any further details on the individual being tested prior to any test result being known.

“It is important to remember there has never been a case of Ebola in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluid.”

A man who died in Ireland shortly after returning from Sierra Leone has tested negative for the Ebola virus

A man who died in Ireland shortly after returning from Sierra Leone has tested negative for the Ebola virus, health officials said Friday.

The Health Service Executive had said Thursday the man's death was "a suspected case" of the tropical virus and quarantined his body until tests could be carried out.

But it said in a statement on Friday that laboratory test samples had proved negative for Ebola.

The man, Dessie Quinn, who was in his mid-40s, had returned from working as an engineer in Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst affected by the west African Ebola outbreak, his company KN Network Services said.

KNNS said it had pulled all of its staff from Sierra Leone as a precaution.

Local media reported that Quinn was receiving treatment for malaria since his return to Ireland.

The HSE rejected media claims that Quinn's family did not know he was at the centre of an investigation into a suspected Ebola case.

"The HSE was in contact with some family members from the outset of the tragic situation," it said.

The Ebola doctor who survived the killer virus

Dr Melvin Korkor tells the Telegraph he felt 'reborn' after surviving Ebola and is now campaigning to convince infected Liberians to seek help sooner

US doctor 'thrilled to be alive' after Ebola recovery

Like every other medic trying to fight the spread of west Africa's deadly Ebola outbreak, Dr Melvin Korkor knows the importance of reassuring a panicking public. Despite its high fatality rate, and the belief that it is the work of witchcraft, his message is that victims may well pull through if they are treated early enough.

Yet when he tells that to fellow Liberians these days, one thing gives him a unique credibility in winning them over. For not only did Dr Korkor come down with Ebola himself recently, he lived to tell the tale.

He revealed his remarkable story of survival in an interview with The Telegraph at Phebe Hospital in Liberia's remote Bong County, where an outbreak of the virus last month saw him and five nurses rushed to an isolation unit in the capital, Monrovia.

The virus had hit the hospital after a woman suffering diarrhoea came in for treatment, lying to staff about the fact that she was from neighbouring Lofa County, where the Ebola outbreak has been at its worst. By the time she died three days later, it was already too late.

"By then, some of the nurses who had treated her had come down with a very high fever," said Dr Korkor, 42, who is now on three months leave.

"They were tested for Ebola and confirmed positive. I knew I had had interaction with the patient and the nurses myself, and so I asked for one of my blood samples to be sent for testing too.

"I also started having unusual feelings myself – low grade fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. It felt a bit like malaria, but I knew that within myself that something was not normal."

When he was summonsed to the offices of Phebe's medical director to be told the results, his worst fears were confirmed. But Dr Korkor knew that while the virus has a mortality rate of 60-90 per cent, those who treat the symptoms early – a matter of keeping the body well-watered and nourished – improve their survival chances.

"I asked the hospital to get an ambulance to take me to Monrovia," he said. "Then I told my wife get me a Bible and nothing else. She started to cry, but I told her 'no crying, I am coming back'."

On arrival at Monrovia's Elwa Hospital, Dr Korkor was assessed again at a hermetically sealed unit where patients are treated by medics in boiler suits, goggles and masks. He was checked into the bed of a patient that had just died.

What followed was a lonely, frightening experience. While each patient had their own private cubicle, Dr Korkor knew his colleagues were losing the fight. It was then that he began putting his faith in ancient scripture as well as modern medicine, reading Psalm 91 from his Bible, which refers to how God will protect his followers from "noisome pestilence" and "any plague come nigh thy dwelling".

Four days in, he was tested again. This time it was negative. "It was like being reborn," he said.

The ordeal was not quite over, however. Upon his discharge, he returned to Bong County, where he found other people quite literally avoiding him "like the plague".

As he told a local radio station: "Thanks to God, I am cured. But now I have a new disease: the stigmatisation that I am a victims of."

It is precisely that sort of public misunderstanding that Dr Korkor is now trying to correct, aware that the more the fear and ignorance surrounding Ebola, the more it will spread unchecked. It has already claimed more than 1,000 lives across Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

Hence Dr Korkor's visit to his local church last Sunday, where he gave a speech about how he survived his ordeal. In a country of devout Christians, the tale of a man who all but risen from the dead has no shortage of resonance. But while he delivered "special thanks to God for saving my life", he stressed to the congregation that it was down to science, not miracles.

"The only reason I survived is because I went to get help earlier," he said. "I want to tell the whole world that Ebola is real, and if you start to feel ill, please get tested straightaway."

Violence as Liberia seals off slum to halt spread of Ebola

VIOLENCE erupted in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, yesterday after security forces sealed off a slum in an attempt to stop the spread of the Ebola virus.

Riot police and soldiers fired live rounds and tear gas to disperse a stone–throwing crowd trying to break out of a quarantine imposed on West Point, home to 50,000 people and one of the poorest and most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city.

Four people were injured.

"These measures are meant to save lives," said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who ordered the restrictions, in an address to the nation.

The violence flared after security forces tried to evacuate a government official and his family from the slum.

Earlier, roadblocks had been created out of piles of scrap wood and barbed wire to prevent anyone from entering or leaving the neighbourhood, which has been hit badly by the outbreak.

The slum occupies a peninsula where the Mesurado River meets the Atlantic. Ferries to the area have been halted, and a coastguard boat was patrolling the waters around the neighbourhood.

The people of West Point reacted with fury to the quarantine, hurling stones and shouting at the security forces.

"It is inhumane," said Patrick Wesseh, a resident. "They can't suddenly lock us up without any warning. How are our children going to eat?"

Many feel that the government has not done enough to protect them from the spread of the disease. West Point residents raided an Ebola screening centre over the weekend, accusing officials of bringing sick people from all over Monrovia into their neighbourhood.

In many areas of the capital, bodies have lain in the streets for hours, sometimes days, even though people asked that they be picked up by health ministry workers wearing protective equipment.

It is the first time that such restrictions have been put in place in a capital city since the Ebola outbreak began last December. Doll Town, 30 miles south of the capital, was also sealed off, while Mrs Sirleaf imposed a nationwide curfew from 9pm to 6am in a further attempt to stem the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, 106 new deaths were reported by the United Nations health agency yesterday, bringing the total across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria to 1,350. Liberia has the highest number of deaths of the four countries – 576 – and its total is rising the fastest.

The UN also warned in its announcement that "countries are beginning to experience supply shortages, including fuel, food, and basic supplies".

A number of airlines and shipping services have halted transport to the worst affected capitals of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

There were also fears yesterday that the epidemic could have spread to Asia.

Authorities in Vietnam said they had detained several people arriving from west Africa who they suspected could have Ebola. Two Nigerians who travelled to Vietnam from Nigeria were having tests at a specialist hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, health officials said.

In Burma, a man was also being tested after arriving from Guinea. The cases follow the news on Tuesday that patients were also being tested in the United States and Spain.

It's time we threw a bucket of cold water over the latest self-congratulatory celebrity fad, says Michael Hogan

Everyone’s at it. Top pop has-been Britney Spears. Your annoying workmate on Twitter. Spoon-faced gazillionaire Mark Zuckerberg. That bloke you never see but can’t bring yourself to defriend on Facebook. Footballers. Actors. The wacky-but-lonely functioning alky down the local pub. The likes of Lena Dunham, Suki Waterhouse, Rita Ora, Taylor Swift and Cara Delevingne, who are in the papers all the time but you’re not actually sure what they do. “It” is, of course, the Ice Bucket Challenge. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/virals/11040688/Ice-bucket-challenge-20-of-the-best-videos-so-far.html]And it’s become immensely irritating.

The viral craze du jour is, ostensibly at least, to raise awareness for the neurodegenerative illness ALS (me neither, but more of that shortly). Over the past week, ice-bucketing has swept the internet like ebola in a branch of Liberian Fried Chicken. We've now passed Peak Ice-Bucket. It’s surely a matter of mere hours before Piers Morgan gets involved, the official sign that something’s truly over.

The idea, if you’ve been fortunate enough to avoid it thus far, is to pour cold water, preferably containing ice cubes, over your head and post the video on social media. What fun! Such megalolz!! Epic ledgebantz!!! I’m sure this is exactly what Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisioned when he invented the worldwide web. Well, this and cute cat clips.

Minister says soldiers could set up field hospitals

Doctors examine blood transfusions as a solution to the crisis

BRITAIN'S Armed Forces could help to set up field hospitals in Africa if the Ebola crisis worsens, the Defence Secretary said yesterday, as the World Health Organisation suggested that sufferers may be treated with blood taken from survivors of the disease.

Michael Fallon confirmed that the Army had been assessing whether British expertise at setting up field hospitals in hostile environments could be used.

He said that, following a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee earlier this month, the Army was examining what it could do to repatriate British citizens if they became infected with the virus, as well as assessing options for building field hospitals in infected areas.

Six out of 10 Ebola victims infected during the outbreak have died so far. The official number killed in West Africa has reached 1,229, with 2,240 cases in total.

Health officials are examining whether the natural immunity built up in survivors could be transferred to other victims via infusions of their plasma.

In the small number of cases in which blood transfusions have been tried, the results appear promising, doctors say, with antibodies found in the plasma of survivors apparently helping to fight off the disease.

Using blood products rather than expensive drug cures would be more cost effective and therefore more obtainable for the largely impoverished nations at the heart of the outbreak. In an interview with Bloomberg, David Wood, who is leading a World Health Organisation team of doctors looking into the possibility, said: "It's feasible. We're consulting with the blood operators who have capability to assist, so that we can get some realistic sense of when this could be available as an option. We'll have that information pretty soon."

Doctors say Ebola survivors have antibodies created by their white blood cells as they fought off the virus. These bind to the invader microbes, either killing them or identifying them for other parts of the immune system to attack.

Dr Kent Brantly, an American missionary who contracted Ebola while helping to treat patients in Liberia, is known to have been given a transfusion of plasma from a 14–year–old boy. His condition has improved dramatically, although it is not clear whether this was the result of the transfusion or an experimental drug called ZMapp, which he had also taken.

Doctors also say it is possible that his body would have fought off the virus even without treatment.

Critics of the use of transfusions say patients who appear to do well may be responding to an infusion of plasma while suffering from a disease that takes a grim toll on the body, often causing bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose.

While ZMapp seems to offer hope of a cure, it has not yet been properly tested and supplies are already exhausted, according to its US manufacturer, and it will take some time for more to be made. Given the scale of the crisis, the World Health Organisation has given permission for experimental drugs and treatments to be used.

Officials fear the true infection rate may be far higher than their figures suggest, with many patients in West Africa hiding away from the authorities over fear of the stigma of the disease.

In Monrovia, the Liberian capital, a group of patients who fled from a quarantine centre after gunmen broke in at the weekend returned for treatment.

They had been exposed to the virus and were waiting to learn whether they had contracted the disease.

The attackers, who said they did not believe in the existence of the virus and opposed the presence of the centre in the area, also made off with bloody sheets, which have not been recovered.

Stung by the 'pernicious' review Mr Smith described the Telegraph’s critic, Robbie Collin, as a scourge of humanity more terrible than the combined horrors of Isis, Ebola and the situation in Gaza

When a screenwriter read The Telegraph’s review of his new film, he was disappointed it received only one star.

The animated children’s feature about table footballers who come to life was summed up in a one-word headline: “foul”.

Read: The Unbeatables, review: 'foul' [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11033704/The-Unbeatables-review-foul.html]

Stung by the “pernicious” review, Richard O Smith decided to strike a blow for all writers hurt by a bad review by delivering some counter-criticism.

He described Robbie Collin, the Telegraph’s film critic, as a scourge of humanity on a par with Ebola, the conflict in Gaza, and Isis, now known as Islamic State.

“Perhaps he just doesn’t like films? Working as a film reviewer must make him permanently furious, like someone allergic to cats working in a cattery,” Smith said.

The Unbeatables is an Argentinian-Spanish production directed by Juan José Campanella, the Oscar-winning film-maker. It was released last year in the Spanish language to some acclaim.

Smith was hired to write dubbed dialogue for an English language version, to be voiced by a cast, including Rupert Grint and Rob Brydon.

The dubbed release did not attract the praise that greeted the original. Smith took particular issue with a tweet Collin sent, which read: “Even in a memorably bad summer for children, The Unbeatables is about as wretched as it gets.”

Juan José Campanella

His review added: “The Unbeatables, a half-Spanish, half-Argentinian cartoon about lead table footballers who come to life, is significantly less fun than playing with lead table footballers, or eating lead table footballers, or standing on lead table footballers in bare feet in the middle of the night while groping around for the light switch.”

In his riposte, Smith wrote: “Even in a memorably bad summer for humanity (Israel/Palestine, Isis, Ebola), Robbie Collin is about as wretched as it gets.”

He added: “Juan José Campanella won an Oscar for his last film [The Secret in their Eyes], so he probably knows what he’s doing. How many Oscars has Collin won? No, winning 'World’s Worst Critic’ for so many consecutive years that he gets to keep the trophy outright doesn’t count.” Smith, 50, is a comedy writer who has contributed to BBC Radio 4’s The News Quiz and Dara O’Briain’s Science Club on BBC Two.

In an interview with his local paper, Smith admitted that writing dialogue to fit animated characters whose mouth movements were speaking the original Spanish lines was a challenge.

He said he had “no control over timing. It was very difficult getting them all to fit in with the lip syncing of the characters”.

Collin said: “I’m sorry to hear that Mr Smith thought my review was pernicious. I can assure him, though, that I love my job and have enjoyed many films this year, just not his.”

I've traded in my Aston Martin for a boring people carrier

A devoted sports car driver, Alex Proud has swapped his beloved DB9 for a family-friendly Ford, which has sparked an existential crisis

Last week I sat in my brand new, (or rather, second-hand) Ford people carrier. It was a moment. I had a moment. A bit of a wobble. I stopped sucking in my stomach and let my belly flop. I looked in the rear-view mirror and appraised my chin honestly. It’s not a single chin any more; it has a friend. I brushed the messy, tangled fluff of my hair back to reveal the acres of gleaming pate. Inevitably, I asked myself, “Where did it all go wrong, Alex?”

Some of you may recall my recent article on why every man should own a DB9 or a Jaguar F type [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10653979/Why-you-should-buy-a-sports-car.html], whether he can afford one or not. I held forth at length about how letting middle age, kids and even income preventing you from fulfilling your dream was to deny the very existence of your Y chromosome. I waxed lyrical about the beauty of my own Aston and its superiority over chavvy Ferraris and vulgar, showy Buggatis. I declaimed that I could not live without this thing of beauty in my life. And yet here I am.

Last week I sold my Aston Martin DB9 and my 1979 Lancia Beta Spyder.

It gets worse. A bit later on last week, after seven wonderful years, Jaguar Land Rover noticed an admin error in their records and took me off their VIP car list. With a single keystroke, my access to massively discounted top-of-the-line Jags and luxury Land Rovers came to an end. Only then did I realise that, for the best part of a decade, I’d effectively been on benefits for very rich people.

Once a couple of bad things have happened to you, life gains a negative momentum of its own. So, pretty soon, I found myself swept along in an avalanche of status anxiety and downward mobility.

On my first full day as a member of the Ford-driving hoi polloi, I parked outside the multiplex (in for a penny...) and a huge Land Rover, driven by a hot ex’s hedge fund manager husband almost parked on top of my humble people carrier. The kids in the back screamed, partly through fear, but mainly because they had no Land Rover entertainment systems to distract them from the continual reminders of their father’s brutal vehicular emasculation.

As the door to the Land Rover opened, I felt my manhood shrivel further into my shorts, and watched my belly swell with shame; what little remained of my hair fluttered into the footwell in an attempt to divorce itself from the indignity of being mine. While this was going on, the hot ex stepped out of the car, looking like she was on a normcore Vogue shoot, while her Paris Hilton-esque dog, quite rightly, cocked its leg on the wheel of my Ford. Of course, the hot ex was at our local multiplex for a spot of hip consumer slumming. I was there unironically.

I looked at the Ford again and recalled those youthful jokes where a cool car was called a fanny magnet. This was the opposite. It was a fanny repellent, a kind of DEET for beautiful people. My brain repurposed that Anchorman joke about Sex Panther cologne: “100% of the time, it works none of the time.” I realised that I’d also become used to the wistful looks of other male drivers and the unprompted shouts of “cool car, mate” from eight-year-old boys. I’d even learned to take the calls of “polar bear killer” from the children of Guardian readers as a raffish kind of compliment. But with a Ford people carrier, there’s none of this. You may as well be invisible.

It’s funny: when you’re surrounded by things like Aston Martins and Michelin-starred restaurants and private jets to Courchevel for skiing weekends, you don’t laugh or look down on people who live normally. You’re not the Mr Burns caricature of a callous, rich scumbag. But you do get used to it. And, after a while, it stops occurring to you that an Aston Martin is not a normal car to drive.

So when you see an overweight dad stumbling out of a people carrier with three screaming children in tow, you don’t sneer at him or even pity him. He’s just a bit irrelevant to you. But then you remember that the Aston is now someone else’s Aston, and that you’re standing in front of a plate-glass window at the local Tesco Extra and that the dad is your reflection.

Around this point you enter the third stage in the Kübler-Ross model of grief [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kübler-Ross_model] : bargaining. You start start telling yourself things like "I could move to be Middlesborough and be rich" and "Most people who drive Range Rovers are w----rs" and "At least I don’t have Ebola". Then the true horror sinks in and the future stretches ahead of you like a road. A flat grey road. A flat grey road you will drive down for the next 40 years at 60 mph in your Ford people carrier. The next vehicle you own will be a mobility scooter.

Here it is traditional for men to seek solace in great art and cheap booze. So I lay on the sofa listlessly drinking white wine and endlessly rewatching the final moments of Goodfellas, looking for solace or at least solidarity in Henry Hill’s fate. The bit where, facing his future in a cookie-cutter suburban nowhere, he says sulkily, “I have to wait around like everyone else... I’m an average nobody. I have to live the rest of my life like a schnook.”

I’d probably have stayed supine on the sofa marinating in self-pity and nostalgia for days but we had people down for the weekend and I love entertaining. So, I raised myself from my slough of despond and, in short order, ten of us were in the people carrier on our way to the pub. As we wound our way through the East Sussex lanes in the affluent, dappled sunlight, something unexpected happened: it occurred me that perhaps it was better to have ten friends in a people carrier than to be in an Aston with only a V12 and earplugs for company. This unexpectedly upbeat thought was followed by another: that maybe losing the Aston was a small price to pay the new house I had just bought for my family.

Weirdly, my friends even complimented me on the Ford. I don’t think they were taking the piss either, although given my reputation for self-awareness, I may be wrong. Also, when we crunched into the gravelly carpark, I didn’t get the looks from other customers that I got with the Aston. You know those looks: "Hello, London w----r, down for the weekend?"

The are other positives too. The kids love it. It’s roomier, it’s far more comfortable, there’s a huge sun-roof which they love and the seats in the back are proper, adjustable seats rather than the afterthoughts you get in sports cars. My wife is also a fan. The Ford is easier for her to drive and park and she doesn’t look ridiculous getting out of it. Also, as women see the disappearance of any sports car as a huge moral victory, she was nice to me for 15 minutes after the men came to collect the Aston.

So I decided to reappraise the Ford. Spend some more time with it. Stop viewing it as a mobile prison for my ego. Stop viewing it as "not the Aston".

The funny thing is, I quite like it too. It does miles to the gallon, rather than gallons to the mile. It’s quite a novelty seeing a quarter of a tank and thinking “no problem.” The part of my brain that once geeked out over unnecessary torque and useless horsepower now gets all keen over untold hundreds of miles between petrol stops. And it’s not just the practical stuff either. Once I got over my dumb badge snobbery, it is a better car to drive. It handles well, even at speed, and is absurdly comfy. It doesn’t have four-wheel drive (but I don’t live on a farm) and it has almost all the toys the £70k Land Rover had, while costing me £200 a month to lease.

As I’ve said earlier, people look at me differently – but maybe I view at myself a bit differently too. At the end of a recent journey, I looked in the mirror and realised we’d spent the entire journey chatting and playing number plate games and I-Spy. Suddenly, I felt like a good dad, rather than a middle aged man who half believes that a flashy car makes him George Clooney.

As I exited the people carrier, I mused that I would be 45 in a couple of weeks, and that my kids and family are everything to me. That spending money on things that make the people I love happy rather than on some James Bond fantasy might make sense. That, in some ways, the Ford was a badge of honour and a sign that I had finally ended my extended adolescence and learned to value the things that really matter. It was a strange – and rather lovely - feeling.

Don’t worry, it passed quickly. By early 2015, I reckon I’ll have cleared the financial hurdle of buying a new house and I’m pretty sure the business will be going well enough for me to re-enter the world of environmental destruction on four wheels. While we’re at it, I didn’t go completely cold turkey either, I kept the old Range Rover Sport with the supercharged Jag Engine in it.

Still, I have a new respect for Ford, ordinary drivers and the simple pleasures of mass-market motoring. I’m sure it’ll last, at least until I take delivery of my 2015 DB9. After that, I give it 15 minutes.

Richard O Smith complains that the Telegraph’s critic, Robbie Collin, subjects him to 'unfair workplace criticism'. Read his letter in full

Dear Telegraph

No one likes workplace criticism, doubly so when it is fundamentally unfair. Now imagine someone in a privileged position of authority dispensing an unjust reprimand. To you. Yet rather than just you and a shouty prat in the photocopier room, your received diatribe of criticism is heard by millions. And you have no right of reply. Open your mouth and holler “but that's unfair and not what happened at all” but no one will hear you.

That's what getting a pernicious one star review in the Telegraph for The Unbeatables movie felt like this weekend. One star for something that I, the principal screenwriter, had invested my heart and soul, neglected my marriage and missed my mother's final birthday - all to create something honest, funny and engaging for the people who had trusted us with their cinema admission money to be thoroughly entertained.

Juan Jose Campanella directed The Unbeatables. He won an Oscar for his last film, so he probably knows what he's doing. How many Oscars has Collin won? No, winning 'World's Worst Critic' for so many consecutive years that he gets to keep the trophy outright doesn't count. Oh sorry, was that workplace criticism unfair, hurtful and based on ignorance?

Hmmm [irony pause].

Collin complains about the football element being “very, very long”.

Maybe he doesn't like football? Have you considered that? I feel we're making progress here. Perhaps he just doesn't like films? We're definitely making a real breakthrough now. Working as a film reviewer must make him permanently furious, like someone allergic and phobic to cats working in a cattery.

Collin then repeated the same opening words from his Telegraph review on BBC Radio 5 this weekend before tweeting them: “Even in a memorably bad summer for children, The Unbeatables is about as wretched as it gets.” I return fire and tweet: “Even in a memorably bad summer for humanity (Israel/Palestine, ISIS, Ebola) Robbie Collin is about as wretched as it gets.” But only 218 people see my tweet. He's got BBC and a national newspaper to deliver his workplace criticisms.

Thankfully Telegraph readers arrive to ensure fairness. They post comments under the review firmly telling Collin “to do his job properly” as “it's a lovely funny film”. I have always depended on the kindness of strangers. That's a line from a movie. Collins [sic] probably awarded it one star.

Patients with other illnesses now dying due to lack of medical care amid Ebola outbreak in Liberia

Three-year-old Matu Buema lies wheezing in her hospital bed, a tiny, listless bundle in her mother Fatu's arms. The normally bouncy toddler is suffering from a bout of malaria that could easily kill her - yet right now, she is far and away the luckiest of the patients to have sought help at Phebe Hospital in central Liberia.

Last month, five of the hospital's nurses and one doctor became infected while treating a patient carrying the Ebola virus, and in the ensuing panic, most of the rest of the staff fled en masse.

The hospital has been closed ever since, and for the 330,000 residents of Bong County, a swathe of dense rainforests scattered with remote villages, there are now no emergency hospital facilities at all, be it for Ebola or anything else.

Those who bring sick or dying loved ones to Phebe's gates are stopped by security guards, some of whom carry spiked clubs in case their message that the hospital cannot help does not go down well.

The only case that get past the checkpoint are those where a child's life is in imminent danger, such as young Fatu, or mothers with complications during childbirth. Who gets in and who doesn’t is down to the discretion of the two doctors still working at the hospital, but even then there is a limit to their charity.

With most of the hospital technicians and specialists absent, many operations cannot be carried out all, and when The Telegraph visited Phebe last week, malaria-stricken Matu was the sole patient in a facility with 200 beds.

"At the moment we can look after only the most critical cases because of the lack of staff," said Kerson Saykor, the administrator of Phebe, standing next to a memorial picture of one of the dead nurses posted to a wall.

"We want the nurses to come back, but they are saying they want protective equipment in case any other patients come in with Ebola, and we do have enough of that to give them yet."

The problems at Phebe are repeated across Liberia, with scores of clinics and hospitals now shut because of the Ebola outbreak. Such has been the chaos that no hard figures on the numbers of closures are available, but with around 80 of the country's 6,000 health workers infected with the virus, including some senior physicians, the impact on the health service has been devastating.

Earlier this month, three hospitals in the capital, Monrovia, were shut, including St Joseph's Catholic Hospital, where an elderly Spanish missionary, Miguel Pajares, died from Ebola last week after being flown back to Spain for treatment. The two other hospitals in Monrovia since reopened, but are now so overstretched that people in Bong County know there is little point in making the four-hour long journey to go there.

The result is that any adult who falls acutely ill in Bong County right now can expect to die. In the township next to Phoebe hospital, a collection of shacks and breeze-block homes amid palms and dense bush, locals said that two residents had passed away in the last week alone because of lack of treatment.

One of them, Yanduay Forkpah, 69, was actually being treated in Phebe when the outbreak began, and was simply ordered to leave, according to his sister Younger Franklin, 62, who had buried him the day before The Telegraph visited.

"My brother developed pains in his neck about three weeks ago, and he spent two nights in the hospital," said Ms Franklin, as she walked down a bush trail to the clearing where his grave now lay, a mound of earth adorned with a cross made of two twigs.

"We didn't know what was wrong with him. But just as they were about to give him an X-ray, they told him the hospital was closing because the staff were dying of Ebola. Since so many other hospitals were shutting too, we had no choice but to bring him home, where he died."

Another case was that of Qweta Karba, 45, a mother-of-nine who was diagnosed two years with a chronic stomach ulcer. It suddenly grew worse again in late July, and despite agonising abdominal pain, all her husband Danny M Karba Senior could do was give her paracetamol.

"She died three days ago, by which time the pain was getting really bad for her," said Mr Karba, 62. "I am very sad that nobody was able to treat my wife – they could at least have done an ultrasound for her. The children are terribly sad."

Ironically, Mr Karba is himself one of the health workers who deserted the hospital: he works at Phebe as a nurse and counsellor treating HIV cases. But while HIV is now a known quantity, Ebola is entirely new to the region, and its horrific symptoms, which include bleeding from the eyes, inspire terror even in health workers.

"I was working there when the outbreak killed some of the nurses, and everyone just ran away," he said. "We cannot go back there until they give us protective gloves to work with people."

Right now, nobody knows quite how many people have died in Bong County and elsewhere as a result of not being able to get emergency medical treatment.

But with the outbreak engulfing not just Liberia but Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria, aid agencies fear it could get worse before it gets better. Even if they can provide health workers with the necessary protective equipment, many may still be scared to come back to work.

In an assessment paper earlier this week, UNICEF warned of an "overwhelming gap in the delivery of critical life-saving interventions" caused by the Ebola break. The report said it also risked driving patients to seek the care of bush midwives and traditional healers, many of whom do not observe proper hygienic practices.

More seriously, the absence of health workers is undermining basic vaccination programmes for the likes of measles and polio collapsing.

Immunisation rates are barely at 50 per cent at best, and the report warned that "with mothers afraid to take their children to health facilities, immunisation is expected to drop significantly by up to half the current coverage rate."

Sheldon Yett, the Liberia representative for UNICEF, told The Telegraph: "We are all now focusing on the Ebola epidemic, but we are facing other impacts just down the road because of the huge impact on the health system. There is potentially a much bigger disaster on our hands."

Police seek to trace immigrants ro'te

POLICE BEGAN a "homicide" inquiry yesterday after workers at Tilbury Docks in Essex discovered 35 illegal immigrants "screaming and banging" inside a shipping container, one of whom died on the scene.

The stowaways, all described as being from the Indian sub-continent, were suffering from hypothermia and dehydration. The survivors, who included women and children, were rushed to hospital after workers heard their cries and broke into a container on a P&O freighter arriving from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.

This was the biggest discovery of illegal immigrants at Tilbury Docks and the first to involve a death. Supt Trevor Roe of Essex Police described the group in the container as "victims of the crime of people trafficking", adding that an investigation would now establish their route to Britain and a "homicide inquiry" would probe how one of them had died. "Somebody has died inside a container, potentially unnaturally," he said.

The stowaways were found at 6.37am on board Nordstream, a P&O freighter, shortly after the ship had completed an eight-hour passage across the North Sea. Staff at Tilbury "became aware of screaming and banging coming from a particular container," said Supt Roe.

When they broke open the container, they found 35 men, women and children, all of them in obvious distress and suffering from the effects of confinement. The workers immediately called the emergency services and seven ambulances were dispatched to the docks, along with two rapid response cars, a patient transport vehicle and a "hazardous area response team".

One man was pronounced dead at the scene. All 34 survivors, including several children, were taken to three different hospitals. They were suffering from "severe dehydration and hypothermia," said Assistant Chief Officer Daniel Gore, from the East of England Ambulance Service.

Police arrived at 7.37am and searched all 50 containers on Nordstream in case the ship was carrying other stowaways. Each of these heavy steel objects, 40ft in length and almost airtight when shut, was opened. No other unauthorised passengers were on board.

All of the stowaways were from the "Indian sub-continent", said Supt Roe, and the death of the man meant that a "homicide investigation" was necessary. He stressed the survivors were not under arrest, but would be "subject to immigration detention" and transferred to centres managed by the UK Border Agency once they were out of hospital.

None of the arrivals was believed to be suffering from a life-threatening condition. Last night, the survivors were understood to be recovering quickly and some were close to being discharged. They are expected to be questioned by police in connection with the homicide investigation.

Nordstream left Zeebrugge at 10pm on Friday for its regular crossing to Tilbury. Whether the stowaways boarded at the Belgian port or at an earlier point is unclear. The first priority of the investigation will be to trace their journey. The aim would be to "backtrack and understand the movements not only of the people but of the container," said Supt Roe. The investigation will "span a number" of countries.

But the nationality of those involved was still unclear last night. Beyond establishing that they were from the Indian subcontinent - narrowing the possibilities down to the countries of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh - police appear to have discovered nothing about their origins.

None of the arrivals seems to speak English. Police said translators were being sought.

A "decontamination zone" was set up around the area where the stowaways were found, but, a spokesman for Public Health England said there was no sign of any risk from diseases such as Ebola.

Last night, Belgian police were reported to have found CCTV footage of a lorry delivering the container to Zeebrugge, but it was not known where the vehicle came from.

Almost 100,000 migrants entered Europe illegally last year via seven routes established by people smugglers.

Once within the EU, the lack of border controls allows free movement between countries. Travelling to Britain is often the goal for the arrivals.

NHS investigating 'possible' case of Ebola after woman from Sierra Leone falls ill at immigration removal centre

A woman has been tested for the Ebola virus in Scotland after falling ill at an immigration removal centre.

Health authorities confirmed they had been investigating a "possible" case of the deadly virus, adding later that the test had turned out to be negative.

The woman is believed to have arrived from Sierra Leone, one of the countries most affected by the epidemic that has claimed more than 1,000 lives across West Africa.

She was being held at the Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire and was taken to hospital for tests.

A spokesman for NHS Lanarkshire said before the negative test results were known: "We are currently investigating a possible case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (Ebola).

"This is a precautionary measure and it would appear at this stage to be highly unlikely the patient will test positive for Ebola."

A spokesman for the Home Office declined to give any further details, saying it did not comment on operational matters.

A man was previously tested for the Ebola virus in Birmingham [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10999593/Man-tested-for-Ebola-in-UK.html] but he, and another man who took himself to hospital fearing he had the virus, were both given the all clear.

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

Nigerian man in his 30s presented Ebola symptoms days after flying in to Alicante from West African country

Spain is investigating a suspected case of Ebola after a Nigerian man presented symptoms of the virus at a hospital in Alicante several days after flying in from the West African country.

The man, who has not been named but is said to be in his 30s, was admitted into San Joan hospital in Alicante on Saturday evening where he was being treated in an isolation unit.

Hospital sources confirmed he was suffering a fever of 38.3 degrees Celsius (100.9F) as well as "other symptoms associated with Ebola - including physical discomfort, vomiting and bleeding".

The patient told doctors that he had arrived in Spain from Nigeria "a few days ago".

Hospital authorities said they had "activated protocol" to deal with the infectious disease while they awaited test results.

Last week, a missionary priest became the first victim of the latest outbreak of the deadly virus to die on European soil. Miguel Pajares, 75, died at a Madrid hospital on Tuesday morning, five days after being repatriated by military plane from Liberia.

In Venezuela, an entire floor of a hotel was quarantined after a Nigerian guest showed symptoms of the virus but it was declared a false alarm after the patient tested negative for Ebola.

Kenya has become the latest country to ban travellers from parts of Ebola-hit west Africa.

Kenyan health minister James Macharia said on Saturday that the country is closing its borders to travellers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the nations most affected by the worst-ever Ebola outbreak.

The move comes amid an international appeal to help contain the deadly virus, which has already killed 1,145 people across west Africa this year.

Nigerians officials have stepped up measures to stop the deadly disease spreading through the continent's most populous nation.

Nigeria has trained 800 volunteers to help in the fight against Ebola following an appeal by authorities in Lagos for volunteers to make up for a shortage of medical personnel because of a six-week doctors' strike over pay.

Experts say Ebola is raging out of control in the region, with the World Health Organization declaring the epidemic an international health emergency and appealing for global aid.

Dr Melvin Korkor may have survived an Ebola infection, but the stigma surrounding the disease means he faces a constant challenge educating the public about the deadly outbreak

Dr Melvin Korkor was one of six members of staff at Liberia's [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] remote Phebe Hospital to contract the Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] virus last month, he is the only one still alive today.

The virus spread to the hospital after a woman from nearby Lofa County - one of the worst-affected areas - came in for treatment for diarrhoea.

She told staff that she was from a less at-risk place, but by the time they found out that she was lying, it was too late.

Three days later, some of the nurses who had treated the woman developed very high fevers, tested positive for Ebola and had to be taken to an isolation centre in Monrovia.

Dr Korkor began "having unusal feelings," similar to the symptoms of malaria and asked to be tested. His blood sample was confirmed positive and he, too, was put in isolation.

"I asked the hospital to get an ambulance to take me to Monrovia, and I confidently told them that I was going to come back," he told The Telegraph.

"Then I told my wife get me a Bible and nothing else. She started to cry, but I told her 'no crying, I am coming back'."

Four days later, he was tested again, and this time his sample came back negative, and he was able to return to Bong County.

Although delighted to have survived the ordeal, Dr Korkor has found that the stigma surrounding Ebola means very few of his friends will visit him now that he has returned, for fear that they might contract the virus too.

"I am doing great," he said. "I'm eating very well, and all the nausea and everything I felt before I was taken to the isolation centre has gone.

"I think within myself that I am indeed free of Ebola."

'Homicide inquiry' launched as dozens of desperate stowaways, all from the Indian subcontinent, are taken to hospital after being found in a shipping container in Essex

One man has died and dozens have been taken to hospital after 35 people were discovered hiding inside a shipping container at Tilbury Docks in Essex on Saturday.

The group, presumed to be illegal immigrants, were found when workers heard "screaming and banging" from inside a container as the ship was being unloaded at 6.37am, said Supt Trevor Roe of Essex Police.

Inside they discovered "adults and children of both genders" who were all suffering from the effects of confinement. Seven ambulances were immediately called to the scene. In addition, Basildon and Thurrock Hospital dispatched two rapid response cars, a patient transport services vehicle and a “hazardous area response team”.

One man was pronounced dead on the scene and all of the remaining 34 people, including some children, were taken to three different hospitals for emergency treatment. An East of England Ambulance spokesman said they were suffering from "severe dehydration and hypothermia".

Supt Roe added that the stowaways were from the "Indian sub-continent" and the death of the man meant that a "homicide investigation" was now underway. The UK Borders Agency had also been contacted because of the "immigration issues" raised by the discovery of the group. The other containers on the ship were in the process of being searched. "Our immediate priority is to ensure there are no other containers on that ship with other persons," said Supt Roe.

The P&O freight ship, Nordstream, left the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium at 10pm on Friday and arrived at Tilbury at 6am on Saturday after an eight-hour crossing. The stowaways were found inside one of the ship's 64 steel containers, which are 40ft long and almost airtight when sealed.

A "decontamination zone" was set up around the area where the people were found at Tilbury. However, a spokesperson for Public Health England said there was no sign of any risk from infectious diseases like Ebola. "If it was Ebola, health care professionals are so alert at the moment to signs and symptoms that should there have been anyone who was showing symptoms we would have been notified immediately," she said. "I think we can be confident that we are not dealing with that."

Thousands of illegal immigrants try to make the dangerous journey by sea to Britain every year. They come from a wide range of countries, including those as far apart as Afghanistan, Eritrea and Syria.

SCIENTISTS have discovered how the Ebola virus disables the body's immune response, in a discovery that should help the search for potential cures and vaccines.

Researchers from American institutions found that Ebola carries a protein called VP24, which interferes with a molecule called interferon that is vital to the immune response.

"Figuring out how VP24 promotes this disruption will suggest new ways to defeat the virus," said Dr Chris Basler, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.

The World Health Organisation yesterday reported 128 new Ebola cases and 56 deaths in West Africa in the two days to Aug 11, raising the death toll from the worst ever outbreak of the disease to 1,069.

Officials in Sierra Leone confirmed the death of a second doctor at the hands of the virus. Dr Modupeh Cole, a senior physician at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown, was diagnosed with Ebola last Friday. His death came two weeks after Sierra Leone's sole virologist, Dr Umar Khan, died from the virus after successfully treating more than 100 patients.

Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone's president, appealed to the international community for help in raising an extra £10.8 million to fund a "national response plan" to fight the epidemic.

Record number of migrants arriving in Italy and Spain as Madrid blames Morocco

Spain is blaming Morocco for giving the "green light" to migrants attempting to cross into Europe, as Italy announces that nearly 100,000 migrants have landed on Italian shores so far this year

Spain [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/] is blaming Morocco for lax controls of its borders after a record number of migrants have crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to reach Europe in the last few days.

Spanish maritime services confirmed on Tuesday that they had picked up close to 1,000 migrants in just 48 hours as they attempted to cross the narrow stretch of Mediterranean between Morocco and southern Spain in inflatable dinghies.

The influx, which has seen the largest number of migrants to arrive on Spanish shores in years, was blamed on the "permissiveness" of Moroccan authorities.

Morocco is concerned that tens of thousands of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are living in makeshift camps waiting for the opportunity to cross into Spain, either by scaling the razor wire topped fences into the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta or by attempting the perilous sea journey.

"There is a human traffic jam building up there and Morocco wants to relieve the pressure," sources told Spain's daily El Mundo newspaper. "Also they are nervous about Ebola.

"If Morocco wanted to stop the boats, it could have."

Sources from Frontex, the EU border management agency, confirmed to Spain's El Pais newspaper that Moroccan maritime authorities had ceased to patrol its northern coast.

NGOs working with migrants in Morocco reported that word quickly spread that the green light had tacitly been given to make the crossing.

"People began to spread the word that the coast was clear to cross by boat," said Helena Maleno, who works with migrants in Morocco.

Spain's foreign minister has called for an emergency meeting with his Moroccan counterpart to discuss the issue.

The sudden rush of people crossing by boat may also be due to good weather conditions and tighter controls at Spain's enclaves, leading many to try their luck crossing by sea.

Spain has boosted police presence at its north African enclaves and in July reinforced its triple razor wire fences with anti-climbing mesh, measures that have seen the number of successful crossings diminish significantly.

The number of people trying to get to Europe across the Mediterranean is already about 60 per cent higher than the whole of last year, the UN refugee agency said in July.

More than 75,000 have tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa in the first half of 2014, landing in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta, the UNHCR says, with about 800 people dying in the attempt.

And in Italy [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/], a senior government official said that nearly 100,000 migrants have landed on Italian shores so far this year.

Mario Morcone, head of the interior ministry's civil liberties and immigration department spoke after 17 Syrian migrants landed on the coast of Sardinia, only day after nine others arrived on the Italian island.

But Italian authorities have rescued 1,396 migrants in the Strait of Sicily in the past 24 hours.

Mr Morcone said the total arrivals for 2014 are already up to about 98,000 migrants.

"These are people, not in Italy for tourism but from despair," he said in a radio interview.

"Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, many of them continue to lose their lives in the crossings."

Officials have estimated that as many as 65,000 migrants have been rescued in Italian waters this year through the county's Mare Nostrum program which was established late last year to try to save migrants who flee to Europe from North Africa on often overcrowded and unsafe vessels.

Many are victims of human smugglers and on Tuesday, police arrested two men they say were responsible for the craft carrying the 1,700 migrants which included hundreds of children.

Canada to donate own Ebola vaccine to WHO for use in Africa

World Health Organisation rules it ethical to offer untested drugs to people infected by the virus with Canada freeing up around 1,000 doses of their experimental vaccine

Canada will donate a small quantity of an experimental Ebola vaccine developed in its government lab to the World Health Organisation for use in Africa, the country's health minister said on Tuesday.

The decision to donate the vaccine came after the WHO said that it was ethical to offer untested drugs to people infected by the virus.

The Canadian government will donate between 800 to 1,000 doses of the vaccine, with the final number given dependent on how much Canada holds back for research and clinical trials. The government will also keep a small supply in case it is needed domestically.

Health Minister Rona Ambrose said she offered the vaccine to Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO.

The US is also working on a vaccine and the WHO and governments involved were discussing possible use in Africa, Dr. Greg Taylor, deputy chief public health officer of the Public Health Agency of Canada told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Canadian announcement.

Canada only has about 1,500 animal doses of the vaccine, which it invented a few years ago, and would need four to six months to make a large quantity, he said. The government's vaccine is separate from the treatment being developed by Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp.

"We see this as a global resource, something we need to put on the global table to say ... how can we make best use of this asset? We're looking to do that as fast as we can," Taylor said, speaking from Ottawa.

The Ebola outbreak is the world's largest and deadliest. So far, 1,013 people have died, the vast majority in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

On Tuesday, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said their official died from Ebola in Nigeria, taking the total number of deaths in the country from the virus to three.

"The ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) Commission announces with deep regret the passing of a staff member of its Lagos Liaison Office, Mr Jatto Asihu Abdulqudir, aged 36," it said in a statement.

"Mr Abdulqudir, a protocol assistant, was among those who assisted the Liberian delegate to a regional meeting Mr Patrick Sawyer, who died from the Ebola Virus Disease at a Lagos hospital on 25th July 2014."

The official had been quarantined since Mr Sawyer was confirmed as having Ebola.

The Canadian vaccine, which the agency licensed for commercialisation to US firm BioProtection Systems, a unit of NewLink Genetics, has proven effective in animals but has never been tested in humans, Taylor said.

Last week, Iowa-based NewLink said that BioProtection had a contract with the US Department of Defence for studies to bring the Canadian Ebola vaccine closer to human testing.

"We've been trying to figure out how we can make a contribution in the fight against this disease and get our vaccine into the clinic," Brian Wiley, NewLink vice-president of business development, said.

"A large amount of work still needs to be done, but when there is a dire need the powers that be move at a quicker pace."

Canada's Mr Taylor did not specify which of several US vaccines in development he was referring to that may be used in Africa along with the Canadian vaccine.

Profectus BioSciences of Tarrytown, New York, has tested its Ebola vaccine in monkeys with good results, its chief science officer John Eldridge said on Tuesday.

Still, deciding whether to use an experimental drug on humans is "very difficult," Mr Taylor said.

"You really don't know how safe it is, you don't know what the side effects are going to be. But in this extraordinary circumstance in Africa right now, we're trying to do everything we can to assist."

The first doses in Africa would likely be available to health care workers, Mr Taylor said.

The Public Health Agency of Canada was also involved in the development of ZMapp, an experimental Ebola treatment licensed by US firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical that has been used to treat two infected American aid workers. Liberia said on Tuesday it will get Mapp's drug to treat two doctors.

A SPANISH priest became the first European to die of the Ebola virus yesterday, as the World Health Organisation authorised the use of experimental drugs to fight the virus.

Miguel Pajares, 75, a missionary priest, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital yesterday morning after being repatriated to Spain from Liberia earlier this month.

He died a day after Spain's health ministry said Madrid had obtained a course of the US-made experimental drug ZMapp over the weekend to treat the priest. Liberia said yesterday it planned to treat two infected doctors with ZMapp, the first Africans to receive it.

Brother Pajares had tested positive for haemorrhagic fever last Tuesday at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia where he had been helping to treat patients infected with the virus.

Two of his fellow workers at the hospital who had tested positive at the same time have since died.

The epidemic, described as the worst since Ebola was first discovered four decades ago, has now killed at least 1,013 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria according to the World Health Organisation, which said it is ethical to use unproven Ebola drugs and vaccines.

"There was unanimous agreement among the experts that in the special circumstances of this Ebola outbreak it is ethical to offer unregistered interventions as potential treatments or prevention," said Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organisation's assistant director general, after an ethics panel had published its guidance. A senior US health official assessing the crisis has warned that the scale of the outbreak in Liberia is overwhelming the capacity of the specialist isolation units that treat victims.

Kevin De Cock, the director for global health at America's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said one of the country's two main treatment clinics, in Lofa County, had 80 patients in a 20-bed unit.

Separately, a Liberian health official disclosed that a woman who had contracted the virus had died in an ambulance while waiting to be admitted to the other main treatment centre in Monrovia, which is also full.

Dr De Cock said that because many families were reluctant to report cases to the authorities, the number of people infected with the virus could be "several times" higher than the figure so far recorded. Health officials needed to start "actively" searching them out before they passed it to others.

"This is an extremely severe situation and quite unprecedented," he told The Daily Telegraph in an interview in Monrovia.

"Much more active searching for cases is required, with health workers going into the community and doing outreach work."

The outbreak, he added, was expected to last for at least four to six months.

In Liberia - the most vulnerable nation because its health service was wrecked during its 14-year civil war - people travelling from infected rural areas had spread Ebola into Monrovia, which now had an "independent, self-sustaining epidemic" of its own and was a "reservoir for infection" for the rest of the country.

Experimental Ebola drugs use in West Africa is ethical, says WHO

The World Health Organisation backs use of experimental Ebola drugs in West Africa outbreak

Untested medicines and vaccines should be used to treat Ebola patients, the World Health Organisation has said, as the drugs could be 'potential asset' it was argued.

Experts have warned that using human Ebola victims for experiments was not ethical but after convening a panel of ethicists the WHO has agreed that untested drugs should be used.

Others have said it was unethical to withhold experimental treatments that could potentially help patients.

In a statement released by the WHO it stipulated that patients should give consent where possible to being treated with the drugs and all aspects of their care be transparent.

The panel was convened after an experimental drug called, ZMapp, made by American biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical, was given to two American health workers infected with Ebola in Liberia.

An elderly Spanish priest who was being treated with the drug became the first European to die from Ebola.

He died on Tuesday succumbing to the virus in a Madrid hospital five days after being evacuated from Liberia.

The 75-year-old Roman Catholic priest, Miguel Pajares, was being treated in Spain after being flown to Madrid on August 7 - the first patient to be evacuated to Europe in the fast-spreading African outbreak.

He contracted Ebola at the Saint Joseph Hospital in the Liberian capital Monrovia where he worked with patients suffering from the disease.

Two American health care workers are also being treated with ZMapp while other untested medicines are being made available.

The death toll has now reached 1,013 with the largest number of reported new deaths in Liberia, where 29 people died, followed by 17 in Sierra Leone and six in Guinea.

Prof Tom Solomon, director of the Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, said: "Doctors often use drugs on a compassionate basis, to treat medical conditions for which the drugs have not been evaluated.

“However the difference here is that some of these new treatments have not been evaluated at all. For all new drugs there is always a “first in man” study, where the drug is given to a human for the first time.

“The difference here is the desire for this “first in man” experiment to be for a patient with the disease. What is key is that if these new experimental drugs are going to be used, then this should only be done in the context of a clinical trial.

Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said: "Giving unlicensed and untested (at least in humans) treatments and vaccines is a very thorny ethical issue.

"The infected US healthcare workers are receiving a type of treatment (antibodies that specifically target the virus) that has a reasonably long safety track record, so it isn't surprising - given the high fatality rate in the current outbreak - that they are happy to receive the therapy.

"But not all drugs are safe - that's why we have very stringent clinical trials. One could argue that the current outbreak provides a perfect arena in which to test new drugs, but that isn't without risk.

“We don't know their safety, we don't know if they are likely to work - sure they have been tested in animals but these studies don't always tell us what will happen in humans.

"Also, who do you give the drugs to - infected people from the general populace, or healthcare workers battling in the frontline? Restricting treatment only to healthcare workers and volunteers could be seen as unethical, but treating the larger number of local infected people isn't easy; the supply isn't large enough and trying untested treatments that may or may not work and may or may not be safe might reverse all the efforts made building trust and goodwill.

"At the end of the day, good infection control is what is going to beat this virus."

Prof Paul Hunter, Professor of Health Protection, University of East Anglia, said: "Given the likely outcome in most patients with infection without specific therapy, I think that most doctors would want to try such therapies for their patients and for themselves if infected.

“The current system of ethical review of trials of medical interventions have made substantial contributions to protection patients from potentially ineffective or harmful treatments. However, it would be intolerable if this system was so inflexible that it contributed to the deaths of patients who could be saved.

"In my view the ethical case is unequivocal. If a patient is likely to die and an experimental therapy has a reasonable chance to prevent death then it should be given. However, this does not mean that any old drug could be given.

“For an experimental compound to be given there should be good prior evidence that the therapy will work, the patient or his relatives should give informed consent wherever possible and whenever the therapy is given proper records must be kept and the outcome reported to WHO.

“Ideally the WHO should produce a list as soon as possible of experimental drugs/therapies where there is sufficient evidence for them to be considered."

The WHO statement added: "Ebola outbreaks can be contained using available interventions like early detection and isolation, contact tracing and monitoring, and adherence to rigorous procedures of infection control," the panel said in a statement.

"However, a specific treatment or vaccine would be a potent asset to counter the virus."

Ebola vaccine: how could GSK have it ready by next year?

British drug giant is at the centre of efforts to get a vaccine ready as soon as possible

An experimental vaccine for the Ebola virus has become the latest hope for health authorities battling the deadly outbreak in West Africa.

The World Health Organisation has said the vaccine - which has only ever been tested on animals - could be ready as early as next year [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/11024010/Ebola-vaccine-wont-be-ready-until-2015-says-WHO.html] .

Meeting this goal will place an unprecedented timeframe on GlaxoSmithKline, the drug maker which runs the research programme in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.

The WHO has acknowledged that there is not enough time for the vaccine to undergo the standard, years-long clinical trials process, but has concluded that in this case it would be ethical to make it widely available with much less testing [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11028049/Experimental-Ebola-drugs-use-in-West-Africa-is-ethical-says-WHO.html] .

It is likely that the vaccine would be widely available following only a small trial in humans to determine its safety, scheduled to take place later this year.

GSK's Dr Ripley Ballou has spoken to the Telegraph about how the drug giant is approaching this unique situation, one which he says he has "not experienced or even seen done" in his 30-year career.

He stresses that GSK will endeavour to put the vaccine through all the safety procedures it would have gone through under normal circumstances.

"The pathway and process are probably going to be a little different, but the basic principles are the same," he says.

"What we trying to develop this vaccine so we are aware of the emergency and urgent need for intervention but also the need to protect safety of our volunteers," he said.

GSK is planning to test the vaccine on a small group - probably tens - of people at the National Institutes for Health Vaccine Research Centre in Maryland in the US later this year.

This process - recruiting volunteers, injecting them with vaccine, following up and analysing their blood samples - normally takes six months from start to finish. GSK is hoping to trim the timeframe down to five months so it can report the results by the end of the year.

Under normal circumstances, the drug maker would then run a series of so-called randomised control trials in areas affected by the disease. This kind of trial involves some volunteers being injected with vaccine and others being given a placebo. It would determine the effectiveness of the vaccine by finding out whether the group given the vaccine was less likely to contract the disease than the placebo group.

But in the midst of an Ebola outbreak it would not be ethical to give some people a placebo version of a vaccine which had even a small chance of protecting them against the disease.

So far the WHO has only asked GSK to accelerate its first-in-human trials to get safety data as soon as possible. After that, it is unclear how drug maker will be asked to proceed.

But Dr Ballou says GSK is in constant discussion with the WHO about the longer term plan. "We cannot give a very accurate roadmap, but we're trying to get meaningful answers as quickly as possible."

Miguel Pajares dies despite being treated with an experimental drug. He had been in isolation at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital

The missionary priest repatriated to Spain from Liberia earlier this month after contracting Ebola has died in the Madrid hospital where he was being treated.

Miguel Pajares, 75, had been in isolation at Madrid’s Carlos III hospital since arriving in Spain on a military jet last Thursday when he became the first Ebola victim to be treated on European soil.

A hospital spokesman confirmed that he had died at 9.30 on Tuesday morning just a day after Spain’s health ministry said it had obtained a course of the US-made experimental drug ZMapp over the weekend in order to treat the priest.

He was being treated with the experimental drug ZMapp.

Brother Pajares had tested positive for the viral hemorrhagic fever last Tuesday at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in the Liberian capital Monrovia where he had been helping to treat patients infected with the virus.

Two of his fellow workers at the hospital who tested positive at the same time have since died from the virus.

All belonged to the Order of San Juan de Dios, a Catholic humanitarian group that runs hospitals around the world, which had asked Spain to repatriate the Spanish priest and a nun who was in isolation with him.

Juliana Bohi, 65, an Equatorial Guinean nun with Spanish nationality is in isolation at the Carlos III hospital but has so far tested negative to Ebola and has yet to show symptoms.

The Spanish priest was one of only three Ebola patients thought to have received the experimental ZMapp drug. The others are two American aid workers evacuated to Atlanta, Georgia.

A panel of medical experts has determined it is ethical to provide experimental treatments to patients infected with the deadly Ebola virus, the World Health Organisation said Tuesday as the global death toll topped 1,000.

"In the particular circumstances of this outbreak, and provided certain conditions are met, the panel reached consensus that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention," the UN's health agency said in a statement.

Why first time buyers are still piling into a hot housing market

Lending to first time buyers hits record levels, as the desire to own a home negates high house prices and looming interest rate rises

UK house price growth reaches seven year high

Mortgage lending to first-time buyers has hit a seven-year high as the group continues to pile in to the housing market, despite high property prices, according to new data from the Council of Mortgage Lending (CML).

In June, the CML recorded the highest number of loans lent to first-time buyers since December 2007 - 28,600, an increase of 7.1pc since May and 18.7pc since June 2013.

The amount borrowed is also at levels not seen since September 2007, at £4.2bn for the month, a significant increase from May (£3.8bn) and since June last year (£3.3bn).

Due to the unprecedented house price hikes over the last year, the average deposit for first-time buyers rose to £30,966 in June, compared to £29,250 12 months ago.

Despite a slow down in the rate of growth of property values [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/11024736/Abrupt-halt-to-double-digit-house-price-rises-in-London.html] witnessed in the last three months, and most keenly felt in the overheated south-east, first-time buyers continued to pile into the market in June, at what could be the top of recent price surges.

"More people are borrowing larger amounts," said Sophie Chick, analyst at Savills. "I believe it [the rise of first-time buyers piling into the housing market] is partly to do with pent up demand from the downturn and also that the desire to own a home is still sky high."

More worryingly, the affordability levels of first-time buyers continue to creep up. Disregarding new regulatory rules in the shape of the Mortgage Market Review - which came into force in April - newcomers to home ownership borrowed 3.46 times their income in the second quarter of the year, up from 3.43 in Q1.

In fact, one in five home loans in June were to high loan-to-value borrowers - albeit newcomers or serial movers - compared to one in nine a year ago.

Although safely below the excessive lending levels of 2006/2007, creeping affordability rates will reinforce Mark Carney's decision to cap high loan-to-value mortgages to prevent a return to "reckless" practices.

The Bank of England's new measures came into affect at the end of June so are yet to show in housing market data but are expected to lead to a reduction in borrowing.

The average age of a first-time buyers fell from 30 to 29 in June while the average household income rose from £36,700 from £35,700.

The relatively low level of interest rates saw the payment burden remain manageable in June at 19.3pc of gross income spent in servicing capital and interest rate payments, down slightly from 19.5pc due to rising wages.

What the experts say

"Since the beginning of the year, we have seen both the number of first-time buyers and the amount they are borrowing increase, seemingly unperturbed by MMR and rising house prices. However, we haven’t yet seen any data for the period after the Bank of England introduced further measures on 26th June. As these come into place, making it harder to borrow a high loan to income mortgage, we expect the number of first time buyers to plateau or decrease.” Sophie Chick, analyst, Savills property group.

"September will see many homes that didn't sell before the summer remarketed, many with reduced guide prices all of which will temper the final headline figure at the end of the year. With the half time results on mortgage approvals now in I expect volumes in 2014 to be up by over 10pc and prices on average to be a more sustainable 6pc up on the start of the year.

"It is interesting to see that from these figures it doesn't seem as though controversial Mortgage Market Review which took effect in April has struck down mortgage lending like the predicted dose of Ebola many had predicted perhaps. However, MMR is having a significant impact in the time it is taking many deals to go through leaving many homeowners frustrated in their attempts to move. This may get better as the system beds down but for now agents report this as a major drag on the market." Henry Pryor, housing market analyst.

"It’s important to analyse the regional variations at play here and for us not to get carried away with what is happening in the ‘UK” based on figures that have recently been completely skewed by big variations in London. I expect to see a cooling of prices in the capital but a continued increase in values elsewhere in the country as other area play catch up. That’s assuming the Bank of England don’t over react with an interest rate hike soon." Russell Quirk, founder and chief executive of eMoov, an online estate agent.

Why I fear the Ebola virus threat in Lagos

With an ill-equipped healthcare system, poor hygeine and crowded streets, Nigerians living in the country's biggest city are understandably anxious about the deadly Ebola outbreak

A Lagos friend recently told me she has stopped shaking people’s hands and avoids any bodily contact in public because she is afraid of contracting the ebola virus.

In a city of some 15 million people with “only” 10 confirmed cases of ebola so far, it is easy to dismiss her fears as mere paranoia.

But the seriousness of the ebola virus threat cannot be underestimated and my friend’s fears echo public sentiment here in Lagos. After all, it takes just one person to infect an entire community.

With news that a nurse who was part of the team in the hospital that attended to the first identified case of an ebola virus victim in Nigeria has died, the anxiety is understandable.

Discussions between ordinary Lagosians are now centred around the gravity of the threat and people are voicing concerns on how Nigeria would cope were the virus to become pandemic.

Our mediocre, ill-equipped healthcare system hardly gives much cause for confidence. Nor the fact that doctors in state run hospitals happen to be currently on strike.

Hygiene practices in most public hospitals also leave much to be desired and there is a lack of basic equipment. For example, it is not unusual for gloves to be rationed in public hospitals.

And in a congested city like Lagos where housing is scarce and people often live in cramped spaces, it is all too easy to imagine such a highly-infectious disease spreading rapidly.

Furthermore, preventing an epidemic is not easy in a place where many people who might suddenly feel ill do not have cars, cannot afford taxis or ambulances (which are mostly private and expensive), and would likely have to resort to being transported to a hospital via public transportation, thus potentially endangering others.

Such scenarios do not bear thinking about as our public buses are most times overcrowded in humid, cramped conditions.

Added to that is the possibility of undetected cases. Many Nigerians do not visit hospitals when ill for a variety of reasons - ranging from financial to a proclivity for self medication or in some cases, a preference for traditional medicine.

There is a danger in the fact that the early symptoms of the deadly ebola virus are similar to that of malaria, a very common illness in Nigeria for which people usually simply buy over the counter drugs from the nearest pharmacy. Malaria is as common here as the flu is in Europe so people hardly think of visiting a doctor whenever they experience malaria-like symptoms.

More needs to be done in terms of raising awareness among Nigerians while cases of identified ebola virus victims are still relatively low. Bearing in mind a prevalent culture of poor preparation for contingencies and government lip-service, it is all too easy to imagine the situation spiraling out of control.

Public responsibility is necessary too. So far, many comments on social media about the ebola virus threat paint a disturbing picture of how it is viewed by ordinary citizens. Some see it as part of a western conspiracy to “infect Africans.”

Such sentiments are hardly helpful. It is also not uncommon for Nigerians to use humour and flippancy as a defence mechanism against the tough realities of everyday life here; however trying to brush off this particular situation with jokes could lead to careless attitudes amongst some regarding safety measures.

Therefore, educating the public about the proper approach towards the virus threat should be of paramount importance to the authorities in addition to putting stringent control measures in place.

Hopefully, the current ebola virus threat in Nigeria will force a radical improvement of the healthcare sector as well as emergency responses.

Unlike some diseases which broke out and remained in remote areas of Nigeria in the past, therefore staying out of the public consciousness with only cursory regard paid to them by the authorities, the ebola virus in Lagos speaks a danger none can ignore.

In the meantime, it seems wise to follow my friend's steps and heed the WHO recommendation on greeting: a friendly smile and nod will do just fine instead of a warm handshake.

Ebola outbreak is overwhelming health services, warns top US medic

Dr Kevin De Cock, of the US Centre for Disease Control, says the situation in Liberia is "extremely severe"

The scale of the west African Ebola outbreak in Liberia is completely overwhelming the capacity of specialist isolation units that treat victims, a senior US health official assessing the crisis has warned.

De Kevin De Cock, the director for global health at America's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said one of the country’s two main treatment clinics, in Lofa County, currently had 80 patients in a 20-bed unit.

Separately, a Liberian health official disclosed to The Telegraph that a woman who had contracted the virus died in an ambulance while awaiting to be admitted to the other main treatment centre in the capital, Monrovia, which is also full.

Dr De Cock said that because many families were reluctant to report cases to the authorities, the number of people infected with the virus could be “several" times higher than the number so far recorded by authorities. Health officials needed to start "actively" searching them out before they passed it to others.

"This is an extremely severe situation and quite unprecedented," he told The Telegraph in an interview in Monrovia. “Much more active searching for cases is required, with health workers going out into the community and doing outreach work.”

The outbreak, he added, was currently expected to last around four to six months, but could last longer.

Belgian-born Dr De Cock, who trained in medicine at Bristol University and is a visiting professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world expert on virus control and has played a leading role in the fight against HIV.

His organisation is based in Atlanta, Georgia, near the hospital that is treating Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the two aid workers who were infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia.

Since arriving in Liberia, he has been working to assess the likely scale of the outbreak, which has already alarmed health experts by the speed with which it spread, initially in rural interior areas of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, but then also to the three countries' coastal capitals.

"Most of us are surprised at the extent of this epidemic and its spread into capital cities," he said. "We have not seen that before, an epidemic affecting three countries at once, rural and urban areas."

In Liberia - considered the most vulnerable of all the infected nations because its health service was decimated during its 14-year civil war - people travelling from infected rural areas had spread it into Monrovia, which was now an "independent, self-sustaining epidemic" of its own and a "reservoir for infection" to the rest of the country.

Dr De Cock was also disturbed by the way Liberia's health system had been a conduit for the disease. Around 15 per cent of the recorded cases so far in Liberia involve health workers, some of whom had caught it off patients and are then believed to have passed it on to others themselves.

"Health care settings have played an important part in amplifying the epidemic, from the public to the health workers and the other way around," he said. "It is also a tragedy for the health workers themselves, between 70 and 80 of whom have died.

"I didn't really expect to find this, and we now need to have a very strong emphasis on health care control."

He said that officials still "did not know" how long the outbreak would last, partly because many Liberians were still reluctant to report cases because of the social stigma involved. However, while public education campaigns now appear to be having some success in encouraging them to come forward, any ensuing increase in the number of reported cases would be impossible for the specialist isolation centres to cope with.

Aid agencies like Medicins Sans Frontieres, which is just about to open a new centre in Monrovia, are already stretched to capacity by the outbreak, which is the largest in history and has already claimed nearly 1,013 lives.

"We are simply not going to be able to provide isolation units everywhere, so we need to work out something that is still a decent level of care,” said Dr De Cock.

“That is going to be a challenge but it is feasible, because it is happening already: in some places, patients are staying in their own homes, and villages have isolated themselves."

DOCTORS stepped up their attempts to halt the spread of the Ebola outbreak yesterday, as three American missionaries who came into contact with a victim of the virus were quarantined and Liberian authorities shut down a third entire province.

Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) hosted a meeting to discuss the possibility of using experimental drugs on patients. However, health officials are divided as to the merits of using drugs that have not been tested.

WHO officials have declared the outbreak, which has killed at least 961 people, becoming the worst in recorded history, a global public health emergency.

Most of the current cases are in the three west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos has 10 confirmed cases, up from seven at the last count. Two patients have died.

In America, three church workers – including the husband of a missionary being treated for Ebola in Atlanta – have been quarantined in North Carolina after returning from west Africa.

Rwandan authorities said they had quarantined a German student with Ebola–like symptoms. The patient was the first to be tested in Rwanda since the outbreak began.

The announcement came following reports that a child who died in a Guinea border town just before Christmas last year was the "patient zero" whose illness began the crisis.

The two–year–old boy was from Guéckédou, a jungle village which lies on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone, and was reportedly declared the first case of the outbreak by investigators.

Liberians ignore guidelines on testing bodies of possible Ebola victims

Liberia's government is cremating the remains of possible Ebola victims without testing whether they have the virus

Liberia's government is cremating the remains of possible Ebola victims without testing whether they have the virus, leaving relations unaware if they may be at risk of the disease as well.

Current guidelines to stop the spread of the outbreak in west Africa recommend that anyone who dies from an unconfirmed illness be tested for the Ebola before the body is disposed of.

As well as helping health officials to monitor the number of fatalities, a positive result means the virus may well have been passed on to friends and relations. But, such is the chaos in Liberia's health service, ministry of health undertakers are being instructed simply to take them directly for cremation.

When The Telegraph accompanied one such team on their collection duties last week in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, the four bodies collected during the course of an afternoon were driven straight to the crematorium at the nearby town of Marshall.

This was despite the fact that some of the families who reported the corpses for collection had done so in the specific expectation that medical tests would be carried out.

The gap in the protocols has alarmed aid agencies, which say it risks fostering a false sense of security among victims' relations, many of whom are reluctant to admit that a loved one may have died from the disease anyway. If the test is negative, it also stops them being ostracised by the rest of their community.

"It is very important to keep a record of who has actually died from Ebola and who hasn't, because without reliable data, it is very difficult to assess the spread of the disease," said Lindis Hurum, emergency coordinator with Médecins Sans Frontières in Liberia.

"Also, for a family, it important to know what their loved one has died from. If they aren't being told that, then there is less incentive for them to report the bodies to the authorities in the first place."

Since the start of the outbreak in March, health officials across west Africa have fought an uphill battle in getting the public to report the deaths. Failure to do so has been one of main reasons for the spread of the illness, as carriers can potentially infect dozens of other people. Under normal guidelines, if a person is found to have died from the virus, health officials try to identify an entire "contact chain" of people to whom it may have been passed.

The lack of a proper testing regime came amid growing concerns about the Liberian government's handling of the crisis. The country's health service was 95 per cent destroyed during the 14-year civil war that ended in 2003. Officials admit that the Ebola outbreak has caught them unawares.

When the disease first broke out, hospital and clinical staff were not equipped with gloves or other protective equipment to treat patients, resulting in several becoming infected. That led to a number of hospitals and clinics being shut.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, apologised on Saturday for the high death toll among the country's health care workers who have fought the Ebola outbreak, which has killed nearly 1,000 people in three countries.

She pledged up to $18 million (£11 million) for the Ebola fight, part of which will be given to health workers to help with insurance and death benefits, to fund more ambulances and to increase the number of treatment centres.

Toddler was 'patient zero' who triggered Ebola outbreak

Investigators say they have discovered the case which sparked the West Africa pandemic, as Rwandan authorities quarantine the country's first suspected Ebola patient

A toddler who died in a Guinea border town just before Christmas last year was the “patient zero” who sparked the Ebola crisis, according to reports.

The two-year-old boy was from Guéckédou, a jungle village which lies on the country’s border with Liberia and Sierra Leone – two countries which have been badly affected by the deadly virus.

Disease investigators said that after falling ill with a fever and vomiting, he then died on December 6, according to a report in the New York Times. A week later his mother and three-year-old sister were also killed by the virus – which has claimed nearly 1000 lives across West Africa in the worst recorded outbreak in history.

The reports came as the Rwandan authorities quarantined a German student with Ebola-like symptoms, according to the country’s health ministry.

The patient was the first to be tested for the disease in Rwanda since the beginning of the outbreak.

Meanwhile Spain said it had obtained a dose of a US-made experimental Ebola drug to treat a Spanish missionary priest evacuated from Liberia last week after testing positive for the killer virus.

The Spanish health ministry announced on Monday that the ZMapp drug was obtained in Geneva this weekend and brought to Madrid to treat Miguel Pajares. The 75-year-old priest was placed in isolation on Thursday at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital.

Ebola is one of the world's most deadly diseases, with no known vaccine or cure. The Zaire strain - the one currently spreading through West Africa - can kill up to 90 percent of sufferers, although in the latest outbreak the death toll has been around 55 percent.

Two Americans diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia and evacuated back to the United States have been treated with the drug and are said to be improving, but the US has resisted calls to make it available to African victims, saying not enough is yet known about its efficacy.

Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the pandemic represents an international health emergency that will likely continue spreading for months. It said 961 people have died and 1,779 have been infected.

The disease has strained health systems of affected states and governments have responded with measures including national emergencies declared in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

Nigeria, which on Monday said its number of confirmed cases had risen to 10, faces the added problem that public doctors are on strike over pay and working conditions and have resisted calls by the government to end their strike to tackle the Ebola crisis.

The Nigerian Red Cross said it had provided 18 volunteers to work with the authorities to educate people on how Ebola is spread.

"A man came in whose wife had died from Ebola, he himself was healthy and he had a small child who was sick, a baby, the baby died and he didn't want to give us the child's body he just said he wanted to die with his baby".

In an effort to contain an epidemic that has cost nearly 1,000 lives throughout west Africa, the Liberian government earlier quarantined Boma and Grand Cape Mount, the most affected northern provinces.

Hostile mobs and infected bodies all in a day's work for team that deals with casualties of deadly virus

In calmer times in Liberia, before the fear of Ebola became as feverish as the onset of the disease itself, Cecilia Johnson’s funeral could have been a dignified affair.

But when she died of an unspecified illness on Thursday, her family in St Paul's Bridge, a slum district of the capital, Monrovia, ignored government edicts to hand her body over for cremation.

Instead, fearing the prospect of being quarantined themselves if they reported it, they sneaked it to the cemetery in neighbouring Tyre Shop Community for burial the following morning.

The problem was that nobody wanted it there. Halfway through the burial, they were confronted by an angry crowd of Tyre Shop residents, demanding to know why a potentially-infected corpse was going in "their" cemetery. A scuffle ensued, and eight hours later, Ms Johnson's corpse lay parked by the roadside in a rusting, mud-spattered wheelbarrow, covered by a piece of carpet and still seeking a final resting place.

For the two distressed relatives who remained by her side, standing drenched in a tropical storm, it was a case of Not in My Backyard, and Not in My Graveyard either.

Such was the scene that greeted the Liberian government's new Ebola "burial team" on Friday, as their convoy arrived, sirens blaring, to pick the corpse. Set up specifically to deal with the Ebola outbreak, which has now claimed nearly 1,000 lives across west Africa, theirs is probably the most dangerous undertakers' job in the world [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11024042/Meet-the-worlds-bravest-undertakers-Liberias-Ebola-burial-squad.html] .

It is not just the threat of the deadly virus itself, which is still highly contagious in dead bodies. It is also an extremely sensitive issue with locals, for whom a visit from a team in boiler suits and masks is the modern-day equivalent of having an "X" marked on their door during the days of Europe's Black Death.

"We have been attacked by mobs of people many times," said the team's leader, Mark Korvayan, who sports a scar on his shaved head from one recent battle, and whose team is now routinely escorted by the police. "The police escort helps, but this is still a dangerous job."

In Liberia's teeming, close-knit shanty towns, the stigma attached to Ebola is considerable. Such is the terror inspired by its horror-movie like symptoms - victims in the latter stages can bleed from their eyes - that many are convinced it is the work of evil spirits, not a virus. Either way, families suspected of losing a loved one to it are often ostracised, as the remaining members of the Johnson family burial party are now learning the hard way.

It would be an utter tragedy if we did not defend the Kurds

Kurdistan, an oasis of stability and tolerance in the Middle East, now faces Islamist slaughter

Like all the rest of us I have been looking with sickened disbelief at the changes in the map of northern Iraq, and the Ebola–like spread of the fanatics. It seems incredible that the disintegration should happen so fast.

It was only in May this year that we welcomed a dynamic and forward–looking young politician to City Hall in London. His name is Nechirvan Barzani, and he is the prime minister of the fledgling state of Kurdistan. He brought his finance guy, his transport minister, his tourism minister – the whole lot.

For about an hour we talked about the great Kurdish boom, and their plans to build ski resorts, hotels: how to put the place firmly on the map for the British tourist. We talked about how to beat traffic congestion and how London could help advise with transforming Erbil into the natural banking centre of the Middle East.

We ended pledging deeper cooperation, and the prime minister presented London with a lovely embroidered carpet and some scenes of Kurdistan (all duly registered), and I presented him with a copy of one of my books and some engraved whisky glasses, though I am not sure how much whisky they drink out there. I promised to come as soon as possible to inaugurate the ski slopes.

Now look at poor Kurdistan. Barely 20 miles from their prosperous capital the Kurds face one of the most horrible and brutal armies since the Middle Ages. The troops of the Islamic State are already in possession of the dam at the key Kurdish city of Mosul, with all the power that gives them over lives downstream on the Tigris.

They are killing, raping, beheading and burying alive. They are offering people the choice of converting to Islam or facing instant execution. They have so terrified the population of northern Iraq – with its patchwork of ethnic groups and faiths – that the minorities have fled for their lives. As of today, there are still tens of thousands camped out on bare hillsides, their children dying of thirst, in scenes of biblical horror.

We are watching a catastrophe unfold, and the Prime Minister is absolutely right in his instinct – that Britain must act, and that Britain must help. I know how people feel these days about getting involved in overseas conflicts. There is a deep weariness and cynicism that has entered the bones of the nation – a sense that we were all bamboozled by Blair over Iraq, and that we won't be fooled again.

People will look at the tragedy of the Yazidi and the Christians, and they will reasonably ask why we are choosing to try to help here, when we decided in the end there was nothing we could do for the Syrians who were being massacred in Aleppo. People will ask, reasonably, why us, when we are only a medium–sized European power with an overstretched Army and a budget deficit of our own.

Public hesitations are entirely understandable; and yet I am certain that it is time to get involved, and to support the American–led operation. We have to act because this is a humanitarian crisis.

I have heard some people suggest that there is some kind of extra imperative here, because many of these persecuted folk are Christians, and therefore our official co–religionists. That strikes me as paradoxical, since the central message of Christ was surely that we should treat everyone as our neighbours – and that applies surely to the Yazidi, who believe in the Peacock Angel, as much as it does to Christians.

It doesn't matter if you are a Christian or Jew or a Muslim or a Yazidi. If you are facing the kind of genocide that seems to be underway in northern Iraq, you surely deserve whatever relief and protection we can provide.

Then we should help because we have a moral duty to that part of the world. It was the British who took the decision in the early Twenties to ignore the obvious ethnic divisions, and not to create a Kurdistan. (Indeed, on one notorious occasion the British actually used gas to suppress a Kurdish revolt.)

And it was a British decision to join in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in the removal of Saddam Hussein; and pace Tony Blair, it is obvious to most sane and rational people (a category that seems not to include Blair) that one of the results of the end of Saddam and the Ba'athist tyranny has been the power vacuum in Iraq, and the incompetence that has allowed Isis to expand with such horrifying speed. The final reason why we should come to the aid of the Kurds and others is that it is in our interest to do so.

My old friend the Kurdish journalist Hazhir Teimourian used to tell me sorrowfully: "There is an old proverb – a Kurd has no friends." I am not sure that is true any more. In the aftermath of the first Gulf war in 1991 the Kurds were driven into the mountains by the vengeful troops of Saddam. The people of Britain were appalled by their misery. John Major was so moved that he set up the no–fly zones that were the precursor to the modern state.

In the last few years the links between Britain and Kurdistan have been developing fast, with the first ministerial delegation from London arriving there two years ago. Standard Chartered Bank has established there, as well as many other firms. They are going not simply because Kurdistan has theoretically the sixth largest oil deposits in the world, but because the place is an oasis of stability and tolerance. They have a democratic system; they are pushing forward with women's rights; they insist on complete mutual respect of all religions.

It would be an utter tragedy if we did not do everything in our power to give succour and relief to those who are now facing massacre and persecution, and to help repel the maniacs from one of the few bright spots in the Middle East.

Yes, we have got it wrong before; and yes, we cannot do everything. But that doesn't mean we should collapse into passivity and quietism in the face of manifest evil. These people need our help.

Meet the world's bravest undertakers - Liberia's Ebola burial squad

Hostile mobs and infected bodies all in a day's work for team that deals with casualties of deadly virus

In calmer times in Liberia, before the fear of Ebola became as feverish as the onset of the disease itself, Cecilia Johnson’s funeral could have been a dignified affair.

But when she died of an unspecified illness on Thursday, her family in St Paul's Bridge, a slum district of the capital, Monrovia, ignored government edicts to hand her body over for cremation.

Instead, fearing the prospect of being quarantined themselves if they reported it, they sneaked it to the cemetery in neighbouring Tyre Shop Community for burial the following morning.

The problem was that nobody wanted it there. Halfway through the burial, they were confronted by an angry crowd of Tyre Shop residents, demanding to know why a potentially-infected corpse was going in "their" cemetery. A scuffle ensued, and eight hours later, Ms Johnson's corpse lay parked by the roadside in a rusting, mud-spattered wheelbarrow, covered by a piece of carpet and still seeking a final resting place.

For the two distressed relatives who remained by her side, standing drenched in a tropical storm, it was a case of Not in My Backyard, and Not in My Graveyard either.

Such was the scene that greeted the Liberian government's new Ebola "burial team" on Friday, as their convoy arrived, sirens blaring, to pick the corpse. Set up specifically to deal with the Ebola outbreak, which has now claimed nearly 1,000 lives across west Africa, theirs is probably the most dangerous undertakers' job in the world.

It is not just the threat of the deadly virus itself, which is still highly contagious in dead bodies. It is also an extremely sensitive issue with locals, for whom a visit from a team in boiler suits and masks is the modern-day equivalent of having an "X" marked on their door during the days of Europe's Black Death.

"We have been attacked by mobs of people many times," said the team's leader, Mark Korvayan, who sports a scar on his shaved head from one recent battle, and whose team is now routinely escorted by the police. "The police escort helps, but this is still a dangerous job."

In Liberia's teeming, close-knit shanty towns, the stigma attached to Ebola is considerable. Such is the terror inspired by its horror-movie like symptoms - victims in the latter stages can bleed from their eyes - that many are convinced it is the work of evil spirits, not a virus. Either way, families suspected of losing a loved one to it are often ostracised, as the remaining members of the Johnson family burial party are now learning the hard way.

For the last few hours, a large crowd has been eyeballing them suspiciously, and a Liberian army patrol - called in to break up the earlier scuffling - has stayed on hand hand keep the peace. The other thing that is keeping the two relatives from being physically attacked is the fear that they themselves may both be infected.

"People here have been gathering around and looking at us in a funny way," complained one relative, as he stood by Cecilia’s body. "It is like they think there is something wrong with us."

Like many other bereaved families that the burial team visit, he is loathe to admit that the cause of Cecilia's death could have been Ebola.

His own diagnosis is that she died because of complications from a bullet wound suffered during "World War Three" the Liberian name for the bloody battle in 2003 that brought down the regime of warlord Charles Taylor.

But not surprisingly, the residents of Tyre Shop Community were somewhat sceptical.

"We asked them if they had an official clearance, but they said ‘no’," said James Zeyzey, 37, the Tyre Shop Community chairman. "So we told them to take the body back, and there was a bit of a fight.

"St Paul's Bridge, where they come from, is a known Ebola zone. We do not want people to bury bodies in our cemetery - it is already full."

Like most other people in Tyre Shop, Mr Zeyzey and the Johnson family speak to me in Liberian English, a heavy patois inflected with the vernacular of the freed American slaves who founded the country in the 19th century. But while it is hard to make out some of the words, I have to resist the natural urge to come closer to listen. Ebola is transmitted by bodily fluids such as saliva, and nobody wants the spittle of a victim's agitated relative landing in their face.

For the burial team, though, close contact with victims is unavoidable. Hence the exhaustive self-protection measures, which include white masks, gloves and white boiler suits, the cuffs of which are bound tightly with masking tape to make sure they are hermitically sealed. Just getting dressed takes around 20 minutes.

"When you pick the bodies up, there is often fluid leaking out of them," said Mr Korvayan, as he helped a colleague robe up. "You have to be very careful."

Then begins the task of wrapping Ms Johnson's in a large plastic shroud and heaving it into a waiting flatbed truck. It is exhausting work, not helped by the fact that in Liberia's humid temperatures, the airtight suits get so hot inside that they have to be removed every 45 minutes.

That the burial team is even out on the streets is testament to their dedication. Many other Liberian health workers have been too scared to even turn up to work, forcing the closure of parts of its war-shattered health service just when it is needed most.

Liberia is considered the least-equipped of all of the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak, which now also includes Nigeria as well as Guinea and Sierra Leone, and which was on Friday was officially classified as an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation.

When The Telegraph accompanied the burial team on Friday afternoon, they answered five call-outs, most of them to an emergency "bodies hotline" that the government has set up. Reaching each locations in Monrovia's maze-like shanty towns was a task in itself, and not all the visits went to plan. At the first call, amid the half-flooded alleyways of Rotu Town, a blazing row erupted as the family refused to hand over the body.

The call to the unit had been made by Deacon Steven F Cooper 1st, whose sister had died the afternoon before from what he said was jaundice. However, he had called the team mainly in the hope that they would confirm his diagnosis, and when they said they were there simply to pick up the body, his co-operation ended.

"My sister is not dead from Ebola - if I thought that myself, I would not have come anywhere near here," Mr Cooper insisted. "We called the hotline all day to get a team to come and clear the doubts of the community, but now that hasn't happened."

Other visits, however, suggest the government's messages are belatedly getting through. At another call, an orderly crowd looks on as the body of Tama Counde Senior, 63, is removed from the shack where he died, less than a week after his wife had also passed away.

"I don't know what was wrong with them, but when my mother died, everybody abandoned us, so my father put her body in the casket himself," said his grieving son Junior, 34. "Maybe a virus crossed into him then."

Yet families who report deaths do not get much reward for doing the right thing. The bodies are simply taken for immediate cremation, with no testing that might put relatives in the clear. And with Liberia's health system in ruins, there is little in the way of follow-up help. Junior Counde, for example, complains that nobody in his neighbourhood will now come to visit him, while at the team's final call of the day, a local tribal chief talks of a vomiting woman living nearby whom everyone is terrified to go near.

"She is throwing up all the time but everyone is scared to go near her," said Sa Harris, 48. "They need to open the hospitals again."

The last body to be removed is housewife Shettema Bole, 41, dearly beloved of Tamba Bole, 52, and who died in the small hours of that morning. As the team emerges from her home with her shroud, a song goes up among the local womenfolk, a gentle, choir-like murmur. "Where are you going dear mother, why are you leaving us so young?"

Unlike Ms Johnson in her wheelbarrow, it is a farewell that Mr Bole, who is watching, can be proud of. But with little sign of the Ebola being brought under control, it is one that may ring out many more times yet around St Paul's.

World health chiefs declare international emergency

The Ebola outbreak in west Africa was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) yesterday as the number of dead neared 1,000 and authorities expressed fears that the virus could spread worldwide.

Dr Margaret Chan, the WHO director–general, appealed for global help to combat what she said was "the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the nearly fourdecade history of this disease".

A coordinated response was essential to stop the international spread of the disease, the organisation said after a two–day emergency meeting. "The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it," Dr Chan said, noting that the countries affected – Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria – could not cope with the virus on their own. "I am declaring the current outbreak a public health emergency of international concern."

The WHO warning came after US health authorities admitted that Ebola could spread beyond West Africa and possibly to the United States.

"We are all connected and inevitably there will be travellers … here with symptoms," Tom Frieden, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told a congressional committee. A spokesman later stressed that those with suspect symptoms might not necessarily have Ebola.

Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable haemorrhaging. There is no known cure, although scientists have called for an experimental drug, ZMapp, being used on two infected American aid workers to be made available for African victims.

The toll from the outbreak has now risen to 961, with more than 1,700 confirmed cases. Nigeria has been the least affected, with two deaths and seven confirmed cases in Lagos, but the city's status as a regional hub for international travel makes a wider outbreak there a major concern.

Benin, to the west of Nigeria, was awaiting test results from two patients with Ebola–like symptoms. In Uganda, a suspected Ebola patient tested negative – but the case fuelled fears that the virus could spread to east Africa. States of emergency have been declared in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with soldiers guarding clinics and sealing off roads to the worst hit areas – a measure the WHO said was a necessary first step towards containing the outbreak. In Europe, Greece reported yesterday that a male citizen who had recently travelled to Nigeria was being tested for Ebola at an Athens hospital.

The first confirmed Ebola patient to be treated in Europe – an elderly Spanish priest who was airlifted to a Madrid hospital after becoming infected during aid work in Liberia – was said by officials to be "weakened and feverish" but stable.

The European Commission insisted that the risk to the continent from the virus was "extremely low", in part due to high standards of health care and prevention.

Death and denial, the curse of Ebola

Health workers face struggle against hostility and ignorance as deadly disease spreads in the fetid slums of Monrovia

Dispatch

IF EVER there was a likely spot for an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, New Kru Town in Liberia is it.

A sprawling slum of the country's warravaged capital, Monrovia, it is home to 50,000 people and has next to no functioning lavatories, sinks or bathrooms. Sewage runs openly through its maze of corrugated shacks, and in Liberia's wet season – at its height now – tropical torrents turn it into one vast, warm, moist breeding pool for germs.

It hardly feels surprising then, in the wake of several locals dying from Ebola, to see health teams daubing blue crosses on a number of shacks around town.

The crosses are not to identify those who have caught the disease, but to mark the relatively few New Kru Towners who have been visited by the teams and accepted their advice on how to avoid getting it. So far, only around 500 houses have been marked – and with health workers themselves accused of spreading the disease, some parts of New Kru Town remain decidedly hostile.

"This is a very poor neighbourhood where sanitation is lacking and people are not well educated in the principles of hygiene," said Tamba Bundor, the leader of a team of volunteers from the local health charity Community Development Services, a Unicef partner, as he drove his car through wet, sandy back lanes.

"It is where the first victims of Ebola died in Monrovia, and most people who have been affected became so because they did not adhere to the messages of prevention."

Nearly 1,000 people have now died of the disease across west Africa. While the outbreak started in remote forested inland areas – possibly via fruit bats – New Kru Town is an example of the ease and unpredictability with which it has spread to urban capitals along the coastline, catching health officials off–guard.

When some initial cases first appeared in Liberia's northern Lofa County in March, health officials initially thought they had it under control. But in June, a resident of a district of New Kru Town known as Carpet Street died, as did several others.

According to Dr Bernice Dahn, Liberia's chief medical officer, three of the victims died while being sheltered in a local church – a sign of how some people believe the disease is a curse that can be cured by prayer or witchcraft.

"We must stop keeping people suspected of Ebola in our churches on the grounds that we can heal them," she warned at the time. "The churches are not hospitals."

Liberian hospitals, however, do not always inspire the kind of faith that people have in Liberian churches. A fortnight ago, one of the main local health facilities, Redemption Hospital, was stoned by a mob after a woman died in there from suspected Ebola, following nationwide rumours that health workers were passing on the disease.

Today, the squat, single–storey building offers redemption no more, having been shut down temporarily, its staff afraid for their own safety.

Safety is a concern too for Mr Bundor and his colleagues, who were attacked as they tried to visit the house of the bereaved family on Carpet Street.

The victim's relations were insisting that their loved one had died as a result of a family curse – a cause of death that, in New Kru Town anyway, carries less social stigma than dying of an infectious disease. "The family of the victim were angry, saying it was a curse, not Ebola," said Anthony Worpor, another of Mr Bundor's health team, who was clad in a T–shirt that said "Save lives, wash your hands before you eat".

"A crowd gathered, and some accused us health workers of spreading the disease. They even began touching a local journalist we had brought with us, saying, 'If you think it is us spreading it, then here you are, we will infect you'."

New Kru Town was originally named after the Kru, a powerful ethnic group. They were traditionally known for a certain independence of mind, and European slave traders used to complain that they were particularly resistant to capture, to the point where their price as slaves was considerably lower.

They proved equally hostile to the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in the 19th century, when the latter tried to muscle in on their trading empires.

Today, New Kru Town is home to a wider ethnic mix, but even so, suspicion of outside influences persists. While Mr Bundor's education programme has already enjoyed some success, he estimates that 40 per cent of New Kru Town's residents are still "in denial" about Ebola's risks and the necessary health measures to avoid it.

Indeed, some residents seem to treat Mr Bundor rather like a Christian doorto–door preacher, listening politely to his warnings but not heeding them.

For example, at Alan's Bar, a dinghy shebeen, a poster warning of the dangers of Ebola was fixed to the front door. Yet official health advice is to avoid bars and other public gathering places altogether now, a message that the groups of drinkers inside, listening to blaring African disco music, have chosen to ignore.

The owner of the bar, Alan Tokba, told The Daily Telegraph that "no dancing was allowed" inside, and that visitors were being asked to wash their hands as they went in.

Mr Bundor admitted that it was "not satisfactory". Nor was he entirely happy with the efforts of Tina Teeh, 26, a mother of three. Her house already bore the blue cross of one of New Kru Town's hygiene converts, but the bucket of chlorinated water she had for her children to wash their hands did not have a separate container to drip the fluid on to their hands first. "I can't afford it," she told the disapproving Mr Bundor.

"But what if you end up ill?" he asked her. "Then you will have to afford hospital fees."

Another mother who claimed to have seen the light was Julie Life, 30, who admitted having been sceptical that Ebola even existed when Mr Bundor first visited her home a few days ago. She said her main reason for changing her mind was watching a deadly virus at work in the Tom Cruise film Mission Impossible II.

As Mr Bundor and his colleagues trudged off to root out New Kru Town's remaining Ebola "deniers", it seemed an apt description of their task.

Will genetic modification become popular by beating the Ebola plague? The experimental drug, ZMapp, which so far seems to be helping two infected Americans, is made from modified antibodies that – just to complete the green demonology – have been grown in tobacco leaves by a company with ties to the US defence department. But if the drug succeeds, and can be manufactured fast enough, there will surely be few complaints about how it was created.

There are already virtually none about GM insulin, which has benefited millions of diabetics. And an Oxford company is trialling an attempt to beat dengue fever, by releasing male GM mosquitoes, which will breed with wild females but fail to produce viable offspring: if it works, it may receive similar applause.

GM crops were rejected here largely because they posed risks, but only really benefited the companies that made them. Now, as The Daily Telegraph reported this week, a trial crop rich in Omega 3 is about to be harvested. This is not straightforward: such "nutraceuticals" could pose hazards to some people. But it, like all GM, should be debated sensibly, without returning to the old slanging match between those who back or reject the technology unquestioningly.

Man walked into Manhattan emergency room with high fever soon after returning from West Africa

A patient at a New York hospital is reported to be undergoing tests for the Ebola virus after developing a high fever soon after returning from West Africa.

ABC News said that the unnamed man went to the emergency room at Mount Sinai Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side with symptoms including a high temperature.

He is said to have been immediately placed in isolation, where he is undergoing tests.

In a statement, the hospital said: "All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff.

"We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients."

Mount Sinai is understood to be following guidelines set in place last week by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for hospitals dealing with suspected Ebola cases.

If confirmed, the patient will become the third Ebola patient to be treated in the US. It is not known where exactly he had been visiting, but West Africa is the seat of the worst of the outbreak.

Dr Kent Brantly, a missionary who contracted the virus while helping victims in Liberia, was flown to Atlanta, Georgia, at the weekend, and is said to be improving while being treated in isolation.

He is due to be joined tomorrow by Nancy Writebol, who fell ill while working in the same hospital as Dr Brantly.

President Barack Obama has invited more than 50 heads of state to the White House

Fifty African heads of state are due to arrive for a summit and gala dinner at the White House with the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus expected to dominate the agenda.

Two leaders, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who is the president of Liberia, and Ernest Bai Koroma, premier of Sierra Leone, pulled out of the event at the last minute as their countries battle the disease which has claimed more than 800 lives.

White House officials confirmed that delegates would be screened on arrival in the US to ensure that they were not carrying the virus.

There will be three days of meetings attended by 5,400 delegates at venues across Washington DC, including the State Department and US Institute of Peace, starting on Monday.

Investment deals worth as much as $1 billion (£590 million) are thought to be on the table President Barack Obama is said to see improved relationships with Africa as one of the most important legacies of his time in office, following criticism that his early years failed to live up to his pre-election promise.

He will take part in group discussions and plans to devote at least a few minutes to each head of state or their representatives at the White House dinner.

It is understood he refused all requests for one-on-one meetings in a bid to avoid any suggestions of favouritism, and delegations are staying at their own embassies or Washington DC's many luxury hotels rather than the official US government guest lodgings across the street from the White House at Blair House.

There is disappointment among some delegates at the impact Ebola will inevitably have on a summit they had hoped would help them move on from the image of Africa as disease-ridden, impoverished and dependent on the West.

Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said the summit marked a new direction for America's relationship with much of Africa.

He went on: "We do believe we bring something unique to the table. We are less focused on resources from Africa and more focused on deepening trade and investment relationships."

At a news conference on Friday, President Obama, who late father was Kenyan, spoke of his hopes for the meeting, stressing the economic potential of the continent.

He said: "The importance of this for America needs to be understood. Africa is growing and you've got thriving markets and you've got entrepreneurs and extraordinary talent ... among the people there.

"And Africa also happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life."

Rajiv Shah, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, told Reuters: "You will see a series of announcements on agriculture and food, and power and energy.

"We will make big announcements that demonstrate these are big ambitions we can take on with our African partners and the private sector."

In addition, the State Department is expected to announce a further $60 million (£36 million) a year for peacekeeping training in six African countries.

While most of the nations of Africa will be represented at the summit, Invitations to some leaders were withheld for political reasons. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, whose regime is subject to international sanctions, and Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, the Sudanese president indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court are among those not asked to participate.

However Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta was invited, despite also being indicted by the Court, which the US is not a member of.

Two Americans who caught Ebola virus in Liberia have been treated with a new, untested drug – which could hold the key to their recovery – as another man in Nigeria falls ill

The two American [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/] doctors who have caught Ebola have been treated with a new "secret serum" which could potentially save their lives. The revelation comes as another doctor, who treated the man who died in Africa's most populous city, Lagos, fell ill with the disease.

Healthcare workers are among those most at risk of contracting the virus, which is currently killing 60 per cent of all infected people.

The US-based doctors, Dr Kent Brantly and Dr Nancy Writebol, fell ill in Liberia [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/liberia/] while treating patients infected with the deadly disease.

While there remains no cure for the virus, a representative from the US National Institutes of Health contacted Samaritan's Purse – the charity they worked for in Liberia – and offered the experimental treatment, known as ZMapp.

The treatment is said to work by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells.

A source close to the Atlanta hospital, where Dr Brantly is being treated, told CNN: "Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away."

One of his doctors reportedly described the events as "miraculous." [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/04/health/experimental-ebola-serum/index.html]

By the next morning, Dr Brantly was able to take a shower on his own before getting on a specially designed Gulfstream air ambulance jet to be evacuated to the United States.

Dr Writebol was also administrated with the drug, which was transported to Liberia in a special sub-zero container.

She showed a less remarkable recovery, but is hoped to travel to the US on Tuesday to continue her treatment.

According to CNN, the drug was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical, based in California. The patients were told that this treatment had never been tried before in a human being but had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys.

Four monkeys infected with Ebola survived after being given the serum within 24 hours of infection. Two of four additional monkeys that started the therapy within 48 hours after infection also survived. One monkey that was not treated died within five days of exposure to the virus.

"With no vaccines or therapeutics currently licensed to treat or prevent Ebola virus, MB-003 is a promising candidate for continued development," said Larry Zeitlin, president of Mapp Biopharmaceutical, in August 2013 – when the results were unveiled.

ZMapp has not been approved for human use, and has not even gone through the clinical trial process, which is standard to prove the safety and efficacy of a medication. The process by which the medication was made available to Dr Brantly and Dr Writebol is highly unusual.

Health officials in Nigeria, meanwhile, confirmed that a second man in the country had contracted the disease.

Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian employee of the government, died in Lagos after flying from Liberia – en route to the US. On Monday it was announced that his doctor had fallen ill.

"As of today, one of the doctors that treated the late Mr Sawyer has tested positive for the Ebola virus," said Onyebuchi Chukwu, from the Nigerian health ministry. Of 70 people who were under surveillance, eight had been "quarantined at an isolation ward provided by the Lagos state government," he added.

The news comes after health workers said drugs that could fight Ebola are not particularly complicated but pharmaceutical firms see no economic reason to invest in making them because the virus’ few victims are poor Africans.

Outbreaks of the deadly haemorrhagic fever have so far been limited to remote corners of African countries, and have killed a little over 2,400 people since the first infections were identified in 1976 in what was then Zaire.

Developing, trialling and licensing vaccines or treatments would cost significant amounts of money, and drugs companies argue there is not enough demand to justify the outlay.

“These outbreaks affect the poorest communities on the planet. Although they do create incredible upheaval, they are relatively rare events,” said Daniel Bausch, a medical researcher in the US who works on Ebola and other infectious diseases.

“So if you look at the interest of pharmaceutical companies, there is not huge enthusiasm to take an Ebola drug through phase one, two, and three of a trial and make an Ebola vaccine that maybe a few tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people will use.”

That is despite laboratory trials proving encouraging, he told Vox news.

“We now have a couple of different vaccine platforms that have shown to be protective with non-human primates,” Mr Bausch said. “That's the good news, but we've had a real break in trying to move forward to get these into human trials and get them out there as a real tool we can use for people infected with these viruses.”

A lot of that has to do with what Prof John Ashton, Britain’s leading public health doctor, termed the “moral bankruptcy” of profit-driven drugs developers.

“We must...tackle the scandal of the unwillingness of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in research to produce treatments and vaccines, something they refuse to do because the numbers involved are, in their terms, so small and don't justify the investment,” Dr Ashton told The Independent on Sunday.

“This is the moral bankruptcy of capitalism acting in the absence of an ethical and social framework.”

At least 826 people have died among 1,440 people infected with the virus, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. One man, an American, died in Nigeria.

Senior health workers including the head of the World Health Organisation have said the disease’s spread is “out of control” and will likely go on at least until the end of the year.

WHO declares Ebola epidemic an international health emergency

The Ebola outbreak will not be contained until after Christmas, a British expert has warned, as the the World Health Organisation declares it a public health emergency

Ebola virus victim left lying in Guinea street for hours over infection fears

The World Health Organisation on Friday declared the Ebola [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/] outbreak ravaging parts of west Africa an international health emergency and appealed for global aid to help afflicted countries.

The decision after a two-day emergency session behind closed doors in Geneva means global travel restrictions may be put in place to halt its spread as the overall death toll nears 1,000.

British scientist Dr Ben Neuman from University of Reading, warned that the outbreak will not stopped until after Christmas.

The WHO move comes as US health authorities admitted on Thursday that Ebola's spread beyond west Africa was "inevitable", and after medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned that the deadly virus was now "out of control" with more than 60 outbreak hotspots.

WHO director Dr Margaret Chan appealed for greater international aid for the countries worst hit by the outbreak.

"The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it," she said.

"The declaration ... will galvanise the attention of leaders of all countries at the top level. It cannot be done by the ministries of health alone."

Dr Neman, a viriologist, added: “The WHO’s declaring a public health emergency of international concern is a big forward step in the fight against this dangerous disease. It is a rare event, something only done in the past for H1N1 ‘swine’ flu in 2008 and the ongoing polio outbreak.

“This will make the vast resources of the United Nations such as funds, experts and equipment, available to help stop Ebola. This should bring the outbreak under control although it's likely it won't be stopped completely until after Christmas."

He said measures such as checking the temperatures of passengers leaving affected areas will help, although WHO specifically advised against an outright travel ban.

The British government held an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday and has pledged an extra £3m to strengthen health systems in Sierra Leone and Liberia and support the WHO, UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee in limiting Ebola’s spread, taking the total UK contribution to £5m.

States of emergency were in effect in Libera, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Soldiers in Liberia's Grand Cape Mount province – one of the worst-affected areas – set up road blocks to limit travel to the capital Monrovia, as bodies reportedly lay unburied in the city's streets.

Two towns in the east of Sierra Leone, Kailahun and Kenema, where put under quarantine on Thursday, as nightclubs and entertainment venues across the country were ordered shut.

Rob MacGillivaray, regional humanitarian director at Save the Children, in heart of crisis in Sierra Leone said: “Parents are understandably frightened and stay away from medical centers through fear of coming into contact with the infection. Pregnant mothers are giving birth at home rather than seeking skilled help and orphaned children are at risk of being ostracized from their communities at the most vulnerable time in their lives. Challenges remain in reaching families in rural communities who were struggling to access healthcare even before the outbreak.

"Children who have lost loved ones will suffer stigma and trauma and that is why it is so important to communicate the reality of the illness – which can be prevented with simple measures. It is critical that families trust the medical system and present at the first signs of symptoms. In many cases this could mean the difference between life and death and is certainly key to containing the outbreak.”

Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives and infected more than 1,700 people since breaking out in Guinea earlier this year, according to the WHO.

As African nations struggled with the scale of the epidemic, the scientists who discovered the virus in 1976 have called for an experimental drug being used on two infected Americans to also be made available for African victims.

One of the three, Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said "African countries should have the same opportunity" to use ZMapp, which is made by US company Mapp Pharmaceuticals.

British scientists welcomed the declaration by WHO and said it would help bring global health experts together.

Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “The WHO’s recommendations will help provide the global leadership which we very much welcome. Ebola continues to pose a very serious health threat for people in West Africa, but it remains very unlikely that the outbreak will turn into a global pandemic.

"However, even though the epidemic is currently 'regional’, Ebola is still of global concern and there remains a possibility that imported cases of Ebola will reach countries outside of West Africa and also that the health care system, economies and stability of the countries involved will be affected. Outbreaks such as this affect us all, even if the virus itself does not reach the UK.”

Prof David Heymann, Head of the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, and Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: “The major message of the Emergency Committee is that the three known measures that stop outbreaks – hospital infection control including protection of health workers, community understanding of risks of infection and how to prevent infection including during burial practices, and contact tracing of known cases with fever surveillance and isolation of those with fever until diagnosis is known – appear not to have been robustly enough applied earlier in the outbreak and governments appear to not have been engaged as necessary.

"Hopefully these recommendations will address these issues, and ensure stronger international co-ordination.

“The WHO recommendations are comprehensive and evidence-based recommendations based on current information, and clearly demonstrate the importance of the International Health Regulations and its emergency committees that can be called on virtually to make recommendations to the Director General based on available information at the time of international spread of infections such as Ebola.”

Prof Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at University of Nottingham, said: “This seems a sensible measured response that focuses on the real problems of the current outbreak.

“Fighting chains of transmission, through public engagement, education, increased surveillance, diagnosis and contact tracing are the only ways this outbreak is going to be snuffed out.

“Keeping these countries open for travel and business makes sense; the virus isn't contagious – it’s not like influenza which is easily spread from one person to another; you have to have direct contact with body fluids. The extra measures to prevent export of the virus should greatly reduce the risk of global spread.

“Here in the UK our surveillance systems are well set-up to identify imported infections. No doubt the ongoing West African outbreak will have the necessary people here on high alert.”

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

The first European victim, a 75-year-old Roman Catholic priest, Miguel Pajares, flew home to Spain on Thursday. Officials said his condition was stable.

In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said people should expect certain rights to be suspended as the country imposes "extraordinary measures" necessary for "the very survival of our state".

In Sierra Leone, which has the most confirmed infections, 800 troops were sent to guard hospitals treating Ebola patients, an army spokesman said.

The outbreak in Nigeria has been minor compared to those in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The densely-packed city of more than 20 million people has a poor healthcare system and officials say that if Lagos sees a rise in infections, public hospitals will need to be operational in order to avert a catastrophe.

Benin said it had placed two patients with Ebola-like symptoms in isolation and was waiting for test results to establish if the pair were infected.

The two infected Americans, who worked for Christian aid agencies in Liberia, have shown signs of improvement since being flown to a specialist hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. They are being given ZMapp, according to reports.

There is no proven treatment or cure for Ebola and the use of the experimental drug has sparked an ethical debate.

US President Barack Obama said it was too soon to send the experimental drugs to west Africa.

"I think we have to let the science guide us. And I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful," he said Wednesday.

Nigeria's Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu has asked the US about getting the drug, but Spain has voiced caution about the serum.

US regulators meanwhile loosened restrictions on another experimental drug which may allow it to be tried on infected patients in west Africa.

Canada-based Tekmira said the US Food and Drug Administration changed the classification of its drug TKM-Ebola from full clinical hold to partial hold.

US health authorities also warned Ebola's spread to the United States was "inevitable" due to the nature of global airline travel, but that any outbreak was not likely to be large.

The worsening outbreak prompted the United States to order the families of embassy staff in Liberia to return home, with the State Department also warning US citizens not to travel to Liberia.

First discovered in 1976 and named after a river in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola has killed around two-thirds of those infected, with two outbreaks registering fatality rates approaching 90 per cent. The latest outbreak has a fatality rate of around 55 per cent.

Driven to extinction: a bug’s life

The number of insects on the planet has plummeted by 45 per cent since the Seventies. Why do we care so little for such a vital resource?

Remember the old saw that insects will eventually take over the world? Well, maybe it’s time to forget it. Startling new evidence suggests that their numbers have nearly halved over the past four decades, while our own population has almost doubled – leading to calls for humans to learn to love the small creatures that more usually bug us.

This week, 600 of the world’s top entomologists – convening in York for a congress held every four years – hosted a special session to convince people of the importance of insects. They worried about how to change the image of the world’s creepy-crawlies, largely neglected by conservationists in favour of more charismatic animals.

It is certainly not before time. Just before the congress, senior British, American, Mexican and Brazilian scientists published a paper in Science, concluding that the number of insects on the planet has plummeted by 45 per cent since the Seventies, while human numbers have soared from around 3.7 billion to 7.25 billion.

The paper marks a first authoritative attempt to work out what is happening to the quantity of insects around the world. Previous studies have suggested that about a quarter of species are in danger if extinction, but these, as the researchers point out, tend to underestimate the damage.

For while species extinctions are important in evolutionary terms, it is the number of insects in an ecosystem that determines how well it functions. And while the last few individuals of a species can hang on for a long time, delaying its complete disappearance, a drop in numbers can occur rapidly when, for example, a rainforest is felled or land is sprayed with an insecticide for the first time.

The paper’s conclusion is, of course, only an estimate. Though based on 3,249 studies of 452 species on five continents, these were carried out mainly in Europe and North America, where most entomologists work. Even more importantly, we know little about the world’s insects, let alone what is happening to them. About a million species are known to science, but we only understand how fewer than 10,000 are faring. And there are thought to be more than seven million that have yet to be discovered.

We do know enough, however, to be sure that insects, like other wildlife, are in crisis around the world – hit by pollution, the destruction of habitat and, increasingly, climate change – and that this matters. As a recent report by the Zoological Society of London, puts it: “If invertebrates disappeared tomorrow, we would soon follow. We are more dependent on our spineless relatives than we ever imagined.”

We’ve heard a lot recently about bees’ vital pollination: they and other insects – including wasps, flies, beetles and butterflies – together fertilise 71 of the 100 crops that provide 90 per cent of world food supplies, providing a free service worth $153 billion a year to the world economy.

Other invertebrates – including ants, woodlice, crickets and beetles – break down detritus and help maintain soil quality: dung beetles alone are thought to benefit the US cattle industry by $380 million annually. And though some insects are notable pests, others keep infestations down.

More fundamentally, insects form the foundations of ecosystems and fuel the lower end of food chains. “It is truly the small things,” adds the London Zoo report, “that make life possible.”

And yet, though they make up at least four fifths of the world’s species, they have been comparatively neglected. EU legislation, for example, protects nearly two thirds of Europe’s vertebrate species, but only 0.1 per cent of invertebrate ones.

Part of the problem is that people tend to dislike them: one professor speaking at York told of the epiphany that made him campaign to change their image. He showed a neighbour’s seven-year-old son a beautiful caterpillar, only for him to squash it, with the words: “My parents say insects are bad.”

Changing that attitude may be tough, but not impossible. Insects are intriguing. They have been plentiful for 530 million years, took to the skies before pterodactyls, and have evolved to fill almost every niche on the planet. And a child’s first natural encounter is more likely to be with a butterfly or a beetle than an eagle or an elephant.

Charities such as Buglife have managed to get hundreds of people recording, not just butterflies, but beetles. The Royal Entomological Society’s National Insect Week this year drew some 120,000 people to over 400 events. Insect-based shows, dances, and even meals are increasing. But there is a long way to go before humanity, literally, gets the bug.

Why wind turbines are turning the air Blue in Iowa

Perhaps, as they say, it has got the wind up. Siemens, the renewable energy giant, is responding to growing opposition to its building the world’s largest onshore wind farm – 448 turbines in south-east Iowa – in classical fashion.

It has commissioned the British-born composer, Will Bates, to capture “yet another form of inspiration of wind farms” by turning the sounds of operating and making them into a “beautiful, graceful rendition of Strauss’s Blue Danube”. The result, the company goes on, combines recording the 350ft diameter blades rotating “musically in sweeping rhythm” while “harmoniously amplifying” the sounds of making them in its factory, which is located in the state. We have all heard of wind instruments, but this is ridiculous.

Iowa already has 3,200 turbines, generating more than a quarter of its electricity – more than in any other US state – proving, the industry says, that Iowa can “farm more than just corn”. But with no state-wide regulation, local communities are increasingly objecting.

So Siemens has released the windy waltz as a television advertisement, in an attempt to “create some general awareness that we are doing something very helpful for the economy, for society and for Iowa.” Opponents, however, may just feel Straussed out.

An Ebola drug might help to put GM crops on the Mapp

Will genetic modification become popular by beating the Ebola plague? The experimental drug, ZMapp, which so far seems to be helping two infected Americans, is made from modified antibodies that – just to complete the green demonology – have been grown in tobacco leaves by a company with ties to the US defence department. But if the drug succeeds, and can be manufactured fast enough, there will surely be few complaints about how it was created.

There are already virtually none about GM insulin, which has benefited millions of diabetics. And an Oxford company is trialling an attempt to beat dengue fever, by releasing male GM mosquitoes, which will breed with wild females but fail to produce viable offspring: if it works, it may receive similar applause.

GM crops were rejected here largely because they posed risks, but only really benefited the companies that made them. Now, as The Telegraph reported this week, a trial crop rich in Omega 3 is about to be harvested. This is not straightforward: such “nutraceuticals” could pose hazards to some people. But it, like all GM, should be debated sensibly, without returning to the old slanging match between those who back or reject the technology unquestioningly.

Tekmira Pharmaceutical shares rise more than 20pc as its get go-ahead to test drug on humans

Shares in Ebola drug company Tekmira Pharmaceuticals jumped 22.5pc in early trading on Friday after US drug regulators cleared it to test the drug on people infected with the virus.

The relaxing of restrictions came as the World Health Organisation declared the killer Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of west Africa an international health emergency and appealed for global aid to help afflicted countries.

The Canadian bio-tech company's experimental drug has shown promising results in monkeys, but is unproven in humans.

Dr Mark Murray, chief executive of Tekmira, said [http://investor.tekmirapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=865208] : "We are pleased that the FDA has considered the risk-reward of TKM-Ebola for infected patients. We have been closely watching the Ebola virus outbreak and its consequences, and we are willing to assist with any responsible use of TKM-Ebola. The foresight shown by the FDA removes one potential roadblock to doing so."

He said the current outbreak of the virus, which has claimed close to 1,000 lives in West Africa, underscores the critical need for effective drugs to treat the Ebola virus.

"We recognize the heightened urgency of this situation, and are carefully evaluating options for use of our investigational drug," he said.

Shares in Nasdaq-listed Tekmira have risen more than 26pc since May 27, a day after Sierra Leone first confirmed Ebola outbreak.

The WHO decision followed a rare, two-day closed-door session of the UN health body's emergency committee, which urged exit screening of all people flying out of affected countries. It stopped short of calling for global travel restrictions, urging airlines to take strict precautions but to continue flying to the area.

Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives and infected more than 1,700 people since breaking out in Guinea earlier this year, according to the WHO.

States of emergency were in effect in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - something WHO said was a first necessary step to bringing the outbreak under control. In Nigeria - where the outbreak has so far been minor - public sector doctors suspended a nearly five-week strike to help battle the deadly virus and prevent it from taking hold in Africa's most populous country.

There is no proven treatment or cure for Ebola and the use of the experimental drug has sparked an ethical debate.

US health authorities have warned Ebola's spread to the United States was "inevitable" due to the nature of global airline travel, but that any large outbreak was unlikely.

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

First discovered in 1976 and named after a river in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola has killed around two-thirds of those infected, with two outbreaks registering fatality rates approaching 90 percent. The latest outbreak has a fatality rate of around 55pc-60pc.
