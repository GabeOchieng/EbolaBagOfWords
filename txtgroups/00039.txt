The Ebola outbreak has incited concern — and criticism. Critics blasted international organizations, particularly the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, for a bumbling, insufficient response to an alarming global threat. Sheri Fink set out to investigate.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/world/africa/cuts-at-who-hurt-response-to-ebola-crisis.html]

I wondered whether the W.H.O.’s downgraded capacities were connected to its performance in this specific case: Did recent budget cuts affect its ability to respond to the outbreak? And was it possible to tie specific missteps to lost chances to keep the outbreak from spinning out of control?

When I set out, I had no idea if these links existed. And I knew relatively little about the W.H.O.’s arcane organizational structure and funding or how these have changed in recent years. Before exploring its response to the Ebola outbreak, I wanted to get to know the organization, its history and its leadership to better understand what was happening on the ground. My investigation involved in-depth interviews with people all over the world and took the better part of three weeks. Even so, I still feel there is much more to this story: It’s an evolving one.

Many people I contacted were reluctant to talk. Several said there would be time to examine missteps in the Ebola crisis, but for the moment, the organizations needed to focus on stopping the outbreak. It was hard to get the full story about some of the interagency scuffles; there was fear among some of those I spoke to that criticizing another group publicly could fray certain patched-up working relationships.

The reluctance to speak highlights a tension reporters often face when working on a story about an unfolding tragedy. Do we have a responsibility to step back and examine the potential impact or negative consequences of our work on the crisis? Or do we simply press forward and expose the truth, come what may, because it’s our role, and it’s our general belief that illuminating the workings of powerful institutions is nearly always constructive?

As a Times correspondent, I feel an acute responsibility. Many people read our work, and this drives me even harder to get things right, to dig deeper and get the full story, from the nuances to the big picture. The pressure to produce a story while it’s most relevant has meant many summer weeks of late nights and working weekends here in New York where quite a few other reporters and editors have also worked hard gathering news on the disease, as have correspondents elsewhere in the United States and Europe. Times correspondents based in Africa have gone further, taking personal risks to bring readers the most valuable insights. In recent weeks, Adam Nossiter, Norimitsu Onishi, Ben C. Solomon and Clair MacDougall have helped us all understand much more about the experiences of patients, health care workers and others in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Given the awful toll of the outbreak and the huge sacrifices made by the people on the front lines, we owe this story our attention.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, suggested in an interview that W.H.O. focuses on developing technical norms and standards and should not be considered a direct aid provider or operational first responder in emergencies. Another doctor I interviewed for the story told me she wondered why, then, the W.H.O. had a department of emergencies and was trying to eradicate polio; it would be a good idea, she said, to put the W.H.O. officials in front of their paradoxes.

That phrase stuck with me. Putting officials in front of their paradoxes — putting all of us in front of our paradoxes — this is something catastrophes tend to do. They expose contradictions and uncomfortable realities we often ignore.

Ebola reveals inequities. We read about doctors and nurses treating patients without so much as running water and gloves in a major hospital in Guinea. What chance do they have to avoid contracting Ebola? Nearly 40 years since the discovery of this virus that kills most of its victims — that has affected the world’s most impoverished people — there are still no vaccines or specific treatments proven safe and effective.

Another paradox — many of the trained responders who run to disasters and wars have been running away from this one. Countries are shutting borders. Airlines are canceling flights. Ships are bypassing ports. Those most in need are becoming pariahs. Ebola, and the fear around it, shows us something about the limits of compassion.

Ebola is heartless because it punishes the very best human tendencies for caring and for honoring the sick and dying. A simple act — wiping a fevered brow or kissing away a tear — can be deadly, because the virus is transmitted through body fluids.

The disease has also been killing those few who are available to heal — the small cadre of nurses and doctors and health workers in these West African countries. Hospitals have shut down, so it’s not just those with Ebola who can’t get care, but also everyone else who gets sick or needs help — a mother giving birth; a child with diarrhea or malaria.

It might sound depressing to be reporting on Ebola. But with such an awful situation, it actually feels good to be doing something at all.

The widening epidemic of Ebola in West Africa looks worse with each passing day. The outbreaks in the hardest-hit countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- have outstripped the ability of humanitarian groups and fragile government health systems to treat the sick and slow the spread.

A panicky effort to quarantine a large slum in Monrovia, Liberia, using troops to keep people penned in, proved a disastrous failure that probably made things worse. A shortage of protective clothing for health care workers treating sick patients in Sierra Leone led nurses to strike last week in a desperate effort to get more help. The virus has begun to spread to other countries where there is always a danger that it could ignite a new round of outbreaks.

In separate statements last week, officials of the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders warned that the outbreak is spreading out of control. W.H.O. leaders have said the outbreak in West Africa could be stopped in six to nine months, but only if a ''massive'' global response, which is nowhere in sight, is carried out.

The most shocking news of the week was how ill-prepared the W.H.O. was to organize an effective response. As Sheri Fink reported in The Times on Thursday, the agency had been weakened by harsh budget cuts in recent years and did not have the staff or ability to flood the Ebola zone. Its emergency response units have been slashed, veterans who led previous fights against Ebola have left, and scores of positions have been eliminated.

The agency argues rather unconvincingly that it is simply a technical organization that provides advice, and that governments have the primary responsibility to take care of their people.

The problem is that the afflicted countries had very weak health care systems to begin with, and they have disintegrated under the pressure of finding and caring for Ebola victims. The United Nations should direct the W.H.O. to take charge where governments are weak.

In another worrisome development, the virus popped up in Nigeria, when a patient who had been infected in Liberia flew to Lagos, where he became ill and died. Health workers responded properly and began an intensive effort to track down every person he had contact with before he died. Unfortunately they missed one, who then carried the virus to another populous area nearly 400 miles away, where it killed a doctor and has put 200 people at risk. A case has also been confirmed in Senegal, brought in by a Guinean who traveled by land through the porous borders.

Hope that a vaccine or drug could come to the rescue looked dim after an emergency meeting of more than 150 experts convened by the W.H.O. last week. A consensus was reached to test two promising experimental vaccines and several drugs or therapies for patients who are already infected, but there is scant hope any will be available in large quantities any time soon. Some of those treatments require intravenous administration, continuous cold storage and facilities able to deliver care safely, all of which will be hard to achieve in the stricken countries.

For now, the afflicted countries will have to rely on methods that have worked in curbing much smaller outbreaks in the past -- like finding and isolating sick people quickly, providing supportive care like hydration to keep them alive while their bodies mount a defense, and tracing and isolating their contacts. But these nations will have to apply these tactics on an enormous scale that will require a large amount of help from global organizations and donors.

Given the W.H.O.'s weaknesses, the White House ought to consider whether the United States should take the lead.

Obama to Present Case for Broader U.S. Mission Against Militants

WASHINGTON — President Obama will use a speech to the nation on Wednesday to make his case for launching a United States-led offensive against Sunni militants gaining ground in the Middle East, seeking to rally support for a broad military mission while reassuring the public he is not plunging American forces into another Iraq war.

“I’m preparing the country to make sure that we deal with a threat from” the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, Mr. Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“What I want people to understand,” he said, “is that over the course of months, we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum” of the militants. “We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities; we’re going to shrink the territory that they control; and, ultimately, we’re going to defeat them,” he added.

The speech will be Mr. Obama’s latest attempt to answer critics who have said that he lacks a broader strategy for dealing with the militant group, and to convince the public that he has both the fortitude and a viable plan for doing so.

The president was adamant that he had no intention of sending American combat troops to go after ISIS, repeating no fewer than three times during the interview that he would not do so, and calling the idea of putting United States boots on the ground “a profound mistake.”

“This is not going to be an announcement about U.S. ground troops,” Mr. Obama said. “This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.”

The president’s plans for a major address came just days after he returned from a NATO summit meeting in Wales, where he and top members of his administration worked on the sidelines to rally international support[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/world/europe/obama-and-cameron-call-on-nato-to-confront-isis.html] for a coalition to confront ISIS in Iraq and Syria. And the “Meet the Press” interview was broadcast hours after American warplanes carried out a new round of attacks[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/iraq.html] on ISIS targets near a major hydroelectric dam in Iraq.

The speech is set for the day before the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which touched off a broad military campaign to defeat the terrorist group Al Qaeda and, ultimately, to protracted American-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Opposition to those wars and a vow to end them responsibly helped propel Mr. Obama to the White House.

The president said he planned to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to outline his strategy, but suggested he did not need a vote to move forward with his campaign against ISIS, saying he was “confident” that he has the authorization he needs. Still, Mr. Obama hinted that he might ask for more money for the mission, saying, “It’s going to require some resources, I suspect, above what we are currently doing in the region.”

Such a request would trigger a congressional debate and vote, and could hinder another of Mr. Obama’s vows: to cut the Pentagon budget.

White House officials have said that Mr. Obama is operating under his constitutional powers as commander in chief in striking ISIS in Iraq, where the central government in Baghdad and Kurdish regional officials based in Erbil have requested United States assistance in battling the group. When the president announced what he described as a limited bombing campaign against ISIS, he said the goal was to protect Iraqi minorities besieged by ISIS and to safeguard American citizens and United States facilities in Iraq.

The president has been sending notifications to Congress on the airstrikes under the War Powers Act, which bars American troops from engaging in military action for more than 60 days without congressional authorization. But recent presidents have ignored that requirement. And some lawmakers in both parties are increasingly uncomfortable ceding the debate over military action in Iraq, and potentially Syria, to the president.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said Mr. Obama must explain to Congress how any additional authority he might seek to strike ISIS would protect Americans. He said training and equipping the militaries of partner nations to counter ISIS, as the president has done in Iraq and is proposing to do in Syria, “is not tenable and will not generate sufficient combat power to protect America.”

If the president is prepared to engage Congress “with a strategic plan” to protect the United States and its allies from ISIS, Mr. McConnell said in a statement on Saturday, “I believe he will have significant congressional support.” The ISIS threat, he added, “is real and it’s growing. And it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response.”

In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Obama said he envisioned the Free Syrian Army’s providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria. He said that until a moderate Sunni opposition emerged, there was no real hope of ousting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. But the opposition has been fractured, and the moderate militias are viewed as far less capable than ISIS.

“Our attitude towards Assad continues to be that through his actions, through using chemical weapons on his own people, dropping barrel bombs that killed innocent children, that he has foregone legitimacy,” Mr. Obama said. “But when it comes to our policy and the coalition that we’re putting together, our focus specifically is on ISIL.” (ISIL is the name used by administration officials for the militant group.)

It is a mark of how much things have changed since just one year ago, when Mr. Obama was weighing airstrikes to punish Mr. Assad for his use of chemical weapons. Faced with a new array of international crises[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/world/europe/as-crises-pile-up-a-president-sticks-to-his-deliberative-approach.html] in recent months, the president said he was “energized” by the challenges facing him. But he also showed signs of strain during the interview, admitting that the demands of his position — including dealing with Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, the rise of ISIS and to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa — were taking a toll.

“There are days where I’m not getting enough sleep, because we’ve got a lot on our plate,” he said.

Mr. Obama also suggested that he regretted his decision last month to go golfing[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/a-terrorist-horror-then-golf-incongruity-fuels-obama-critics.html] immediately after responding publicly to the ISIS release of a video showing the beheading [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html]of the American journalist James Foley.

“I should’ve anticipated the optics,” the president said, adding that the “theater” of his job was “not something that always comes naturally to me.

“But it matters. And I’m mindful of that.”

It is one of the pitfalls of any presidential vacation, Mr. Obama said in the interview. “What I’d love,” the president added, “is a vacation from the press.”

Reading the Times With Anna Deavere Smith

Anna Deavere Smith, the actress-playwright, reads the paper most days, almost always in paper form on Sundays. Why? Habit, she says.

I have never been able to read the paper in one sitting! I travel a lot and so I don’t even have a routine about the Sunday paper. More often than I would like I am reading it on an airplane, because I usually take the first flight out from wherever I am.

Did anything on the front page particularly surprise you?

“Foreign Powers Buy Influence at Think Tanks.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D]” This came as a surprise to me. Perhaps I am Pollyannaish, but even as a sometime academic who is well aware that special interests can inform research, my eyes bulged wide open at the amounts of millions that foreign powers pour into the think tanks. I am not surprised at their willingness to accept the sums. I am saddened because I doubt if what matters to me most – particularly bridging opportunity and education gaps for people – attracts that kind of dough.

I was surprised by the story about the 13-year-old working long hours in a tobacco field[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/business/just-13-and-working-risky-12-hour-shifts-in-the-tobacco-fields.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D]. This seemed to be a throwback to a time I thought had passed. The fact that she has to wear garbage bags to protect herself from the dripping nicotine dew was hard to read.

What concerned me as much as news of this oppressive work is that the interview subjects didn’t seem to have any sense of options. I wondered if Saray Cambray Alvarez, the 13-year-old quoted, would lose her job, or if she realized she might, when she spoke to The Times’s reporter.

The story “For Jihad Recruits, a Pipeline From Minnesota to Militancy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/for-Jihad-recruits-a-pipeline-from-Minnesota-to-militancy.html]” presents a young man who once had a job pushing a wheelchair through the Minneapolis airport. He ended up as a suicide bomber in Somalia. This gave me pause: I wonder how many people will, having read the story, look differently at young men pushing wheelchairs through airports. It struck me that stereotypes can be derived not only from fear, but from the very fact that we simply never know about people: Not knowing gives us a sense of a loss of control over the world in which we live. Maybe the stereotypes we concoct give us a sense of control.

Which story is most likely to haunt your sleep?

A story in the robust Arts and Leisure section about the conceptual artist Pierre Huyghe called “Conceptual Anarchy[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/arts/design/fall-arts-preview-pierre-huyghes-unpredictable-retrospective.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D].” The artist wants to depict an actor from the inside using a pill camera.

If one swallows a particular pill that is normally used by doctors to inspect digestive tracts, one’s insides are filmed. The artist is thinking of asking Willem Dafoe to swallow the pill.

Pierre Huyghe is said to be one of the best conceptual artists of his generation. Still, Willem Dafoe is such an extraordinary actor, I’d like his insides to be his own business.

Were there subjects covered about which you would like to know more?

Ben Brantley writes about short theater pieces in “Short, Spare and Spirited” [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/theater/fall-arts-preview-the-river-constellations-and-into-the-woods-to-open.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D] — and he quotes the great theater director Peter Brook and the author of “The Empty Space”: When “a man walks across this empty space whilst someone else is watching him,” then you have “all that is needed for an act of theater to be engaged.”

Brantley then describes theater anticipated this season that goes the other direction from large Broadway extravaganzas. Will this be a trend? Short form has taken hold in television and certainly on the web. Are we going to be treated to an era of the theater that is simple, spare, basic? Will audiences take to it, or do they need the extravaganzas? The short and simple had a hold in the past. It might be nice to experience the throwback.

Ebola? Ukraine? Syrian bombs on ISIS territory? Forgotten Ricin? Did you find any good news anywhere in the paper?

There was good news. I’m glad that Glenn Close is coming to Broadway[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/theater/fall-arts-preview-glenn-close-returns-to-broadway-in-a-delicate-balance.html], that Steve Reich’s “Music for 18 Musicians”[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/26/arts/music-review-a-composer-may-age-but-the-compositions-are-ever-young.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D] will be at BAM this week. (However, I did, under the influence of that piece of music, allow a hairdresser I did not know to cut off all my hair, and I do mean all of my hair except for a quarter-inch.) And I am glad that Nicholas Kristof[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-when-whites-just-dont-get-it-part-2.html] is holding his edge regarding race in America in the face of some disturbingly oversimplistic responses to his column a week ago, written in the wake of Ferguson.

And I am pleased to see in the Magazine section an antidote to some of the worries about testing in schools.

The author of “Flunking Exams[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/magazine/why-flunking-exams-is-actually-a-good-thing.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D]” suggests that a pretest is a powerful way to foster learning. In other words, attempting to answer a question without knowing the answer can, when timed right, prime the brain for learning. Serendipitously, in my class at N.Y.U. on Sunday, I asked a student to tell the class — on the first day, the first class — what we were going to learn today. He had to guess. He took it in stride and did a good job of conjecturing, but it also piqued interest and I think made the class more receptive to the four hours they had to spend together (and with me! ). I did this before I read the Magazine article. So after the fact I felt pretty good about my own pedagogy.

Anything in the paper inspired you?

Nicholas Kristof’s “Whites Just Don’t Get It Part II.”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-when-whites-just-dont-get-it-part-2.html] It is inspiring to me that Kristof continues to tend to the conversation on race that he engaged in in the wake of Ferguson. He suggests that “instead of pointing fingers, let’s adopt some of the programs that I’ve cited with robust evidence showing that they bridge the chasm.”

This is essential at this moment. We have a crisis, for example, in education. Statistics show us that poor children of color are more likely to experience disciplinary action that may land them out of school and in prison. Recently when I discussed what’s commonly called the “School to Prison Pipeline” phenomenon with the dean of the graduate school of education at Stanford, Deborah Stipek, she said it’s not the “School to Prison Pipeline,” it’s the “Womb to Prison Pipeline.”

We have a problem. A problem is an opportunity to bring forward resources and to foster innovation. I’m with Kristof: If it’s for the overall welfare of the nation, let’s stop pointing fingers and get to work.

Anything on the editorial page that stayed with you or changed your mind about something essential?

In a Sept. 4 Op-Ed,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/michael-kimmel-and-gloria-steinem-on-consensual-sex-on-campus.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D] Gloria Steinem and Michael Kimmel take up California’s Senate Bill 967, known as the “Yes Means Yes Law,” which requires affirmative consent from partners at each stage of sexual activity. With Governor Brown’s signature, the bill would make California the first state to move from the “no means no” standard to “yes means yes.”

The affirmative is one way of working toward more clarity in an effort to avoid sexual assault. Of course there are those who feel this kills the romance. But Steinem and Kimmel make the argument that “yes” is the most erotic word in the English language. They go to Molly Bloom and Leopold in James Joyce’s “Ulysses” to add sustenance to their argument. I once heard Steinem call herself a hope-aholic. Writing about yes is just more evidence of her way with words and positive thinking.

Are you a big obit reader?

I read obits from time to time and was particularly interested in the one about the pop artist Marjorie Strider[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/arts/design/marjorie-strider-sly-pop-artist-is-dead-at-83.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A7%22%7D], who, among other things, went around TriBeCa in the 1960s hanging picture frames on fire hydrants, trees and against a painted wall. It was nice to imagine the TriBeCa I never knew. I live there now and it has become pretty suburban. I have to jump into the gutter to avoid the massive strollers that come down the wide sidewalks.

Hong Kong Group to Give Harvard's School of Public Health $350 Million

Harvard University on Monday will announce the largest gift in its history, $350 million to the School of Public Health, from a group controlled by a wealthy Hong Kong family, one member of which earned graduate degrees at the university.

Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's president, said the gift by the Morningside Foundation, directed to a relatively small part of the university, would have a profound effect on the School of Public Health in Boston, giving it a stable financial base and the ability to give students more financial aid while expanding programs in several fields.

''It's always been, as the whole field always is, under-resourced,'' Dr. Faust said. ''It's overwhelmingly dependent on money from federal grants that are under threat.''

The foundation is led by two brothers, Ronnie and Gerald Chan, whose businesses include the Hang Lung Group, a major developer of real estate in Hong Kong and elsewhere in China, and the Morningside Group, a private equity and venture capital firm. The School of Public Health will be renamed for their father, T. H. Chan, who founded Hang Lung.

Only six larger donations have been made to an American institution of higher education, according to a list by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Those include a $400 million gift by Eli and Edythe Broad to the Broad Institute, a joint arm of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Chans' gift is the largest to Harvard alone.

In keeping with university practice, Harvard did not disclose the timing or form of the gift. Large donations are often spread over several years, and can consist of securities or real estate, in addition to cash.

Harvard officials said the gift would be used to address four broad areas: pandemics, which they define to include threats like obesity and cancer; harmful environments, ranging from pollution to violence; poverty and humanitarian crises; and failing health systems. Dr. Faust cited the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as an example of the need for such resources, hitting on three of those four areas -- a rapidly spreading disease, abetted by poverty, that existing health systems cannot handle.

''We're all realizing how important public health is as we become more global and diseases are shared across boundaries,'' she said.

Gerald Chan earned a master's degree in medical radiological physics and a doctorate in radiation biology at the School of Public Health in the 1970s, worked as a research fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and published several scientific papers. He has remained an active alumnus of the school, judging student competitions and giving speeches there, including the commencement address in 2012.

In 1986, he joined his brother in creating the Morningside Group, and he is a director of Hang Lung, where Ronnie Chan is the chairman. The family's philanthropic efforts have focused on promoting science and higher education, including endowing a professorship at the School of Public Health.

Recently, Gerald Chan has drawn attention for his real estate purchases in the Harvard Square area of Cambridge, Mass., near the university's main campus.

The PBS series “Frontline”[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/] pours a double shot of dismal on Tuesday in a program that examines the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and atrocities in Nigeria related to the hunt for Boko Haram.

Though neither segment has the depth of a full documentary, each is disturbing, evidence of flawed responses to disasters of very different kinds.

The Ebola report looks at a microcosm rather than the entirety of the still-spreading outbreak.

The segment starts in July, visiting a relief operation in Sierra Leone centered on a beleaguered hospital.

“When the hospital was built four weeks earlier, 64 beds seemed more than enough,” the narration says. “That’s no longer the case.”

We see a Doctors Without Borders team trying to deal with the swelling caseload and can only be awed by the courage of those doing the work.

Treating the sick is just part of the challenge; finding people who are ill and persuading them to come into the hospital rather than stay in their villages and infect others is also a formidable task.

Hope is in scant supply; death isn’t.

“You’re just walking, trying not to step on the graves,” one responder says. “Trying to show some respect, but at the same time, it’s so unceremonial.”

Images of hospital patients awaiting their fates are heartbreaking and made all the more so by the knowledge that many caught the virus while caring for sick relatives.

Nothing in this report is new, but its sheer starkness supports the growing call for a more vigorous international response[http://time.com/3291282/obama-ebola/] to the outbreak.

Some governments in the countries affected by Ebola seem unwilling or unable to deal with the crisis. The second subject “Frontline” examines, the Boko Haram situation in Nigeria, has also been exacerbated by government failures.

Boko Haram[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/africa/boko-haram-seeks-new-battlegrounds.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A10%22%7D&_r=0], the radical Islamist group, has wreaked havoc on parts of Nigeria, most infamously by kidnapping scores of girls, an act that has brought worldwide outrage.

But Evan Williams, the producer and reporter of the segment, has secured a series of hard-to-watch videos that indicate that the hunt for Boko Haram has resulted in its own atrocities, apparently committed by the military and government-sponsored militias doing the hunting.

The videos show beatings and executions of people accused — often, Mr. Williams reports, without merit — of belonging to Boko Haram. The brutality, some witnesses say, has actually driven people to align with Boko Haram to escape these supposed saviors.

The possible responses to the Ebola outbreak are at least knowable. What the world should do about the horrors in Nigeria is far less clear.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• “No evidence of human error.”

In a preliminary report,[http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/701/b3923acad0ceprem-rapport-mh-17-en-interactief.pdf] the Dutch Safety Board said today that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 broke up in midair after being hit by “high-energy objects from outside the aircraft.”

The finding is consistent[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/world/europe/malaysian-airliner-ukraine.html] with theories that it was brought down by a missile. All 298 people on board died when the jetliner crashed July 17 in eastern Ukraine.

The report did not offer any information on where the objects came from.

• The last election before Election Day.

Today is the finale of primary season. Voting takes place[http://bigstory.ap.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/news-guide-primary-election-highlights-3] in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware and New York.

• Foreign policy strategy session.

President Obama meets congressional leaders today on his plans for fighting ISIS, ahead of his speech to the nation at 9 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday.

The administration praised Iraq after lawmakers there approved a power-sharing government[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/world/middleeast/iraq.html], raising hopes that a united Baghdad can help repel the militants.

• Apple’s unveiling.

The company’s new product dog-and-pony show today, which we are live-blogging[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/apple-live-blog-new-iphone/], will be watched for any surprises.

Redesigned iPhones, mobile payments software and a “wearable” gadget are already anticipated.

• Dire warnings on Ebola.

Doctors Without Borders said today that it is overwhelmed by Ebola cases in Liberia, where the World Health Organization said the number of patients was increasing exponentially[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/world/africa/ebola-cases-reported-up-sharply-in-liberia.html].

Congressis considering[http://mobile.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/09/08/world/africa/08reuters-usa-congress-ebola.html] an Obama administration request for more funding to combat the virus, and a fourth infected U.S. citizen is expected[http://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/09/us/ap-us-ebola-americans.html] in Atlanta today for treatment.

• Police under scrutiny.

The Senate Homeland Security Committee holds a hearing[http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/oversight-of-federal-programs-for-equipping-state-and-local-law-enforcement] today on equipping local law enforcement, after county police in Ferguson, Mo., used riot gear and armored tanks to disperse protesters last month.

And the Ferguson City Council meets today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/us/ferguson-council-looks-to-improve-community-relations-with-police.html] for the first time since the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. It plans to establish a board providing citizen oversight and guidance for the police.

• Home Depot finally confirms breach.

Consumers are awaiting more details from Home Depot today after the chain acknowledged that hackers[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/home-depot-confirms-that-it-was-hacked/] had broken into its payments systems.

Sixty million or more credit card numbers may have been stolen, making it the largest known breach of a retail company’s computer network.

• Monsoon death toll is rising.

Pakistani and Indian troops are using boats and helicopters today to deliver food supplies to families and evacuate victims in Kashmir, where hundreds have died, amid its worst flooding[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/world/asia/scale-of-flooding-stymies-relief-efforts-in-india-and-pakistan.html] in decades.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are lower.

European shares closed down, and Japanese indexes ended higher. Most Asian markets were closed for a holiday.

• Trump Entertainment Resorts, which has two casinos in Atlantic City, filed for bankruptcy court protection today.

• Google is trying to improve its standing in Europe after its third proposed settlement with European antitrust regulators[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/technology/google-is-target-of-european-backlash-on-us-tech-dominance.html] was rejected.

It holds a public meeting in Madrid today, one of seven[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28344705] planned to debate issues raised by the online “right to be forgotten” ruling in Europe.

• Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce giant, is moving into America with today’s $1 billion purchase of Ebates[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/rakuten-of-japan-to-buy-ebates-a-u-s-rebate-site-for-1-billion/], an online rebate site.

NOTEWORTHY

• A new tennis champion.

The 14th-seeded Marin Cilic defeated[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/sports/tennis/marin-cilic-defeats-kei-nishikori-at-us-open-for-his-first-grand-slam-title.html] No. 10 Kei Nishikori in straight sets, becoming the lowest seed to win the U.S. Open since Pete Sampras won in 2002 as No. 17.

It is the Croat’s first major title.

• Oh, the places we’re still going!

Some of Dr. Seuss’s forgotten work is published today in a collection called “Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories.[http://www.randomhouse.com/book/234695/horton-and-the-kwuggerbug-and-more-lost-stories-by-dr-seuss]”

The pieces by Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, originally ran in Redbook magazine in the 1950s. Horton and the Grinch will be familiar to readers, but Kwuggerbug will be new to most.

• On the record.

Want to know which TV show is the most pirated? Or which posting on Facebook got the most likes?

These new listings and many other “mosts” are in the 60th-anniversary edition of “Guinness World Records,” released today.

(The answers: “Game of Thrones,” and Vin Diesel’s picture of himself with the late Paul Walker.)

• American breakthrough.

Two Americans and an Australian are among the six writers on the shortlist[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/man-booker-prize-shortlist-announced-2/] of the 2014 Man Booker Prize, the first time authors from outside the British Commonwealth have been considered for the literary award.

• Back together, at least for one song.

Michelle Williams, who was a member of Destiny’s Child with Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland, releases her latest album today.

“Journey to Freedom” includes the single “Say Yes,” which reunites the R&B trio.

• A big step in the glass slipper.

Keke Palmer becomes the first black Cinderella on Broadway[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/keke-palmer-will-be-broadways-next-cinderella/] today in “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella.”

• Underneath it all.

Britney Spears’s lingerie collection debuts today at the New York Public Library during New York Fashion Week[http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/].

BACK STORY

What is driving today’s huge increase in investigations of sexual assaults on college campuses?

A 1972 federal law on women’s collegiate sports.

So-called Title IX — one part of the amendments to earlier education acts — bans sex discrimination in schools that receive federal money.

It helped the number of girls and women in high school and college sports soar to 3.4 million today from 310,000 in 1972.

In 2011, the Education Department started using a stricter interpretation of Title IX, one that requires students to be protected from sexual harassment and assault.

Since then, students at more than 75 schools[https://docs-google-com.proxy.bc.edu/a/nytimes.com/file/d/0B2NmtrdBZz-tRTF1cHVDV0V5LV9fbl9kQVEtWkRCTElJV1pF/edit] have used Title IX to start investigations over the handling of sexual assault complaints.

Now, a bipartisan group of senators wants to enshrine that protection in law.

The group’s bill, currently in congressional committees, would impose significant financial penalties[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/upshot/campus-sexual-assault-bill-relies-on-public-shaming.html] on colleges if they do not release data about sexual violence on campus, among other requirements.

A Closer Look at the Ebola Epidemic in the Context of Ecological Health

The Ebola epidemic continues to rage[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] in West Africa, and while it is very unlikely to reach pandemic scale (see The Economist[http://www-economist-com.proxy.bc.edu/blogs/economist-explains/2014/08/economist-explains-10]), the outbreak provides a reminder of the linkages between disrupted ecosystems and human illness.

Back in July, the Op Talk blog of The Times explored how environmental conservation in areas that are reservoirs for Ebola[http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/how-environmentalism-can-help-stop-ebola] can help cut the odds of outbreaks. In 2012, Jim Robbins wrote a fine overview of “The Ecology of Disease[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/sunday-review/the-ecology-of-disease.html?_r=1&ref=jimrobbins]” — everything from Ebola to Lyme disease — accompanied by a superb map of “Hot Spots for Emerging Diseases[http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/07/15/opinion/15cover-grph.html?ref=sunday-review].”

Now, a very helpful overview of the “one world, one health[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/one-world-one-health/]” concept has been written for the Future Earth blog by by Catherine Machalaba[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/people/catherine-machalaba], program coordinator for health and policy at EcoHealth Alliance. The illustration above is part of an info-graphic created by Machalaba and a colleague. Here’s an excerpt:

Ebola and other emerging diseases: losing the trees before we see the forest’s connection to our health

By Catherine Machalaba[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/people/catherine-machalaba]

The Ebola crisis has serious impacts on public health, economies, and societies, but crucially, it’s not an isolated incident. Globally, infectious diseases account for a billion human cases per year, leading to millions of deaths. The majority of known human infectious diseases are “zoonotic,”[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61678-X/abstract] meaning they are shared with animals. Ebola is just one of nearly 1,000 known human diseases that have originated from animals….

[W]hat’s striking about diseases emerging in recent decades, of which over 70 percent have come from wildlife, is that we ourselves are driving their appearance in humans[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/nature/journal/v451/n7181/full/nature06536.html]. The more we expand the footprint of human populations, encroaching upon and altering natural habitats in order to extract resources, intensify food production, and move animals and people – and the pathogens they carry – the greater the potential for infection and the spread of pathogens novel to humans. Climate change may also create newly suitable habitats for species and their pathogens. As an example, projections have suggested that warming temperatures could alter the range for Flying Fox bats[http://www.pnas.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/110/Supplement_1/3681.full.pdf], which carry the deadly Nipah virus. The drivers of disease emergence and spreading are also the drivers fundamentally changing our environment….

In the devastating Ebola crisis, there may be a silver lining to salvage. While Ebola fortunately is unlikely to become a global pandemic (due to Ebola’s infection pathway, which requires direct contact with bodily fluids, and the risk-minimizing public health advances in many parts of the world), we can harness the concern from the global community about Ebola’s potential spread to have a constructive dialogue about preventing future outbreaks. This is especially timely given other recent animal-origin diseases we’ve seen, including H7N9 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and our challenge in controlling their ongoing spread.

In addition to essential community and policy-oriented actions around strengthening preventive public health infrastructure, science has an important role to play in prevention. Science can yield a better understanding of disease risks and identify ways to prevent pathogens from moving from animals to humans. We can expand our arsenal by targeting the source, as with the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT program[http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ohi/predict/], which has conducted novel pathogen surveillance in wildlife in settings of high risk for transmission to humans. Routine surveillance of animals may also directly benefit both wildlife conservation efforts and human health by providing sentinels for diseases of harm to humans. Detection of Ebola infection in wildlife might have prevented transmission to the first Ebola case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a few weeks ago, which occurred from butchering and/or consuming an infected animal, an outbreak believed to be separate from the one in West Africa.

As we look towards the Sustainable Development Goals, health stands out as a ubiquitous concern that communities worldwide will continue to grapple with. A 2012 study found that vector-borne and parasitic diseases (VBPD) can negatively affect economic development[http://www.plosbiology.org.proxy.bc.edu/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001456] and suggested an increased VBPD burden where biodiversity decreases.

The overlapping drivers of disease and environmental change, as well as their development implications, point towards the need for, and benefits, of ‘One Health’, a more integrated view and approach to human, animal and environmental health[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60821/william-b-karesh-and-robert-a-cook/the-human-animal-link]. We can no longer afford to think of human health as separate from animal health and their environmental determinants.  “My biggest concern is the lack of understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that lead to outbreaks such as Ebola”, says Dr. William B. Karesh from the conservation and health organization EcoHealth Alliance, who has been a leader in One Health initiatives. “Without a broad collaborative approach like Future Earth is taking, we will be severely limited in our ability to prevent future outbreaks”.

Some international groups are helping to foster synergies, including the World Health Organization’s recent conference on Climate and Health, the Convention on Biological Diversity’s initiative on Health and Biodiversity, the Lancet-Rockefeller Commission on Planetary Health, and the DIVERSITAS-Future Earth ecoHEALTH[http://www.futureearth.org/projects/ecohealth] project, which brings together public and animal health, development, ecology, economics, and other sectors to investigate connections between health and environmental change to generate science and policy outputs that can inform sustainability solutions.

Central to dialogues on infectious disease is the number of pathogens that exist. A recent estimate suggests over 320,000 mammalian viruses are still to be discovered[http://mbio.asm.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/4/5/e00598-13] but haven’t yet emerged in humans. What we do to our planet will determine whether we can go beyond reactive responses and prevent an increasing health burden. If we don’t rapidly take a broader view of health – moving from beyond our single-species perspective, to ecosystems as a whole – we may lose the trees before we have seen the forest, and the importance it holds for our health.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Man with a plan.

President Obama will address the nation Wednesday night[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/us/obama-isis-congress.html] on the growing threat of ISIS.

“A lot of people will be watching to see first whether he now has a strategy in Syria, which he famously said he didn’t have not long ago,” says Peter Baker, our White House correspondent.

“The question is, what that strategy is, will it work, how long will it take and what will it mean for a country that’s been at war for 13 years straight now.”

Mr. Baker says he expects the president to say again that he has ruled out ground troops even if he does authorize airstrikes inside Syria.

“Instead, he’ll emphasize that this requires a variety of elements,” Mr. Baker says, “including Syrian rebel forces on the ground, an international coalition to help cut off support for ISIS and political reconciliation in Iraq and a larger resolution to Syria’s civil war.”

• Following the leader.

“Every major product Apple announced has been done by someone else already. It has a gift, though, for making them better.”

That’s Nick Wingfield, one of our technology reporters, on Apple’s introduction today [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/technology/apple-aims-for-the-wrist-with-a-smartwatch-while-making-the-iphone-6-larger.html] of big-screen iPhones, a heralded mobile payment system and a smartwatch to track activity and stay connected.

“Big-screen phones that are wannabe tablets have already been huge mainstream hits for Samsung,” he says. “A lot of Apple fans are going to be thrilled that the company finally came around to making bigger phones.”

Apple’s greater challenge will be selling the public on the need for a smartwatch and mobile payments, both products that others have tried with mixed results.

“Apple is great at conjuring up a need for things where none was apparent before,” Mr. Wingfield says.

• Europe loves Google. Sometimes.

The company’s European market share is close to 90 percent (excluding Russia), compared with just two-thirds in the United States, says Danny Hakim, one of our correspondents in London.

But as European regulators work to rein the company in[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/technology/google-is-target-of-european-backlash-on-us-tech-dominance.html], it’s also clear just how much anger and resentment Google faces, he says.

First, he says, are “the revelations by Edward Snowden about the role technology plays in America’s intelligence-gathering practices.”

Then there are worries about whether American tech giants pay their fair share of European taxes.

“And in policy circles there is concern about the competitiveness of European technology companies, and whether they are being improperly squeezed by the big Silicon Valley companies,” Mr. Hakim says.

“And it’s important to remember that anger against them is being stoked, too, by some of their American rivals, principally Microsoft,” he notes.

• Odd one out.

One of our best-read stories this week[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html] explored how Qatar’s support of political Islam has angered the other oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchies.

Only Qatar’s royal family knows for sure why it has courted the Muslim Brotherhood and similar groups, says the article’s author, David D. Kirkpatrick, our Cairo bureau chief.

But regional politics offer one answer, he tells us.

“Islamists who have dealings with Qatar say the emirate cultivates mainstream Islamist parties around the region as a counterweight to Saudi Arabia,” he says.

Qatar already has a close military partnership with the United States, he adds, so it has hedged its bets.

“Over the last 45 years, one might argue, political Islam has steadily moved closer to power across the Arab world,” Mr. Kirkpatrick says, “so betting on its future is not unreasonable.”

Ebola Cases Reported Up Sharply in Liberia

Correction Appended

The World Health Organization issued a dire Ebola warning on Monday concerning Liberia, saying that the number of afflicted patients was increasing exponentially, that nearly all the country has confirmed cases and that all new treatment facilities were overwhelmed, “pointing to a large but previously invisible caseload.”

The description of the crisis in Liberia, which along with Sierra Leone and Guinea are the three West African countries at the center of the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded, suggested an even more chaotic situation in Liberia than had been thought, with the highest cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths.

In another ominous piece of news, the organization said one of its own doctors working at a government-run Ebola treatment center in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, would be evacuated after having tested positive for the disease.

Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which recently treated and discharged two American missionary health workers infected with Ebola, said in a separate announcement that it would be receiving a third patient by air ambulance from West Africa on Tuesday. It was unclear if that patient was the same person, whose identity was not disclosed. At the same time, the authorities in Sierra Leone elaborated on their three-day plan, announced Saturday, for a nationwide curfew [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/world/africa/sierra-leone-to-impose-widespread-ebola-quarantine.html]this month to allow emergency teams to visit every home in the country of six million from Sept. 19 to 21 to find people infected with Ebola and remove the dead.

Despite concerns among some health advocacy groups that such a measure could backfire, President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone said in a nationwide address that “we have no choice but to go into it with great commitment and determination.”

Sierra Leone has more than 1,200 cases and has had about 500 deaths, but in relative terms it is still faring better than Liberia, a country with a smaller population which has been hit with nearly 2,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths, according to World Health Organization figures.

“Transmission of the Ebola virus in Liberia is already intense and the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,” the organization said in a statement on its website[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/8-september-2014/en/]. “The number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in Ebola-specific treatment centers.”

Of the 152 health care workers in Liberia who have been infected, the statement said, 79 have died.

The paucity of medical personnel in Liberia, with a population of 4.4 million, was a severe problem even before the Ebola outbreak escalated into a crisis. The World Health Organization’s statement said that when the outbreak began, Liberia had only one doctor per 100,000 people. “Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly,” said the statement, titled “Situation in Liberia: Nonconventional Interventions Needed.”

The organization said its new assessment was the result of a two-week investigation by its own emergency experts collaborating with the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia.

In Montserrado County, which includes the capital, Monrovia, and is home to one million people, the statement said at least 1,000 beds were urgently needed, as opposed to the 240 now available. Even with 260 more beds planned, the statement said, “only half of the urgent and immediate capacity needs could be met within the new few weeks and months.”

The statement singled out the risks in Monrovia’s West Point slum, where the authorities imposed an ill-fated Ebola quarantine last month that provoked deadly riots and was lifted after 10 days[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/africa/quarantine-for-ebola-lifted-in-liberia-slum.html?_r=0].

Ebola, a virus first discovered in 1976, causes high fevers, extreme fatigue and internal bleeding, with a fatality rate as high as 90 percent and no known cure. The health organization has estimated that it could cost $600 million to fight the scourge and that 20,000 people could be infected.

At an emergency meeting at the organization’s Geneva headquarters last week, experts said two potential vaccines could be available as soon as November[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/world/africa/ebola-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-november-who-says.html] and would first be administered to health care workers most exposed to the disease. The experts also recommended expedited treatment of other experimental therapies, including serums derived from the blood of Ebola survivors.

How Much of the Worst Summer of News Ever Can You Take?
By ANNA ALTMAN

NYT Blogs

© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved
In case you’ve been living under a rock, this summer has been full of catastrophic news. Since June, Boko Haram has continued to kidnap girls and women in northeastern Nigeria[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/africa/boko-haram-suspected-of-new-kidnappings-in-nigeria.html], Ukrainian separatists shot down Malaysia Flight 17[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/malaysian-airlines-plane-ukraine.html], the death toll in Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/world/middleeast/un-raises-estimate-of-dead-in-syrian-conflict-to-191000.html] surpassed 190,000 and thousands of children from Central America trekked to the United States border[http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/obamas-humanitarian-immigration-crisis/] to flee unprecedented violence.

That doesn’t even include Robin Williams[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/business/media/busy-working-robin-williams-fought-demons.html]’s suicide, the largest outbreak of Ebola on record[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] in West Africa, Israel’s ground invasion in Gaza[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip.html], ISIS establishing a caliphate in Iraq[http://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000003048191/islamic-state-fighters-take-mosul-dam-amvid.html] and Syria[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/the-iraq-isis-conflict-in-maps-photos-and-video.html], and the tragedy in Ferguson, Mo.

It’s been a lot to absorb. Erin Gloria Ryan at Jezebel[http://jezebel.com/worst-fucking-summer-ever-1627642532] anoints the summer of 2014 “the worst ever.” A lot of this, she writes, has to do with the 24-hour news cycle and social media: “There were eras where most things, to some people, probably seemed okay. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media[http://blog.wan-ifra.org/2014/07/29/is-social-media-to-blame-for-the-increasingly-graphic-images-in-our-newspapers] are great ways to spread joy and pictures of your cool fourth of July nail art, but they’re also incredibly efficient in letting people know what is bad where you are.”

Daniel Altman at Foreign Policy[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/09/05/how_to_get_away_with_almost_anything_syria_ukraine_islamic_state] thinks the media and the public have attention-deficit disorder when it comes to all this bad news — that no one can absorb all the bad news that’s been taking place this summer: “It would be impossible to follow every single event happening around the world. Even the best news organizations can’t, because they have finite resources. But the rest of us can’t either, because we have other things to do besides sitting in front of our various screens.”

Mr. Altman worries, however, about the impact of our divided attention. He expresses concern, in particular, about Syria: “Deaths in Syria’s civil war long ago passed the 100,000 mark, with hundreds more every day, but there is almost no coverage of the day-to-day fighting and plight of civilians there anymore. The novelty has worn off, and new stories have grabbed the attention of the media and public.”

The consequence may be even more violence: “Bashar al-Assad, his cronies, and his opponents have the license to keep on killing without much fear of global outcry or intervention.”

Some argue that we have a moral obligation to pay attention to the grisly violence taking place in Syria. Writing after Mr. Assad’s sarin gas attack in August 2013[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/world/europe/syria-united-nations.html?pagewanted=all], Susan Moeller at the Huffington Post[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-moeller/why-you-need-to-look-at-t_b_3803383.html] argued that we have to fight “compassion fatigue[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201207/compassion-fatigue]” and train our eyes on the horrors in Syria: “When the best available evidence for a major news event is visual, and when that visual evidence is not itself an agent of fear-mongering (such as videos made by terrorist groups) journalists have the responsibility to publish that visual evidence and we the adult audience have the responsibility of looking at it — forewarned of the horrors to be seen perhaps, but not coddled into a comfortable obliviousness.”

Ms. Moeller differentiated between images that function as evidence and those that serve solely to perpetuate fear. Writing nearly a year before the killings of the journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Ms. Moeller thus anticipated a heated argument[http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/should-we-be-seeing-gruesome-acts-and-if-so-where/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs®ion=Body&_r=1] about whether or not such videos are pure (and efficacious[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/isis-beheading-videos-propaganda-working]) propaganda, and thus to be avoided, or required viewing[http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/08/22/james-foley-video-grim-but-owe-him-bear-witness/wWG9Jkprv49QJbA28BG8wM/story.html]. (Her argument also supports Brendan O’Neill[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100280647/can-everyone-please-stop-posting-photos-of-dead-palestinian-children-all-over-the-internet/]’s, writing for The Telegraph, who writes that the proliferation of photos of dead Palestinian children on social media ignites our moral outrage, but does little to inform us: These photos “are about turning the spotlight on to ourselves so that we can narcissistically declare to anyone who will listen: ‘This photo made me weep. Aren’t I good?’”)

There is evidence, however, that an overload of negative news can, on the one hand, make us depressed about things unrelated to the news[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-we-worry/201206/the-psychological-effects-tv-news] and, on the other, make us less likely to act to change the circumstances that lead to violence[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/08/01/compassion-fatigue-how-much-too-much-bad-news]. Lin Taylor[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/08/01/compassion-fatigue-how-much-too-much-bad-news], writing for the Australian website SBS last month, quotes the social psychologist Dr. Lisa Williams, of the University of New South Wales, who says, “the more that we hear about events and suffering and trauma that pull at our proverbial heartstrings, the more likely that some of us just withdraw and no longer have that strong motivation to help.” Opting out of the news cycle, Ms. Taylor writes, can allow us to reset: The journalism researcher Julie Posetti tells Ms. Taylor, “Tuning out for periods is becoming increasingly necessary — both to avoid vicarious trauma, and to prevent compassion fatigue.”

Courtney E. Martin, a columnist for On Being[http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-unbearable-weight-of-world-news/6734], offers a personal story about James Foley’s death to illustrate this conundrum. She writes that while sitting with her mom and her husband, she and her husband “express our horror then transition into talking about the danger journalists face reporting in regions like Syria or on topics like combat, the drug trade etc. I slowly — too slowly — realize that my mom’s eyes are filling with tears.”

Ms. Martin acknowledges that she has habituated herself to the consumption of world events at all hours of the day: “I’m talking about the chronic, contemporary pain of being an informed person. You wake up, reach for the phone next to your bed, start scrolling through Facebook and — just like that — you are immersed in the eternal stream of rubble, corruption, and death that is the daily news cycle.” Her mother, however, has made a conscious effort to minimize her exposure to the news and, to Ms. Martin’s mind, that means a more humane reaction: “Titrating her consumption overall actually produced a more moral response in my mom in the moment; whereas my husband and I were able to speak about James Foley’s death with sadness, to be sure, but also with a certain amount of detachment. My mom’s response was actually closer in line with her own humanity and James Foley’s humanity. His death in Syria is an event worthy of tears, even for a stranger.”

Ms. Martin admires her mother’s sensitivity, but she also worries about the consequences of not bearing witness. “Shielding oneself from the news is dangerous for everyone. If we, the relatively safe and privileged reader, don’t act as witnesses to the world’s violence, how can we fight against it? Is our mental comfort more important than the motivation that our discomfort might produce?”

The optimum level of attention might be somewhere in the middle. We need to keep tabs on the violence and suffering unfolding in regions far from our own, as Mr. Altman advocates, but we shouldn’t be so inundated with information as to become numb or inactive. We need to protect ourselves as well as our world.

Obama Is Ready To Order Strikes From Air in Syria
By MARK LANDLER and JONATHAN WEISMAN

WASHINGTON — President Obama is prepared to authorize airstrikes in Syria, a senior administration official said on Tuesday, taking the military campaign against the Sunni militant group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, into new and unpredictable terrain. But Mr. Obama is still wrestling with a series of challenges, including how to train and equip a viable ground force to fight ISIS inside Syria, how to intervene without aiding President Bashar al-Assad, and how to enlist potentially reluctant partners like Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

In a prime-time address on Wednesday evening, Mr. Obama is to explain to Americans his strategy for “degrading and ultimately destroying the terrorist group,” the White House said in a statement. People briefed on the president’s plans described a long-term campaign far more complex than the targeted strikes the United States has used against Al Qaeda in Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere.

Mr. Obama has resisted military engagement in Syria for more than three years, out of fear early on that arming the rebels who oppose Mr. Assad would fail to alter the balance in the civil war while more direct military intervention could have spillover effects in the volatile region.

When he threatened Syria with a missile strike last year after Mr. Assad’s forces used chemical weapons, implacable opposition in Congress led him to shelve the plan. Now, however, the threat from ISIS has changed both the American political climate and his calculations.

On Tuesday, the president briefed Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate about his plans. Mr. Obama told them he believed he had the authority needed to order an expanded operation, though he would “welcome action by the Congress that would aid the overall effort,” the White House statement said.

But Congress is divided on the need for a vote on military action before the midterm elections, and both sides appeared to be searching for a way to enlist congressional support without an explicit authorization of force. One way under discussion would be for lawmakers to approve $500 million in funding to train and arm Syrian rebels who would fight ISIS — legislation that has been languishing on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Obama’s speech to the nation, on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is the culmination of weeks of anguished internal deliberations, followed by days of intense lobbying of allies by the president — at a NATO meeting in Wales, with Congress, and even over a three-hour dinner Monday night with members of the Democratic and Republican foreign-policy establishment.

The White House has been galvanized by the beheadings of two American journalists, James Foley and Steven J. Sotloff, each by a masked ISIS fighter. The harrowing images, captured on video and circulated around the world, have turned American public opinion in favor of military action against the militants, recent polls show, and appear to have moved a president who had long resisted military engagement in Syria. And the United States has conducted airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq.

But Mr. Obama is encountering complications as he works to assemble support at home and a coalition abroad. The Turkish government, for example, has been fearful of an aggressive retaliation against ISIS because of concerns that the group would harm the 49 Turkish citizens it is holding, including its consul general, after ISIS raided the Turkish Consulate in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met with Turkish leaders to discuss their contribution to the effort, but emerged with no concrete commitments. A Turkish official expressed concerns that weapons sent to Syrian rebels to fight ISIS could end up in the hands of Kurdish fighters whom Turkey regards as a terrorist group.

The White House is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to Saudi Arabia this week to enlist the Saudis, who have been a vital source of funding to groups opposing the Assad government. The Saudis, while supportive of the United States, worry that going to war with ISIS could provoke a backlash among Sunni extremists in its own population.

At the dinner on Monday, several participants said, Mr. Obama expressed confidence that a robust coalition would coalesce against ISIS over time. They said he presented a comprehensive plan that included military, diplomatic and ideological components, based on trying to counter the story line that ISIS has propagated in the Arab world.

“The big picture is that this is going to be a very long-term proposition, that American leadership is necessary, and that this can’t turn into a U.S. vs. Sunni battle,” said one of the guests, Samuel R. Berger, who was national security adviser to President Bill Clinton. “It has to be us helping the Sunnis battle the Sunni extremists.”

Another participant, Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state who is the president of the Brookings Institution, said, “He regards ISIS as a new phenomenon that requires not thinking about it as ‘some of them here, some of them there,’ but ‘wherever it is, to go after it.’ “

Jane Harman, the president of the Woodrow Wilson Center, said that while the Assad government was a major topic of discussion, she and other participants told Mr. Obama that he could order military action in Syria without fear of helping Mr. Assad, since ISIS was occupying ungoverned territory that his forces were unlikely to reconquer.

But Ms. Harman, a former Democratic representative from California, said she made a fervent case that Mr. Obama should obtain congressional authorization for any action. Her call was not picked up many of the Democrats currently in Congress.

The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, told reporters that public attitudes toward military action were far different from a year ago, when Mr. Obama faced deep opposition in Congress to missile strikes against the Assad government for its use of chemical weapons.

Ms. Pelosi suggested that the only vote Congress was likely to take before the Nov. 4 elections would be to fund the military campaign, but Republican leaders are not even promising that.

A stopgap spending bill expected to come to a vote in the House on Thursday will include spending for overseas military operations from Oct. 1 to Dec. 11, but the money will be embedded in the broader bill to keep the government open. And so-called overseas contingency operations will be funded at the same level as spending for such efforts in the current fiscal year, House Republican aides said. Republicans did include all $88 million in new funds to combat Ebola.

The measure would also extend the life of the federal Export-Import Bank through next June over the vociferous opposition of some conservatives, who had mounted a major campaign to kill an agency they denounce as corporate welfare.

“As a practical matter, I don’t really see the time that it would take to really get this out and have a full debate and discuss all these issues,” Representative Howard McKeon, Republican of California and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said he favored congressional approval of military action. But, he added, it is up to the president to present Congress with a clear plan to defeat ISIS before any authorization vote should be taken.

A spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner said he would support the deployment of American military forces “to help train and play an advisory role for the Iraqi security forces and assist with lethal targeting” of ISIS leaders. But he made no mention of a House vote.

On Wednesday, before the speech, the White House will send a delegation to meet with senators in a classified briefing. Among those going to the Capitol will be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey; the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew Olsen; and the deputy national security adviser, Antony J. Blinken.

The brewing confrontation is already proving to be a dividing line between the interventionist wing of the Republican Party and a resurgent isolationism.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Wednesday committed $50 million to the fight against Ebola in West Africa, the largest sum it has ever committed to one outbreak.

As part of the effort, the foundation had already offered $12 million to the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support their efforts to contain the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The new money will be available for emergency operations and to help develop drugs, diagnostics or vaccines, said Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the foundation’s chief executive officer.

The Gates Foundation — the world’s richest — is stepping forward because it can make cash available immediately. “We’d heard that funds committed by some other donors would have to go through their bureaucracies,” she said.

Officials at the United Nations recently estimated that defeating this outbreak will cost at least $600 million.

Stabbing With Syringe in Nigeria Raises Concerns of Ebola as Weapon

A federal air marshal was stabbed with a syringe at the airport in Lagos, Nigeria, on Sunday, an incident that is raising concerns about whether the deadly Ebola virus could be harvested from the widespread outbreak in West Africa and used as a bioweapon.

Initial tests on the substance in the syringe, conducted at a special biodefense forensics laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., did not detect the virus or any other threatening agent, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christos Sinos, said Wednesday. The marshal, who arrived in Houston on Monday, was examined there and has been released from the hospital with no sign of illness, according to a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration.

Experts say it would be extremely hard for a group to grow large amounts of the virus and turn it into a weapon that could be dispersed over a wide area, infecting and killing many people.

“The bad guys are more likely to kill themselves trying to develop it,” said Dr. Philip K. Russell, a retired major general who was the commander of the Army Medical Research and Development Command.

But it is harder to totally discount the possibility of a smaller attack, perhaps like the one at the airport in Lagos. Another possibility would be suicide infectors, people who deliberately infected themselves and carried the virus out of the epidemic zone to sicken others.

“To truly isolate the virus takes a lot of resources,” said Dr. Ryan C. W. Hall, a Florida psychiatrist who has written about the psychiatric impacts of bioterrorism attacks. “But if you have people who are willing to die and willing to inject themselves with the blood of someone who has been infected, you don’t need a Biosafety Level 4 lab,” he said, referring to the special containment facilities used to work with the most deadly pathogens.

Such an attack would not kill many, or even any, people in an advanced country like the United States. But it could strike terror and cause economic disruption. “Someone gets sick on an airplane, conceivably everyone on that airplane has to be quarantined,” said Dr. Robert Kadlec, who was special assistant on biodefense policy to President George W. Bush.

The United States government considers Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses to be among the most serious potential bioterrorism agents, along with those that cause smallpox, anthrax, botulism, plague and tularemia.

“It’s not very contagious compared to things like plague, but it does have high lethality and could cause fear and terror,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Center for Health Security, which is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Most of the experimental drugs and vaccines now being considered for use in Africa’s Ebola outbreak have been developed in whole or in part with United States government biodefense funding, including ZMapp, the drug that appeared to help two American aid workers who were stricken with Ebola in Liberia.

Before it killed 13 people by unleashing nerve gas in the Tokyo subways in 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo traveled to Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The trip was ostensibly a medical aid mission, but the real intent was to collect Ebola samples, according to a congressional investigation[http://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part05.htm]. It does not appear the cult succeeded in its quest.

The Soviet Union tried to develop a weapon using Ebola, but dropped the effort in favor of the closely related Marburg virus, said Raymond A. Zilinskas[http://www.miis.edu/academics/faculty/rzilinskas], director of the chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

Dr. Zilinskas, who is a co-author of “The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History” (Harvard University Press, 2012), said the Soviets might have encountered difficulties in mass producing Ebola. He said they did manage to mass produce the Marburg virus in a form that could be stable if dispersed through the air, but he doubted that terrorists could do the same.

“You are talking about highly capable people working on it for years,” he said. “That’s not terrorists.”

A terrorist could expose himself to the infection, for example by rubbing against a corpse or by using bodily fluids from an infected person. That could be accomplished in West Africa, where many people are dying not in hospitals.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever has an incubation period estimated at two to 21 days, according to the World Health Organization. That means that many people would not have symptoms for a week or more after being exposed.

“So they could get on an airplane and get through customs and not be symptomatic and be in downtown Minneapolis before we know it,” Dr. Hall said.

Dr. Adalja said such a situation was not that plausible. He said that infected people are not contagious until they have symptoms, by which time they might not have the strength to go to a public place to infect others. And it would be hard for a suicide infector to spread the disease to others, since contact with bodily fluids is required.

“You have to literally vomit on them,” he said.

Researchers say that the inability of Ebola to be transmitted from person to person by air would also limit its effectiveness as a weapon of mass destruction. It is also not clear how stable the virus would be when exposed to ultraviolet light. Anthrax, by contrast, can be dispersed through the air in the form of very hardy spores.

One study[http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.bc.edu/pmc/articles/PMC1997182/pdf/ijexpath00004-0007.pdf] by Army researchers showed that when forced to inhale Ebola virus, monkeys could be infected.

Another study[http://www.nature.com.proxy.bc.edu/srep/2012/121115/srep00811/full/srep00811.html] published by Canadian scientists two years ago found that pigs could transmit the virus through the air to monkeys in nearby cages.

World; Middle East
Obama’s Remarks on the Fight Against ISIS

Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.
My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.

As commander in chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We took out Osama bin Laden and much of Al Qaeda’s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We’ve targeted Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia. We’ve done so while bringing more than 140,000 American troops home from Iraq and drawing down our forces in Afghanistan, where our combat mission will end later this year. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer.

Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat. We can’t erase every trace of evil from the world and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. And that’s why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. At this moment the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is ISIL — which calls itself the Islamic State.

Now let’s make two things clear: ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL’s victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state. It was formerly Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria’s civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government nor by the people it subjugates. ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.

In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. And in acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists — Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff.

So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria and the broader Middle East, including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners, including Europeans and some Americans, have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks.

I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then we’ve conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have also helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children.

But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves. Nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. That’s why I’ve insisted that additional U.S. action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days.

So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. Our objective is clear: We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy.

First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions so that we’re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.

Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi security forces. Now that those teams have completed their work and Iraq has formed a government, we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission. We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment. We’ll also support Iraq’s efforts to stand up national guard units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL control.

Across the border in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress, again, to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its own people — a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria’s crisis once and for all.

Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding, improve our intelligence, strengthen our defenses, counter its warped ideology, and stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of the Middle East. And in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to further mobilize the international community around this effort.

Fourth, we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who’ve been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands.

So this is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq, sending arms and assistance to Iraqi security forces and the Syrian opposition, sharing intelligence and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: We stand with people who fight for their own freedom, and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity.

My administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the president and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger.

Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved, especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partners’ forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years, and it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.

My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked. Next week marks six years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet despite these shocks, through the pain we felt and the grueling work required to bounce back, America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth.

Our technology companies and universities are unmatched. Our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving. Energy independence is closer than it’s been in decades. For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day, and that makes me more confident than ever about our country’s future.

Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression and in support of the Ukrainian people’s right to determine their own destiny. It is America — our scientists, our doctors, our know-how — that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons so that they can’t pose a threat to the Syrian people or the world again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity and tolerance and a more hopeful future.

America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia, from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East, we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding. Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a commander in chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform — pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East and service members who support our partners on the ground.

When we helped prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here’s what one of them said: “We owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people.”

That is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety, our own security depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation and uphold the values that we stand for — timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth.

May God bless our troops and may God bless the United States of America.

The president said the United States would lead a coalition against ISIS and laid out the four parts of the strategy.

WASHINGTON -- The violent ambitions of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have been condemned across the world: in Europe and the Middle East, by Sunni nations and Shiite ones, and by sworn enemies like Israel and Iran. Pope Francis joined the call for ISIS to be stopped.

But as President Obama prepares to send the United States on what could be a yearslong military campaign against the militant group, American intelligence agencies have concluded that it poses no immediate threat to the United States. Some officials and terrorism experts believe that the actual danger posed by ISIS has been distorted in hours of television punditry and alarmist statements by politicians, and that there has been little substantive public debate about the unintended consequences of expanding American military action in the Middle East.

Daniel Benjamin, who served as the State Department's top counterterrorism adviser during Mr. Obama's first term, said the public discussion about the ISIS threat has been a ''farce,'' with ''members of the cabinet and top military officers all over the place describing the threat in lurid terms that are not justified.''

''It's hard to imagine a better indication of the ability of elected officials and TV talking heads to spin the public into a panic, with claims that the nation is honeycombed with sleeper cells, that operatives are streaming across the border into Texas or that the group will soon be spraying Ebola virus on mass transit systems -- all on the basis of no corroborated information,'' said Mr. Benjamin, who is now a scholar at Dartmouth College.

Mr. Obama has spent years urging caution about the perils of wading into the Syrian civil war, a position that has led critics to argue that his inaction has contributed to the death and chaos there. Now, he faces criticism that he has become caught up in a rush to war with no clear vision for how the fighting will end.

In his speech Wednesday night, the president acknowledged that intelligence agencies have not detected any specific plots aimed at the United States. ISIS is a regional threat, he said, but if the group is left unchecked it could ultimately directly threaten the country.

Some American officials warn of the potential danger of a prolonged military campaign in the Middle East, led by the United States, and say there are risks that escalating airstrikes could do the opposite of what they are intended to do and fan the threat of terrorism on American soil.

In recent days, American counterterrorism and intelligence officials have sought to tamp down the political speech used to describe the threat from ISIS -- the wealthy militant army that has seized wide portions of two countries and attracted thousands of foreign fighters who some officials fear could at some point be sent home to carry out attacks -- with a more nuanced assessment of its weaknesses.

''As formidable as ISIL is as a group, it is not invincible,'' Matthew G. Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said last week, using an alternate name for the group. ''ISIL is not Al Qaeda pre-9/11'' with cells operating in Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States. Mr. Olsen's assessment stood in contrast to more pointed descriptions by other American officials like Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who has said that ISIS poses an ''imminent threat to every interest we have.''

The group has been vulnerable, for instance, to airstrikes coordinated with Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces in northern Iraq in the past month, Mr. Olsen said, noting that as a result, ''ISIL is losing arms, it's losing equipment, and it's losing territory.''

Despite the attention ISIS has received, when American counterterrorism officials review the threats to the United States each day, the terror group is not a top concern. Al Qaeda and its affiliates remain the most immediate focus. That is because ISIS has no ability to attack inside the United States, American and allied security officials say, and it is not clear to intelligence officials that the group even wants to.

In a speech Wednesday morning, Jeh C. Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said, ''We know of no credible information that ISIL is planning to attack the homeland at present.''

But a chorus of voices demanding tough action to blunt the advances of ISIS -- a chorus that has grown louder with the recent release of videos showing the beheadings of American journalists -- appears to have had a substantial impact on public opinion. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted Sept. 3 to 7 reveals that nearly half of the country thinks the United States is more at risk of a major terrorist attack than it was before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

While ISIS may have long-term aspirations for war with America, the group's immediate focus is forming an Islamic state under a puritanical version of Sunni Islam.

American officials have said publicly that their greatest fear is that ISIS has inspired radicals in the West. The concern is that jihadists with American or European passports will fight alongside ISIS or other terrorist groups in Syria, then return home trained to carry out an attack of their choosing. It is not clear that airstrikes against ISIS will, at least in the short term, diminish that threat.

Even a limited air campaign could play into an ISIS narrative that American infidels were intervening on behalf of apostate governments in Iraq and Syria. Airstrikes are also risky because the new Shiite-led government in Iraq is unsettled, officials say. Under Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the government inflamed sectarian tensions, enraging Sunnis who are not natural allies of ISIS. If American airstrikes are seen as supporting the Iraqi government against the Sunnis, bombings could become ISIS recruiting tools.

The officials said any military action would have to be closely coordinated with Iraq and other governments in the region to avoid worsening a Shiite-Sunni rift. One unintended consequence of the United States' attacking ISIS will be weakening the strongest remaining opponent of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

Analysts are also concerned that ISIS has destabilized the Middle East and is fostering the growth of its violent version of Islam, much like the way the Taliban allowed the growth of Al Qaeda.

''It's pretty clear that upping our involvement in Iraq and Syria makes it more likely that we will be targeted by the people we are attacking,'' said Andrew Liepman, a former deputy director at the National Counterterrorism Center who is now a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation.

''But this is different than many other situations we've been involved in because the ISIS narrative is so vicious and so brutal that it has virtually no external allies.''

It was only three months ago, when Mr. Obama first announced plans to send military advisers to Iraq, that much of Washington -- from Congress to think tank pundits -- seemed deeply skeptical about greater American military engagement in the region.

Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst now at the Brookings Institution who rose to prominence in 2002 for advocating the toppling of Saddam Hussein and later expressing regret for that position, said in a July interview that he had deep reservations about sending the American military back to the volatile region for fear of ''opening Pandora's box.''

Now, some of Mr. Pollack's concerns appear to have taken a back seat to his alarm over ISIS and the destabilizing impact of Syria's civil war. In the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pollack wrote, ''the rationale for more decisive U.S. intervention is gaining ground.''

The number of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo doubled over the past week to 62, the World Health Organization reported Thursday, and more than half the afflicted patients have died.

The outbreak in the country, where the Ebola virus was first discovered nearly 40 years ago, is a distinct strain from the far more drastic Ebola crisis ravaging western Africa, where more than 2,200 people have died this year, the worst on record. The Congo outbreak, by contrast, is confined to four villages in one county, and all are linked to one initial case, first reported to the W.H.O. on Aug. 26.

Still, the doubling of Congo cases during the week ending Tuesday, reported by the W.H.O. in an update on its website,[http://who.int/csr/don/2014_09_10_ebola/en/] reflected Ebola’s contagious risks. The virus, which causes high fevers, vomiting, diarrhea and internal bleeding, with a fatality rate as high as 90 percent, is spread through person-to-person contact.

Thirty-five of the Congo patients have died, the W.H.O. said, including seven health care workers. Isolation facilities have been established in the four affected villages, the W.H.O. said, and international experts assisting local health officials have identified 386 people who may have been exposed.

In other Ebola-related news, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that economic growth in Liberia and Sierra Leone, two of the three West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak, could decline by as much as 3.5 percentage points because of disruptions to the mining, agriculture and service industries. Economic growth in Guinea, the third worst-afflicted country, where mining businesses have yet to be affected, could fall by 1.5 percentage points, the I.M.F. said.

In neighboring Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where health officials have confirmed 19 Ebola cases linked to a visitor from Liberia two months ago, Reuters reported that a South African woman in transit at Lagos airport on her way home from Morocco had been sent to a testing center as a suspected Ebola patient. The woman, who was not identified, had visited Sierra Leone and Guinea and had acknowledged having Ebola symptoms, Reuters quoted Nigerian health officials as saying.

U.S.
Aid Worker Recovering From Ebola

Dr. Rick Sacra, an American aid worker stricken with Ebola[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/us/04writebol.html] in Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], is making a remarkable recovery, his wife and doctors said Thursday.

One reason could be transfusions of blood plasma he received from Dr. Kent Brantly, a fellow missionary who recovered from the disease. Dr. Sacra received two infusions of plasma from Dr. Brantly last weekend, according to Dr. Phil Smith, the medical director of the special biocontainment unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where Dr. Sacra is being treated.

It is thought that Dr. Brantly, who was infected in Liberia and recovered at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, has antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in his blood that would be effective against the virus and would help Dr. Sacra.

“We are hoping it jump-started his immunity,” Dr. Smith said during a news conference at the medical center.

The World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is hoping to deploy the approach, using convalescent serum, in the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa. However, it is not clear how well this approach works in general, nor how much the transfusions helped Dr. Sacra. He has also been receiving an experimental drug and supportive care to maintain his fluids and mineral balances.

Dr. Smith said “several parties” had asked him not to identify the drug. He suggested this was to avoid having people in Africa clamoring for something that might be in short supply. Dr. Smith has said the drug is not ZMapp[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/30/world/africa/study-says-zmapp-works-against-ebola-but-making-it-takes-time.html], the one given to Dr. Brantly.

Dr. Sacra, who is from the Boston area, went to Liberia in early August to provide medical care that was being neglected because of the Ebola outbreak, particularly delivering babies.

It is not clear how he became infected. He began running a fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] the evening of Aug. 29 and arrived in Nebraska last Friday.

Dr. Angela Hewlett, associate medical director of the biocontainment unit, said Dr. Sacra was now in “good condition,” able to move about his room, talk and read. He can eat some food but not enough, so he is still being fed intravenously.

If Dr. Sacra just had the flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], he might be ready for release in a couple of days, with some home nursing, Dr. Smith said. But he will require two tests, at least 48 hours apart, showing no trace of Ebola in his blood before he can leave the hospital. Dr. Smith said he had not received the results from the blood tests.

Dr. Sacra’s wife, Debbie, who communicates with her husband by videoconference, said, “We really are amazed at how quickly Rick’s condition seemed to turn around.” She attributed it to “both faith and science.”

“It seems like his brain is waking up a little bit more every day,” she said.

Ms. Sacra said her husband hoped to return to Liberia and wanted the attention being paid to him to raise awareness of the plight of people in Africa. She also thanked Dr. Brantly for donating plasma so soon after his recovery.

Dr. Brantly and Dr. Sacra are friends, working with the missionary aid organizations Samaritan’s Purse[http://www.samaritanspurse.org/] and SIM USA[http://www.simusa.org/]. Ms. Sacra said that the fact that the two men had the same blood type was “something from the Lord.”

MINNEAPOLIS -- THE Ebola epidemic in West Africa has the potential to alter history as much as any plague has ever done.

There have been more than 4,300 cases and 2,300 deaths over the past six months. Last week, the World Health Organization warned that, by early October, there may be thousands of new cases per week in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. What is not getting said publicly, despite briefings and discussions in the inner circles of the world's public health agencies, is that we are in totally uncharted waters and that Mother Nature is the only force in charge of the crisis at this time.

There are two possible future chapters to this story that should keep us up at night.

The first possibility is that the Ebola virus spreads from West Africa to megacities in other regions of the developing world. This outbreak is very different from the 19 that have occurred in Africa over the past 40 years. It is much easier to control Ebola infections in isolated villages. But there has been a 300 percent increase in Africa's population over the last four decades, much of it in large city slums. What happens when an infected person yet to become ill travels by plane to Lagos, Nairobi, Kinshasa or Mogadishu -- or even Karachi, Jakarta, Mexico City or Dhaka?

The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air. You can now get Ebola only through direct contact with bodily fluids. But viruses like Ebola are notoriously sloppy in replicating, meaning the virus entering one person may be genetically different from the virus entering the next. The current Ebola virus's hyper-evolution is unprecedented; there has been more human-to-human transmission in the past four months than most likely occurred in the last 500 to 1,000 years. Each new infection represents trillions of throws of the genetic dice.

If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola. Infections could spread quickly to every part of the globe, as the H1N1 influenza virus did in 2009, after its birth in Mexico.

Why are public officials afraid to discuss this? They don't want to be accused of screaming ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater -- as I'm sure some will accuse me of doing. But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.

In 2012, a team of Canadian researchers proved that Ebola Zaire, the same virus that is causing the West Africa outbreak, could be transmitted by the respiratory route from pigs to monkeys, both of whose lungs are very similar to those of humans. Richard Preston's 1994 best seller ''The Hot Zone'' chronicled a 1989 outbreak of a different strain, Ebola Reston virus, among monkeys at a quarantine station near Washington. The virus was transmitted through breathing, and the outbreak ended only when all the monkeys were euthanized. We must consider that such transmissions could happen between humans, if the virus mutates.

So what must we do that we are not doing?

First, we need someone to take over the position of ''command and control.'' The United Nations is the only international organization that can direct the immense amount of medical, public health and humanitarian aid that must come from many different countries and nongovernmental groups to smother this epidemic. Thus far it has played at best a collaborating role, and with everyone in charge, no one is in charge.

A Security Council resolution could give the United Nations total responsibility for controlling the outbreak, while respecting West African nations' sovereignty as much as possible. The United Nations could, for instance, secure aircraft and landing rights. Many private airlines are refusing to fly into the affected countries, making it very difficult to deploy critical supplies and personnel. The Group of 7 countries' military air and ground support must be brought in to ensure supply chains for medical and infection-control products, as well as food and water for quarantined areas.

The United Nations should provide whatever number of beds are needed; the World Health Organization has recommended 1,500, but we may need thousands more. It should also coordinate the recruitment and training around the world of medical and nursing staff, in particular by bringing in local residents who have survived Ebola, and are no longer at risk of infection. Many countries are pledging medical resources, but donations will not result in an effective treatment system if no single group is responsible for coordinating them.

Finally, we have to remember that Ebola isn't West Africa's only problem. Tens of thousands die there each year from diseases like AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have among the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. Because people are now too afraid of contracting Ebola to go to the hospital, very few are getting basic medical care. In addition, many health care workers have been infected with Ebola, and more than 120 have died. Liberia has only 250 doctors left, for a population of four million.

This is about humanitarianism and self-interest. If we wait for vaccines and new drugs to arrive to end the Ebola epidemic, instead of taking major action now, we risk the disease's reaching from West Africa to our own backyards.

Michael T. Osterholm is the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

A Feeble Response to Ebola

MONROVIA, Liberia — The spread of the Ebola virus across West Africa has been fast and deadly. The World Health Organization has characterized the speed and extent of the outbreak as unprecedented[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-august-2014/en/]. To date, at least 2,288 people in the region have died, and some 4,269 confirmed or probable cases have been reported[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/132834/1/roadmapupdate8sept14_eng.pdf?ua=1]. But the global response has been underwhelming; the aid group Doctors Without Borders has characterized international efforts to tackle the crisis as “dangerously inadequate.”

Liberia has been hardest hit by the epidemic. So far the country has counted 1,224 likely Ebola deaths, of which 508 have been confirmed by laboratory testing. Most of its hospitals have either closed or are barely functioning. In Bong County, in the north, the two largest hospitals have been shuttered, leaving over 330,000 people without health care. As foreign staff depart, borders close and the last planes leave, it seems that the world intends to cut us off and allow us to die.

Though the risks to the West posed by Ebola are minimal, Western media have fanned irrational fears, fueling panic about the spread of the virus to Europe and North America rather than calling for international assistance to combat the crisis in West Africa. The Western press blames superstition, myths and ignorance for the virus’s spread through the region — not the fact that West African facilities are inadequate and overwhelmed; government finances are already stretched to capacity; there is widespread corruption and poor coordination among government agencies; and the international response has been pitiful.

Liberia, which emerged from its 14-year civil war in 2003, simply does not have the infrastructure to manage the Ebola crisis. It should not be expected to handle the worst outbreak of the world’s deadliest virus on its own. The international community must act now to stop the situation from spiraling further out of control.

Liberia began rebuilding its health system following the end of the war; a reconstruction process that was nowhere near complete when the virus struck. Combating Ebola requires significant medical expertise and manpower, expensive equipment for real-time testing, and treatment centers. Liberia, which lacks enough personnel to transport victims to the facilities that do exist, is far from being able to provide these state-of-the-art resources.

One 120-bed isolation unit, opened in August in Monrovia, the capital, by Doctors Without Borders, reached capacity in its first week. Many families have been forced to care for their loved ones at home, as they are either unable to find ambulances to transport them to treatment centers, or turned away upon arrival due to lack of space. This has only accelerated the spread of the virus. According to Red Cross representatives in Liberia, the crematorium in Monrovia is unable to keep up with the number of dead bodies it receives, and has had to turn away the highly contagious corpses of victims.

The Liberian legislature’s health committee concedes that the government’s Ebola Task Force cannot manage the prevention and treatment of suspected and confirmed cases of the virus, and has stressed the need for international agencies to take over coordination of the Ebola response. Doctors Without Borders, too, has concluded that Liberia’s health system can’t cope. The country urgently needs properly equipped and fully staffed treatment centers in its largest cities and Ebola hotspots.

The W.H.O., in an assessment[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/8-september-2014/en/] released this week, found that in Montserrado county, which includes the capital, 1,000 beds are needed to treat infected Ebola patients; only 240 are currently available. There is also an urgent need for medical expertise and human resources, including infectious disease experts and disaster relief specialists, to implement coordinated national and regional responses.

But the problems facing the country go beyond the virus itself: Liberia must now also manage an array of secondary crises that have metastasized in the wake of the Ebola outbreak. As medical facilities close due to fears of contamination, many people have become ill or have died from easily preventable and treatable diseases like malaria and diarrhea. The country imports at least half of its staple consumables; the suspension of many international flights to Liberia has only increased food insecurity. With prices rising and basic provisions dwindling fast, an uptick in refugees trying to escape across borders is inevitable.

The Ebola outbreak is an international crisis and demands an international response before the entire region collapses into chaos. Absent massive international medical aid, Liberia could see tens of thousands of deaths in the coming months. And the spread of the virus to neighboring Ivory Coast, Ghana and other countries in the region could trigger an even larger humanitarian crisis.

How many more families must be wiped out, how many more Liberians must die before world leaders appreciate the severity of the situation, and act?

Ebola Outpaces Global Response, W.H.O. Says

GENEVA — A month after declaring the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a global health emergency, the World Health Organization warned on Friday that the disease is still outpacing the international response to contain it.

“The Ebola outbreak that is ravaging parts of West Africa is the largest, most severe and most complex in the nearly four-decade history of this disease,” Margaret Chan, the health organization’s director general, said at a news conference. “The number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to treat them.”

So far, 4,784 Ebola cases have been reported and more than 2,400 people have died in the outbreak, which is concentrated in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Ms. Chan said on Friday, citing the latest data available. But she made clear the figures were “an underestimate.”

A surge of 400 new cases in Liberia in the past week, double the number of new cases in the preceding week, was “a particular cause for concern,” the health organization said. Sierra Leone reported 200 new cases in the past week and a high rate of transmission in the capital, Freetown, the W.H.O. said. Nearly half the total number of infections in West Africa and just over half the deaths occurred in the last 21 days, it said.

Releasing a road map to guide the international response to the crisis two weeks ago, the health organization said some 20,000 people could ultimately be affected, but Ms. Chan said Friday that the estimate could change as the epidemic evolves.

The outbreak has already stricken more people than all other outbreaks of the disease combined, Sarah Crowe, a staff member for the United Nations children’s fund, Unicef, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.

Ms. Chan’s comments came at a joint news conference with Cuba’s public health minister, Roberto Morales Ojeda, to announce that Cuba would send 165 doctors and nurses to Sierra Leone, the biggest commitment of personnel to the health crisis so far by any country, Ms. Chan said.

The new team, now receiving specialist training in Cuba, will deploy in the first week of October and will stay six months, the health organization said in a statement.

“I’m quite positive more support will be forthcoming,” Ms. Chan said, noting assistance offered by Britain, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union, France, Uganda and the United States.

The World Health Organization has said it will earmark $100 million to fight the outbreak. Other commitments include $200 million from the World Bank, $181 million from the European Union, $75 million from the United States and $50 million from the Gates Foundation[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/health/gates-foundation-pledges-50-million-to-fight-ebola.html].

Among other aid commitments, the United States said this week that it would send a 25-bed military field hospital to Monrovia to treat health care workers infected by the virus, and Britain has promised to provide a 62-bed unit for Sierra Leone.

But despite the efforts to scale up the response, World Health Organization data makes clear that the resources available to date are a small fraction of what is needed. In Liberia, which accounts for roughly half the number of cases and more than half the number of deaths reported so far, not a single hospital bed is available to receive people infected, Ms. Chan said.

Liberia has a total of 314 beds in centers for treating Ebola patients, but Monrovia alone needs another 760 beds, the W.H.O. said this week.

“The thing we need most of all is people, health care workers,” Ms. Chan said, citing the urgency of providing pay and hazard allowances to get national staff in the affected countries back to work.

Already fragile health services in countries that rank among the world’s poorest have been weakened by the effect of the Ebola epidemic on medical staff, who have lacked sufficient supplies of the materials and equipment needed to protect themselves.

In Sierra Leone, where health care workers have died in disproportionate numbers since the epidemic began, officials said on Friday that a fourth doctor, Olivette Buck, had become infected with the virus and that the three other doctors to contract the disease had died.

The authorities in Sierra Leone were urgently attempting on Friday to evacuate Dr. Buck for treatment abroad, saying the loss of another prominent doctor would be disastrous for the country’s already battered morale.

In Liberia, where 153 health workers have become infected and 79 have died, Unicef said it had delivered nearly 248 metric tons of personal protection equipment, hygiene kits and the chlorine needed for routine hand washing, but it reinforced the warning that the international efforts still fell far short of what was needed.

“We don’t have enough partners,” Ms. Crowe said in her telephone briefing. “Many Liberians say they feel abandoned.”

“Ebola has turned survivors into human booby traps, unexploded ordnance — touch and you die,” Ms. Crowe said in an article published by the BBC[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29147797]. “Ebola psychosis is paralyzing.”

“It’s quite surreal,” she added in her briefing. "Everywhere you go there’s a sense of this virus taking over.”

The outbreak is deeply disturbing for children who “are seeing family members and relatives taken away by people in astronaut suits,” Ms. Crowe said. They live in a “twilight zone” where normal play with their peers is a risk. “It’s almost as if they have to unwire their normal human ways,” she said.

Aid agencies are also concerned that the impact of the epidemic is collapsing the ability of health services to address other medical needs. Unicef said children were dying from measles because they had not been vaccinated, and pregnant women had few places where they could safely deliver children.

Emerging from years of brutal conflict, Liberia had achieved the fastest rate of decline in child mortality in Africa, Sheldon Yett, Unicef’s representative in Liberia, said in a statement. “Now Ebola is threatening to wipe out all those hard-earned gains for children and for Liberia,” he said.

Adam Nossiter contributed reporting from Dakar, Senegal.

U.S. Scientists See Long Fight Against Ebola

The deadly Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak sweeping across three countries in West Africa is likely to last 12 to 18 months more, much longer than anticipated, and could infect hundreds of thousands of people before it is brought under control, say scientists mapping its spread for the federal government.

“We hope we’re wrong,” said Bryan Lewis, an epidemiologist at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech.

Both the time the model says it will take to control the epidemic and the number of cases it forecasts far exceed estimates by the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org], which said last month that it hoped to control the outbreak within nine months and predicted 20,000 total cases by that time. The organization is sticking by its estimates, a W.H.O. spokesman said Friday.

But researchers at various universities say that at the virus’s present rate of growth, there could easily be close to 20,000 cases in one month, not in nine. Some of the United States’ leading epidemiologists, with long experience in tracking diseases such as influenza, have been creating computer models of the Ebola epidemic at the request of the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org] declined to comment on the projections. A spokesman, Tom Skinner, said the agency was doing its own modeling and hoped to publish the results soon. But the C.D.C. director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, has warned repeatedly that the epidemic is worsening, and on Sept. 2 described it as “spiraling out of control.”

While previous outbreaks have been largely confined to rural areas, the current epidemic, the largest ever, has reached densely populated, impoverished cities — including Monrovia, the capital of Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] — gravely complicating efforts to control the spread of the disease. Alessandro Vespignani, a professor of computational sciences at Northeastern University who has been involved in the computer modeling of Ebola’s spread, said that if the case count reaches hundreds of thousands, “there will be little we can do.”

What worries public health officials most is that the epidemic has begun to grow exponentially in Liberia. In the most recent week reported, Liberia had nearly 400 new cases, almost double the number reported the week before. Another grave concern, the W.H.O. said, is “evidence of substantial underreporting of cases and deaths.” The organization reported on Friday that the number of Ebola cases as of Sept. 7 was 4,366, including 2,218 deaths.

“There has been no indication of any downturn in the epidemic in the three countries that have widespread and intense transmission,” it said, referring to Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Liberia and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

The scientists who produced the models cautioned that their dire predictions were based on the virus’s current uncontrolled spread and said the picture could improve if public health efforts started to work. Because conditions could change, for better or for worse, the researchers also warned that their forecasts became shakier the farther into the future they went.

Dr. Lewis, the Virginia Tech epidemiologist, said that a group of scientists collaborating on Ebola modeling as part of an N.I.H.-sponsored project called Midas, short for Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study[http://www.nigms.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/research/specificareas/MIDAS/Pages/default.aspx], had come to a consensus on the projected 12- to 18-month duration and very high case count.

Another Midas participant, Jeffrey L. Shaman, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, agreed.

“Ebola has a simple trajectory because it’s growing exponentially,” Dr. Shaman said.

Lone Simonsen, a research professor of global health at George Washington University who was not involved in the modeling, said the W.H.O. estimates seemed conservative and the higher projections more reasonable.

“The final death toll may be far higher than any of those estimates unless an effective vaccine or therapy becomes available on a large scale or many more hospital beds are supplied,” she said in an email.

Dr. Vespignani said that the W.H.O. figures would be reasonable if there were an effective campaign to stop the epidemic now, but that there is not.

The modeling estimates are based on the observed growth rate of cases and on factors like how many people each patient infects. The researchers use the past data to make projections. They can test their methods by, for instance, taking the figures from June, plugging them into the model to predict the number of cases in July, and then comparing the results with what actually happened in July.

Dr. Shaman’s research team created a model[http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu/ebola.html] that estimated the number of cases through Oct. 12, with different predictions based on whether control of the epidemic stays about the same, improves or gets worse. If control stays the same, according to the model, the case count by Oct. 12 will be 18,406. If control improves, it will be 7,861. If control worsens, it will soar to 54,895.

Before this epidemic, the largest Ebola outbreak[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/resources/outbreak-table.html] was in Uganda from 2000 to 2001, and it involved only 425 cases. Scientists say the current epidemic surged out of control because it began near the borders of three countries where people traveled a lot, and they carried the disease to densely populated city slums. In addition, the weak health systems in these poor countries were not equipped to handle the disease, and much of the international response has been slow and disorganized.

But questions have also been raised about whether there could be something different about this strain of Ebola that makes it more contagious than previous ones.

Researchers are doubtful, but Thomas W. Geisbert, an Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, said it was important to keep an open mind about the possibility. During vaccine tests expected to start next month in monkeys, he said, he and his colleagues will monitor infected animals to see if they develop unusually high virus levels early in the disease that might amplify its infectiousness.

Some scientists have also suggested that as the outbreak continues and the virus spreads from person to person, it will have more opportunities to mutate and perhaps become even more dangerous or contagious. But Stuart T. Nichol, chief of the C.D.C.’s Viral Special Pathogens Branch, said that so far, researchers monitoring the mutations had seen no such changes.

The Sluggish Fight Against Ebola

Efforts by the United States, other nations and international organizations to curb the widening epidemic of Ebola in West Africa are falling short — too little help arriving too late. The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 20,000 people could be infected over the course of the outbreak. President Obama has called the epidemic a “national security priority” and pledged to use American military assets to help the beleaguered countries, primarily Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, to bring the epidemic under control. The Agency for International Development and the Defense Department are already rushing personnel and supplies to the scene.

The question is whether all the efforts are moving fast enough to keep up with increasing rates of infections and deaths. The head of the W.H.O. stressed again on Friday that the answer is clearly no: New cases are outpacing the capacity to treat them. A day earlier, Joanne Liu, international president of Doctors Without Borders, the humanitarian group that has provided most of the medical care in Liberia, reiterated that new isolation and treatment facilities must be built quickly and on a large scale, in days, not weeks or months. A 25-bed unit pledged by the Pentagon for Liberia, she noted, would treat only health care workers, not the broader population; it may not be delivered for another month. A 62-bed unit that will be built by the British in Sierra Leone will be operational within eight weeks.

Because most Ebola victims remain at home, it is critical to supply families with hygiene kits, containing disinfectants, gloves and other materials that properly instructed households can use to prevent spread of the virus among family members and from them to others. About 400,000 people live in highly infected areas of Liberia, according to an Agency for International Development official, but the United States will deliver only 50,000 kits in about a month, a number that will be augmented by other donors but will still fall short of the need.

The United States can do better than this. Even with its increased responsibilities in the Middle East, the Pentagon surely has enough logistical and technical resources to greatly augment aid to the Ebola-stricken countries. The United States offered prompt and vigorous support after an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010 and a tsunami struck Indonesia in 2004. It needs to do the same now.

The main reason to mount an all-out response is humanitarian — to save impoverished people from agonizing illness and death, and fragile societies and economies from destruction. The virus poses little threat to the United States or other countries with advanced health care systems that can quickly identify and isolate infected patients. The virus is not transmitted through the air from one person to another but requires direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, as can happen while bathing someone infected, cleaning up vomit or burying one who has died.

Some experts remain concerned that the virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warns that as the epidemic “continues to spiral out of control,” the risk will rise that a mutation might make it more transmissible. And while many experts think the risk of a mutation is small, Mr. Obama echoed these concerns when he said in a recent interview with “Meet the Press” that an easily transmissible virus could be “a serious danger to the United States.” In any case, health officials will need to be vigilant in monitoring how this virus evolves as the caseload expands.

A separate worry is that infected West Africans might carry the virus to populous cities in other African nations or even to distant megacities in the developing world where the health care systems may not be primed to spot and control an incipient epidemic. That is another good reason to stop this epidemic quickly.

This article contains no useful information. Zero. Nada. Nothing. If usefulness is your criterion for reading, thank you very much for your time and goodbye, we have nothing more to say. The truth is that I am bored to tears by usefulness. I am bored, more precisely, of pretending usefulness is the thing that really matters.

I mostly write about wildlife. So here is how it typically happens for me: A study comes out indicating that species x, y and z are in imminent danger of extinction, or that some major bioregion of the planet is being sucked down into the abyss. And it’s my job to convince people that they should care, even as they are racing to catch the 7:10 train, or wondering if they’ll be able to pay this month’s (or last month’s) rent.

My usual strategy is to trot out a list of ways even the most obscure species can prove unexpectedly, yes, useful. The first effective treatment that turned H.I.V. from a death sentence into a manageable condition? Inspired by the biochemistry of a nondescript Caribbean sponge[http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/sea-sponge-hiv-medicine]. The ACE inhibitors that are currently among our most effective treatments for cardiovascular disease (and which have lately been proposed as a treatment for Ebola)? Developed by studying the venom of the fer-de-lance, a deadly snake found from Mexico to northern South America. The new medical bandage that’s gentle enough for the delicate skin of newborns and the elderly? Modeled on the silk of spider webs[http://sites.psu.edu/eseminar/2014/03/10/the-medical-field-using-spider-silk-now/].

Every time I begin this line of argument, though, I get the queasy feeling that I am perpetuating a fallacy. It’s not that I’m telling lies; these examples are entirely real. But given, for instance, that three-quarters of our farm crops depend on insect pollinators, or that more than 2.6 billion people rely directly on seafood for protein, it seems a little obvious to be reminding people that wildlife can be useful, or, more to the point, that human survival depends on wildlife. Without saying so out loud, the argument also implies that animals matter only because they benefit humans, or because just possibly, at some unknowable point in the future, they might benefit humans.

You don’t have to look too far to see how silly this can get. In truth, I don’t have to look at all, because university press offices fill my inbox with examples every day: The Harvard scientists who hope their study of cuttlefish skin[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140128202045.htm] will “inspire improved protective camouflage for soldiers on the battlefield.” The Berkeley team that thinks studying the genetics of blubber-eating polar bears[http://strangebehaviors.wordpress.com/2014/05/08/unlocking-the-secrets-of-the-polar-bears-amazing-evolution/] could help us learn to live with our bacon-wrapped, wide-load lifestyle. And the wonderful folks at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, who believe “Squid sucker ring teeth material could aid reconstructive surgery, serve as eco-packaging[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140702111007.htm].” (And you thought they were good only for calamari.)

I don’t entirely blame the scientists. Their research often depends on taxpayer funding, and their dreams are haunted by the ghost of United States Senator William Proxmire’s Golden Fleece Award[http://www.the-scientist.com.proxy.bc.edu/?articles.view/articleNo/10030/title/What-Proxmire-s-Golden-fleece-Did-For--And-To--Science/]. That award garnered headlines by ridiculing outlandish-seeming items in the federal budget, and animal behavior studies were a juicy target. So now people doing that kind of research all feel obliged to imply that they are two steps away from a cure for the common cold. No basic research here, Senator, sir, no idle curiosity. Useful “R” Us. (They also delight in pointing out that one of Mr. Proxmire’s targets — a $250,000 investigation into the sex life of the screwworm fly — has yielded $20 billion in benefits to American cattle farmers by enabling control of a major insect pest.)

Improbably, wildlife conservationists now also often hear the call of the useful. Along with a large contingent of eco-finance bureaucrats, they try to save threatened habitats by reminding nearby communities of all the benefits they derive from keeping these habitats intact. Forests, meadows and marshes prevent floods, supply clean water, provide habitat for species that pollinate crops, put oxygen into the atmosphere and take carbon out, and otherwise make themselves useful. In some cases, conservation groups or other interested parties actually put down cash for these ecosystem services — paying countries, for instance, to maintain forests as a form of carbon sequestration. The argument, in essence, is that we can persuade people to save nature by making it possible for them to sell it. They can take nature to the bank, or at least to the local grocery. They can monetize it. (The new revised version of Genesis now says, “God made the wild animals according to their kinds, and he said, ‘Let them be fungible.’ ”)

I understand the logic, or at least the desperation, that drives conservationists to this horrible idea. It may seem like the only way to keep what’s left of the natural world from being plowed under by unstoppable human expansion and by our insatiable appetite for what appears to be useful. But usefulness is precisely the argument other people put forward to justify destroying or displacing wildlife, and they generally bring a larger and more persuasive kind of green to the argument. Nothing you can say about 100 acres in the New Jersey Meadowlands will ever add up for a politician who thinks a new shopping mall will mean more jobs for local voters (and contributions to his campaign war chest). Nothing you can say about the value of rhinos for ecotourism in South Africa will ever matter to a wildlife trafficker who can sell their horns for $30,000 a pound in Vietnam.

Finally, there is the unavoidable problem that most wildlife species — honey badgers, blobfish, blue-footed boobies, red-tailed hawks, monarch butterflies, hellbenders — are always going to be “useless,” or occasionally annoying, from a human perspective. And even when they do turn out, by some quirk, to be useful, that’s typically incidental to what makes them interesting. Cuttlefish do not fascinate because their skin may suggest new forms of military camouflage, but because of the fantastic light shows that sometimes play across their flanks. Spider web silk doesn’t intrigue because somebody can turn it into bandages, but because of the astonishing things spiders can do with it — stringing a line across a stream and running trotlines down the surface to catch water striders, for instance, or (in the case of the species named mastophora dizzydeani) flinging a ball of silk on a thread like a spitball to snag moths out of the air.

Wildlife is and should be useless in the same way art, music, poetry and even sports are useless. They are useless in the sense that they do nothing more than raise our spirits, make us laugh or cry, frighten, disturb and delight us. They connect us not just to what’s weird, different, other, but to a world where we humans do not matter nearly as much as we like to think.

And that should be enough.

Liberian President Pleads With Obama for Assistance in Combating Ebola

WASHINGTON — The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, has implored President Obama for help in managing her country’s rapidly expanding Ebola crisis and has warned that without American assistance the disease could send Liberia into the civil chaos that enveloped the country for two decades.

In a letter on Tuesday to Mr. Obama, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf wrote that “I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us.” She requested 1,500 additional beds in new hospitals across the country and urged that the United States military set up and run a 100-bed Ebola hospital in the besieged capital, Monrovia.

Infectious-disease experts have sharply criticized as inadequate the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola crisis, particularly in Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves. Global agencies like the World Health Organization and the United Nations have also come under criticism[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/world/africa/cuts-at-who-hurt-response-to-ebola-crisis.html] for responding too slowly to the Ebola outbreak.

The epidemic has taken an estimated 2,218 lives out of 4,366 cases in West Africa. So far more than 1,000 people have died of the virus in Liberia.

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf’s request was made several days after Mr. Obama, in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” called the disease a national security priority and said the United States must lead the international effort in containing the spread of Ebola in Africa.

Shortly afterward, his administration announced that it would use the American military to set up a 25-bed health facility in Liberia to treat health care workers, a gesture that many infectious disease specialists working in West Africa derided as paltry, particularly in comparison with the Pentagon’s large-scale response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.

“When President Obama announced that the U.S. government was going to greatly increase its help, I was ecstatic,” said Dr. Timothy Flanigan, an infectious-disease specialist with Brown University, in an interview from Monrovia, where he has been working for the past month. “The 25-bed hospital that’s being provided is hardly a drop in the bucket for the people of Liberia.”

Obama administration officials said Friday that the president would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta next Tuesday, when he would announce a more aggressive American response to the disease. The military’s 25-bed hospital, a senior administration official said, “is the floor in terms of D.O.D.'s response, not the ceiling,” referring to the Department of Defense. “You’ll see more of that on Tuesday.”

On Monday, the W.H.O. issued a dire Ebola warning for Liberia, saying that the number of new Ebola cases was increasing exponentially and that all new treatment facilities were overwhelmed, “pointing to a large but previously invisible caseload.”

The organization’s data indicated a 68 percent spike in Ebola cases in Liberia over the past three weeks. The description of the crisis in Liberia, which along with Sierra Leone and Guinea is at the center of the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded, suggested an even more chaotic situation than had been thought.

The global consulting firm Oxford Analytica said this week that of the three West African countries at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, Liberia is in the most dire straits because of the high concentration of infected people in Monrovia.

In an echo of the colonialism that characterized West Africa in the 19th century, Britain has focused its assistance efforts on its former colony Sierra Leone, as British troops head there to build and staff a 63-bed facility near the capital, Freetown. France has sent medical experts to its former colony Guinea.

That leaves Liberia, with its historic ties to America’s antebellum era, in the United States’ hands. In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf said a perception by other countries that the United States would take care of Liberia had hurt the country so far in the Ebola fight. She said a health expert with the French group Doctors Without Borders told her recently: “We’re French. You’ve got America behind you; why should we have to do this for you?”

But the government of Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace laureate, had also come under criticism for its response to the Ebola crisis, in particular a quarantine that she placed on a densely populated Monrovia neighborhood that caused deadly riots. That quarantine was lifted after 10 days.

In her letter to Mr. Obama, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf asked that the Pentagon set up and operate “at least one” Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, an echo of several infectious-disease specialists who say that only the American military has the capacity and experience working with viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola that demand a quick response.

Many health experts say that the military brings much-needed organization and discipline to the work at Ebola treatment centers, including ensuring that health workers adhere to strict safety protocols. Because the disease, transmitted by bodily fluids, is contagious when patients are sick, or after they have died, health care workers must wear gloves, masks and full-body protective gear before touching patients and must go through several steps of chlorination after treating patients.

“It has been three months since I felt the warmth of bare skin that was not mine,” Dr. Kanagasabi Udhayashankara, pediatric resident at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, wrote in an email. “Two months since I have been less than two feet of another human without P.P.E,” or personal protective equipment. Health workers in Liberia, Dr. Knight said, “move with an invisible force field of three feet between us and the nearest human.”

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday that “since the outbreak began in March, the whole government has been engaged in fighting this.” He added that the Defense Department is “actively working to look at capabilities that we might be able to provide that would be of use.”

Correction: September 17, 2014, Wednesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about a letter to President Obama from the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, in which she pleaded for American help in her country’s Ebola crisis misidentified the doctor who described in an email what it is like to work with Ebola patients. It was Dr. Kanagasabi Udhayashankara, a pediatric resident at JFK Hospital in Monrovia — not Dr. David Knight, an American physician — who wrote, “It has been three months since I felt the warmth of bare skin that was not mine.”

I SLIPPED away from work on a recent Monday to take my two nieces to the Garry Winogrand photography exhibition[http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2014/garry-winogrand] at the Metropolitan Museum of Art[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/metropolitan_museum_of_art/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. I doubt there’s a better way to play hooky in New York right now.

When you go — not if, but when (and soon, by the way; the show closes Sept. 21) — I suggest you bring a thesaurus. Because it wasn’t long before we found words failing us. An image of an acrobat caught midleap on a Manhattan street, for instance, struck the three of us as the epitome of “amazing.” So did another photo. Then another. Upon seeing the first few dozen of the more than 175 prints on view we pledged that we would not use that word to describe every single photo. Beautiful, incredible, joyful, strange, very sad — we made it as far as the second room before we were back to the A’s.

“It is just so... amazing,” said Katy, who’s 18 and an aspiring photographer, as if she’d been rendered helpless by yet another example of the Bronx-born artist’s particular genius for street photography. I nodded in sympathy. In a world plagued by intractable problems — police shootings, Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] spreading, spiraling civil wars, planes falling from the sky — lacking sufficient synonyms for a work of art seemed a good one to have.

When we reached the last room, I asked Katy which picture was her favorite. She led me back to the one that had stumped her in the synonym department. Her sister, Emily, who’s 14 and had been off wandering through the Met’s collection of European paintings, then showed me her favorite piece in the museum: a Monet water lily painting (the first she’d ever seen) from 1919.

This is when I let each girl in on a secret: It can be yours. No different from falling in love with a song, one may fall in love with a work of art and claim it as one’s own. Ownership does not come free. One must spend time with it; visit at different times of the day or evening; and bring to it one’s full attention. The investment will be repaid as one discovers something new with each viewing — say, a detail in the background, a person nearly cropped from the picture frame, or a tiny patch of canvas left unpainted, deliberately so, one may assume, as if to remind you not to take all the painted parts for granted.

This is true not just for New Yorkers but for anyone anywhere with art to be visited — art being a relative term, in my definition. Your Monet may, in fact, be an unpolished gemstone or mineral element. Natural history museums are filled with beauties fairly begging to be adopted. Stay alert. Next time a tattered Egyptian mummy speaks to you across the ages, don’t walk away. Stay a while. Spend some time with it. Give it a proper name: Yours.

But don’t be hasty. You must be sure you are besotted. When it happens, you will know. A couple of years back, I spent much of Memorial Day at the Museum of Modern Art with my friend Oliver, a self-described philistine when it comes to art. He struggled to see the value in the work of the performance artist Marina Abramovic as she sat gazing into the eyes of museum visitors. And the enormous, bright red Barnett Newman painting, “Vir Heroicus Sublimis,” got him all worked up, railing against the pretensions of abstract expressionism.

This was my cue to lead Oliver to another gallery on another floor and steer him toward an early, rose-tinted Picasso. He smiled a smile that even Edvard Munch might have wanted to paint. And he stayed and stayed and stayed, a self-appointed sentinel to Picasso’s “Boy Leading a Horse.”

It’s yours, I said. Congratulations.

I have been slowly adding to my own collection since moving to New York. I acquired a Francis Bacon nude that I fell hard for at the artist’s retrospective at the Met five years ago. The piece was on loan from a European museum, and the fact that I might never see it again made it all the more irresistible. My naked Bacon and I are forever embroiled in a long-distance romance.

Usually, I gravitate toward works that are overlooked, tucked back in a far corner, or that are a museum’s “John Doe” — Artist Unknown. I am just as likely to make a medieval suit of armor mine as I am an obscure Diane Arbus. I also push myself to go into galleries that I would not normally think about entering. Often, this is a source of my best finds. I am strongly anti-museum map and militantly in favor of getting lost. While there’s nothing wrong with navigating straight to the old masters, I believe it’s far nicer to lose your way in a labyrinth of galleries and suddenly find yourself, as I did one Saturday evening, face to face with an Odilon Redon bouquet looking so fresh I could have sworn the paint was still wet.

Perhaps the best part about possessing art in this way is that what’s mine can be yours, and vice versa. In fact, I would not be surprised if half of New York City has also put dibs on the Monet that Emily chose. This made it no less hers.

I brought her in closer to her new acquisition: “Emily, meet your Monet. Monet, Emily.”

Words did not fail her: “Hello, beautiful,” she whispered.

Back to the Slums of His Youth, to Defuse the Ebola Time Bomb

MONROVIA, Liberia — The girl in the pink shirt lay motionless on a sidewalk, flat on her stomach, an orange drink next to her, unfinished. People gathered on the other side of the street, careful to keep their distance.

Dr. Mosoka Fallah waded in. Details about the girl spilled out of the crowd in a dizzying torrent, gaining urgency with the siren of an approaching ambulance. The girl’s mother had died, almost certainly of Ebola. So had three other relatives. The girl herself was sick. The girl’s aunt, unable to get help, had left her on the sidewalk in despair. Other family members may have been infected. Still others had fled across this city.

Dr. Fallah, 44, calmly instructed leaders of the neighborhood — known as Capitol Hill, previously untouched by Ebola — how to deal with the family and protect their community. He promised to return later that day, and send more help in the morning. His words quelled the crowd, for the moment.

“This is a horrific case,” he said as he walked away. “It could be the start of a big one right here. It’s a ticking time bomb.”

Months into the Ebola outbreak, Liberia remains desperately short on everything needed to halt the rise in deaths and infections — burial teams for the dead, ambulances for the sick, treatment centers for patients, gloves for doctors and nurses. But it is perhaps shortest on something intangible: the trust needed to stop the disease from spreading.

Dr. Fallah, an epidemiologist and immunologist who grew up in Monrovia’s poorest neighborhoods before studying at Harvard, has been crisscrossing the capital in a race to repair that rift. Neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, shack by shack, he is battling the disease across this crowded capital, seeking the cooperation of residents who are deeply distrustful of the government and its faltering response to the deadliest Ebola epidemic ever recorded[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/africa/sierra-leone-declares-health-emergency-over-ebola.html].

“If people don’t trust you, they can hide a body, and you’ll never know,” Dr. Fallah said. “And Ebola will keep spreading. They’ve got to trust you, but we don’t have the luxury of time.”

With his experience straddling vastly different worlds, Dr. Fallah acts as a rare bridge: between community leaders and the Health Ministry, where he is an unpaid adviser; between the government and international organizations, which have the money to back his efforts.

But the scale of the task is daunting. He is trying to beat Ebola in a city of 1.5 million people where the disease is expanding exponentially[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/ebola/8-september-2014/en/], where entire families search in vain for medical care, and where the main hospital is dangerously overwhelmed, plagued by electrical fires, floods and the deaths of health workers infected with the disease.

Dr. Fallah has slowly begun winning over the city’s toughest neighborhood, West Point, the seaside slum where he spent two years of his childhood. Deadly clashes between angry residents and soldiers erupted recently after Liberia’s government placed the entire neighborhood under quarantine[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/in-liberias-capital-an-ebola-outbreak-like-no-other.html]. The 10-day cordon, enforced by the army and the police, merely deepened the mistrust of the government in the city’s slums, the very neighborhoods most affected by Ebola.

Dr. Fallah plunged into West Point, deciding with community leaders to battle Ebola by resurrecting a survival mechanism used during Liberia’s catastrophic 14-year civil war.

They divided West Point into zones, much as was done during the war to ensure that everybody received food and other vital supplies. Surveillance teams of volunteers overseen by Dr. Fallah now scour West Point, searching for information about a dead or sick person, hoping to identify victims and remove the bodies before the disease can be passed on.

His teams visit every morning, tracing the circle of people around Ebola victims to see who else develops fevers or starts vomiting. This painstaking process, repeated until an outbreak is eventually contained, has extinguished past Ebola outbreaks in rural Africa — and may be the only hope of stopping it now.

“Dr. Fallah has taken the situation in West Point as if he were living here,” said Kenneth Martu, a political organizer in West Point. “We can say openly: Had he not been here, things would have gotten far worse.”

Two days after the government lifted the quarantine in West Point, the Health Ministry asked Dr. Fallah to start using the civil war-era zone system in two other Ebola-stricken neighborhoods, perhaps another signal of the government’s turn away from force in its campaign against Ebola.

“We feel that using the communities to provide the leadership for us to do the Ebola work is more effective,” said Dr. Bernice Dahn, a deputy health minister.

Dr. Fallah’s team of contact tracers pushed deep into West Point one morning, into a labyrinth of hovels and alleys that became ever narrower. A group of young men appeared abruptly, blocking the only exit, their intention clear. They went away, with a $10 bill.

“I usually carry small bills,” Dr. Fallah said. “But I forgot to break this bill this morning.”

Monrovia is the first city to face the full onslaught of Ebola. Tracing the contacts of Ebola victims has never been attempted on this scale, yet Dr. Fallah’s team has only five vehicles to monitor hundreds of thousands of people. One vehicle was in the shop for five days, so Dr. Fallah used his own.

In West Point, a slum of up to 120,000 people, Dr. Fallah deployed 15 volunteers to track 150 people who may have been exposed to the virus. The tracers fan out early in the morning to catch the people at home — they are supposed to stay indoors, but many do not — and to minimize contact with an often hostile community.

“On the field, as we are going, they are cursing us, passing around, talking plenty,” said Marie Harding, a tracing supervisor.

At one house — a large one by West Point standards, with eight rooms and, even more unusual, a restroom — about 20 people came to the entrance, emphatically stating that everything was fine. A man named Junior, who rented a room, had died in late August, apparently of Ebola, and a burial team had come to pick up his body three days later.

David Yeah, 75, the home’s owner, said that he had locked the room. Sprayers had come to decontaminate it; they had thrown the dead man’s clothes into the sea. The house’s other occupants had avoided the man before his death, bringing him neither food nor water, he insisted.

But after a few minutes, Mr. Yeah and his tenants acknowledged that a woman — possibly a relative — had been nursing the man and mixing with the other occupants. Then she fled after his death.

Dr. Fallah had seen this many times before. The government’s failure to provide basic services keeps undermining the trust he is trying to build. Burial teams take days to pick up the dead; ambulances — there are only about a half-dozen in the capital — respond to only a fraction of emergency calls. Those lucky enough to be transported to a treatment center are often turned back, taken home because of a shortage of beds, or left pleading at the gate for admission.

“The government has to keep its part of the bargain,” Dr. Fallah said, adding, “The community can do one thing for us. They can limit the spread. But they must see that their labor is leading to some fruit.”

The government’s lifting of the quarantine after 10 days also gave West Point a conflicting message. Many rejoiced at the move but interpreted it as proof that there was no Ebola in their community.

On the Sunday after the quarantine was lifted, churchgoers celebrated what many saw as West Point’s deliverance from Ebola. Inside the Dominion Life Church, next to an Ebola holding center, the faithful danced and — disregarding awareness campaigns to avoid touching and risk exchanging body fluids — shook hands and grasped one another’s arms with fervor.

“No, no, no, no,” the Rev. William Morlu, the church’s senior pastor, said when asked whether Ebola was present in West Point.

At the Church of Pentecost, Emmanuel Oben, 45, the chairman of a local P.T.A., said that the government was “not sincere.” But Dr. Fallah, whom he had met twice, was “a man that everybody wants to work with,” he said.

“People trust him,” he said. “He was once like us.”

When Dr. Fallah was 10 years old, his father lost his job as a driver for an American mining company, so the family moved to Monrovia. The family lived in West Point for two years and then moved to a squatter’s area called Chicken Soup Factory, where his parents eventually built a house. His mother still lives in it.

During Liberia’s civil war, he spent 11 years completing his college studies at the University of Liberia, and worked for Doctors Without Borders. A friend’s support led to graduate studies in the United States, where he earned a doctorate in microbiology and immunology at the University of Kentucky in 2011 and a master’s degree in public health at Harvard in 2012.

A project to open a maternal care clinic in Chicken Soup Factory brought Dr. Fallah back to Liberia after Harvard. The clinic opened in June but was shut down a month later because of the Ebola outbreak.

On an afternoon of heavy rain, Dr. Fallah drove out to two neighborhoods where local residents had begun organizing Ebola awareness campaigns on their own. In the face of the hysteria gripping the capital, they were joining forces and fighting back.

In one area, volunteers like Obediah Daykeay, 22, who had read up on Ebola in an Internet cafe, were instructing neighbors on the use of bleach and water to wash their hands. They had invited Dr. Fallah after hearing him on the radio.

“We are trying our best with the few resources we have,” Mr. Daykeay said. “Nobody else has come here.”

In another neighborhood, a group of youths had raised money to print an eight-page pamphlet on Ebola. Dr. Fallah spoke to them inside a church, urging them to organize monitoring teams.

The youths listened intently, fear visible on many faces, craning forward in their pews toward Dr. Fallah as rain beat noisily on the church’s corrugated roof.

“I’m not saying I know the answer,” Dr. Fallah said later. “I’m struggling like any other person to find the answer — just have a lot of spirit and God. But one thing I’ve realized is that the people in the community, some of them have the answers.”

Going Viral: Twenty years ago, Richard Preston scored a nonfiction hit with his scientific adventure story ''The Hot Zone,'' about an outbreak of Ebola virus among quarantined monkeys in Virginia -- the book spent almost two years on the hardcover and paperback lists before fading away in June 1996. (That was a good time for science journalism. During its run, Preston's book shared space on the list with Oliver Sacks's collection of neurological case studies ''An Anthropologist on Mars'' and Nicholas Negroponte's technology primer ''Being Digital,'' which predicted the end of fax machines and CD-ROMs.) Now, with Ebola back in the news because of its fatal spread through West Africa, readers are returning to ''The Hot Zone.'' The Associated Press reported last month that Anchor Books, the paperback publisher, had printed 70,000 new copies, and the book is currently at No. 17 in its 50th week on the paperback nonfiction list.

''The thing is,'' Preston told CNN early in August, ''Ebola has been pulling surprises on all of us. I don't think anybody really expected that Ebola had the potential to do something like get into the cities and get out of control. But, you know, most of the experts I'm talking to are saying that they are pretty well convinced that, you know, they will be able to get it under control, but there's huge concern about the possibility that Ebola could get into a major city.'' The virus's return is obviously bad news. But it does retroactively absolve ''The Hot Zone'' of a charge Colin Harrison leveled against it in the Book Review a few years after its publication. ''The outbreak in Virginia resulted in exactly zero human cases,'' Harrison noted, complaining about the ''happy frenzy'' of media attention the story had received. ''It was the first time that everyone knew about a disease that nobody had. It was the first time that a virus was famous for being famous.'' Now we know we were right to panic.

The Independents: After spending its first two weeks on the hardcover fiction list at No. 1, Haruki Murakami's latest novel, ''Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,'' slips this week to No. 2, dethroned by Louise Penny's ''The Long Way Home.'' But at press time Murakami's book was still the top-selling new novel at the nation's independent bookstores, according to the best-seller list at IndieBound, the website of the American Booksellers Association. It's followed by Donna Tartt's ''The Goldfinch'' (No. 3 on the Times list) and Anthony Doerr's ''All the Light We Cannot See'' (No. 8 on the Times list). In hardcover nonfiction, the top three sellers at indie bookstores are Diane Muldrow's ''Everything I Need to Know I Learned From a Little Golden Book'' (No. 6 on our advice, how-to and miscellaneous list), Hampton Sides's ''In the Kingdom of Ice'' (No. 5 on our hardcover nonfiction list) and Ben Macintyre's ''A Spy Among Friends'' (No. 14 here).

Ushers at the Brooklyn Academy of Music fought a brief, losing battle against concertgoers surging into the aisle to dance when the Senegalese singer and bandleader Youssou N’Dour[https://fr-fr.facebook.com/pages/Youssou-Ndour/89971228242] performed there on Friday night. All the better: Mr. N’Dour — a superstar across Africa and the French-speaking world since the 1980s, a 2012 presidential candidate[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/world/africa/youssou-ndour-senegal-singer-runs-for-president.html] in Senegal and the winner of the 2013 Polar Music Prize[http://www.polarmusicprize.org/home/] — leads one of Africa’s greatest and most nimble bands, Le Super Étoile. With the audience on its feet, the synergy between performers and listeners only grew.

Mr. N’Dour’s incessantly danceable music rides hurtling four-against-six grooves: from a percussion section crackling with high-speed talking drum, from guitars that can echo the staccato picking of the kora or mesh like a funk band, from keyboards that hint at West African balafon (marimba) or offer sleek contemporary tones. Before the audience got moving, there had already been bursts of frenetic footwork onstage from Le Super Étoile’s dancer, Moussa Sonko.

For audiences in Senegal and elsewhere, Mr. N’Dour can play marathon dance-club sets. In Brooklyn, he geared this performance toward its site: an opera house with a seated audience. The set worked more than a dozen songs into less than two hours, and it featured the part of Mr. N’Dour’s repertory that uses the major chords and terse refrains of Western rock. What the opera house sacrificed in participatory fervor, it partly offset with clear acoustics that revealed every particle of Super Étoile’s syncopation.

The music offers its physical joys with a clear conscience. Mr. N’Dour extends Senegal’s griot tradition of social conscience and praise singing into pop aimed worldwide. In all its intricate momentum, the band only complements Mr. N’Dour’s kindly clarion of a voice, which is equally sweet, lithe and resolute. His songs are exhortations, history lessons and messages; Mr. N’Dour sang in Wolof, Fulani, French and English. His two nights at the Brooklyn Academy of Music were part of the monthlong series there dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Nonesuch Records[http://www.bam.org/programs/2014/nonesuch-records-at-bam], part of the Next wave Festival, and Mr. N’Dour got the audience on its feet and pumping its arms to celebrate the label.

One of the concert’s key moments arrived when Mr. N’Dour introduced “New Africa” — a song, he said, that was not about war or Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but about people determined to create an Africa of hope and possibilities. It was an incantation, not a dance tune; with Mr. N’Dour’s voice sailing over synthesizer chords, it was both mystical and contemporary. But the concert hit its peaks when the music hinted at a more African time frame: with Mr. N’Dour leaving pop refrains behind for swirls of improvisation, with the rhythm section revving up. “Set” was one song that started at a sprint and raced from there. At one point, with a percussionist thundering a solo on djembe (a hand drum), Mr. Sonko, the dancer, leapt over the drummer’s head. “Have a clear mind,” Mr. N’Dour sang in Wolof. “Be pure in your heart.”

The Nonesuch Records festival continues through Sept. 28 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; 718-636-4100, bam.org.

Goodbye, Organization Man

Imagine two cities. In City A, town leaders notice that every few weeks a house catches on fire. So they create a fire department — a group of professionals with prepositioned firefighting equipment and special expertise. In City B, town leaders don’t create a fire department. When there’s a fire, they hurriedly cobble together some people and equipment to fight it.

We are City B. We are particularly slow to build institutions to combat long-running problems.

The most obvious example is the fight against jihadism. We’ve been facing Islamist terror for several decades, now, but every time it erupts — in Lebanon, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and beyond — leaders start from scratch and build some new ad hoc coalition to fight it.

The most egregious example is global health emergencies. Every few years, some significant epidemic strikes, and somebody suggests that we form a Medical Expeditionary Corps, a specialized organization that would help coordinate and execute the global response. Several years ago, then-Senator Bill Frist went so far as to prepare a bill proposing such a force. But, as always, nothing came of it.

The result, right now, is unnecessary deaths from the Ebola virus in Africa. Ebola is a recurring problem, yet the world seems unprepared. The response has been slow and uncoordinated.

The virus’s spread, once linear, is now exponential. As Michael Gerson pointed out in The Washington Post, the normal countermeasures — isolation, contact tracing — are rendered increasingly irrelevant by the rate of increase. Treatment centers open and are immediately filled to twice capacity as people die on the streets outside. An Oxford University forecast warns as many as 15 more countries are vulnerable to outbreaks. The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, warned: “At this rate, we will never break the transmission chain, and the virus will overwhelm us.”

The catastrophe extends beyond the disease. Economies are rocked as flights are canceled and outsiders flee. Ray Chambers, a philanthropist and U.N. special envoy focused on global health, points out the impact on health more broadly.  For example, people in the early stages of malaria show similar symptoms to Ebola and other diseases. Many hesitate to seek treatment fearing they’ll get sent to an Ebola isolation center. So death rates from malaria, pneumonia and other common diseases could rise, as further Ebola cases fail to be diagnosed.

The World Health Organization has recently come out with an action plan but lacks logistical capabilities. President Obama asked for a strategy, but that was two months ago. Aid is scattershot. The Pentagon opened a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia. The U.S. donated five ambulances to Sierra Leone. Coordination and logistical support are just not there.

At root, this is a governance failure. The disease spreads fastest in places where the health care infrastructure is lacking or nonexistent. Liberia, for example, is being overrun while Ivory Coast has put in a series of policies to prevent an outbreak. The few doctors and nurses in the affected places have trouble acquiring the safety basics: gloves and body bags. More than 100, so far, have died fighting the outbreak.

But it’s not just a failure of governance in Africa. It’s a failure of governance around the world. I wonder if we are looking at the results of a cultural shift.

A few generations ago, people grew up in and were comfortable with big organizations — the army, corporations and agencies. They organized huge construction projects in the 1930s, gigantic industrial mobilization during World War II, highway construction and corporate growth during the 1950s. Institutional stewardship, the care and reform of big organizations, was more prestigious.

Now nobody wants to be an Organization Man. We like start-ups, disrupters and rebels. Creativity is honored more than the administrative execution. Post-Internet, many people assume that big problems can be solved by swarms of small, loosely networked nonprofits and social entrepreneurs. Big hierarchical organizations are dinosaurs.

The Ebola crisis is another example that shows that this is misguided. The big, stolid agencies — the health ministries, the infrastructure builders, the procurement agencies — are the bulwarks of the civil and global order. Public and nonprofit management, the stuff that gets derided as “overhead,” really matters. It’s as important to attract talent to health ministries as it is to spend money on specific medicines.

As recent books by Francis Fukuyama and Philip Howard have detailed, this is an era of general institutional decay. New, mobile institutions languish on the drawing broad, while old ones are not reformed and tended. Executives at public agencies are robbed of discretionary power. Their hands are bound by court judgments and regulations.

When the boring tasks of governance are not performed, infrastructures don’t get built. Then, when epidemics strike, people die.

WASHINGTON -- Under pressure to do more to confront the Ebola outbreak sweeping across West Africa, President Obama on Tuesday is to announce an expansion of military and medical resources to combat the spread of the deadly virus, administration officials said.

The president will go beyond the 25-bed portable hospital that Pentagon officials said they would establish in Liberia, one of the three West African countries ravaged by the disease, officials said. Mr. Obama will offer help to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia in the construction of as many as 17 Ebola treatment centers in the region, with about 1,700 treatment beds.

Senior administration officials said Monday night that the Department of Defense would open a joint command operation in Monrovia, Liberia, to coordinate the international effort to combat the disease. The military will also provide engineers to help construct the additional treatment facilities and will send enough people to train up to 500 health care workers a week to deal with the crisis.

Officials said the military expected to send as many as 3,000 people to Africa to take charge of responding to the Ebola outbreak.

''We all recognize that this is such an extraordinary, serious epidemic,'' a senior official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of Mr. Obama's public remarks on Tuesday. The efforts should turn the tide from a high-transmission epidemic that continues to grow every day, other officials said.

The White House plan would increase the number of doctors and other health care workers being sent to West Africa from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other American agencies, officials said.

The American government will also provide 400,000 Ebola home health and treatment kits to Liberia, as well as tens of thousands of kits intended to test whether people have the disease. The Pentagon will provide some logistical equipment for health workers going to West Africa and what administration officials described as ''command and control'' organizational assistance on how to coordinate the overall relief work. The Army Corps of Engineers is expected to be part of the Defense Department effort.

Administration officials did not say how soon the 17 treatment centers would be built in Liberia; officials there, as well as international aid officials, have said that 1,000 beds are needed in Liberia in the next week alone to contain a disease that has been spreading exponentially.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease and public health expert at Vanderbilt University, praised the plan, calling it a ''major commitment,'' and said it was more extensive than he had expected.

''It seems coordinated and coherent,'' Dr. Schaffner said. He added that ''the real core'' was the Defense Department's logistical support ''because the heart of any kind of epidemic containment concept is getting the goods to the right place, putting up the institution.''

Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the plan was an important first step, ''but it is clearly not enough.'' The focus on Liberia, he said, is too limited, and more help should be extended to Sierra Leone and Guinea, the other countries at the center of the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded.

''We should see all of West Africa now as one big outbreak,'' Dr. Osterholm said. ''It's very clear we have to deal with all the areas with Ebola. If the U.S. is not able or not going to do it, that's all the more reason to say the rest of the world has to do it.''

Dr. Jack Chow, a professor of global health at Carnegie Mellon University, also warned that ''the virus does not recognize national borders and will continue to spread where health care is inadequate.''

Top White House aides on Monday rejected criticism from African officials, doctors and representatives from aid groups who said the United States had been slow to act in the face of the disease. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the government, including the C.D.C., had committed more than $100 million since the outbreak started in the early spring.

''The C.D.C. has responded commensurate to the seriousness'' of the crisis, Mr. Earnest told reporters ahead of a trip Mr. Obama has planned to the agency's headquarters in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Earnest called the response ''among the largest deployments of C.D.C. personnel ever.''

Senior administration officials conceded that the effort must expand further as the outbreak threatens to spread in Africa and, potentially, beyond the continent. Officials said medical experts in the government were genuinely worried about the possibility of a mutation that could turn the virus into a more contagious sickness that could threaten the United States.

The World Health Organization has issued a dire Ebola warning for Liberia, saying that the number of afflicted patients was increasing exponentially and that all new treatment facilities were overwhelmed, ''pointing to a large but previously invisible caseload.'' The description of the crisis in Liberia suggested an even more chaotic situation there than had been thought.

Ms. Johnson Sirleaf, who has implored Mr. Obama to do more to help her country battle the disease, traveled over the weekend through Monrovia, the Liberian capital, with the United States ambassador, Deborah R. Malac.

''What is needed is on a scale that is unprecedented,'' a senior administration official said in an interview, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not allowed by the White House to talk on the record ahead of Mr. Obama's announcement.

The United States, a second senior administration official said, also plans to send 400,000 home protective kits to the four counties in Liberia that have been hardest hit by Ebola. The kits will include protective gear for family members, gloves and masks, disinfectants, and fever-reducing drugs.

That is worrisome, Dr. Osterholm said, because it is difficult to care for Ebola patients without becoming infected, and there is no proof that the kits will work. ''We are going to endanger family members more by providing the kits,'' he said.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Conquering contagion.

President Obama will announce plans[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html] to send 3,000 troops to Liberia to fight the Ebola outbreak when he visits the Centers for Disease Control today in Atlanta.

On Capitol Hill, Kent Brantly, the American medical worker who was successfully treated after contracting the virus in Liberia, will testify at a Senate hearing.

• A new phase in Iraq.

The U.S. military launched airstrikes[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/middleeast/us-airstrikes-hit-targets-near-baghdad-held-by-isis.html], hitting targets near Baghdad, to help the Iraqi government win back territory seized by ISIS.

It was the first expansion of the campaign against the militant group that President Obama outlined last week in a speech to the nation.

Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress he would recommend using combat forces[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/middleeast/isis-airstrikes-united-states-coalition.html] in specific operations if airstrikes were not successful.

• Soldiers killed in Afghanistan bombing.

At least three soldiers with the NATO-led coalition were killed and five wounded today[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/asia/soldiers-killed-in-suicide-attack-at-us-base-in-kabul.html] in Kabul after their convoy was targeted in a car-bomb attack at the gates of a U.S. military base.

Reports say that more than a dozen civilians were also wounded.

• A healthier U.S.?

The federal government releases new data today showing that the number of Americans without health insurance fell by about 8 percent[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/number-of-americans-without-health-insurance-falls-survey-shows.html] to 41 million people in the first three months of this year.

But tens of thousands will lose their coverage[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/us-to-end-coverage-under-health-care-law-for-tens-of-thousands.html] at the end of the month because they failed to prove that they were citizens or legal immigrants.

• Crunch time in France.

The government of President François Hollande, who has a record low rating in polls[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/07/us-france-hollande-poll-idUSKBN0H20BA20140907], won a confidence vote today in the National Assembly[http://www.france24.com/en/20140916-embattled-french-government-faces-key-confidence-vote/].

He needed to win by a big margin for his three-week-old cabinet to have legitimacy. Thirty-two members of the governing Socialist party abstained.

• A snapshot of national poverty.

The poverty rate fell to [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-16/poverty-in-u-s-declines-for-first-time-since-before-recession.html]14.5 percent[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-16/poverty-in-u-s-declines-for-first-time-since-before-recession.html] of the U.S. population, from 15 percent, the Census Bureau said today in its report on 2013.

Median household income was flat..

• Ukraine moves toward Europe.

The parliament ratified an “association” pact[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/europe/ukraine-west-europe-russia.html] with the European Union today, a step the nation’s president said was the first toward E.U. membership.

At the same time, the legislature granted three years of self-governance for its territories held by pro-Russia rebels.

• Promises and threats for Scotland.

The three major British political parties renewed a pledge[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/europe/scotland-referendum.html] today to grant Scots “extensive new powers” if they reject independence in a referendum on Thursday.

The prime minister took a different tack, telling Scots that if they vote to secede “there’s no going back from this, no rerun.” Polls show that the outcome is still too close to call.

• Global get-together.

The U.N. General Assembly, which includes representatives from all 193 member nations, begins today in New York and continues until Sept. 30.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks are higher. European indexes ended down, and most Asian shares fell sharply.

• The Fed’s policy-making group starts a two-day meeting[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/business/as-bond-buying-ends-yellen-now-will-chart-course-for-federal-reserve.html], with a decision to make the last asset purchases in its economic stimulus program expected Wednesday.

• Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund, will start unwinding its $4 billion in holdings in all hedge funds, after deciding on Monday that the funds are too expensive and complicated[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/nations-biggest-pension-fund-to-end-hedge-fund-investments/].

• The F.C.C. asks at a round table today whether proposed net neutrality rules[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/technology/fcc-revisits-net-neutrality-exemption-for-mobile-broadband.html] should cover broadband on cellphones.

NOTEWORTHY

• Colleges get their grades.

The QS World University Rankings, charting the top 800 universities on the planet, are released today[http://www.qs.com]. M.I.T. came in first [http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=] on the consulting company’s list last year.

• Undoing U2.

Applereleased software[http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29208540] that will remove the U2 album “Songs of Innocence” from a customer’s iTunes library. A week ago, the company gave the songs free to its 500 million music customers.

• “X” marks the spot.

The R&B singer Chris Brown today releases “X,” his sixth album. It includes collaborations with Usher, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross.

• In the clear.

On this day 40 years ago, President Gerald R. Ford announced an amnesty program for men who had dodged the draft or deserted the military.

But it came with conditions[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/sept-16-1974-conditional-amnesty-for-vietnam-draft-dodgers-and-military-deserters/], including spending two years working in a public service job.

BACK STORY

Trump Plaza in Atlantic City closes today and the Trump Taj Mahal could be next, following the bankruptcy declaration last week of the casinos’ owner.

A terrible blow for The Donald, right?

Not exactly. Donald J. Trump hasn’t had any operating involvement or significant investment stake in either casino for years.

Atlantic City was once central to Mr. Trump’s business empire. In 1984, he partnered with Harrah’s to construct his first casino there, and over the next seven years he added two more to his collection.

Then the first bankruptcies started. By 2004, Mr. Trump’s Atlantic City casino corporations had been through three[http://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-is-donald-trump-able-to-file-for-bankruptcy-so-many-times/] of them.

After a fourth in 2009, Mr. Trump resigned from board and began publicly distancing himself from the debt-ridden mess. This year, he sued to get his name removed[http://www.nj.com/atlantic/index.ssf/2014/08/trump_sues_to_get_name_off_atlantic_city_casinos.html] from the casinos.

The Atlantic City ventures aren’t the only ones that feature heavy Trump branding with little Trump ownership. Thanks to marketing and licensing deals, dozens of properties nationwide carry Mr. Trump’s name even though he has no meaningful involvement[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/nyregion/feeling-deceived-over-homes-that-were-trump-in-name-only.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0] in them.

Good evening. Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Fighting an invisible enemy.

Containing an epidemic requires health care expertise and a lot of supplies.

So why is President Obama sending 3,000 soldiers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html] to West Africa to fight Ebola?

They aren’t just any soldiers, says our Pentagon correspondent, Helene Cooper.

“This is the Army Corps of Engineers,” she explains. “They have the ability to ramp up hugely and quickly.”

The troops will build 17 treatment centers in Liberia, including five in the capital, Monrovia. Each will have 100 beds.

“And they can drill all the processes, everything you need to do to fight infectious diseases without getting infected,” Ms. Cooper says.

“They have the expertise.”

• Still an option.

“The course is a lot more perilous than maybe President Obama portrayed it in his speech.”

That’s our White House correspondent Mark Landler, commenting after the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Congress today that, if airstrikes fail, he might seek to deploy combat troops against the Islamic State[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/middleeast/isis-airstrikes-united-states-coalition.html].

Mr. Landler says Gen. Martin E. Dempsey’s assessment put the president in a somewhat awkward spot.

In Mr. Obama’s televised address last week, Mr. Landler says, “his political message was really a cautious one, designed to allay people’s fears of a ground war.”

But General Dempsey, the president’s top military adviser, was more willing to raise “the possible necessity of having American ground forces be deployed.”

• Forgotten frontier.

NASA announced contracts[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/science/space/boeing-and-spacex-win-contracts-to-carry-americans-to-space-station.html] with Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts to the International Space Station, with flights starting as early as 2017.

But launching astronauts might be an easier task than reinvigorating Americans’ interest in the final frontier, which was at a peak during the space race but faltered when NASA curtailed its programs.

“Americans haven’t cared much about the space program before or during the lull, and this announcement doesn’t change anything much,” says Kenneth Chang, our science reporter.

For one, the tasks even of shuttle missions were generally mundane.

“These rockets and spacecraft are basically minivans for going to a space station that’s just going in circles around Earth,” he says.

It’s the destination that’s the attraction.

“People remember the Saturn V,” Mr. Chang says, “not because it was a big honking rocket — although it was indeed a very cool, big honking rocket — but because it went to the moon.”

• The art of conversation.

“The View” is having to find its footing again as it returns with an almost all-new lineup[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/arts/television/after-17-years-the-view-isnt-so-clear-anymore.html] of hosts.

“It used to be the one place where people turned to hear spirited women debate the story or scandal of the day,” says Alessandra Stanley, our television critic.

Now, it faces a multitude of copycats — like “The Talk,” and now “The Real.” Most stick to celebrity topics, unlike the original.

“The women of ‘The View,'” Ms. Stanley says, “will discuss Beyoncé, but they also address Washington gridlock and ISIS.”

Whoopi Goldberg, the only returnee from last season, is joined by a former host, Rosie O’Donnell, as well as the actress Rosie Perez and the G.O.P. strategist Nicolle Wallace.

It’s still early, Ms. Stanley notes, but “the new cast seems more interested in chemistry than clashes.”

U.N. Sees Need for $1 Billion to Fight Ebola

GENEVA — The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa risks ballooning into a humanitarian catastrophe without a major surge in international efforts to contain it, senior United Nations officials said Tuesday, estimating the cost of this effort at $1 billion.

The number of people affected by the disease is still rising at an “almost exponential” rate, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference in Geneva. He said the number of reported cases had climbed to 4,985, including 2,461 deaths. Half of the infections and deaths occurred in the past 21 days, he said, underscoring the acceleration of the outbreak. “We don’t really know where the numbers are going with this,” Mr. Aylward said.

A road map he announced[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/africa/ebola-outbreak.html] nearly three weeks ago to guide the international response had called for the capacity to manage 20,000 cases, but “that does not seem like a lot today,” he said.

“The numbers can be kept in the tens of thousands,” he said, “but that is going to require a much faster escalation of the response if we are to beat the escalation of the virus.”

Mr. Aylward appeared with Valerie Amos, the United Nations’ emergency relief coordinator, and Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations’ senior system coordinator for Ebola, spelling out the devastating impact of the outbreak on the fragile economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries at the center of the crisis.

“Looking forward,” Mr. Aylward said, “we risk a humanitarian catastrophe if we do not see a rapid scale-up not just of the Ebola response but also the provision of essential services.”

The Ebola outbreak is “much more than a health crisis,” Ms. Amos said, warning that the three countries’ capacity to deliver food and other necessities of daily life was “on the brink of collapse.”

Dr. Nabarro said the funding the United Nations estimated was needed to tackle the crisis had jumped tenfold from $100 million a month ago. He justified the increase with the somber assessment that the outbreak would “go on doubling in that sort of frequency if we don’t deal with it.”

So far, he said, the appeal has raised about 30 percent of what is needed. Offers of assistance are coming in all the time, he said, but it will take “something quite exceptional” to turn the situation around.

The first priority is increasing the number of treatment centers to isolate those infected with disease, Mr. Aylward said, noting that in some areas, infected people are still walking around their communities, generating more infection.

In Liberia, which had three treatment centers with a total capacity of 314 beds last week, Mr. Aylward said, the United Nations now has firm commitments of 500 new beds and expects more in the coming weeks.

Their remarks came in advance of a speech on Tuesday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html] by President Obama announcing an expansion of military and medical resources to combat the spread of Ebola. The American response will focus on Liberia, the worst hit of the three countries. The initiative will include opening a joint command center in Monrovia, the capital, and sending up to 3,000 military officers to train national workers and to build 17 treatment centers, adding about 1,700 beds.

Among the latest international contributions to fighting the epidemic, China is sending Sierra Leone a mobile laboratory consisting of 59 clinicians, epidemiologists and nurses from its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who will join 115 medical staff members it already has working in the country.

“The most urgent immediate need in the Ebola response is for more medical staff,” Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement welcoming China’s move as “a huge boost, morally and operationally.”

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Monday that it had opened a 60-bed treatment center in Kenema, one of the most badly affected cities in Sierra Leone.

Setting up new treatment centers requires weeks, however, so one of the main initiatives to “take the heat out of the outbreak” is developing small Ebola “care units” in the community to try to get sick people out of their homes.

Despite the scale of the threat, Mr. Aylward saw hope of progress in some areas. “You definitely want to get Nigeria and Senegal, obviously, done quickly,” he said after the news conference. Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, and Guinea’s capital, Conakry, should be freed of the disease soon, he said, and “Guinea should be able to get most of the country free in the very near term as well.”

Monrovia still poses a particular challenge, he said.

Correction: September 16, 2014, Tuesday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed a comment about the W.H.O.’s priorities. It was Bruce Aylward — not Dr. David Nabarro — who said the first priority was increasing the number of treatment centers and noted that in some areas, infected people were still walking around infecting others.

The reality of Ebola, a world away; Letter From Africa
By ADAM NOSSITER

There are two realities about the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa — one from inside the infected zone, and another from outside of it.

Outside the zone, a miracle drug — ZMapp, or some iteration of it — is just around the corner, to sweep the problem away. The Western narrative of scientific progress demands no less. Inside the zone, fearful villagers and city dwellers continue to hide sick relatives, cross borders carrying the infection and touch infected corpses at funerals. More become infected, and more die. The epidemic, not science, advances.

Outside the zone, somebody else must be to blame for the worst Ebola epidemic in history: the United States or Europe, for not providing enough help or money, or international health agencies, for not committing enough resources or for not having stamped it out already.

Inside the zone, attention is focused on staying alive and coping, not blaming. Inside the zone, Doctors Without Borders, a largely European organization, is stretched to the breaking point and is forced to turn away Ebola patients, the United States government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has committed scientists to the anti-Ebola fight — dozens have been deployed to the region, according to the C.D.C. — and even the maligned World Health Organization has sent in doctors, epidemiologists and health workers who are putting themselves at risk.

Outside the zone, hysteria over Ebola has led to the collective stigmatization of a big chunk of the African continent. Anybody coming from West Africa is suspected of carrying the disease. Inside the zone, life goes on, and people shop in markets — if not quite as normal, then at least as much so as human survival mechanisms will allow. Near the gates of the Ebola treatment center in Guéckédou, Guinea, for instance, where the epidemic started, a licentious-looking bar called the ‘‘Deuxième Bureau’’ — ‘‘Second Office,’’ a local reference to the house of a kept woman or mistress — was still welcoming customers in mid-July, even as dying Ebola patients were being ferried past.

The clash of these two realities is to be expected, given the extreme circumstances. It is like this when one disadvantaged corner of the world is beset by a calamity, and the rest of the world peers in, anxiously and imperfectly, from a vantage point in which no one worries about relative order, a constant supply of electricity and running water, and air-conditioning. But the contrast is particularly striking this time because there is no risk in simply stepping off the few remaining planes flying in to Freetown, Conakry or Monrovia — contrary to what some in the West appear to believe.

Yet here is where the two narratives join up: because there is real fear, inside and outside the zone. Inside the Ebola zone, the fear is based on a potent reality. Ebola kills about half its victims, the epidemic is so far unchecked, and the medical resources on the ground, largely sent in from elsewhere, are not keeping pace. In fact they are losing ground.

That truth is difficult for people in the West to grasp. The misapprehension is comprehensible, because one of the world’s deadliest viruses is afflicting the weakest, least-prepared societies in the world. The consequences of such a confrontation cannot be anything other than fearsome. Nothing now stands in the way of the disease except the overstretched foreign aid agencies.

It is difficult for people in the West to imagine the extent of disorganization in these countries. There is a near-total absence of effectively functioning institutions of any sort, let alone those devoted to health care. Years of exploitation by thieving elites — followed by brutal civil wars that were in some ways the inevitable consequence — substituted for institution- and nation-building in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the two hardest-hit countries. In Guinea, a sinister, ideologically motivated dictator ruled his country with an iron hand for a quarter century.

The lesson for the country’s beleaguered inhabitants was the same as in its neighbors, a lesson now playing out with awful consequences: The state and institutions were always sources of suffering, not succor.

Congressional Memo
U.S.
World Events Muffle Democrats’ Economic Rallying Cry

WASHINGTON — Just outside the Capitol, two Democratic senators running for re-election stood last week before a few dozen labor-aligned supporters and local high school students with posters declaring “America Needs a Raise” to make another pitch for increasing the minimum wage — a cornerstone of the party’s midterm economic message.

The event generated little momentum for the issue and little coverage for Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. But it did emphasize a larger, unintended point: The Democrats’ strategy of making an increase in the minimum wage a midterm election rallying cry has been drowned out by world events. The party continues to talk about it, but it appears that few are listening.

“It is because of what is happening in the Middle East,” conceded Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a third Democrat present and a longtime leader on progressive labor issues.

Events overseas have undermined Democrats’ strategy to tie their midterm prospects to an economic theme that includes calls for a higher minimum wage, reducing income inequality, pay equity for women and help with college tuition. Instead, the public and Congress have been overwhelmed this summer by a border crisis, an Ebola outbreak in Africa and, most notably, the terrorist threat from the Islamic State, also known by the acronym ISIS.

Democrats, pointing to President Obama’s effectiveness in drawing an economic contrast with the Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and to the 2006 midterm races in which they took over the House and the Senate, still believe the strategy is sound.

“I think the Democrats’ economic message has a lot of resonance, but it has been difficult to break through the focus on foreign policy issues,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

While Democratic candidates in some contested states are still seen as making headway with the economic argument, its diminishing punch nationally is threatening to make the final two months of the campaign more about Mr. Obama’s droopy approval ratings — a risky proposition, particularly for Democrats defending seats in red states where the president’s standing is abysmal.

“His ability to project those issues in these races has been limited by the competing realities,” Mark Mellman, a top Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Obama’s faltering focus on economic issues. “The press is much more interested in what he’s saying about ISIS than what he is saying about the minimum wage.”

Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president, agreed that the urgent need to deal with the terrorist threat this summer had largely derailed the president’s push, which began in earnest last spring, to help Democrats define the election as a choice between two competing economic visions. He said the president’s Democratic allies in the Senate had also struggled to stick to their game plan.

“There is no question that the national conversation has been around issues other than the national economic condition,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “It makes it harder to get the debate on the economic issue.”

Six months ago, strategists in the West Wing and their counterparts on Capitol Hill had high hopes for a coordinated, poll-tested plan to use the president’s national megaphone and the Democrat-controlled Senate to repeatedly put Republicans on the defensive on what Mr. Obama and his allies call pocketbook issues. They saw few other options given controversy over the health care law and little movement on other big proposals.

The idea was to schedule a series of economic-themed speeches by the president, closely timed with Senate votes on the same subject. On April 30, Mr. Obama gathered an audience in the East Room of the White House to deliver an aggressive attack on Republican opposition to increasing the minimum wage. At the same time, the Senate forced a vote on an increase to $10.10 per hour — a proposal that was immediately blocked by Republicans.

“Either you’re in favor of raising wages for hardworking Americans, or you’re not,” the president declared in April, taking aim at Republicans in his event. “They won’t raise wages for millions of working families when three-quarters of Americans support it? That makes no sense.”

But Democrats also saw signs that the issue lacked potency back in March when a major internal research project for House Democrats found that the push on the minimum wage was not by itself a sufficient contrast with Republicans.

Yet even now, Democrats say economic issues are working in some races, though not on the national stage. Embattled candidates in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina have pushed the pay equity message particularly strongly in an effort to build on their advantage with female voters. And in Iowa, Democrats have successfully used ads about the minimum wage to blunt a surge by Joni Ernst, the Republican Senate candidate, according to Democratic strategists.

But the Democratic candidates are largely on their own, weighed down by an increasingly unpopular president who is now mired in questions of war and terrorism. Instead of helping to create a national environment that plays to Democratic strengths on the economy, Mr. Obama is the focal point of a serious and uncertain political topic.

Mr. Pfeiffer said it remained unclear how the president’s call to wage a new war against militants in Iraq and Syria would affect Democratic candidates this fall. He said that Mr. Obama had little choice but to shift his focus away from the elections.

“When you’re president, challenges come and you have to meet them,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “You don’t get to pick the cards you are dealt.”

Republicans say they see no evidence that the economic push by individual Democratic candidates is delivering the results that Mr. Obama needs to make sure that his party hangs on to the Senate this November.

“I think it has pretty much fallen flat,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. “People see it as an election-year stunt, and it is.”

On Monday, White House officials commemorated the sixth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which set off the economic collapse of 2008, with a little-noticed blog post[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/14/growing-our-economy-and-strengthening-our-financial-system]. And White House officials said the next several weeks would be dominated by a focus on foreign policy as the president travels to the headquarters of the Central Command in Tampa, Fla., to discuss his plans for battling Islamic militants and next week attends the United Nations General Assembly.

Officials still maintain there will be plenty of time for Mr. Obama to make the economic arguments, and they said he had never been scheduled to campaign aggressively for individual Democratic candidates until October.

Democrats say they will push ahead with the themes, and Mr. Harkin, who is retiring this year, said he hoped the Senate would hold at least one more minimum wage vote.

“I think the voters have the right to know as they go into the election on this vital issue who is for raising the minimum wage and who is not,” he said.

An Urgent Campaign Against Ebola

President Obama’s announcement of a more aggressive campaign against the Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/africa/obama-urges-world-powers-to-bolster-ebola-response.html] in West Africa on Tuesday shows the administration is starting to recognize the severity of the crisis in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The question now is whether ramped-up medical assistance from the United States and other countries will arrive fast enough to change the course of the rapidly expanding epidemic.

It was scary enough when the World Health Organization projected that 20,000 people might be infected within the next six to nine months. Now there are credible projections that the outbreak could last a year to 18 months and infect hundreds of thousands of people before it is brought under control, as Denise Grady reported[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/africa/us-scientists-see-long-fight-against-ebola.html] in The Times on Saturday. The epidemic has been growing exponentially in Liberia, the hardest-hit country, with the number of new cases almost doubling from one recent week to the next. The only thing that could interrupt that trend would be a more effective public health effort to slow the spread of the virus.

On Tuesday, senior United Nations health officials called for a major surge in international support[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/africa/ebola-fight-needs-more-money-un-says.html] that could cost $1 billion, of which only 30 percent has been pledged. They said the number of infections could be kept in the tens of thousands provided there is a much faster escalation of international assistance.

Mr. Obama’s initiative, which would primarily focus on Liberia, would substantially increase American spending from its already high level. The Defense Department alone is prepared to devote up to $1 billion to the cause, according to an administration official. The United States military will establish a joint command center in Monrovia and send up to 3,000 military personnel to Liberia and Senegal. They will construct up to 17 treatment centers with about 1,700 beds, with the first ones ready in the next several weeks. Military medics will train up to 500 health care workers a week to deliver care safely, starting in a couple weeks. And the American government will also supply 400,000 home-health kits[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/world/africa/obama-to-announce-expanded-effort-against-ebola.html], containing disinfectants, gloves and various supplies to prevent transmission of the virus among family members. That is enough for every person in the most highly infected parts of Liberia.

The American effort looks like the largest, but other nations and organizations are contributing as well. The European Union recently pledged $180 million to the affected countries. Cuba is sending a team of 165 medical experts to Sierra Leone.

China, which has been notably stingy in contributing aid to past humanitarian crises, says it has sent a laboratory team of 59 to Sierra Leone to help diagnose cases in addition to 115 medical experts already there. Although the W.H.O. welcomed the assistance as “a huge boost, morally and operationally,” China, with the world’s second-largest economy, can afford to do a lot more.

Russia is sending a small team of specialists with two mobile laboratories to Guinea to diagnose cases, a token gesture at best. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has opened a 60-bed treatment center in Sierra Leone. Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders continues to provide most of the care in Liberia.

A big concern is how quickly the treatment centers in Liberia can be built. Some experts say 1,000 beds are needed in the next week to contain the disease, a goal that seems well out of reach. All donors will need to hasten their assistance if there’s to be any hope of containing an epidemic that is spiraling out of control.

Obama Presses Leaders to Speed Ebola Response

ATLANTA — President Obama on Tuesday challenged world powers to accelerate the global response to the Ebola outbreak that is ravaging West Africa, warning that unless health care workers, medical equipment and treatment centers were swiftly deployed, the disease could take hundreds of thousands of lives.

“This epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Obama said here at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he met with doctors who had just returned from West Africa. The world, he said, “has the responsibility to act, to step up and to do more. The United States intends to do more.”

Even as the president announced a major American deployment to Liberia and Senegal of medicine, equipment and 3,000 military personnel, global health officials said that time was running out and that they had weeks, not months, to act. They said that although the American contribution was on a scale large enough to make a difference, a coordinated assault in Africa from other Western powers was essential to bringing the virus under control.

“Everyone realizes that no one group or one country or one organization is going to be able to tackle this,” Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank and an expert in infectious diseases, said in a telephone interview hours after the bank unanimously approved previously announced grants to the most affected of the countries. He praised the American effort as “extremely encouraging,” but said it remained unclear how the United States would coordinate its effort with relief groups. “This is all being put together on the fly,” he said.

Administration officials said they urgently needed stronger responses from Britain and France, countries that, along with the United States, have colonial ties to the three hardest-hit African countries: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

So far, France has sent $13 million to Guinea for two tons of medical equipment and the construction of medical centers, and $15.5 million and 24 doctors to Senegal and Ivory Coast, other former French colonies. British troops, the government said last week, are headed to Sierra Leone, a former British colony, to build and staff a 63-bed facility near the capital, Freetown.

On Tuesday night, administration officials said the Pentagon would ask Congress to redirect $500 million from existing Defense Department funds to fight Ebola. The money is in addition to $500 million the Pentagon requested last week in redirected funds for both Iraq and Ebola.

In Washington, New York and Geneva, health experts expressed astonishment and alarm at the virus’s rapid spread.

“The pace of the disease and also its impact have taken our breath away — it’s been that massive,” said Shanelle Hall, director of the supply division at Unicef, which has sent about 550 tons of supplies to West Africa in the past several weeks and has plans to almost triple that amount by the beginning of next month. “We hope other governments also come in with commensurate levels of support.”

On Capitol Hill, Dr. Beth P. Bell, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the C.D.C., told a Senate hearing that although Ebola did not currently pose a significant public health threat to the United States, “there is a window of opportunity to control the spread of this disease, but that window is closing.”

At the United Nations, the Security Council prepared to convene for a rare emergency meeting on Thursday to mobilize a response. It also took action on a global health issue in 2000 and 2011, when it passed resolutions on AIDS.

Senior United Nations officials said in Geneva that cases of the disease were rising at an almost exponential rate, with the number of reported cases now at 4,985, including 2,461 deaths. Half of the infections, according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the World Health Organization, occurred in the past 21 days, underscoring the acceleration of the outbreak. “We don’t know where the numbers are going with this,” Dr. Aylward said at a news conference.

Mr. Obama echoed those words. “We can’t dawdle on this one,” the president said. “We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.”

But just how fast the American military can build 17 treatment centers of 100 beds each in Liberia, as planned, is still in question. Liberian officials say 1,000 beds are needed there in the next week alone to contain the disease. American military officials cautioned that they were not close to getting that number of beds up and running and said it would take time — perhaps as long as two weeks — before personnel arrived to begin setting up the first treatment centers.

Defense Department officials said that once constructed, the treatment centers would be turned over to Liberia and staffed by local and international health care providers, although health care experts say they are having difficulty finding doctors. A small number of American physicians and nurses are among the 3,000 military personnel en route to Liberia and Senegal, but administration officials said they would serve as trainers to other health care workers.

Some health experts said the president’s plan focused too much on Liberia and not enough on Guinea and Sierra Leone. “An uneven response in the region may trigger unintended flows of people seeking care from American centers,” said Dr. Jack Chow, a professor of global health at Carnegie Mellon University and a former official at the World Health Organization.

But in Liberia, half a year after the start of the outbreak, the authorities remain incapable of carrying out the most basic steps needed to stop the spread of Ebola, including picking up the dead and isolating potentially infectious people. In the capital, bodies are often left in houses and neighborhoods for up to three days before they are taken away by burial teams. Because of a shortage of ambulances, families with visibly sick relatives take taxis to full treatment centers, where they are often turned away.

As Ebola spread through the capital last month, Liberia’s government initially asserted control over the fight against the virus, even placing an entire slum in Monrovia under quarantine, against international advice. But facing a deteriorating situation on the ground and increasing pressure by politicians and the news media to “outsource” the battle, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote to Mr. Obama and the leaders of China, Russia and several other countries asking for direct help.

Because of Liberia’s historical ties to the United States — it was founded by freed American slaves in 1822 — a visible American military presence would not draw the kind of backlash it would elsewhere in Africa.

On Tuesday, many in Monrovia welcomed news of greater American involvement. “It will help us,” said the Rev. Otis Borbor, the pastor at the Lighthouse Assemblies of God church in Caldwell, one of Monrovia’s most affected neighborhoods. “That’s what we were praying for, the pastors. We were praying to God that he may send people to rescue us and carry help to the country. So when we heard that, we were happy.”

Frederick J. Ryan Jr. was profoundly excited: He had landed the Jonas Brothers as Politico’s guests for the 2010 White House Correspondent’s dinner.

Buzzy party guests — as well as splendid neck ties, proper place settings and a steady flow of invitations to embassy dinners, Georgetown cocktail parties and Virginia horse races — are the essential elements of the professional life of Mr. Ryan, an affable one-time Reagan staff member and former television executive who on Oct. 1 will become the new publisher of The Washington Post, a position once held and made iconic by the late Katharine Graham.

The appointment of Mr. Ryan to replace Mrs. Graham’s granddaughter, Katharine Weymouth, the last scion of the Post’s longtime former owners, startled media analysts and a broad swath of former and current employees of Politico, the upstart news outlet of which Mr. Ryan was once president. Most expected the Post’s new owner, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to choose a publisher with a background that would bring his digital dreams for journalism to life.

But in Mr. Ryan, Mr. Bezos has installed less his doppelganger than his antipode — a Reagan-era veteran who has thrived in the charity ball culture of Washington. If Mr. Bezos’ selection says something about how certain social precincts of the capital still endure, it raises questions about whether Mr. Bezos’ interests are more in owning a prestige trophy than a platform for innovation.

At Politico, Mr. Ryan was better known for promoting the website’s brand and the television stations of Politico’s owners than for any expertise in print or online journalism, according to a dozen people who worked with him. “He had very little to say about editorial or digital vision,” said Bruce Drake, a senior editor at the Pew Research Center who worked with Mr. Ryan on an early version of Politico. “I’ve never seen any evidence that Fred his made his mark in those areas.”

There is ample evidence that Mr. Ryan — the chairman of the board of the White House Historical Association and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation and a board member of Ford’s Theatre and the National Museum of American History, among others — will be the insider to Mr. Bezos’ outsider.

It was Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs — not Senator Thomas R.

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Warlike preparations.

President Obama heads to Tampa, Fla., this morning to receive a briefing at U.S. Central Command, the control hub for military action in the Middle East.

The Islamic State, the militant group that controls large areas of Iraq and Syria, released a short video[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/world/middleeast/isis-issues-video-riposte-to-obama.html] in which it appeared to say that it would kill American ground forces should Mr. Obama deploy them.
