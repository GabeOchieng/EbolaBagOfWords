The second person in the U.S. to have Ebola lived just a block away.

But far more concerning to Tonya Huff on Sunday afternoon were the high number of turnovers the Dallas Cowboys were committing in their game against the Seattle Seahawks.

"I can't live in fear. That's not living," Huff said as she watched the game from the San Francisco Rose, a bar around the corner from the East Dallas apartment of a medical worker who contracted Ebola. "If it's already here, there's nothing I can do."

Sunday's announcement that the second case of Ebola had surfaced in Dallas -- the first transmitted case in the USA -- sparked a mix of emotions in this North Texas community. Most people went about their business. Some felt dread that the Ebola virus had surfaced so close to home.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings was busy reassuring residents -- again -- that the virus, though frightening, is being contained.

"This shows the system's working," Rawlings said of the work decontaminating the patient's apartment.

James Hinckley, 30, lives next door to the infected worker. He was at work Sunday when he began receiving calls from concerned friends and relatives.

He said he wasn't altering his day-to-day activities, other than moving to a friend's home for a few days. The move was to avoid the crush of news media that appeared on his street.

More concerning to Jennifer Jutton, 35, who lives nearby, was the fact that the infected patient had a dog. It was unknown Sunday whether the dog also had the virus or how it would be spread it. Rawlings said Sunday that the dog remained in the apartment and will be saved.

"It's about the dog," Jutton said. "That's the headline now."

How not to treat Ebola in digital age ; As the Dallas hospital error shows, computers can hinder how we communicate

A blame game broke out soon after Thomas Eric Duncan became the first patient in the U.S. diagnosed with Ebola. Duncan had been sent home from the emergency room of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 25 because no one there connected his feverish illness with his recent travel from Liberia. Three days later, he returned to the hospital and was diagnosed with Ebola. On Wednesday, he passed away, and now one of his caregivers has tested positive for the disease.

Diagnostic errors -- such as when a patient seeks attention and is turned away because of a failure to collect or appreciate a crucial piece of information -- are the most common type of medical mistake. They contribute to up to 80,000 deaths a year in the U.S. Errors of this type can be fatal, such as when the error involves a missed heart attack, stroke, or serious infection. But in an Ebola outbreak, the consequences can be much more severe because they can affect so many more people.

On Oct. 2, the Dallas hospital issued a statement blaming electronic records for causing the error, because of "separate physician and nursing workflows." A day later, the hospital admitted there was nothing wrong with its computer system. While it is not clear whether the physician saw the nurse's note, we do know that the nurse did not communicate directly with the doctor, and that the doctor did not act on the information.

State of the art

The Dallas hospital uses a state-of-the-art electronic record system. But no matter how good the system, computerization doesn't solve every problem in medicine, and it creates some new ones. This can lead to electronic silos, in which individuals from different specialties (such as nurses and doctors) communicate with each other via the electronic record, rather than face-to-face.

I have observed this phenomenon at my hospital. After seeing their patients, physicians used to station themselves for hours on the clinical floors to do their charting. Now, the charts live anywhere there is a computer. So doctors often choose to work in solitude in their office, but that can inhibit the human communication so vital to effective care.

State of teamwork

The emergency room, where this error occurred, is the site of some of the most profound changes. In the predigital days, the nurses and doctors lived and breathed teamwork, constantly chatting as they went about their work. This was partly because a nurse would quickly see a patient and, if she had concerns, would tell the doctor. Or the doctor would see a patient and, if he needed to order a test or have an IV started, he'd tell the nurse. Now everything gets reported and ordered in the electronic health record, and it's on to the next task.

Even worse, each "side" retreats to its own corner. Walk around the ER and you'll see doctors and nurses, sometimes just inches away from each other, staring at their computers without exchanging a word. A 2014 study bore this out: Implementation of an electronic health record was associated with a significant decrease in the quality of communication between doctors and nurses.

What can we learn from this case? First, though the computer system was not the culprit here, these systems can improve. In the future, big data-type analytics would have been "watching" for the combination of travel to West Africa and fever, and signaled all the clinicians when it found them. (In an even more distant future, systems on the lookout for travel-associated infections could mine both medical and passport records, identifying suspect cases without needing to ask the patient about his travel history.)

Second, while today's medical computer systems are not perfect, we need to resist the temptation to blame every medical mistake on them. The computer is a tool, and a very useful one.

Perhaps one day, the tool will become so good, so accurate, that it will replace physicians and nurses, as we've seen workers replaced in other industries. But that day is not today, and won't be tomorrow. For now, we need to take advantage of these marvelous tools, but not forget that they don't practice medicine. We do.

For insurers, Ebola threat just too risky ; Policies don't cover businesses or world travelers

Sal Pain's hazardous-waste removal company has transported trash contaminated with the scariest of the scary, be it anthrax or asbestos, legionella to MRSA.

Now, for the first time in 30 years, he's facing a business challenge like none before. His insurers won't cover him for Ebola.

"Ebola is different," Pain says. "Nobody wants to touch this with a 10-foot pole."

The Ebola epidemic that has struck three countries in West Africa and on Wednesday claimed the life of a Liberian man visiting the United States has prompted an unprecedented worldwide public health response.

Now the fallout from the spread of the deadly virus has hit business and travelers. Businesses like Pain's Bio-Recovery Corp. in New York and companies with workers abroad, including oil and mining companies, humanitarian organizations and transportation providers, have to evaluate how they should operate as the threat of Ebola looms and insurers refuse to help shoulder the risk.

Business owners worry about two things: interruptions in their money flow and danger to their employees, says Logan Payne, senior account manager at Lockton, a global insurance broker. Most businesses carry insurance to protect them in either scenario, Payne says.

In the case of Ebola, however, the insurance policy may not help. Many policies won't cover any risk associated with Ebola, Payne says.

Brad Smith, vice president of CG Environmental-Cleaning Guys, which decontaminated the Dallas apartment where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan stayed before dying at a hospital, says the company is still negotiating with its insurance company.

"When they took us on, they knew what we did," Smith says. "But Ebola is new to the United States of America. There is still a lot of information being gathered by a lot of smart people right now."

Companies must consider their liability if an employee sent to an Ebola-affected area gets sick and exposes others, says Dave Evans, senior vice president of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America.

"Businesses need to consider what will happen if an employee of theirs boards a plane and has Ebola," Evans says. "What potential liability do they now have to other members of the public?"

Travelers, too, may find themselves unprotected.

The CDC has encouraged U.S. citizens traveling to Ebola-affected countries to purchase travel insurance that includes medical evacuation for Ebola. If the coverage meets the Affordable Care Act standards, it covers care for illness from Ebola, but it might not cover everything a patient might need, such as experimental drugs or a medical flight back to the U.S. for treatment, says Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance.

Some plans limit the insurance payout to a figure that might not be enough to cover the costs of the intensive treatment and quarantine that come with Ebola, McLean says.

"Those costs are going to add up," she says.

Travelers with trip insurance who cancel trips to Ebola-affected areas might not see a payout. Most travel insurance policies pay only if trips are canceled for specific reasons such as death of a traveling companion, weather or an employment layoff, says Megan Singh, spokeswoman for Squaremouth, an online company that evaluates travel insurance products. A "cancel for any reason" clause can increase the cost of a travel insurance policy by 40%, she says.

"Fear is not covered by travel insurance," she says.

HCC Medical Insurance Services gave customers who hold its Atlas Travel policy 10 days to leave countries identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as high-risk for Ebola or face losing coverage, the company said in a statement.

Insurance quarrels aren't stopping Pain's company, Bio-Recovery Corp, from cleaning up planes quarantined for Ebola at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

"This is our Michael Jordan moment. The fourth quarter," Pain says. "When everyone else says no, we show up."

John F. Kennedy International Airport began enhanced Ebola screenings Saturday, and four other U.S. airports plan to start them this week.

While airport screenings alone will not eradicate the Ebola virus, they are a start. What most people don't understand is that the U.S. did not just decide to do something about Ebola now; it has been involved for several months.

People tend to act more out of fear in situations like this instead of with intelligence. Authorities need to try to ensure people are screened over in Africa. If they quarantine people in one place, it's easier to limit the possibility of infecting more people worldwide.

Denise Ramos

The key to ending this outbreak is getting Ebola in Liberia under control, and a huge part of that involves having Americans (who want to go) help over there to try and stop the spread of the disease. This is not a problem where we can just stick our heads in the sand and wish it away, as much as many people would like to do.

Craig Macaulay

Screening at U.S. airports will help, but it wouldn't have caught Thomas Eric Duncan, the patient who died in Dallas. And it won't catch the next asymptomatic carrier who wants to enter the USA. Fortunately, Duncan wound up in a hospital, so the number of people who were exposed to the virus was limited.

But what if the next asymptomatic carrier enters the country, gets sick and does not seek treatment? By the time the case is discovered, the number of people affected could be more than 50. Tracing and monitoring possible infection at that time would be extremely difficult.

Until this virus is better understood, the public fully educated and the outbreak controlled, we should do more than screen. We should prohibit entry from the affected countries.

Leslie Jacobs

LETTERS

Ebola has been around since 1976. Why hasn't any Western country developed a vaccine in all this time? Could it be because the only people affected were people in villages in African countries? I guess it is fine for those villagers to die but not for Westerners.

Yes, we now want to stop Ebola where it is because we don't want it traveling here. I still don't hear enough of a focus on those exposed in Africa, on saving their lives. More than 4,000 have already died in this Ebola outbreak.

We have a long way to go before we treat everyone as equals, valuing the life of everyone and putting compassion before the mighty dollar.

Arleen Lorrance

Scottsdale, Ariz.

Screening at U.S. airports is nuts. We don't need to find the Ebola virus here. We need to keep it in West Africa. Use passport stamps to prohibit anyone who has been in Africa fewer than 30 days ago to come here.

And, if someone travels there and gets Ebola, then they should have to stay there.

We don't need the death, grief and expense of inviting the problem here.

Ebola panic will turn disease into terrorist ; We know how to win with patience, resolve

Even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new Ebola screening at key airports, the chorus of voices calling for much broader action got louder. Though reports of potential new infections were quickly knocked down, they fed growing public concern anyway.

But overreacting might just be the way to spread the disease instead of contain it. It is a lesson we learned long ago. During the 14th century Black Death, Venice and other cities introduced a quarantine, shutting off their waters to ships suspected of carrying the disease, to no effect. Thousands of Venetians died. The city of Milan, well ahead of its time, avoided a major outbreak by isolating sick people and sealing off their houses.

The problem with the quarantine was that it caused people to panic. And panicked people take fewer precautions, spreading more disease. Overreactions, such as the needless quarantine Thursday of a whole building near Paris, can distract from better approaches.

A tried-and-true method of slowing the spread of an outbreak is known as contact tracing -- isolate victims and then identify and follow the contacts of the sick person. This method can be especially effective with a disease such as Ebola, where a person does not have enough virus in her secretions to be contagious until she is exhibiting symptoms.

Thomas Duncan, the Liberian patient in Dallas who died this week, was in contact with 100 people after his arrival in the U.S. The fact that none of them has gotten sick shows how difficult it is to catch Ebola. This difficulty, and our advanced health care system, will be able to prevent any serious outbreaks here.

But panic can spread far faster than a virus. Our overreaction is turning Ebola into a microscopic medical terrorist. Just as a terrorist's bomb can kill a handful of people but catch the attention of millions, so too has Duncan's tragic case had far more impact on public perception than it had on those around him. So far, Duncan's infection hasn't caused a single additional case, but now we are all talking about him.

As with any terrorist, a global response involves attacking the problem at the source, in this case by pouring health resources and funding into West Africa. While Ebola cases are still doubling every month, our response is ramping up. Three thousand troops to build Ebola clinics is a good step, but it should have been done months ago. Burial teams are in place to cut the risk of burials. Over many months, especially if vaccines in clinical trials become available, public health efforts should still be able to gain control over the outbreak.

We should expect more Ebola cases outside of West Africa, maybe even some here. But they won't be a sign the war on Ebola is failing, only that stopping it will require vigilance and restraint in sticking to what works.

Five reasons stocks are tanking again ; Major reversal of fortune can be chalked up to toxic combo

The roller coaster ride on Wall Street kicked into a new gear Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering a downward spiral of 335 points to 16,659 for its third day of 200-plus point moves -- the longest streak since August 2011.

The Dow's big downdraft comes on the heels of Wednesday's 275- point rally, which was its biggest this year. The Dow is exhibiting volatility not seen since the summer of 2011, when stocks got hammered after a rating agency downgraded the USA's gold-plated AAA credit rating.

The Dow has now moved more than 200 points in five of the seven trading sessions since the start of October. Wall Street fears October because it has been the month where stocks have suffered their biggest one-day crashes, including 1929 and 1987.

So what's causing all the angst on Wall Street, less than three weeks after its last record high?

1. Global growth fears. Investors are concerned that the slowdown in economies around the globe, especially the eurozone, will worsen and drag down demand for products and services around the globe, and hurt the profitability of U.S. corporations. Couple those growth fears with anxiety over when the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates next year, and you get a great deal of anxiety over the growth outlook.

"The market is headed lower on Europe's economic prospects," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.

2. Ugly stock charts. Wall Street often watches key levels on major stock indexes, such as the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500- stock index, for signs of support, or a floor under stock prices. But today, the key 1950 level on the large-company stock index did not hold, and selling picked up after that key level gave way. The S&P ended down 2.1% at 1928.

It is not just high-octane small-company stocks or momentum stocks getting creamed.

"If you look underneath the surface, the market is in much worse shape," says Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management. "This (sell-off) is the popular indices following" to the downside.

3. ECB power doubts. Back in July 2012, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi put a floor under global markets when he basically said the ECB "would do whatever it takes" to keep the eurozone intact. But Draghi actually spooked markets Thursday when he said in a speech that the eurozone economy is slowing and warned that policymakers must boost inflation from an "excessively low" level.

The worry is that the ECB is behind the so-called curve. Wall Street wants Draghi to launch a U.S.-style sovereign bond-buying program to boost demand and jump-start the eurozone economy. But Draghi has not yet made that aggressive move.

"Today showed Emporer Draghi has no clothes," says David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors.

4. Commodities sell-off. The commodity complex, which includes energy, has been getting whacked with heavy selling, which is hurting shares of energy stocks and other commodity plays. In fact, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude has sunk below the $90 level for the first time in more than two years. A barrel of Texas Intermediate crude tumbled to nearly 2% today to $85.87 a barrel. Falling oil prices often signals a weakening economic outlook.

"It's oil, oil, oil," says Andy Busch, editor and publisher of The Busch Update, a financial newsletter.

5. Overdue market pullback. Earlier this week, the S&P 500 celebrated the third anniversary of its last official correction, defined as a drop of 10% from a recent high. There is a feeling that the stock market, which peaked three Fridays ago on the day Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba celebrated its record-breaking initial public offering, was tired, fatigued, overbought and overloved -- and that a sizable pullout was needed to reduce the froth.

Says Donald Luskin, chief investment officer at TrendMacro: "It's just a reversal of (Wednesday's) reversal -- this happens during market corrections, when investors hang on every word looking for direction."

The market has been dealing with a host of concerns for a while - - geopolitical risks, the Ebola crisis and a looming Federal Reserve hike in interest rates -- that are now starting to have an effect.

"The market has simply taken enough body blows that it was ready for a head shot," says Jordan Kimmel, chief investment officer at InvestView.

Nigeria halts spread of virus, brings hope

People here are shaking hands again, kissing, hugging, touching. These days, shops are open, people are working, and children are finally going back to school.

That's because Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is officially Ebola-free, the health ministry said, even as the deadly virus rages in neighboring countries, where lockdowns and quarantines are common and death rates are rising.

As the U.S. and Spain deal with their first diagnosed cases of Ebola and fears that the virus could spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sending researchers to Lagos to study how Nigeria was able to contain the disease. No new cases have been reported here since Aug.31, the CDC said.

The Nigerian government's "extensive response to a single case of Ebola shows that control is possible with rapid, focused interventions," CDC Director Tom Frieden said.

Christine Afafa, 27, a mother of two in Lagos, said it was impossible for her to imagine her country could win the fight against Ebola so quickly. She said it's a relief to get back to normal, with schools starting this week.

"We're very happy as parents to take our children back to school after a long break," Afafa said. "Our confidence has now been restored. We are free to allow our children to interact with others again."

Nigeria was hit with Ebola after Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-born American, brought the deadly virus to Lagos when he flew there July 20. Because the country was already on alert for the virus, health officials acted quickly and determined he came into contact with 59 people at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport and at the hospital.

The government immediately imposed strict measures to quarantine the ill and to screen thousands of their contacts around the densely populated Lagos.

President Goodluck Jonathan declared a national emergency, closed schools and set about tracing who had been in contact with those infected. Also, the government distributed leaflets and put up billboards in multiple local languages to educate the public on preventive measures and symptoms of the Ebola virus.

The government even advised people to use ashes to clean their hands, for those who couldn't afford to buy soap.

"This is how we won the fight against Ebola virus," said Commissioner for Health Jide Idris. "We swiftly worked together as a country when we discovered cases of the virus. The people of Nigeria were very cooperative. They followed the instructions that were given."

Nigerians are told to remain vigilant about the illness and to take preventive steps. Despite the warnings, the mood on the streets of Lagos was joyous at what seems a return to normal life.

"It was difficult even to meet your close relatives and friends due to fear of contacting Ebola virus," said Dan Adeboye, 45, who resumed his work shining shoes last week. "But now we can talk and do our work without fear."

The Ebola virus continues to wreak havoc in neighboring Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The World Health Organization said there are now more than 8,000 cases of the Ebola virus since the outbreak began five months ago. About half that number have died from the disease.

In Liberia, the hardest-hit country, the situation has worsened despite government efforts to quarantine victims and to spread awareness about the disease and prevention measures.

"We are like people who are in prison without freedom and food to eat," said Judith Hawah, a parent of three in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. "You can't just move anywhere to look for food because of fear of Ebola."

In Sierra Leone, the rate of infection is increasing: Five people are infected each hour, according to Save the Children. That is in spite of a widespread quarantine and lockdown of entire districts.

These days, on the streets of Sierra Leone's fourth-largest city, Makeni, the occasional rumbles of a car engine are cause for excitement. Since the Ebola quarantine began last month, only cars with special permits can pass through the city, and motorcycles are forbidden.

"The city of Makeni is becoming very boring," said Abass Gbla, 70, who used to sell soap in the market but now stays inside.

In Port Loko, another quarantined district in northern Sierra Leone, there were 91 new cases and 11 deaths within two days last week, said resident Osman Justine Conteh, 26.

Residents say they are losing faith in the ability of local authorities to fight Ebola.

"This situation cannot be contained by our own medical personnel," Conteh said. "We want more help from the outside."

Others said they are now resorting to prayer.

"I am currently fasting to ask the almighty Allah to save us from this situation," Gbla said. "But if authorities don't give a few traders passes to travel in and out and buy food, we are in a big trouble."

How Ebola flight screenings work ; New steps include temperature scan, health questions

How might the changes announced Wednesday affect you?

How will screening happen?

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials will step up monitoring for Ebola symptoms at five U.S. airports.

The change will affect certain passengers arriving on international flights as they clear Customs. The enhanced screening will target travelers whose trips began in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three countries hit hardest in the current outbreak.

"We are stepping up protection for people coming into the country and for Americans related to travel," said Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While Ebola is difficult to transmit through blood, mucus or other bodily fluids, the disease has infected 8,011 people in West Africa and killed 3,857, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.

"We're always looking for ways that can better protect Americans," Frieden said.

Where -- and when -- will you notice a difference?

The enhanced screening will take place at Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, New York JFK, Newark Liberty and Washington Dulles.

The stricter screening begins Saturday at JFK and will be phased in at the other airports next week. CBP staffers will pull aside travelers from the three countries, to ask questions and take their temperatures.

Steve Sigmund, executive director of the Global Gateway Alliance, which advocates for New York airports, said the group supported the enhanced screening for the health and safety of millions of area travelers.

"Additional personnel and layers of screening will help ensure the well-being of both passengers and local residents," Sigmund said.

The Atlanta airport issued a statement saying it is working with CDC and CBP to ensure the safety of travelers at the world's busiest airport.

"With growing concern over the spread of the Ebola virus, we welcome the additional screening measures announced today by the White House," the airport said.

What will the screening entail?

CBP agents will take temperatures of passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea with a non-contact thermometer. They'll also ask questions about their health and possible exposure to Ebola.

If the traveler has a fever, or if a questionnaire reveals possible exposure, a CDC quarantine officer will assess whether the passenger will be allowed to continue or if precautionary measures are required.

Even if a traveler doesn't have a fever or other symptoms, officials will ask the traveler to keep a daily temperature log for 21 days and provide contact information.

Travelers may have fevers for other reasons. Malaria is common in West Africa, but it is transmitted by mosquito rather than between people, Frieden said.

"We expect to see some patients with fever, and that will cause some obvious and understandable concern," he said.

Will you be affected if arriving on an international flight to one of the five airports with enhanced screening?

The enhanced Ebola screening will target only passengers whose trips began in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea. It is unclear exactly how much time the additional screening will add, but air travelers headed to the U.S. from those nations should allow more time for clearing border controls at the five airports with enhanced screening.

At this point, travelers whose trips begin from other international destinations are not expected to see significant changes.

Why is the enhanced screening happening at only those five airports?

Only about 150 travelers arrive each day from the three West African countries, and 94% of them arrive at one of the five airports with enhanced screening, according to administration officials.

"The number of travelers is relatively small," Frieden said. "It's not an effort that would be particularly disruptive to large numbers of people. We think it's manageable."

Federal officials ordered new health screening Wednesday for travelers from West Africa arriving at five big U.S. airports as the death of the first Ebola patient in this country heightened concerns about containing the deadly virus.

The Customs and Border Protection agency will begin fever screenings Saturday at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and next week at Atlanta, Newark, Washington Dulles and Chicago O'Hare international airports.

"We believe these new measures will further protect the health of Americans, understanding that nothing we can do will get us to absolute zero risk until we end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa," said Tom Frieden, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The screening follows the death Wednesday of Thomas Eric Duncan, who arrived in the USA on Sept. 20 from Liberia.

Duncan, 42, sought treatment for symptoms at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas a few days later and was sent home with antibiotics. He returned in an ambulance two days later and was diagnosed with Ebola.

"He may have been too far gone for even our best supportive care," said Amesh Adalja, infectious disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Phil Smith, director of the biocontainment center at the Nebraska Medical Center, where an NBC News freelance cameraman is being treated for Ebola, said early treatment is key to survival. When a patient reaches the point of needing dialysis and respiratory help, as Duncan did, there is little doctors can do, he said.

The airports selected for Ebola screening receive 94% of the arrivals from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the countries hit hardest by the virus, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. That is about 150 travelers a day.

"This is almost by any measure a very small percentage of the traveling public," Earnest said.

Screeners will take temperatures and question travelers about their health and possible exposure to Ebola.

A traveler who has symptoms will be evaluated by a CDC quarantine officer and could be isolated or referred to other health authorities.

Travelers without symptoms will be asked to complete a daily temperature log and provide contact information.

Shares of Chimerix fell during the market's best day of the year Wednesday after the death of a person taking the company's drug to treat an Ebola infection.

The stock lost 32 cents, or 1%, to end at $32.91 but had been down much more during the day. Officials said Thomas Eric Duncan died after being the first confirmed case of a person with an Ebola in the U.S. Duncan was given Chimerix's experimental drug brincidofovir to help combat the infection.

The company's stock had been down as much as 15% during the day but recovered as the market rallied and investors absorbed the news. The shares have more than doubled in value this year as investors viewed the company's treatment as one of the most promising ways to deal with the Ebola outbreak.

On Tuesday, the company said its brincidofovir drug had good results for patients infected with certain respiratory diseases.

Speculators have been trying to find a way to profit from the Ebola outbreak. There is no cure to date. So far, the infection has killed thousands of people in West Africa, which is where it is most concentrated.

Investors speculated the drug from Chimerix would be a promising way to arrest the rise of the disease.

Another company involved in working on treatments for infectious diseases is Canada-based Tekmira Pharmaceuticals. That stock seemed to benefit a bit from its rival's setback. Shares of Tekmira added $1.12, or 5%, to end at $23.86 Wednesday. The company is working on a drug code-named TKM-Ebola. It's in trial phase, and investors hope it could be effective.

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, which is also developing treatments for hard-to-cure diseases, added 49 cents, or 4%, to end at $11.76 Wednesday. The company is based in Durham, N.C., and is working on a range of treatments for infectious diseases, including the flu.

As good times roll, Silicon Valley hears whispers of a tech bubble

If you listen carefully around these parts, you'll hear the buzzing. Can the good times last?

The Bay Area's high-tech economy is soaring. There are half-a- billion-dollar venture rounds (Airbnb) and $18 billion valuations (Uber). Second-quarter venture-capital investments totaled $13.8 billion, the most since the fourth quarter of 2000, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

The war for talent has led one company, real estate search engine 42Floors, to offer employees paid vacations, or "pre-cations," before a job begins. Hitting a San Francisco Giants game for team meetings is commonplace.

"I do think that we're probably in a bit of a bubble," says William Taylor, 43, who works in human resources at Adobe. "There's been a huge influx of VC capital over the last couple of years. It kind of feels like the early 2000s all over again."

Taylor's unscientific metric for gauging whether the times are getting too frothy is the "long lines at some pizza joint or (a place selling) the new brownie of the year," he says. "I judge by the lines."

Few here like to use the B-word: bubble. That's partly because suggesting that things could come crashing down is like whispering "divorce" at a wedding.

Nevertheless, stratospheric valuations and fizzy perk-filled times have caused a cautionary ripple across Silicon Valley.

First to go public with concern was Benchmark Capital's Bill Gurley, who a few weeks ago told The Wall Street Journal, "The venture capital community or start-up community is taking on an excessive amount of risk right now unprecedented since '99" -- an ominous date around these parts, because it marked the peak of the dot-com bubble.

Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson applauded Gurley's comments, noting in a blog post that "we have multiple portfolio companies burning multiple millions of dollars a month" and adding that he has been aggressive about urging his CEOs to cut back on spending and double down on their business models.

Then came an 18-tweet blitzkrieg from Valley investor and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz. He thanked Gurley and Wilson for the "vivid alarm," then picked up a virtual megaphone.

"When market turns, M&A mostly stops," he tweeted, a reference to big buying sprees such as Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp and Microsoft's recently announced $2.5 billion deal for Minecraft. "(Then) nobody will want to buy your cash-incinerating start-up. There will be no Plan B. VAPORIZE."

That all-caps prediction sounds about right to Luke Stebner, 27, a front-end developer at Scribd, who is particularly flummoxed by the $1 billion purchase by Amazon of Twitch.tv, an online forum for video gamers to watch fellow players in action. "I think there's a ton of money being thrown around and not really anything to back it up," he says.

Conversations with a range of tech investors and workers offer a more nuanced view of both the exuberance and risks inherent in the new tech frenzy.

"This is a very different environment than 15 years ago," says longtime Silicon Valley futurist Paul Saffo. "The issue here is risk from outside forces, particularly global events," he says.

Saffo points to everything from the Ebola crisis to a newly frosty geopolitical relationship with Russia as market depressants that could crash the tech party.

That said, tech founders with solid fundamentals should stay the course, says Ben Ling, a partner at Khosla Ventures.

"The thing that is different this time is that we are seeing a lot of companies actually creating value with real revenue and real customers," he says. "But VCs are urging entrepreneurs to get back to basics and don't overspend."

Ling's advice: Don't get locked into long leases, hire too many people or spend too much on marketing.

If times are destined to get tougher, the best way for investors to mitigate their risk is to focus not on sexy companies but sound ones, says Howard Hartenbaum of August Capital.

That approach dovetails with Amanda Kahlow's strategy. As CEO of 6Sense, a predictive sales intelligence company for B-to-B enterprises, Kahlow spent six years developing her product and received $12 million in funding last year. Kahlow says she has no interest in raising more money at the moment.

"I want to see how far we can go (with this round)," she says. Overall, "I don't think we are seeing as much of the waste, in terms of spending on big parties or business models that aren't sustainable."

Texas Ebola victim mourned far and wide ; He'll be cremated to reduce risk of infection

The first Ebola patient diagnosed in the USA was mourned Wednesday by close friends and family in Texas, where he arrived from Liberia less than three weeks ago.

"His suffering is over," said Louise Troh, Thomas Eric Duncan's girlfriend, who rented the apartment where he was staying. "My family is in deep sadness and grief, but we leave him in the hands of God."

Duncan, 42, arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 28, diagnosed with the deadly virus that has claimed 3,879 lives, according to the World Health Organization.

Death came after Duncan had been heavily medicated, on dialysis and semi-comatose, said Saymendy Lloyd, a Liberian activist from Washington who has been a spokeswoman for the family.

Duncan's 19-year-old son, Karsiah Duncan, who had not seen his father since the boy was taken to the USA at age 3, had flown to Dallas on Monday, but Duncan died before their scheduled closed- circuit-video meeting, Lloyd said. Duncan's family visited the hospital this week and glimpsed him using a camera system, but Tuesday, they declined to view him again.

"What we saw was very painful," Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, told the Associated Press.

Duncan's body will be cremated to reduce the risk that it could infect others, said David Lakey, Texas health commissioner.

Troh was relocated with her family after first being quarantined for six days in the unsanitized apartment. They are being monitored for signs of the illness.

Dallas officials mishandled Duncan's case at several points, including quarantining the family for days in a contaminated apartment, said Robert Murphy, a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at Northwestern University in Chicago.

"I hope other hospitals learn from this," Murphy said. "This guy probably would have done better if he had stayed in Liberia," where doctors are more familiar with Ebola. "The outcome couldn't have been any worse."

Hospital officials haven't discussed Duncan's treatment in detail but acknowledged not initially considering Ebola.

Wendell Watson, a hospital spokesman, said, "He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing."

Troh thanked the city, her church and the local Liberian community "for all the love and support they have shown. Without their help, I can't imagine how we could have endured. Our deepest sympathies go out to his father and family in Liberia and here in America."

Obama: World must 'step up' on Ebola ; President considers tighter health security measures for airline travelers who enter USA

President Obama urged other countries Monday to do more to help contain the Ebola virus in West Africa and said his team is looking at tighter screenings of airline passengers coming into the USA.

"We have not seen other countries step up as aggressively as they need to," Obama said.

The president pledged more "pressure" on fellow foreign leaders to "make sure that they are doing everything that they can to join us in this effort."

He did not specify which leaders. Nor did he specify additional security measures, except to say, "We're also going to be working on protocols to do additional passenger screening, both at the source (in West Africa) and here in the United States."

The president and his aides, including public health officials, evaluated their anti-Ebola strategies to decide whether more measures are needed to help keep the virus out of the USA.

The administration is under pressure in light of a case in Dallas, where a man infected with Ebola in Africa fights for his life. The president and aides "discussed the progress health officials in Texas have made in identifying and monitoring the contacts of the patient in Dallas," a White House statement said.

Obama and his national security aides met as a nurse in Spain became the first person known to catch Ebola outside West Africa.

The chances of an Ebola epidemic in the USA are "extremely low," Obama said, but "we don't have a lot of margin for error."

The president and aides stressed that the virus is not transmitted through the air or water, but rather through the exchange of bodily fluids.

Administration officials will study suggestions -- plenty of which are being made by lawmakers and members of the public -- on airport screening procedures.

"Our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in place in this country is sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak from occurring," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

He referred to a comment Friday by Obama homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, who said, "We are constantly going to evaluate what may be the most effective measures we can take."

One proposal officials have ruled out: a travel ban to and from West Africa, the main source of the virus. Earnest cited protocols at the nation's airports and border entry points and said, "We have a lot of confidence in that multilayered system."

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said federal agents at airports should conduct more stringent screenings for travelers from West Africa, including taking their temperature.

Shares of Chimerix rose Monday after the biopharmaceutical firm announced that one of its experimental drugs was being used to treat the first patient diagnosed with the Ebola virus in the U.S.

Following requests from treating physicians, the Food and Drug Administration approved emergency investigational drug applications that would allow using the drug known as brincidofovir to treat Thomas Eric Duncan.

The Liberian national, diagnosed with Ebola following a recent trip to West Africa, was reported in critical but stable condition Monday at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Chimerix shares closed up nearly 4.7% at $31.47 on Monday.

Chimerix CEO M. Michelle Berrey said tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health suggested that brincidofovir "may offer a potential treatment" to help combat the virus' deadliest outbreak in history.

"Chimerix is committed to working with global health organizations and government agencies in the fight against the Ebola virus outbreak," said Berrey in a statement announcing the development.

The Durham, N.C.-based company said it is working with the FDA to finalize a clinical trial protocol early this week "to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of brincidofovir" in patients who have confirmed diagnoses of the Ebola virus.

The experimental drug is an oral nucleotide analog that in test tube studies has shown evidence of antiviral activity against all five families of DNA viruses that affect humans, including the herpes virus family, cytomegalovirus and adenovirus, Chimerix said.

Chimerix is one of several companies developing experimental drugs or diagnostic tests focused on Ebola. Others include Canada- based Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, and Corgenix Medical, a Colorado- headquartered medical diagnostic testing firm.

Tekmira shares plunged Monday, closing down 18.7% at $24.00. The drop came after Leerink Research lowered its rating on the stock from "outperform" to "market perform," citing an overvaluation, Market Watch reported.

CDC chief: U.S. must fight Ebola at source ; Director warns ban on West Africa flights could hinder battle

The first priority of federal health officials is to protect Americans from Ebola, but "an outbreak anywhere is potentially a threat everywhere," the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.

In recent days, a handful of lawmakers, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, have called for restrictions on air travel between Ebola-affected countries in West Africa and the United States.

On Saturday, there was a brief scare at Newark Liberty International Airport when a passenger who had traveled from West Africa was ill on a flight from Brussels. A CDC official met the aircraft and the passenger was taken to a hospital, where "it became clear that the symptoms that individual had weren't consistent with Ebola," CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. The patient was discharged and was feeling better.

Despite the concerns sparked by such incidents, Frieden emphasized the importance of keeping the travel pipeline open to Ebola-stricken countries in order to fight the outbreak at its source.

"If we don't control the outbreak, there's a real risk that it could spread to other countries in Africa" and beyond, Frieden said. "To do that, we need regular travel."

"If we make it harder to fight Ebola in West Africa, we actually increase our own risk," he said. He noted that everyone leaving Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is being screened and said the CDC is considering a plan to screen everyone coming into the U.S. from those countries.

"We've seen a lot of understandable concern because of the deadly nature of Ebola," Frieden said. "We want (people) to be scared. We want them to have a healthy respect."

Health officials traced Duncan's contacts since he arrived in Dallas and found no one exhibiting any symptoms, said David Lakey, Texas health commissioner.

"We are very happy about that, but very cautious," Lakey said. "We are on high alert right now."

Duncan was in critical condition in the intensive care unit in Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Frieden said he had taken "a turn for the worse."

In August, two Americans who had contracted Ebola while working in Africa recovered in the United States after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp. Duncan is not receiving the drug because there is none left.

"It takes a long time to make that medicine," Frieden said, "so it's not going to be available any time soon."

The first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. last week prompted a debate on what measures should be taken to curb the spread of the virus.

If the Ebola case had been recognized by the Dallas hospital staff on the patient's first trip to the emergency room, he wouldn't have gone home to an apartment full of relatives, to possibly contaminate them.

People in the United States need to realize that we are not immune from disease just because we are American. That nonchalant attitude is what allowed the patient to be sent home on his first hospital visit.

Venus Friedrich

Thomas Duncan, the Ebola patient diagnosed in Dallas, deserves compassion from us. He reportedly helped a pregnant woman dying of Ebola, and that is why he caught the deadly disease.

If you think you can live in a bubble, free from all contagion in our global world, you are fooling yourselves.

I understand he brought Ebola with him, but we should not abandon or hate him.

Molly Jones

We've known about this virus for decades. Why haven't there been greater efforts to stop it?

My biggest fear is that the disease will mutate from a difficult- to-spread version into a deadlier, easier-to-spread, airborne version. If that happens, we will indeed have the deadliest pandemic on record.

Ramone DeCurta

LETTERS

We are being told that Ebola is at epidemic proportions in West Africa, and that we are safe because we are more aware and have better sanitation conditions. So why was the first Ebola case diagnosed in the United States last week, and do we have control of all the people whom this patient may have infected?

But it doesn't really matter, because with our porous Southern border, the chances are that if sick people don't come on airplanes, they might cross the border into the general population.

We had better hope that the treatment for the doctor cared for at an Atlanta hospital for Ebola, which seemed to be a success, will be available for the potential cases to come.

CDC multitasking hurts disease fight

"You had one job!" is the punchline on a popular Internet meme involving organizational screw-ups. Now critics are saying something similar about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to the agency's handling of the Ebola outbreak. Unfortunately, it's not true.

While we'd be better off if the CDC had only one job -- controlling disease -- the CDC has taken on all sorts of jobs that have distracted its management. Going forward, we need to learn this lesson for the CDC and for the government as a whole.

Ebola is nothing new, and disease control experts have long known the keys to stopping it.

Even so, when patient Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in Dallas, the system didn't work. Duncan was initially sent home from the hospital, though he told a nurse he had come from Liberia. Then, once he was quarantined, family members were left in a contaminated apartment for days with Ebola-ridden bedding and linens. Eventually, the family was moved to housing provided by a "local faith-based community."

Last week, the CDC admitted, "We let our guard down a little bit."

Yes. These problems should have been thought of in advance -- and maybe would have been, if the CDC actually had only one job. But it has multiple jobs, having involved itself in everything from playground safety to smoking in subsidized housing.

In 2014, the CDC received (together with the Public Health Service and related programs) $6.8 billion. But not all of that money went to infectious diseases. There were programs for:

Chronic disease prevention (obesity, heart disease, etc.)

Birth defects

Environmental health (asthma, safe water, etc.)

Injury prevention (domestic violence, brain injury, etc.)

Public health services (statistics, surveillance, etc.)

Occupational safety

These other tasks might or might not be important, but they're certainly a distraction from what's supposed to be the CDC's "one job" -- protecting America from a deadly epidemic. And to the extent that the CDC's leadership has allowed itself to be distracted, it has paid less attention to the core mission.

In an era where new disease threats look to be growing, the CDC needs to drop the side jobs and focus on its real reason for existence. But the problem isn't just the CDC. It's everywhere.

It seems that as government has gotten bigger, and accumulated more and more of its own ancillary responsibilities, it has gotten worse at its primary tasks: It can supervise snacks at schools but not defend the borders; it can tax people to subsidize others' health care plans but not build roads or bridges; and it can go after football team names but can't seem to deal with the Islamic State terror group. Multitasking results in poorer performance for individuals. It also hurts the performance of government agencies, and of government itself.

Government: You have one job. Try doing it.

Emergency physicians are critical to America's ability to respond to outbreaks of disease and disasters. This was demonstrated this week when an Ebola patient in Dallas first sought medical care in an emergency department.

It is reminiscent of 2001, when a patient infected with anthrax first came to an emergency department in Virginia complaining of flu- like symptoms: Vigilant emergency staff quickly alerted other hospitals, thus saving lives.

Emergency physicians are well trained to identify and manage infectious disease and disasters, and have practiced standard protocols to protect against blood-borne pathogens, such as Ebola and HIV, for at least 30 years.

Remember earlier this year, two Ebola patients were treated in an Atlanta hospital; they recovered and were discharged without infecting others.

America has the expertise and infrastructure to prevent the massive spread of Ebola as seen in West Africa. U.S. hospitals have equipment to care for patients with infectious diseases and the ability to isolate them for treatment. Alarm by the public, while understandable, is unwarranted.

However, this case highlights legitimate concerns. A 2014 report card, conducted by a task force of emergency physicians working with the Altarum Institute, gave America a C-minus for disaster preparedness. A recent study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine reports that the volume of emergency patients has grown by 31% from 2001 to 2011, while the number of emergency departments has grown only 2.2%.

The incredible pressure ERs have been under from increased demand and decreased resources leaves too little wiggle room for a bad flu season or a terrorist attack. Our national security depends on ERs having the resources they need.

Most people would run in the other direction from a patient exhibiting symptoms of Ebola. I and the 33,000 emergency physicians I represent run toward those patients, asking how we can help relieve their suffering.

Yesterday, today and tomorrow we will be there to provide the best care for our patients and do our best to contain this terrible disease, and the next one and the one after that.

Writing about public health can make you a little crazy.

After 14 years as a medical reporter, I'm a self-confessed germaphobe. I buy hand sanitizer in bulk. I haven't touched a raw chicken in years. I no longer eat sprouts or cantaloupes, which have caused far too many food poisoning outbreaks.

But I'm not even a little worried about getting Ebola.

Because viruses aren't all the same. Because Ebola is not the flu. And Dallas is not West Africa.

Unlike the common cold or viruses that cause food poisoning, Ebola does not spread through casual contact. Your kids aren't going to pick it up on a toy at day care. You aren't going to get Ebola because you touch a door handle or because someone sneezes on you.

Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, primarily blood. It can only spread after someone develops symptoms, such as a fever. So if you're exposed to Ebola, the odds are that you are going to know it.

So what has allowed Ebola to ravage West Africa?

Extreme poverty, a broken public health system and the trauma of countries newly emerged from years of brutal warfare.

These conditions aren't present in the USA. They aren't even present in much of Nigeria, where the Ebola epidemic appears to be over. Nigeria, which is considerably more developed than many of its neighbors, was prepared for the possibility of Ebola and took quick action to limit its spread.

I would hope that the USA would respond at least as effectively. While we may see more cases, it's just not likely that we are going to be overwhelmed.

Still, many people remain convinced that the USA is on the verge of an apocalypse.

In some ways, it's easy to see why people are confused.

For nearly two decades, since avian influenza emerged in China in 1996, we've been bombarded with one terrifying disease outbreak after another. Some of these outbreaks were real -- bird flu, swine flu, MERS, SARS and even anthrax. Other imagined threats -- such as a bioterrorist attack using smallpox -- haven't materialized.

But here's what all of the scary germs mentioned above have in common: They can spread through the air; Ebola doesn't. Public health leaders have almost 40 years of experience with Ebola, and they've never seen cases where someone got Ebola because an infected person coughed on them.

If Ebola spread that easily, there would be 7 million cases, not 7,100 cases, as the World Health Organization reports.

Is it possible that we will see more cases of Ebola? Yes.

But the USA has safely treated five people with Ebola-like viruses without any mass outbreak. These deadly viruses were here, in the USA, unbeknownst to most of us, and we all survived just fine.

Some of the excessive fear about Ebola reminds me of the hysteria over AIDS in the 1980s. That fear led an Indiana town to bar a 13- year-old boy named Ryan White from attending school. Ryan was infected with the AIDS virus from a blood transfusion, and he posed no threat to anyone.

I would hate to see anyone face that sort of discrimination today.

Does that mean we shouldn't care about Ebola? Absolutely not. The Ebola epidemic is heartbreaking. I've covered it for months, hoping that my stories will move people to help. Many reputable charities have been on the scene in West Africa since the first days of the outbreak in March. Americans who are concerned about Ebola should consider making a donation.

People might also want to consider protecting themselves from diseases that pose far greater risks in the USA. Half of Americans skip the flu shot, even though influenza kills up to 49,000 Americans a year.

As Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told me, "I bet that if we put out an Ebola virus vaccine tomorrow, half of this country would take it, even though it hasn't killed anyone who hasn't traveled" to the affected countries. "Yet you can't get parents to give their children an HPV vaccine to prevent a virus that kills 4,000 U.S. citizens a year."

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is disrupting some drilling plans for the USA's biggest oil company.

ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said at a news conference Thursday in Houston that the company is having second thoughts about plans to start offshore drilling in some areas in West Africa. USA TODAY was not present at the meeting, but company spokesman Patrick McGinn confirmed the comments first reported by Reuters in an e-mail.

"Safety, health and logistical issues related to Ebola will delay the planned late 2014 start of ExxonMobil's first exploration well offshore Liberia," McGinn said.

The postponement will affect one well off the Liberian coast. Exxon's operations in Nigeria are not affected.

The company also said it is restricting non-essential travel by employees to the West African countries where the outbreak has struck. The hardest-hit countries are Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but the virus has also struck in Senegal and Nigeria.

Shares of Exxon closed up 44 cents, or 0.5%, at $93.30.

Few large U.S. companies have significant activity even in the sub-Saharan Africa region, of which only a portion is affected by the outbreak. Many of the companies that do business in the sub- Saharan Africa region are centered in South Africa, far from the region affected by the outbreak.

Seven companies have disclosed a notable presence in the sub- Saharan region, says S&P Capital IQ:

Accenture, a global consulting firm, lists South Africa as one of its priority emerging markets.

Insurer American International Group lists Johannesburg Insurance as a significant unit.

Chevron in 2013 reported net production of 431 oil-equivalent barrels a day in Africa, which was 17% of its total.

Cisco Systems, the networking company, also maintains a presence in South Africa.

Citigroup, the global financial firm, has been aggressive in the emerging world. Revenue from emerging markets, which includes Africa, accounted for 41% of Citi's revenue in 2013.

Morgan Stanley operates a unit out of South Africa.

Starwood Hotels operates and franchises hotels all over the world, including 85 in Africa and the Middle East. Its stock fell 3.6% Wednesday.

An American freelance TV cameraman working for NBC News in West Africa is being flown back to the United States for treatment after testing positive for Ebola, the network said Thursday.

He is the fourth American to have contracted Ebola in Liberia. The journalist, 33 years old but not identified by name, reported symptoms on Wednesday. On Thursday he tested positive, NBC News said in a story online.

Ebola case in Texas exposes readiness gaps

When Thomas Eric Duncan walked into a Dallas emergency room last week, he might as well have been wearing a sign shouting: "Ebola." He had flown in from virus-ravaged Liberia. He told a nurse where he was from. He was suffering from flu-like symptoms. Everything hospitals have been warned to watch for.

Yet, he was examined, given some antibiotics and sent home -- only to return by ambulance three days later, deathly ill with the nation's first reported case of Ebola.

The hospital's breathtaking blunder is no reason for panic. Duncan is now isolated in a hospital room, authorities are tracking those he might have come in contact with, and four people are under quarantine. But the way events unfolded in the past week revealed a pair of serious gaps in the still-emerging system for countering the disease:

ER response. That Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, a sophisticated institution in a major city, could drop the ball so badly is troubling, especially after weeks of warnings and headlines about Ebola.

A nurse, using an Ebola "checklist" instituted by the hospital, learned that Duncan had come from Africa. Yet that was apparently not communicated to the team that cared for him in his first visit and dispatched him back into the community.

Poor communications are a common problem in hospitals, which use wristbands and other measures to avoid problems. But the Dallas experience ought to prompt every hospital administrator to develop surefire systems tailored to Ebola. Impressive-sounding federal strategies to fight Ebola won't mean much if front-line health professionals don't follow them.

Air travel. The glib response -- banning flights and travelers from West Africa -- might become necessary at some point, but imposing a quarantine of that scale is more problematic than it might seem at first blush. It would disrupt efforts to stop the infection at the source by interfering with the flow of doctors and aid. What's needed is tighter screening of people flying from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- at departure and arrival.

People boarding planes in West Africa are now routinely checked for fever and must answer written questions about whether they have been in contact with Ebola. This is far from foolproof: Fever typically doesn't show up until two to 21 days after exposure to the virus, and Liberian officials allege that Duncan lied about whether he had had contact with an Ebola patient.

What's needed are layers of protection, but customs officials at ports of entry in the U.S. have not added any special screening for travelers coming from West Africa. Since Wednesday, they've been handed informational "tear sheets" -- a transparently inadequate step that is matched by failings elsewhere in the system.

On Thursday, for example, local public health officials were still scrambling to get a cleanup crew to the apartment where Duncan had been so ill and where occupants are confined.

Top federal health officials are doing an excellent job of keeping the public informed. If Americans are to remain calm, though, people throughout the system need to earn their trust.

It's "Jobs Friday" -- again! No data point gets as much scrutiny, as much instant analysis or as much financial media coverage than the U.S. government's monthly employment report. So let the monthly teeth-grinding and nail-biting on Wall Street begin as the Bureau of Labor Statistics lets investors around the world know how many jobs were created in the U.S. last month.

The consensus opinion of Wall Street economists is that 215,000 jobs were created in September, up from a disappointing 142,000 in August, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 6.1%.

These two data points are potentially market-moving numbers, as they could influence the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy decisions and offer insights into the health of the economy and labor market. If the jobs number comes in too strong, it could "push market participants to scale back their appetite for risk and spur a further decline in U.S. stocks," as it could boost expectations for an earlier-than-expected rate hike next year, says David Song, a currency analyst at DailyFX.

The September jobs report comes at a time of great anxiety, as the stock market has suffered a serious stumble the past two weeks amid an array of new risks that few anticipated a month ago, including the first U.S. Ebola case, the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong and the U.S. bombing of Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.

A: Investors had plenty to worry about before. Now there's an Ebola outbreak to deal with. But the negatives on stocks should be limited for now.

So far, only the stocks with potential exposure to the problem or its various ripple effects have been hurt due to the outbreak.

Investors' first reaction after the first confirmed case was found in the U.S. was to sell off shares of travel-related companies, namely hotels and airlines. When people are worried about an outbreak of a disease, it can put a damper on their desire to travel. Some airlines, including Virgin America, even disclose in their regulatory filings that diseases can result in travel restrictions.

Investors are also keeping an eye on companies that operate in the affected region. ExxonMobil CEO's Rex Tillerson said Thursday the outbreak would delay the company's plan to set up offshore drilling in some areas of West Africa. Africa is an important part of Exxon's energy reserves, accounting for 20% of the company's developed and proven reserves. Other energy firms, including Chevron, also do direct business in the region.

Investors are hoping this will be the latest health crisis to come and go, so they can return to worrying about other things.

Health officials monitored a possible second Ebola patient Wednesday in Texas. The first had been initially sent home even though he'd been in an area of West Africa where the virus has created a deadly epidemic.

The first U.S. patient diagnosed with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, was sent home with antibiotics after he came to a Dallas emergency room with symptoms Friday and explained he was visiting from Liberia, according to his sister, Mai Wureh. He returned two days later and is in serious but stable condition in intensive care at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital.

Zachary Thompson, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told WFAA-TV that a second patient who had close contact with Duncan was being carefully watched.

"We have one confirmed case; there may be another case that is a close associate with this particular patient," Thompson said. "There should be a concern, but it's contained to the specific family members and close friends."

Health officials cautioned that more people probably will arrive in the USA carrying the virus. "Even with good screening at the airports, etc., it's possible there will be additional cases," said Jesse L. Goodman, infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center.

The virus, which has sickened more than 7,000 people in West Africa and killed more than 3,000, hadn't been diagnosed outside the region until Tuesday.

At a news conference Wednesday, Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Resources, said the team that treated the first patient didn't know he'd been to Africa when it decided to release him.

Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said officials are monitoring a "handful" of people with whom the Ebola patient had contact. They include five school-aged children.

The diagnosis of the first Ebola patient on U.S. soil this week may have put people in a panic, fearing the exotic virus more than mundane germs -- such as influenza -- that pose a far greater threat to the average American.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa -- the largest in the 40-year history of the virus -- has infected 7,178 and killed 3,338, according to the World Health Organization. Still, because Ebola is rare and relatively difficult to transmit, it kills far fewer people than diseases of which Americans are no longer afraid, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

"It's important to keep these things in perspective," says Lisa Maragakis, associate hospital epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.

She compared Americans' fear of Ebola to the fear of flying. Though many people are afraid to fly, Maragakis points out that far more people are killed in cars.

Influenza, which many people mistake for a "bad cold," claims up to 49,000 lives a year and sends more than 200,000 to the hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Half of the more than 100 children who died from flu in the USA last year were healthy kids with nothing to suggest they were more vulnerable than other children.

Measles, one of the most infectious diseases in the world, is far easier to catch than Ebola. If a person with measles comes in contact with 10 susceptible people -- those who have never had measles or who are unvaccinated -- nine of those people will come down with measles, says Julia Shaklee Sammons, medical director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

On average, people with measles spread the disease to 12 to 18 other people, according to the Michigan Center for Public Health Preparedness. In contrast, people with Ebola in West Africa spread the disease to one to two others, according to the WHO.

Unlike Ebola, measles spreads through the air. The measles virus is so hardy that it can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person leaves the room -- and still infect the next person to walk by, according to the WHO.

Even with a mortality rate of 2% to 15% -- far lower than the 70% mortality rate seen in the West African Ebola outbreak -- measles kills 122,000 people around the world each year, Hotez says. Before vaccines, measles killed 2.2 million every year.

Norovirus, the most common cause of both food-borne illness and stomach-related misery in the USA, can live on surfaces for days, so people can pick up the virus just from touching a door handle or a toy, Sammons says. Norovirus -- which causes diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps -- afflicts up to 21 million Americans a year and kills up to 800, according to the CDC.

"In general, Ebola is not easy to get," Sammons says.

Patients infected with Ebola can spread the virus only after they show symptoms, such as a fever, CDC Director Tom Frieden said Tuesday. Ebola can't spread through the air. It can spread only through direct contact with bodily fluids, primarily blood, Sammons says.

Ebola could be far less lethal in a developed country that has access to modern intensive care.

Fears about Ebola virus spread to travel stocks ; Airlines, hotels, casinos took a hit

Investors backed away from travel industry stocks Wednesday as they considered how the USA's first reported case of the Ebola virus might affect consumers' desire to travel.

United Airlines said Wednesday that it had been told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Ebola victim flew part of his itinerary on the airline after leaving Liberia for the United States on Sept. 19. The carrier said it believes the patient flew United from Brussels to Washington's Dulles International Airport on Flight 951 and from Washington to Dallas/ Fort Worth on Flight 822 on Sept. 20.

Shares of hotels, airlines and casinos were weak Wednesday due to the weak broad market, but also fanned by the initial worry that viral outbreaks are bad for the travel business. All but one of the 23 stocks in the Standard & Poor's 1,500 hotels, airlines and casinos industry groups closed down Wednesday. Those stocks were down by an average of 2.2%, which is worse than the roughly 1.3% decline by the S&P 500.

Among the hardest-hit travel stocks was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, with 1,200 properties. Its shares fell 3.6% to $80.20. Airlines were also hit hard. Shares of SkyWest fell 5% to $7.39. Southwest Airlines lost 3.6% to $32.55, JetBlue lost 3.5% to $10.24 and Delta Air Lines fell 3.5% to $34.90.

Some analysts advised patience. "We do not expect this to become a broad-based U.S. airline issue, and think this is an isolated case," said S&P Capital IQ in a research note. "Should flight restrictions become necessary at some point, we think U.S. airlines have limited exposure to the areas of the world where Ebola is an issue."

That's not to say that investors didn't find ways to think they can profit from the Ebola virus' dispersion. Shares of biotech companies specializing on rare and difficult-to-treat viral infections were favorites Wednesday.

Fall may be here, but don't blame October ; Month's not as scary as most investors think

October conjures up dark connotations on Wall Street, and the first day of trading in the month's first day this year did nothing to change that perception.

Indeed, the mere mention of October manifests feelings of impending doom among stock investors. October's susceptibility to history-making stock market crashes is to blame for its reputation as a month to be feared. The stock market crash of 1929, the Dow's 22.6% dive on Black Monday in 1987, and the market meltdown in October 2008 have left scar tissue on the psyche of the American investor.

"It's known as the jinx month," says Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac, a Wall Street bible that tracks the stock market's seasonal performance tendencies.

The jinx continued Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 238.19 points, or 1.4%, to 16,804.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.3% to 1946.16. And the Russell 2000 index fell 1.5%, leaving the small-stock index 10.2% below its March 2014 record close and putting it in correction territory.

The slide came on fears of slowing global growth after weak manufacturing reads in the eurozone and the U.S., as well as continuing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and Wall Street's first reaction to a new threat: the first U.S.-based Ebola case.

This October, there is no shortage of events with potential to cause big stock swings -- ranging from the Federal Reserve's final exit from its market-friendly bond-buying program to fresh readings on the U.S. labor market and the pace of economic growth in the third quarter. Most third-quarter earnings reports also come in October.

But does October deserve all the bad press? Is the market always drenched in red ink in October like a Halloween ghoul? Is October truly a month to be feared, a month where unexpected market shocks are destined to destroy even the best of investment plans?

The answer, statistically speaking, is "no," a review of historical performance statistics shows. For instance, there have been 12 times since 1928 when the S&P has fallen 1% or more the first day of October, says Bespoke Investment. And on average, the S&P was up 0.9% the next day, 3.1% in the next week and 3.8% the rest of the month, Bespoke says.

While there's no doubt the stock market in October has been prone to an occasional shock, an occasional dive off a cliff, an occasional wealth-melting setback, its performance track record looks far more stable when viewed over longer time periods.

The average return for the S&P 500 since 1928 is +0.43% -- and that positive return comes despite October declines of 19.9% in 1929, a 21.8% plunge in 1987 and a 16.9% free fall in 2008, according to Birinyi Associates. The large-company stock index has also posted positive returns 58% of the time in October since 1928, ranking it No. 6 out of all 12 months, InvesTech Research says. "But that doesn't erase the stigma that came from those big crashes, which creates a high degree of anxiety going into October," says James Stack, a money manager and editor of InvesTech Research.

Another potential shock absorber for stocks in October is an offsetting seasonal phenomenon: The market tends to fare well in the final three months of the year when there is a midterm congressional election. The fourth quarter of a midterm election year has posted the best performance of all 16 quarters of the four-year presidential election cycle, InvesTech Research says.

But hidden beneath the long-term average is the feared hyper- volatility October is known for.

Big swings. Out of all 12 months in the postwar era since 1945, both the biggest monthly gain and the largest monthly loss for the S&P 500 occurred in October, says S&P Capital IQ. A 16.3% gain in October 1974 is the No. 1 gainer, and the 21.8% decline in 1987 is the No. 1 loser.

Big losses. Adding to the angst is the fact that five of the six largest daily declines suffered by the S&P 500 since 1928 have occurred in October, says InvesTech Research. The biggest one-day decline: Oct. 19, 1987, when the index plunged 20.5%. The most recent was -9.0% on Oct. 15, 2008.

"Investors fear the month," says Sam Stovall, an investment strategist at S&P Capital IQ, noting that virtually every investor took a financial hit during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. "Plus, some investors experienced the Crash of '87, and most have read about the Crash of 1929."

Add in the fact that the market hasn't had a 10% correction in almost three years, and it's clear why anxiety is running high again as October arrives, says Stack. Still, the ingredients for a major bear market crash are absent, Stack argues, although a shock such as the Fed changing its tune and saying rate hikes are coming much sooner than expected could spark market upheavel, he adds.

Ebola risk seen as low on flights

Health officials say the risk of spreading Ebola through airline travel is low, even though a man who traveled from Liberia to the United States was diagnosed with the disease, because travelers from affected countries are screened before boarding and the often fatal disease is not transmitted when an infected person has no symptoms.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has infected 6,500 people and killed 3,000, has prompted screening of travelers for fever at airports across Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and in Lagos, Nigeria.

The patient diagnosed Tuesday in Dallas had flown Sept. 19 from Liberia and arrived in the USA on Sept. 20. He had passed the fever screening and developed symptoms only on Sept. 24. He sought treatment Sept. 26.

United Airlines said in a statement Wednesday that it had been told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Ebola victim flew part of his itinerary on the airline. The carrier said it believes the patient flew from Brussels to Washington's Dulles International Airport on Flight 951 and from Washington to Dallas/Fort Worth on Flight 822.

Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says health officials are tracking a handful of the man's contacts in the United States.

"At this point, there is zero risk of transmission on the flight," Frieden said. "It does not spread from someone who doesn't have fever or other symptoms."

Ebola is not spread through breathing the air, like influenza or tuberculosis. Ebola is spread by direct contact with blood, mucus or other fluids from an infected person.

The disease usually incubates in an infected person for two to 21 days. Initial symptoms include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash and bleeding.

The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations that recommends policies for airlines, are reluctant to halt flights to entire regions because of the importance of travel and getting health care workers to the affected area.

"The risk of a traveler becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing the disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported," the WHO said in a statement.

WHO cites Nigeria as nearing an end to its outbreak because of quickly isolating its patients and tracing their contacts.

A very sick traveler from Liberia arrived in Lagos on July 20 and, before Ebola was recognized, he had exposed 72 people on the aircraft, at the airport and at a hospital, according to WHO. Nigeria traced the contacts through the unnamed airline and airport to reduce the spread of the illness.

All told, Nigeria confirmed 19 cases of Ebola and identified 900 contacts. Nearly all have completed a three-week monitoring period that will end today, according to WHO. The country has seen no new cases since Aug. 31.

"One hundred percent of the individuals getting on planes are screened for fever before they get on the plane," Frieden said. "If they have a fever, they are pulled out of the line, assessed for Ebola and don't fly unless Ebola is ruled out.

"But that doesn't rule out a situation like this one, where someone was exposed and came in while they were incubating the disease but not sick with it," he said.

Even after the arrival of Ebola in Texas, our national dialogue on the disease remains overly optimistic and full of misleading assurances from elected officials and public health experts. What the public needs to know and understand is this: Ebola is deadly and, like all viruses, it can mutate.

Right now, the disease spreads from person to person by bodily fluids, but it could become airborne. If it does, we could face a public health challenge like we haven't seen here since smallpox or polio. Even if Ebola isn't the disease to shatter our illusions, there is a good chance some other novel infectious disease will.

We have an overconfident view about the capabilities of our health care and public health systems. It's due in part to willful ignorance and in part to leaders who want the public to believe they've got things more under control than they actually do. The reality is that we have significantly underinvested in public health for decades.

The annual budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is $11 billion, about what Americans will spend on Halloween festivities this year. And state and local public health agencies are in dire need of new funding.

Public health departments in the past few years have had to cut critical programs and tens of thousands of jobs. Our public health system is not ready to deal with a challenge like Ebola if the situation takes a turn for the worse.

Americans also overestimate our health care system. Any large- scale disease outbreak could overwhelm us. Though we have plans to use portable pop-up hospital tents and beds to expand surge capacity, we haven't figured out how to create pop-up nurses and doctors to staff them.

Many in public office cite the quick production of a vaccine as the panacea. That's naive. It could take a year or more to develop a vaccine for a novel infectious disease that could be ready for widespread use. (The current Ebola outbreak started in December.) In the interim, a disease would have free reign to spread while health workers can offer little to the afflicted.

Our leaders are so concerned with avoiding panic that they're willing to say anything, even if it shreds their credibility. Remember, we were initially told the Ebola outbreak would be stopped before it got too large. Now estimates put the potential number of victims over a million.

Sending 3,000 troops to West Africa is a Band-Aid. With Ebola in Texas, we can no longer pretend that our country's greatest threats are from terrorists.

We need to change our world view (sooner rather than later) to appreciate that novel infectious disease outbreaks could be one of our greatest threats that require real resources and significant funding if we are to stand a chance.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on Tuesday the first case of Ebola in a critically ill patient diagnosed in a U.S. hospital.

The patient -- who has been isolated since his symptoms were recognized -- is an unnamed man in intensive care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Hospital workers noted his case because of his symptoms and recent travel history. It is not known whether he has infected others, although CDC officials are tracing his contacts.

The man left Liberia Sept. 19 and arrived in the USA the next day but had no symptoms when leaving Africa or arriving here, said Thomas Frieden, the CDC director. The patient became sick Sept. 24, and he sought care two days later. He was sent home but returned to a hospital and was admitted Sept. 28. Frieden did not reveal the man's nationality but said he came to the USA to visit relatives.

Frieden said there is no danger of the sort of widespread outbreak seen in West Africa. "This is the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. and the first strain of this Ebola diagnosed outside of Africa," he said. "I have no doubt that we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country. It is certainly possible that someone who has had contact with this patient could develop Ebola, but there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here."

Ebola patients are contagious once they begin showing symptoms, such as fever, diarrhea and vomiting, Frieden said.

Someone with these symptoms could infect health care workers, such as people working in an emergency room. The virus is spread only through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or vomit, says Brett Giroir, CEO at Texas A&M Health Science Center, an intensive care specialist.

Ebola does not spread through the air, like measles or the flu, said David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Fauci: 'Aggressive' effort needed to beat Ebola

The nation's top expert on infectious diseases warns that without a bigger response, the world risks seeing "close to the worst-case scenario" in the Ebola crisis in West Africa, amid projections that a million people could die.

"The community of nations -- European nations, other developed countries that have resources to do it, the U.N., the African Union - - if they get involved in a very aggressive way to do infection control, we can put an end to this, I'm confident," says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. "But if we have a lot of motion but no action, a lot of signing of resolutions with no resources, it's not going to happen."

Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used computer models to calculate that the deadly virus could infect 1.4 million people in Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of January unless there is effective containment. A separate study in the New England Journal of Medicine said the virus could become endemic.

He rates the world's response as "inadequate," Fauci told Capital Download, USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series.

Sunday, the NIH Clinical Center admitted an American doctor who had been volunteering in Sierra Leone and was exposed to the Ebola virus. The patient is under observation in an isolation unit.

Fauci, who has led the infectious-diseases institute for three decades, says he wouldn't be surprised if a case or two of Ebola erupted in the USA.

"Certainly it is conceivable that we will have someone who is infected in West Africa, without symptoms, does not know that they are infected, get on a plane and land somewhere -- Paris, London, Washington, New York -- get off and then get ill, go to an emergency room, be seen by doctors, nurses and health providers, and might even infect one or two people," he says. "That's entirely feasible.

"But what we will not have is an outbreak, an outbreak that is anything like what you're seeing in West Africa," he says.

That's because the U.S. health care system would be able "to identify, isolate, contact-trace and shut off an outbreak." In contrast, the three West African nations most affected by Ebola -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- have "a close-to-dysfunctional health care system."

Though he discounts the prospects of a wider epidemic in the USA as "so unlikely," Fauci says national security nonetheless would be threatened by the collapse of the African countries that face "catastrophe" because of the disease -- and the "ripple effects" Americans could feel from economic or political dominoes toppling.

President Obama has announced that the United States would establish a military command in Liberia and build 17 Ebola treatment centers in the region.

'Syria Deeply' founder turns focus to Ebola ; 'Ebola Deeply' won't let story disappear

Lara Setrakian, the impresario behind the deeply immersive and critically acclaimed website Syria Deeply, is about to take the same approach to Ebola.

On Oct. 15, if not before, Setrakian will launch Ebola Deeply, which will feature original reporting about the frightening outbreak of the deadly disease and will aggregate the best reporting on the subject from elsewhere.

"We want to make sure that Ebola doesn't disappear when the next big story comes along," she says.

Setrakian, who says she's in talks with several high-profile partners for the initiative, plans to both mimic and build on the approach at Syria Deeply, which has several staffers outside of Syria and more than 20 correspondents inside the war-torn country providing original content. It also provides a one-stop amalgamation of reporting by other news outlets. The Ebola crisis is concentrated in a handful of West African nations, with Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone being the hardest hit.

"We want to integrate local voices to tell a bigger story while at the same time unifying (the coverage) that's out there," she says.

All of which is excellent news. Ebola is a complex and important story that needs constant scrutiny. It makes perfect sense as a target for Setrakian's immersive approach.

Setrakian, a former correspondent for ABC News and Bloomberg TV, had planned to take on climate change in her next endeavor, Arctic Deeply. But given the urgency of the Ebola exigency, she decided to shift gears.

Reporters in the affected countries came to her to express dissatisfaction about how the crisis is being covered, Setrakian says. They noted that many international journalists had left the region -- covering such a contagious disease is an extremely dangerous proposition -- and they increasingly felt they were on their own. "They needed allies," Setrakian says. She found that public health officials shared concerns about the coverage.

Ebola Deeply is very much a work in progress, with many details still to be worked out. That's in line with Setrakian's firm embrace of the concept of the lean start-up. "You start with a minimum viable product, then you refine it and build on it," she says. "It doesn't have to be polished and perfected (at the outset) to be useful to our readers, as long as it's journalistically solid."

Once it's up and running, the site will evolve and grow, with user-generated and interactive components becoming key parts.

Setrakian, an evangelist for the deep-dive, single-topic approach to journalism, discovered its power when she was covering the 2009 uprising in Iran. Not many people were, and Setrakian, who was based in Dubai at the time, found she soon developed quite a following on Twitter. It made her realize that there was an audience out there tied together not by geography but by intense interest in a subject.

After the Arab Spring erupted, Setrakian felt the media didn't have much staying power when it came to the individual rebellions, and thus was born Syria Deeply. And people took notice.

The day it launched in December 2012, the website Fast Company said hello with this headline: SYRIA DEEPLY OUTSMARTS THE NEWS, REDEFINES CONFLICT COVERAGE."

Since then, Setrakian has been engaged in a research project on the intense single-topic approach at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.

And now she's taking the concept into very different terrain.

"We'll see how this works in connection with a public health crisis," she says. "I'm very excited."

Ebola fighters charge ahead to tackle crisis ; Battling virus takes physical, emotional toll on volunteers who delve into Hot Zone

The goggles that physician Daniel Lucey wore to protect against the Ebola virus almost blinded him. The protective suit he donned in Sierra Leone is a one-man sauna, and the only available gloves are, he says politely, "sub-optimal." After one tore, he wore three per hand.

Lucey, an adjunct professor of immunology and microbiology at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, spent much of August on the front lines of the biggest Ebola outbreak in history, confronting the obstacles that face those trying to subdue this lethal virus.

Those obstacles did not deter him: After less than a month at home, he will leave Sunday to treat Ebola patients in Liberia.

"It's dangerous," Lucey acknowledges, but "if I don't do it, who's going to do it, except the people who have no choice?"

Lucey is one of a cadre of volunteers and professionals who have heeded the call to help in the Hot Zone -- the cities and rural areas in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia where Ebola is on the rampage, killing at least 2,900.

Nearly 200 health care workers have died of Ebola, and two American doctors and an American helping in a hospital were infected but survived. That hasn't kept a small but determined band of health workers from journeying to West Africa to train medical staffers, run public education campaigns and care for the sick.

"My wife says, 'Why don't you stay at home with your family?'" says retired pediatrician Alan Jamison of Morristown, Tenn., who spent much of July volunteering in Liberia for non-profit Medical Teams International. His family both supports him and worries about him, "but I feel like I have another calling."

The unprecedented toll on those providing care has prompted some non-profit groups to step up their services to personnel serving in West Africa. International Medical Corps, for example, has added mental health staff for volunteers to consult before, during and after their stints.

The Ebola effort "is an unusual response, and it requires unusual measures," says Margaret Aguirre of International Medical Corps. The community reaction to those risking their lives by going abroad and treating the deadly virus is an important part of the effort.

Those who venture into Ebola territory are few but tough, many having seen duty in places such as Haiti and Libya. Even for these veterans, the Ebola outbreak makes demands almost too heavy to bear. There's the crushing workload imposed by the paucity of people willing to help. There's the protective gear, which, when combined with West Africa's heat and humidity, is impossible to tolerate for more than a few hours. There's the ever-present fear of infection.

"We're not packing ourselves as tight when we sit in chapel together," says John Fankhauser, a staffer of the non-profit SIM who works at a hospital in Liberia. "We don't shake hands. I'm mindful of everything I touch. It's draining, I have to admit."

Most distressing is the restrictions Ebola puts on those who devote their lives to help others. Recently, a woman infected with Ebola had a seizure at the hospital where Adam Levine, a volunteer for non-profit International Medical Corps, was working.

Levine, an emergency medicine specialist at Brown University Medical School, wasn't wearing protective gear. He could only stand by helplessly -- the first time in his career, he says, that he didn't rush to the side of a patient racked by a seizure.

It's the children who died alone in the Ebola isolation ward this summer who haunt physician Lance Plyler, who returned to the USA from Liberia in August. The limitations imposed by the protective suits meant medical staffers couldn't be at the bedsides every moment.

"We saw, time and time again, children perishing on their own," says Plyler, a staffer at Samaritan's Purse, a non-profit group. "We desperately wanted to be with them all the time, but it was physically impossible. It was gut-wrenching."

Amid the horror, medical personnel linger on the victories. Levine thinks of the nurse, critically ill when she entered the hospital, who is now on the mend. "It feels really good to think there's somebody we're saving," he says.

President Obama told United Nations members Thursday that the Ebola virus is "spreading at alarming speed" and that all countries must do more to prevent its spread across the globe.

"If unchecked, this epidemic could kill hundreds of thousands of people in the coming months," Obama said at a special U.N. meeting.

As he wrapped up three days of U.N. meetings, Obama told delegates that the "horrific disease" that has killed hundreds in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea threatens to undermine regional security, stall economic growth, and create "a humanitarian catastrophe." The United States and other nations are providing help to West Africa nations, Obama said, but it is not enough.

More countries need to provide assets such as air transport, medical evacuation, health care workers, equipment or treatment, Obama said. He called on foundations and businesses to contribute money and resources.

Last week, the president announced a $1 billion-plus plan that involves the deployment of about 3,000 troops in Liberia to build facilities and assist with training Africans to treat Ebola victims.

Meanwhile, American doctor Richard Sacra, who contracted Ebola when delivering babies at a hospital in Liberia, survived his illness and was released from an Omaha hospital Thursday.

Sacra, 51, was flown to the Nebraska Medical Center because it has a special unit to care for patients with dangerous infectious diseases. Sacra was in Liberia working as a medical missionary for SIM USA.

"I am so grateful," Sacra said in a written statement. "Just so incredibly grateful to have gotten through this illness."

In the hospital, Sacra received a blood transfusion from another American physician who survived Ebola, Kent Brantly, in the hope that Brantly's blood would contain antibodies to help Sacra. Sacra is also one of a handful of Ebola patients to receive an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola made by Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceuticals.

Sacra's doctors don't know which of these therapies gets credit for his survival.

Climate march highlights perils of capitalism

A pair of massive protests in New York this week brought together climate change, Wall Street and the need for regulation as concern about the future of the planet melded with a sense that capitalism without rules poses an existential threat.

"None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria," is what no less a personality than actor Leonardo DiCaprio told world leaders assembled for the U.N. climate summit on Tuesday.

DiCaprio, who took part in the People's Climate March on Sunday that drew an estimated 300,000 protesters, addressed the group "not as an expert, but as a concerned citizen."

"As an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems," DiCaprio said. "I believe humankind has looked at climate change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else's planet, as if pretending that climate change wasn't real would somehow make it go away."

After Sunday's March, a smaller protest on Monday, Flood Wall Street, resulted in more than a hundred arrests after protesters at the end of the day ignored police orders to disperse.

One of the speakers at Monday's protest, Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, has cast the debate over climate change as a clash between "deregulated capitalism" and the welfare of mankind in her new book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate, which was published last week.

"We have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism," she writes in the book, "the reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis."

Of course Klein, author of an earlier book called Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, is an avowed opponent of neoliberalism in general for what she sees as its pernicious effects on society, but that is not the reason she blames if for the lack of action on climate change.

"It's part of the same story, the same logic," she said on MSNBC last week. It is the result of an ideology, she says, "that values nothing but profit."

Effective action against climate change requires the type of government regulation that undermines the free market ideology currently driving companies, Wall Street, and -- to the extent that politicians are hostage to big-money interests -- Washington.

"We need to break a whole bunch of the free market rules that these guys hold very dear," she told Chris Hayes in the television interview. "We need to regulate."

This was DiCaprio's message to the U.N. assembly as well.

"To be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car," the actor said. "This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action."

Against this backdrop, at a time when airstrikes in Syria and an Ebola outbreak in Africa upstage the longer term crisis posed by climate change, President Obama's pledge at the U.N. to take account of climate change in U.S. development aid seemed woefully inadequate as a response.

Klein had anticipated this inadequacy in her Guardian column last week.

"It's not simply that our leaders aren't leading us -- at an appropriate gallop -- away from fossil fuels and towards the renewable energy revolution that is both technologically and economically feasible," she wrote.

"It's that most of them are doubling down on the very energy sources that are most responsible for the crisis, cheering on the extractive industries as they dig up the most greenhouse gas- intensive fossil fuels on the planet: oil from the tar sands, gas from fracking, extra-dirty lignite coal."

This is a fairly apt description of Obama, who never fails to boast in his State of the Union speeches about the U.S. boom in natural gas production from hydraulic fracturing, and whose administration has yet to take a stand on the Keystone XL pipeline that will support production of tar sands oil in Canada.

Given this inaction by government leaders, Klein says, people seek refuge in "mental tricks," finding excuses, grasping at potential technological fixes or simply putting their heads in the sand.

Whether the demonstrations in New York mark some sort of turning point in the climate change debate remains to be seen. But it has now been joined to the populist groundswell against rogue banks on Wall Street, the growing gap in inequality of incomes and opportunity, and resentment that corporate money has paralyzed Washington.

The type of revolution in government action needed to cope with climate change and other social ills is what threatens corporate interests the most and makes them so desperate in their opposition, Klein says, even though this change could bring numerous benefits to society.

"It's not the end of the world," she said of the needed government activism in her MSNBC interview. "It's the end of their world."

Darrell Delamaide has reported on business and economics from New York, Paris, Berlin and Washington.

The world is making progress on issues from human rights to global warming, President Obama said Wednesday, but all of that could be undone by the largest threat: extremist violence.

In his annual address to the United Nations, Obama urged all countries and religions -- especially Islam -- to reject the extremist ideologies that fuel bloodshed and threaten global stability.

"As we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress," Obama said. "And that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world."

The president's visit to the United Nations came the same week the United States began airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State, one of the extremist groups cited by Obama. Attacks continued Wednesday. Last month, the president authorized similar strikes against the militant group in Iraq.

The escalation prompted some critics to question whether the United States is the right country to address the problems of global violence.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on CBS' This Morning, protested the attacks in Syria, saying, "No terrorist group can be eradicated and destroyed through aerial bombardments."

Addressing the General Assembly, Obama defended the Syria and Iraq airstrikes that have targeted the al-Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan group, as well as Islamic State positions.

Citing the Islamic State's record of violence, which includes beheadings of hostages, Obama told the delegates, "The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force."

Obama used the words "fanaticism," "hate" and "evil" to describe the Islamic State, condemning it as a "network of death."

The United States has assembled "a broad coalition" to defeat the militants, including Arab states, Obama said. He spoke of plans to train forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight on the ground against the Islamic State and other jihadists.

"We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power," he said.

Obama's speech was in sharp contrast to his U.N. address last year. Then, he spoke of ending "a decade of war" that included Iraq and Afghanistan and having the United States shift away "from a perpetual war footing."

The threats of extremism dominated Obama's crowded schedule Wednesday, the second of three days of U.N. meetings. It included an Obama meeting with the new prime minister of Iraq and a special U.N. Security Council session devoted to the problem of "foreign fighters."

The council passed a resolution requiring countries to crack down on the recruitment of fighters who could move to other nations to launch attacks. That includes efforts to shut off financing for terrorist groups.

To that end, Obama's Treasury and State departments announced sanctions on 24 groups and individuals they say have aided the movement of foreign fighters.

Intelligence agencies estimate that more than 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries have traveled to training bases in Syria in recent years, Obama told the Security Council.

In calling on Muslims to denounce extremist ideology, Obama said a lethal group of terrorists "have perverted one of the world's great religions."

Thomas McDonnell, a professor of international law at Pace Law School in White Plains, N.Y., said it's commendable for Obama to speak out against global extremism.

The challenge, he said, is that many people around the world see the U.S. as a longtime backer of repressive regimes, especially in the Middle East.

"We are are not exactly a neutral arbiter," McDonnell said. "It's a complicated situation."

Citing criticism of the United States, Obama acknowledged the nation's faults, specifically last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.

Though "we have our own racial and ethnic tensions," Obama said, the United States has "worked to address our problems, to make our union more perfect."

Noting hopeful signs around the world, Obama said the prospects of major wars between global powers are reduced, poverty rates are falling and the Internet is helping to educate millions.

Obama also spoke of a "pervasive unease in our world" about events such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Russian aggression in Ukraine -- and terrorism.

"We come together at a crossroads," he said. "Between war and peace, between disorder and integration, between fear and hope."

WHO: Ebola outbreak could last forever ; That's the danger if it isn't controlled soon

If the world doesn't get the Ebola outbreak in West Africa under control quickly, the disease could become a permanent fixture in the region, spreading as routinely as malaria or the flu, the World Health Organization warns today in a new report.

While some experts dispute that dire scenario, many agree that the virus could circulate for years if it's not stopped soon.

The notion that Ebola could become endemic in West Africa -- spreading routinely, rather than in sporadic outbreaks -- is "a prospect that has never before been contemplated," according to the report, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

There could be 20,000 cases by Nov. 2, with thousands of new cases per week, the report said. About 70% of patients are dying from the illness.

"We are concerned that without a massive increase in the response, way beyond what is being planned in scale and urgency it will prove impossible to bring the epidemic under control," wrote researchers Jeremy Farrar, of the Wellcome Trust, and Peter Piot, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in an accompanying editorial.

The Ebola virus has caused more than 20 outbreaks in the past four decades, mostly in remote villages in central Africa. Although some outbreaks were severe, public health officials were always able to put a stop to them -- even without effective treatments or vaccines -- by quickly and methodically diagnosing patients, making a list of everyone those patients might have exposed and then monitoring those contacts.

The current outbreak appears to have begun the same way in the West African country of Guinea, with the first cases in December. The virus spread for three months, however, before public officials realized they were dealing with an Ebola outbreak. In contrast, doctors in the Democratic Republic of Congo took just days to confirm an Ebola outbreak after seeing the first cases.

In West Africa, Ebola has now infected at least 5,854 people -- killing 2,803 -- in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, according to the WHO, which notes that the total number of cases likely much higher, because many victims haven't yet been counted.

MAY 16: MOUSE INFECTED WITH VIRUS SIMILAR TO EBOLA ESCAPES

MAY 12: FERRETS INFECTED WITH DEADLY STRAIN OF AVIAN FLU VIRUS ESCAPE

MAY 16: DANGEROUS BACTERIA SHIPPED BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN KILLED

Scientists wearing spacesuit-like protective gear searched for hours in May for a mouse -- infected with a virus similar to Ebola - - that had escaped inside Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana, one of the federal government's highest-security research facilities, according to newly obtained incident reports that provide a window into the secretive world of bioterror lab accidents.

During the same month at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, a lab worker suffered a cut while trying to round up escaped ferrets that had been infected with a deadly strain of avian influenza, records show. Four days later at Colorado State University's bioterrorism lab, a worker failed to ensure dangerous bacteria had been killed before shipping specimens -- some of them still able to grow -- to another lab where a worker unwittingly handled them without key protective gear.

Nobody was sickened in the incidents, and the mouse was caught the next day. Yet in the wake of serious lab mishaps with anthrax and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that prompted an uproar, these additional incidents are further fueling bipartisan concern about lab safety.

"As long as we keep having an ad hoc system of oversight in this country, we're going to keep seeing more and more incidents," said U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight subcommittee that held a hearing in July on the CDC incidents.

Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said, "These incidents underscore why the committee has been investigating the safety of high-containment labs."

The CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture jointly run the Federal Select Agent Program that oversees laboratories working with dangerous viruses, bacteria and toxins called "select agents" because they're deemed to pose serious threats to people and agriculture and could potentially be used as bioweapons.

Citing bioterrorism laws, the Federal Select Agent Program doesn't publicly release details about accidents occurring in regulated labs. The details of the incidents in May were revealed in minutes of those labs' institutional biosafety committees and related reports obtained by Edward Hammond, former director of the Sunshine Project, an independent lab watchdog group that operated from 1999-2008, until it lost funding.

Hammond said it's difficult for policymakers and the public to judge the safety of labs. "We need to require reporting and for reporting to be public," he said.

Colorado State University

At Colorado State University in Fort Collins on May 16, a researcher in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab boiled tubes containing specimens of Burkholderia pseudomallei, records show. The bacteria, which can cause symptoms including pneumonia and life- threatening bloodstream infections, are classified as a Tier 1 select agent - a designation given to a handful of pathogens deemed to present "a severe threat to public health and safety."

As a check to ensure the specimens had been deactivated by boiling, the worker put a sample from each tube into an incubator to see if the bacteria would grow, the records show. Before the results of that safety check, the tubes were sent the same day to a lower- level lab at the same facility where another lab staffer - whose only safety gear noted in the report was a pair of gloves - transferred them to new tubes.

Colorado State's vice president for research, Alan Rudolph, told USA TODAY that it had been standard procedure not to wait for confirmation of inactivation because the process had been 100% successful in the past.

But on May 19, two of the 20 supposedly sterile safety-check samples showed signs of growth. The researcher without proper protective gear received antibiotics and never showed signs of infection, the university said. The lab now requires a 24- to 48- hour wait time to check for any growth, Rudolph said, and some researchers wait 48-72 hours.

"We have a great track record of safety," Rudolph said. "This is an incident, as we reported, and we should learn from it."

St. Jude Hospital

At St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which has an internationally recognized influenza research facility, a worker in an enhanced BSL-3 lab discovered on May 12 that five ferrets had escaped their cage. The ferrets had been inoculated a week earlier with the deadly H7N9 avian influenza virus but didn't show any symptoms, according to the hospital's incident report.

H7N9 is a strain of bird flu that was first identified in 2013 as having seriously sickened some people in China. Most people sickened by the strain have suffered severe respiratory illness, and about one-third have died.

As the worker at St. Jude corralled the ferrets and put them back in their cage, she noticed a tear in her double gloves and a small cut to her right index finger. Although her risk of exposure to the H7N9 virus was deemed "very low," the worker was offered an anti- viral drug and underwent blood tests to look for signs of infection, and none was found.

According to the hospital's incident report, the research was overseen by Richard Webby.

In June, St. Jude's biosafety committee approved a new project proposed by Webby to do a controversial type of research that the minutes say has the "high likelihood of conferring enhancements" - in other words making more dangerous - strains of avian influenza virus that have a low ability to produce disease.

In August 2013, Webby was among several co-signers of a letter in the journal Nature arguing that controversial "gain of function" experiments are needed on the H7N9 virus to understand its potential to cause a pandemic if it were to mutate naturally. Other scientists oppose the work as too dangerous.

Officials from St. Jude did not answer many of USA TODAY's questions. In an e-mailed statement, St. Jude said, "We have a robust biological safety program that meets and exceeds all federal standards." The hospital did not answer questions about Webby's new research but said, "The project has not been started at St. Jude."

Rocky Mountain Labs

Around 11 a.m. on May 16, scientists in one of Rocky Mountain Laboratories' Biosafety Level 4 labs in Hamilton, Mont., thought they had fully anesthetized several mouselike rodents called Mastomys. The animals had been infected with a strain of Lassa virus 21 days earlier, according to the lab's incident report.

Lassa virus causes a type of hemorrhagic fever that has symptoms similar to Ebola, such as bleeding from the gums, eyes or nose and repeated vomiting. According to the CDC, 100,000 to 300,000 people are infected with Lassa fever each year in West Africa, and about 5,000 die from it.

Rocky Mountain Laboratories is operated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of the National Institutes of Health.

The spacesuit-clad scientist reached into the cage to remove a sedated mouse that would undergo a procedure. That's when another of the rodents jumped out of the cage and dropped to the floor. It was last seen running behind the table before it disappeared. For "1-2 hours," the scientists in the bulky, pressurized protective suits searched for the mouse - but couldn't find it, records show.

Live traps containing food were placed around the room, and staffers were instructed "to visually make eye contact with the floor surrounding the door to ensure the rodent did not attempt to leave the room," records say. The next morning, workers captured the animal in the necropsy room, where dead animals are dissected. "The animal was disposed of," the records say, and surfaces were decontaminated.

In a statement to USA TODAY, the agency that runs the lab said, "The animal could not exit the BSL-4 laboratory and, as expected, was found the following morning. At no time was there a hazard to other parts of the facility or to the surrounding community."

Because 21 days had passed since the rodent was infected with Lassa virus, researchers say it would not have been shedding virus. "Regardless, the risk of virus exposure to laboratory workers is extremely low because of the protective, positive-pressure suits they wear," the agency said.

Despite such assurances from all the labs, some in Congress remain wary. "It used to be we only had a few labs doing this very high-level and risky research. Now we have them at places like St. Jude and academic research institutions like CSU and other places," DeGette said. "It appears none of these breaches have lead to any kind of infection. But it's only a matter of time."

Fewer than half in USA get flu shots, CDC says

When many are preoccupied with Ebola and a rare respiratory virus striking children, health officials announced Thursday that fewer than half of Americans are being vaccinated against the flu, which kills more than 30,000 people a year.

The disparity is striking: Influenza vaccines are available more widely than ever and are offered a variety of ways, from needle- free shots to high-doses, said William Schaffner, a professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a flu shot for everyone 6 months and older.

This flu season could be tougher than usual if it follows the pattern seen in Australia, which has reported the highest number of influenza cases in five years, Schaffner said. He noted that although the flu is hard to predict, in many years, flu outbreaks in the Southern Hemisphere can predict flu activity in the USA.

The CDC has advice on vaccinations for children, pregnant women and senior citizens.

For the first time, it suggested children ages 2 to 8 receive a live intranasal flu vaccine because of evidence that it's more effective. Parents, it said, should have kids use the first vaccine available rather than risk illness.

The CDC calls for senior citizens to get a second type of vaccine against pneumococcus, a bacteria that can cause pneumonia and that hospitalizes about 50,000 Americans a year: Those 65 and older should get a one-time vaccination with the combination pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13, routinely given to children, as it protects against 13 strains of the bacteria, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said.

Seniors should also get a second, one-time vaccination with another pneumococcal vaccine -- a polysaccharid vaccine -- that protects against 23 strains of pneumococcus. The shots should be about six months apart. The vaccines can reduce the risk of pneumoccal infection in seniors by 45% and cut the risk of life- threatening infections by 75%, Schaffner said.

The Prevnar vaccine has dramatically reduced pneumococcus infections in children. Because fewer children carry the bacteria, Prevnar has indirectly reduced infections in seniors, a phenomenon known as herd immunity.

A study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that a high- dose flu shot better protects seniors than the regular shot.

People have more flu shot options than ever, Schaffner said, including nasal sprays (for those 2 to 49), a "needle-free" shot that uses a jet to force vaccine through the skin, and shorter needles.

The CDC recommends a flu shot for pregnant women, which also protects newborns until they can be vaccinated, said Laura Riley, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Flu-infected pregnant women are at high risk of hospitalization in intensive care and at risk of preterm delivery.

Flu costs the United States more than $87 billion annually, according to a report released by the CDC Foundation Thursday.

Forty-six percent of Americans got flu shots last year, Frieden said.

Paul Offit, director of infectious diseases and the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said parents seem more concerned about a respiratory virus called EVD-68 than influenza: "Ebola and EVD-68 have collectively caused zero deaths, but flu causes thousands of deaths every year," he said.

Ebola survivor pleads for world to help save lives

An America missionary doctor who survived Ebola pleaded with world leaders Wednesday to act quickly and decisively to control the outbreak in West Africa.

"As a survivor of Ebola, it is not only my privilege but my duty to continue to be a voice for those who continue to suffer from this terrible disease," said Kent Brantly, who contracted Ebola while treating patients in Liberia with the missionary group Samaritan's Purse. Brantly spoke to a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, which met for the second time in six weeks to hear about Ebola.

"The longer we wait, the greater the cost of the battle, both in dollars and lives," Brantly said. "We must act immediately to bring healing and stability to the people of West Africa."

Although Brantly praised President Obama's plan to send 3,000 troops to West Africa to coordinate the disaster response, he criticized the World Health Organization, charging that the organization has not done much to affect the course of the epidemic. About half of the 5,000 people infected with Ebola have died in an outbreak that stretches from Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Senegal and Nigeria.

About 40% of Ebola cases in Liberia have been diagnosed in the past three weeks, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.

Brantly was the first person to receive an experimental Ebola drug called ZMapp and received a transfusion from a survivor before being airlifted to the USA for care. The maker of ZMapp has no more of the drug, which was made in small quantities because of its early stage of development.

Brantly described the awful days of his illness.

"Ebola is a scourge that does not even allow its victim to die with dignity," said Brantly, whose symptoms included "sustained fever, excruciating pain, vomit and diarrhea filled with blood."

"Like the dozens of Ebola patients I'd treated, I found myself suffering alone," Brantly said. "The only human contact I had came through double layers of medical gloves."

Brantly said he was disappointed that the outbreak, which began in March, received widespread media coverage only after he and American missionary Nancy Writebol were infected in July. "It's unfortunate that thousands of African lives and deaths did not warrant the same attention as two infected Americans," Brantly said. By the time a physician named Richard Sacra arrived in Monrovia to deliver babies and provide maternity care, "it was impossible to buy a box of medical gloves," Brantly said. Sacra contracted Ebola in Liberia and is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

Sacra is likely to make a full recovery. He received a blood donation from Brantly and took an experimental drug for seven days. His doctors have not revealed the name of that drug.

Doctors Without Borders announced that a French citizen working for the organization in Liberia has become infected. The woman, who has been in isolation since Tuesday, will be flown back to France for treatment. Doctors Without Borders developed infection-control measures used by many other medical groups and has meticulous procedures to prevent the spread of Ebola.

The Liberian hospital where Brantly worked is turning away 30 patients a day for lack of beds, he said. Obama's plan will allow for 1,700 hospital beds.

The U.S. surge could be a "game changer" by creating infrastructure to provide good supportive care, as well as experimental treatments under development, said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

President Obama is expanding assistance to fight Ebola in West Africa and sending 3,000 military personnel to the region.

Ebola is a worldwide threat, including to the USA. This is a great role for the military, better than dropping bombs.

@dug44

The president should be praised for being proactive rather than reactive in fighting this deadly epidemic.

@JeffOstach

I don't think it is a great idea to expose thousands of military personnel to the Ebola virus.

@frankdupuis140

Think about how much more money we would spend if we did nothing and Ebola made its way to the United States.

@meverner

FACEBOOK

I'd say it's probably a lot cheaper to handle this situation now, over there, rather than waiting for it to cross over the ocean. Who else is going to stop it?

Vince St John

Maybe sending more aid and military personnel is a good idea, but I'm a bit skeptical. I hope none of our people get sick or bring the virus back to the United States.

Aaron Bowen

They probably won't be there to cure individuals who already have the virus, but to prevent its spread. It's like a forest fire: You don't try to save individual trees, but you focus on starving the fire.

The sad truth is that since there's no readily available cure, the plan will probably be to quarantine the people who already have it and manage their symptoms as much as possible, and stop further transmission with the hope that the outbreak burns itself out.

West Africans expressed gratitude for President Obama's pledge to send U.S. troops to fight the Ebola outbreak, but some feared that countries on the periphery of the crisis would be overlooked.

When Ibrahim Moiwo heard of Obama's announcement that he will send troops and other aid, "I felt relieved that the disease will soon be a thing of the past," said the Freetown mechanic, 45. "No support is too small in the fight against Ebola, which is gradually destroying our country."

His country ranks third in the number of deaths, after Liberia and Guinea, but Moiwo said news reports he's heard mention only Liberia, the worst-hit country. "I hope they will put Sierra Leone on their priority list," he said.

Obama announced Tuesday that he is dispatching troops and aid workers, saying the disease poses a global and national threat with "profound political and economic and security implications for all of us."

The disease has claimed 1,296 lives in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. Guinea has reported 595 suspected Ebola deaths, and Sierra Leone has reported 562 suspected deaths from the disease.

More than 5,000 people have been infected by the virus, which has spread to Nigeria and Senegal.

In Nigeria and Senegal, residents fear the disease could grow worse. "We really appreciate the efforts by the U.S. government to help curb this Ebola menace in West Africa," said Abdul Ali Hakeem in Abuja, Nigeria. "However, they should not only focus on other countries and ignore Nigeria."

Hakeem called on the Americans to help put up more isolation centers and spread awareness about the deadly disease in his country.

Foreign humanitarian workers want to see an easing of commercial flight restrictions that have made it difficult to get volunteers in and out of the region, said Yann Lelevrier, representative for international medical organization Doctors Without Borders.

"We have more than 200 expatriates on the ground fighting the disease," Lelevrier said. "It's a problem because we have to organize monthly rotations considering the difficult work conditions that our teams face."

"We would expect to have all the flights and all the possibilities to reach these areas to provide the best possible care," he said.

The Ebola outbreak could last for years and spread to many more countries if it is not controlled quickly, a U.S. health official told a Senate hearing Tuesday. Aid agencies offered a stark assessment of prospects for stopping the epidemic.

Lawmakers held their first hearing on Ebola, warning that the deadly outbreak of the disease is getting worse by the minute. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health Spending held the joint hearing.

"If we do not act now to stop Ebola, we could be dealing with it for years to come," said Beth Bell, director of the national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At a Senate hearing on Ebola, she said 100 CDC staffers are working in West Africa and hundreds more are assisting from Atlanta. "The best way to protect the U.S. is to stop the outbreak in West Africa," she said.

Kent Brantly, a physician working for the missionary group Samaritan's Purse, pleaded with senators to act quickly. Brantly was flown back to the USA for treatment and was cured. "We can't afford to wait months or even weeks," Brantly said.

"From the time I fell sick, just two months ago, the death toll has tripled," Brantly said, noting World Health Organization estimates of 5,000 cases, about half of which ended in patients dying from the virus. "In nine months down the road, we are looking at hundreds of thousands, not just in cases, but deaths."

Bell described Ebola as a dangerous forest fire, moving fast. Brantly went further, telling senators Ebola is "a fire straight from the pit of hell. We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the vast moat of the Atlantic Ocean will protect us from this fire."

Getting Ebola treatment centers up and running quickly, Brantly said, "is the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes."

Even President Obama's sending of 3,000 American troops to West Africa may not be enough to care for the swelling numbers of patients. Daniel Lucey, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone for three weeks last month, said the United States is in uncharted territory in this outbreak.

Facing an unprecedented and out-of-control Ebola epidemic in West Africa, President Obama announced an equally unprecedented response Tuesday -- dispatching 3,000 U.S. troops to the region with health care and aid workers in an effort to contain the deadly virus.

The expanded, $1.26 billion military-led plan will include a new regional U.S. base in Liberia; portable hospitals, laboratories and other medical facilities; and increased training for first responders and other medical officials throughout West Africa.

It's the largest response to an international epidemic in U.S. history, Obama said after meeting with the nation's top public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

Will it be enough?

"There is no guarantee of success, but there would be a guarantee of failure if Obama hadn't announced this plan," said Daniel Lucey, an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University Medical Center.

"This is urban Ebola," said Lucey, a doctor who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone for three weeks in August. "It's unprecedented, and it's uncontrolled."

Obama acknowledged as much. "In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before. It's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's spreading faster and exponentially," he said.

The president said the solution is within grasp. "The world knows how to fight this disease," Obama said. "It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast. We can't dawdle on this one."

Obama said Army Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams will lead the African effort. He's already arrived in Liberia, where he will set up a regional command center in the capital, Monrovia. His mission is to establish an "air bridge" into Africa to more quickly get medical supplies and aid workers to the continent.

"Some people have asked why the military should be involved," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., at a Senate hearing. "They have to be involved if we want to deal with the problem. There's no way for the doctors and nurses and health care workers to deal with it" without such help.

The mission, dubbed Operation United Assistance, is modeled after the U.S. response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, when 20,000 U.S. troops helped get aid into the country. U.S. troops will not provide "direct medical care," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

That will be the job of health care providers. More than 100 experts from the CDC are in Africa, where they will help train 500 new health workers every week.

"This new response, we think, is spot on for what's needed," said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, a Christian missionary group that runs the ELWA Ebola treatment center in Monrovia. He said other nations must also step up. "Now we need about triple this from the rest of the world community to fight this wildfire of Ebola."

Infections are doubling about every three weeks, and the longer Ebola rages out of control the more likely it could spread to other continents or -- in a nightmare scenario -- mutate to become airborne.

The virus spreads only through direct contact with bodily fluids. "The window of opportunity to contain this outbreak is closing," said Joanne Liu, president of Doctors Without Borders, at a United Nations briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. "We need more countries to stand up, we need greater deployment, and we need it now."

She said sick people are banging on the doors of the group's Ebola hospitals in Monrovia, desperate for a safe place where they won't spread the disease to their families. "Tragically, our teams must turn them away," she said.

As of Tuesday, the World Health Organization reported 4,963 confirmed cases and 2,453 deaths in the hardest-hit nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. If the virus keeps spreading at the current rate, "there simply aren't going to be enough beds," said Ken Isaacs of Samaritan's Purse, a missionary group that has run an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia.

His organization hopes to train people to treat family members at home. "We ran Ebola treatment centers for two months, and we were totally overwhelmed," Isaacs said. "Isolating people in their homes and training the family members to protect themselves is the way we can influence disease transmission."

The United States hopes to prevent people from contracting the virus in the first place, through better hygiene.

Helped by $9 million from the Paul Allen Family Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development will provide 400,000 "household protection kits" to be distributed by volunteers. The kit includes a bucket, refuse bags, four surgical gowns, 25 surgical masks, six bars of soap, 100 latex gloves, chlorine and an information leaflet.

Support for the president's Ebola direction enjoyed rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. "The president's absolutely right," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced his intention to support a funding bill that would include $88 million in additional Ebola funds.

Ebola threat accelerates, but world reacts tepidly

As the Ebola outbreak has picked up speed -- sickening nearly 4,800 people and killing half -- the world has talked a good game about how deeply it cares. On the ground in West Africa, however, the disease races on, largely unimpeded.

In the three hardest-hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the outbreak-inflicted horror exceeds anything Americans experience. Ambulances carrying Ebola victims hunt for a clinic or hospital to take them in. Often as not, they're turned away. Those admitted sometimes must lie on the floor, wretchedly sick. Some treatment centers have become little more than places where people go to die.

Families often suffer multiple deaths. Forced to care for loved ones at home, they unwittingly spread disease among more loved ones. Burial teams in heavy protective gear roam communities picking up still-infectious bodies for cremation. Their fearful families force them to sleep outside.

The courageous health care workers battling Ebola need just about everything. More doctors, nurses, disease trackers and burial teams. More ambulances, isolation units and protective suits.

Instead, most of the countries closest to those hardest hit have done a bang-up job of isolating their desperate neighbors in hopes of keeping the disease out. Their airports are closed to traffic from infected countries, even planes carrying exhausted health care workers in need of R&R. Supply lines have been severed.

But the more isolated the infected countries become, the faster the disease spreads, increasing the likelihood that it will cross borders anyway.

The first 1,000 cases took more than four months to spread. The next 1,000 accumulated in just one month. Since Aug. 13 -- just a month ago -- 2,800 cases have been added. Ebola has also spread to Nigeria, and Senegal has reported one case. The World Health Organization -- ineffective in controlling the outbreak -- warns that thousands more could be sickened.

It is highly unlikely that Ebola will reach American shores, at least in epidemic fashion. If it did, the nation's sophisticated medical system could halt its spread. Even so, the U.S. and other countries have an interest in helping West Africa, and not only because it's the right thing to do.

With farmers sick and trade halted in the stricken nations, food is already in short supply. Economic and political repercussions could follow, further destabilizing the continent.

President Obama calls it a "national security priority," and he's expected to ramp up the U.S. response today. It will include a massive military-led logistical effort, 17 100-bed treatment centers, hundreds of thousands of home-treatment kits, and training of 500 medical workers a week. Ideally, this will not only staunch the epidemic but also serve as a model for a permanent system capable of responding swiftly to new viruses that could prove even more infectious than Ebola.

Not least, it says something positive about America. On a continent beset not just by disease but also by Islamist radicalism, that can only be a good thing.

Los Angeles Times, editorial: "The United Nations warns that the intensive global medical effort needed to contain the Ebola virus sweeping through parts of West Africa could cost as much as $600 million. Ebola has killed about half of those who have become infected -- and has recently crossed from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone into two more nations. Deep budget cuts have crippled the ability of the World Health Organization. With the undermining of WHO's ability to be the first responder in global medical crises, the U.N. should have quickly figured out a new scenario -- perhaps one under which nations agreed to apportion donations of staff, medicines and other resources. It did not do so."

Richard E. Besser, The Washington Post: "The U.S. has the expertise and the personnel to get this outbreak under control. We need to establish large field hospitals staffed by Americans to treat the sick. We need to implement infection-control practices to save the lives of health care providers. We need to staff burial teams to curb disease transmission at funerals. We need to implement systems to detect new flare-ups that can be quickly extinguished. A few thousand U.S. troops could provide the support that is so desperately needed. Some may ask why the U.S. should play this role. From a humanitarian and medical perspective, we have a moral obligation to provide care to those who need it, wherever they may live."

Laurie Garrett, Foreign Policy: "World, you still just don't get it. The Ebola epidemic will not be conquered with principles of global solidarity and earnest appeals. The world largely ignored the unfolding epidemic, even as the sole major international responder, Doctors Without Borders pleaded for help and warned repeatedly that the virus was spreading out of control. The WHO doesn't have a giant SWAT team of disease-fighting soldiers ready to swoop into a beleaguered area on an agency-owned transport jet, armed with lifesaving drugs and vaccines. In reality, the WHO begs airlines for tickets in coach, pleads with drug companies and protective-gear manufacturers for free handouts, and has only the expertise on hand that governments are prepared to payroll and donate, such as scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

For Ryan Karas and Lindsi Stinson, it was blood. For Angela Rauen, it was urine. And for Linda Cannon, vomit.

The airline passengers say they were confronted by a biohazard when they boarded recent flights. Their experiences are happening against the backdrop of the Ebola epidemic, which is heightening passenger fears of infection.

The responses of airlines and government regulators suggest they have good reason to be concerned. Karas and Stinson, newlyweds flying from Phoenix to Kauai on US Airways, were taken aback when they spotted dried blood on their seatbacks. And they know what dried blood looks like; both have jobs in emergency medicine.

"When we notified the flight attendant, she just said, 'Oh disgusting, someone should have reported that,' and then walked away," says Karas, who works for a hospital in Colorado Springs. "She didn't apologize, or clean the mess, or even offer for us to sit in an alternate row."

US Airways e-mailed the couple a form apology and after I asked about their case, it followed up with an e-mail promising an "internal" investigation.

Rauen, who was flying from Orlando to Chicago on American Airlines, found herself in a urine-soaked seat. "I knew it was human urine because of the very distinctive odor," says Rauen, a sales manager from Oak Brook, Ill. She complained to a crewmember, who confessed that seats get sprayed by passengers "all the time" and told her she could either sit down or take the next flight. She sat down, and eventually was reseated.

Cannon, a teacher from Palatine, Ill., was on a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Las Vegas when she felt something wet on her seat. "I pulled out my hand, which was covered in vomit."

This time, a flight attendant seemed more sympathetic to her complaint. The crewmember cleaned the seat while Cannon changed into clean clothes. It didn't help: Bits of upchuck still coated her seat.

"I sat for 3 1/2 hours with the remnants of vomit on my jeans and underwear," says Cannon. " I spent the entire flight with nausea and the woman in the next seat telling me it still smelled."

Complaints to United were met with form letters dismissing her request as nothing more than a grievance about an "unpleasant odor," for which the airline does not offer any compensation.

The passengers who came into contact with blood, urine and vomit wonder whom to blame for the lack of hygiene on a plane, and what they're doing about it.

The answer is a bit complicated. Airlines are responsible for the cleanliness of their aircraft, and it's a job they say they take seriously. At American Airlines, for example, planes are tidied up between flights, which can include cleaning the lavatories and seats, and replacing any obviously soiled blankets or pillows. Overnight, the planes are serviced more thoroughly. The restrooms are serviced, seats and tray tables are wiped down, carpets are vacuumed and blankets and pillows are replaced.

Monthly, each aircraft is given a "deep" cleaning, where seat covers are washed and the cabin is sanitized using government- approved cleaning agents. Every 18 months to two years, depending on the plane's flight hours, the aircraft gets what's called a "C Check," during which the plane is basically taken apart piece by piece and put back together.

"In that process, the cabin is obviously completely cleaned," says American spokesman Joshua Freed.

Fortunately, the risk of infection to passengers is fairly low even when the system fails, say experts. "Exposure to bodily fluids of another passenger while traveling is generally rare," says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and School of Medicine.

Health experts say you can't contract an infectious disease such as Ebola via urine on a seat or dried blood. You may be at risk if an infected person vomits on you, but not usually in the case of contact with residual vomit.

As for Ebola, there have been no cases of passengers contracting it on a plane in the U.S., says Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade organization. "The possibility of transmission is extremely low."

Airline ticket contracts don't provide any compensation for soiled seats, and it's not even clear where to complain, beyond the carrier. Multiple agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, Food and Drug Administration, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Agriculture Department have jurisdiction over various aspects of on-board sanitation for passengers and cabin crews. That makes tracking the number of complaints a challenge.

Bottom line? These gross-outs, though they may not harm passengers, shouldn't happen -- particularly now. Air travelers aren't entitled to adequate legroom or service with a smile anymore, but can we all agree that they deserve a sanitary seat?

WHAT TO DO IF YOUR SEAT IS SOILED

Ask to be moved

Chances are there's not enough time to bring in a cleaning crew to fix the problem before your flight departs. Politely ask a flight attendant if you can move to a clean seat.

Keep your expectations reasonable

You should expect an apology, but airline contracts of carriage - the legal agreements between you and the airline - don't say you should get a free flight or an upgrade, no matter how unpleasant your experience.

If the airline ignores you, notify the FAA

Contact the government if your airline doesn't respond. You can file a complaint with the Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection Division at dot.gov/airconsumer/file-consumer- complaint.

An American physician who contracted Ebola while working in a West African hospital has received a blood transfusion from another American doctor who survived the disease, hospital officials confirmed Thursday.

Richard Sacra, who is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center's special biocontainment unit, received the blood donation from Kent Brantly, who was treated for Ebola and released from an Atlanta hospital last month. Both men contracted Ebola while caring for patients in Monrovia, Liberia, while working for missionary groups.

Sacra, 51, also received an experimental therapy. Doctors have not revealed its name.

Sacra is recovering well, his wife, Debbie, and his doctor, Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit, said at a news conference Thursday.

Brantly received a blood donation from a teenage survivor of Ebola while he was still in Liberia.

Brantly and another missionary, Nancy Writebol, received an experimental drug called ZMapp that has never been formally tested in humans. Both recovered and returned home. Supplies of ZMapp have been exhausted, according to its manufacturer. The drug takes months to produce.

Doctors have said they don't know what allowed Brantly to survive -- the transfusion, the experimental drug or the care he received at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital.

Brantly had been in Africa with missionary group Samaritan's Purse. His blood is the same type as Sacra's. Sacra and Writebol work for a different missionary group, called SIM USA. A fourth, unidentified health worker with Ebola was flown from Africa to Emory this week for care.

Across West Africa -- particularly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- Ebola has sickened more than 4,000 people and killed more than half of its victims, according to the World Health Organization. A separate outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has struck 62 people, killing 35.

Sacra, a family physician from Worcester, Mass., had gone to Liberia in August to care for patients, mostly pregnant women, who did not have Ebola but were unable to get medical care. Liberia, a country of more than 4 million, had only a few dozen doctors, and virtually all other medical care stopped in the country because of the epidemic.

Debbie Sacra said her husband wants to make sure the public recognizes the full extent of the tragedy unfolding in West Africa.

He hopes that in the aftermath of the epidemic, the health care system in Liberia can be built back better than before "so they're not at risk of this kind of disaster again," she said.

Fashion Rocks CBS, 9 ET/PT

Were you sorry not to see Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet at the Emmys? Well then, here's good news: He's back on your TV as host of this Fashion Week-themed concert from New York. Among those scheduled to perform are Jennifer Lopez (which makes Idol sense), Miranda Lambert, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, the Band Perry, Duran Duran and Kiss.

Robin Williams Remembered: A Pioneers of Television Special PBS, 9 ET/PT (times may vary)

This special outing of the PBS series salutes Robin Williams by combining an interview he gave the program with remarks from friends and clips from his career. After Mork & Mindy, Williams focused more on his film career than on television, limiting his TV appearances to talk shows and the occasional special. But fans can be grateful that he did return for one more show, CBS' The Crazy Ones, and left us with one of his best sustained, most empathetic and most carefully modulated performances. So much talent, so much promise -- such a loss.

Frontline: Ebola Outbreak PBS, 10 ET/PT (times may vary)

These would seem to be your primary choices: You can A) ignore ebola completely; B) allow yourself to fall prey to vague and probably groundless fears; or C) turn to a reliable source like Frontline and learn the facts about the threat. Wouldn't "C" make the most sense?

Political ads bypass world events, focus close to home

For months, television's evening news shows have been dominated by warring factions in Gaza, Iraq and Ukraine, but the political ads that air between stories are more likely to focus on "bad guys" closer to home -- such as President Obama or the Koch brothers.

Political ads in congressional races largely avoid international events -- focusing instead on jobs, taxes, health care and even family histories designed to boost the candidate's appeal.

"What's most striking is that there's so much going on in the world, and almost none of it is showing up in ads," says Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Media, which monitors political advertising. "As long as a (foreign policy) story is still moving, politicians are so risk-averse they would rather not come down one way or another in an ad."

Ads from both political parties include "some version of 'Washington is broken, the federal government doesn't help you and me,'" Wilner says.

Voters who watch enough political ads will notice some themes:

Get dad to help: Second-generation Democratic candidates have turned to their better-known parent for a boost. Michelle Nunn, running for the Senate from Georgia, and Arkansas incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, have appeared in ads with their fathers, both former senators. An ad for Alaska Sen. Mark Begich focused on his father, Rep. Nick Begich, who died in 1972 in a plane crash while traveling around the state.

Go for the spit take: Ebola and parrot poop are unlikely topics for political ads, but candidates use out-of-the-ordinary imagery to grab viewers' attention. Some are icky: The anti-tax group Club for Growth showed a talking parrot to mock Arkansas' Pryor on health care, then capped the ad with the parrot pooping on a copy of The New York Times. Pryor returned the favor with footage of the Ebola outbreak in an ad accusing his opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, of voting against disaster funding. Others go for humor: In a spot for Minnesota Republican Mike McFadden, running for Senate, cute peewee football players vouch for "Coach McFadden," then apparently hit him in the groin, causing him to deliver the ad's "I approve this message" disclaimer in falsetto.

Too many political spots this election season rely on ad cliches such as headlines, grainy black-and-white photos and newscast clips, says Rick Wilson, a Republican ad consultant who has made his share of hard-hitting spots. He liked the ad from Iowa's Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst, in which she announced she "grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm."

Run against someone else: Public opinion of Congress and the president is at historic lows, so candidates are happy to tie their opponent to the person they believe to be voters' least favorite. For Republicans, that means Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Corbett, facing a tight re-election race, airs an ad that says Democrat Tom Wolf supports Obama's health care overhaul, gun control agenda and opposition to coal.

For Democrats, the go-to demons are the Koch brothers, billionaire industrialists who fund conservative groups including Americans for Prosperity.

A new ad from incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., calls his GOP opponent, physician Monica Wehby, "a good investment for the Koch brothers. But she's the wrong choice for Oregon."

Guilt by association is not a new technique -- Democrats put President George W. Bush into many congressional ads in 2002. "There's still some utility for that kind of hammer-and-tongs advertising," Wilson says, but he worries that voters are so used to it, they will tune out. "Neither side is covering themselves with glory this year."

Why U.S. must lead Ebola fight ; A global plan to protect other countries will protect us, too

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa serves as a dramatic example of why it is essential that the United States take the lead in promoting a robust global health security agenda. Doing so will save lives -- in foreign countries and here in the USA -- and it will protect economies by arresting dangerous diseases before they spread across the globe.

Implementing an effective global health security network is not without cost, but these costs are only a fraction of what ultimately would be spent by taking a more passive approach.

To date, more than 1,550 people in West Africa have perished from Ebola, and individual families have suffered unspeakable loss.

On top of that, the social fabric of entire communities has been put at risk, and much-needed resources have been diverted from the struggle against other diseases that afflict the region.

The spread of Ebola carries not only human costs, but great economic costs as well. These include disruptions to general commerce in nations most impacted by the outbreak as well as to the global economy.

When all is said and done, total costs have the potential to top more than $1 billion, according to some estimates.

Dangerous limitations

This Ebola outbreak, unlike previous ones, has spread to multiple countries. These include Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Nigeria -- Africa's most populous nation and largest economy.

Throughout this struggle, there have been incredible displays of heroism. Health workers have selflessly given their lives to save others. However, the overall response has failed to contain the outbreak.

The control of Ebola requires the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox -- namely surveillance and containment -- but without a vaccine. It also requires solving all of the problems of providing care, food and even salaries for cases and contacts placed in isolation.

Yet, the most impacted countries do not have health care delivery systems capable of attaining those goals. There are simply not enough clinics, hospitals or health care workers -- much less insurance coverage. Thus, these nations are unable to mount necessary responses to the outbreak, especially after years of instability and war in some countries.

Limitations such as these speak to the need for a rapid, full- scale international response. But they also serve as a warning, alerting Americans to the need for a comprehensive approach to protect people in all countries by stopping deadly diseases before they spread.

Globalization has changed the likelihood of disease and the speed at which it can travel from one country to another.

While Ebola is deadly, it is not as transmissible as other diseases, such as pandemic flu.

Lack of preparedness

The potential consequences of not being prepared for pandemic flu could cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars. On top of these challenges, we currently lack a globally linked system to prevent epidemic threats, detect outbreaks and then coordinate responses.

Working with the international community, the United States must take the lead in advancing a comprehensive platform for global health security to keep the world safe and secure from infectious disease threats.

This year, the U.S. government joined with other governments, the World Health Organization and non-government organizations to launch a new global health security agenda. The idea of this effort is to put into place mechanisms throughout the world that will help to better prevent, detect and respond to emerging health threats.

While some might question whether we should be concerned about health issues in other parts of the world, the citizens of our country need to know that this work is as essential as protecting our nation from terror-related threats.

Of course, the United States cannot act alone. Other nations, international organizations and the private sector must do their part.

To protect us all, we must come together to make global health security a priority before it is too late.

Drs. William Foege (1977-83), James Mason (1983-89) and David Satcher (1993-98) are former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A third American aid worker has been diagnosed with Ebola as public health agencies made an urgent appeal for a greater global response to contain the outbreak.

The missionary group SIM USA announced Tuesday that one of its American doctors has been diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia. The doctor was providing maternity care in the capital city of Monrovia but not treating Ebola patients.

The doctor wasn't identified, and it's not known how he was infected. He isolated himself as soon as he developed symptoms and has been transferred to the Ebola isolation unit, according to SIM USA. He is doing well and is in good spirits.

More than 240 health care workers have been diagnosed with Ebola in the West African outbreak, and more than half have died, according to the World Health Organization. In all, Ebola has infected more than 3,000 people and killed more than 1,500 in this outbreak.

Two other American aid workers had been infected with Ebola: Nancy Writebol with SIM USA, and a doctor, Kent Brantly, working with Samaritan's Purse. Both received an experimental drug, were transferred to a hospital in Atlanta and have been released.

"I felt like I was about to die," Brantly recalled to NBC News. He said breathing was so difficult he told the nurse, "I don't know how long I can keep this up."

Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, "I could not possibly overstate the need for an emergency response." He said Ebola threatens the security of affected countries. "There is a window of opportunity to tamp this down, but that window is closing. We need action now."

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday that "the world is losing the battle" to contain Ebola. "Leaders are failing to come to grips" with the threat, said Joanne Liu, president of Doctors Without Borders.

"States have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction."

The group called on countries with the capacity to handle biological disasters to send more trained civilian or military medical teams. "Funding announcements and the deployment of a few experts do not suffice," Liu said. "The clock is ticking, and Ebola is winning. The time for meetings and planning is over."

A separate Ebola outbreak is occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa. Tests on the viruses in circulation there show that the outbreak is a "distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the outbreak in West Africa," the WHO said Tuesday.

NATO has its hands full at summit ; Ukraine, IS, Ebola all top issues at 1st major gathering in 2 years

It feels as if the world is facing an unprecedented number of global security crises, NATO's former Supreme Allied Commander said ahead of a key gathering of the 28-nation alliance that will see President Obama travel to Wales this week.

Adm. James Stavridis, NATO's highest-ranking military officer from 2009-13, said the summit being held Thursday and Friday is "clearly the most important one since the fall of the Berlin Wall because of the clear level of multi-crises" unfolding around the world.

What's facing the West's top leaders include: The Islamic State's uprising in Syria, Iraq and along the Turkish border; continuing fallout from the Arab Spring (in Libya and Egypt); winding down of NATO's mission in Afghanistan.

Plus, there are escalating concerns over cyberthreats, territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the spread of Ebola virus.

But the dominant issue for Obama, German President Angela Merkel, French President Franois Hollande and other leaders will be what to do about "Russian adventurism" in eastern and southern Ukraine.

The meeting is NATO's first major jamboree since 2012 in Chicago, where enlarging the alliance and the deepening of partnerships were salient points.

Now a few years later, the alliance that was set up in 1949 to push back against post-World War II Soviet expansion and to prevent European nationalist militarism is being challenged anew by Russia's alleged backing of separatist fighters over the border in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine and NATO allege -- and Moscow denies -- that Russian troops are being deployed in Ukraine, a standoff that is threatening a direct military confrontation between the two countries and that has the potential to pull in NATO's biggest military powers, such as the U.S. and Britain.

"In one sense this is a summit with a long agenda, but actually, there's only really one item on it," said Michael Clarke, director general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. "NATO has to come up with a set of policies that can deal with Russian subversion."

Former State Department official Xenia Wickett, who now runs the USA program at Chatham House, an international affairs institute in London, said the summit should be seen as a "way station" rather than an "endpoint" in terms of dealing with NATO's current and emerging security challenges.

"There's a risk that the summit becomes all about putting out fires rather than a more strategic one," she said. "The summit needs to pay attention to current events, but it also needs to look much further ahead in terms of where NATO (as an organization) is going."

Under NATO's Article 5, an attack against one NATO member is an attack against all members. Ukraine is not a full member of NATO but a "partner," which means it cooperates on a range of issues with the alliance, including receiving some military assistance.

Kiev has indicated it will seek full NATO membership, and Article 5 does in theory apply to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which sit on Russia's doorstep.

Obama, who travels to Estonia today to meet with all three Baltic leaders, is likely to send a strong signal to Russia about aggression in Ukraine and to reconfirm the United States' commitment to NATO's Article 5.

NATO leaders are also likely to address Afghanistan's security, which will pass almost entirely to Afghans at the end of the year.

Still, while NATO today appears to be facing a multiplication of conflicts led by state and non-states, the nature of the threats is not necessarily as grave as in previous years, said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, during a briefing in London.

"The existential threat that NATO members faced through the Cold War we do not face today, even from terrorist attacks -- as dreadful and bloody and damaging as they can be," he said.

Britain late last week raised its threat level from international terrorism from "substantial" to "severe," the nation's second- highest level.

"The idea of nuclear Holocaust, which we were living with through that period, we must remember that we are not living in that world now," Niblett said.

The Ebola health crisis threatens to turn into a much broader "food crisis" in some of the world's most impoverished countries, according to the United Nations' World Food Program.

The program is scaling up its operations in West Africa to provide food to 1.3 million people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The food will go to people being treated for Ebola, their relatives and those who have been quarantined by their governments in an effort to halt the spread of Ebola.

"The food chain is threatened at many levels," the World Food Program said in a statement. Hundreds of families have lost loved ones, many of whom were their family's breadwinners.

Farmers are leaving their crops as they flee areas ravaged by Ebola, according to a statement from the food program. People are not able to travel and trade freely as countries close borders and international airlines cancel flights, says Michael Stulman of Catholic Relief Services. People are also not able to hunt for bush meat, a practice that has been banned in some places because of the high risk of contracting Ebola while butchering the animals. Bats and apes can carry Ebola.

"We have already seen alarming price increases on imported food commodities such as rice," Stulman says. "The harvest this season is going to be seriously compromised."

For example, the cost has risen from $37.50 to $45.40 for a 110- pound bag of local rice in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. The cost of imported rice rose $15.50.

The Ebola virus spreading through West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people before the outbreak is brought under control, the World Health Organization says in a report out Thursday.

The grim assessment is in a 27-page document outlining a "road map" to end the outbreak.

That will take six to nine months and $490 million, the WHO says.

Though Ebola outbreaks have happened before, "20,000 is a scale that has never been anticipated," Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the WHO, said in Geneva. "That's not saying we expect 20,000 cases. That's not saying we accept 20,000." But he says it's crucial to have a plan to deal with an outbreak that big.

The WHO released the latest official toll of the outbreak: 3,069 cases and 1,552 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The overall death rate is 51%. More than 40% of the cases have occurred in the past three weeks, the agency says.

As bad as those numbers are, "in many areas of intense transmission, the actual number of cases may be two- to four-fold higher than that currently reported," the WHO says in the report.

The report came as U.S. officials and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline announced the first safety trial of an Ebola vaccine.

After years of retrenchment in the wake of two costly wars, a new USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll finds that Americans increasingly are open to a larger U.S. role in trying to solve problems around the world.

The public remains conflicted over just how much the United States can and should do to address global challenges. But the initial shifts in public opinion could make it easier for President Obama to order more muscular options in striking Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. If the trend continues, it could help shape the 2016 campaign to succeed him.

"This runs counter to this conventional wisdom that the public is isolationist," says Bruce Jentleson, a former State Department adviser in the Obama administration who is now a professor at Duke and a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "It's not trigger-happy, but it's also not totally gun- shy."

In more problematic findings for the White House, the nationwide survey also shows broad dissatisfaction with Obama's handling of crises in Russia, Iraq and the Middle East. A 54% majority, including some of his most reliable supporters, complain the president is "not tough enough" in his approach to foreign policy and national security issues.

In the survey, 39% say the United States does too much in helping solve world problems; 31% say the U.S. does too little. That reflects a significant change from less than a year ago, when Americans by an overwhelming 51%-17% said the U.S. did too much.

A 34-percentage-point gap in November 2013 has narrowed to 8 points now.

Among Democrats and independents, the percentage saying the U.S. does too little has jumped by about 10 points. The increase is even more striking in the GOP. In November, about one in five Republicans said the U.S. did too little; now nearly half do.

At a White House news conference Thursday, Obama announced he was dispatching Secretary of State John Kerry to the Middle East and confirmed he had asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for possible IS bombing targets in Syria. But when pressed about military action there, he said, "We don't have a strategy yet," and cautioned: "Folks are getting a little further ahead of where we're at."

"There's more challenges in the world; it's getting worse," Angela Chramer of Birmingham, Ala., said in a follow-up interview. The 51-year-old video producer, who was among those surveyed, says growing problems demonstrate the need for the United States to show leadership. "If we pull back, somebody worse takes over. That goes in the Middle East and that goes everywhere."

WARY OF THE COSTS

To be sure, the difficult legacies of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan make many Americans wary of the costs and consequences of getting involved in distant places.

"We can only do so much," protests Bob Schuhart, 51, a high- school custodian from Oshkosh, Wis. "We can't be a policeman for the whole world. We have to take care of our own, too." He faults former president George W. Bush in particular for leading the nation into war "under false pretenses."

But Schuhart also worries that the world has become "more stressful" during Obama's tenure "because he threatens and says he's going to do something, but he never really backs it up."

The perception that Obama is "not tough enough" is growing. Early in his presidency, in June 2009, a 51% majority of Americans called his approach on national security issues "about right." Now a 54% majority doubt his toughness, including one-third of Democrats, four in 10 blacks and of women.

A generation after the euphoria over the end of the Cold War, and 13 years after the trauma of the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans once again see the world as increasingly perilous. Two-thirds of those surveyed, 65%, say we live in a more dangerous world than several years ago; just 7% call it a safer one. In recent weeks, headlines have relayed the beheading of an American journalist by the Islamic State, the spread of the Ebola virus across west Africa, the on- again off-again war between Israelis and Palestinians, and the threat of armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

After focusing mostly on such domestic concerns as the economy and health care during his first term, Obama has found his second term defined in large part by the need to respond to a series of foreign crises -- from a flood of children from Central America illegally crossing the southern border to the collapse of Iraqi military forces that the U.S. had spent a decade training.

Next week, the president is scheduled to attend a NATO summit in Wales after a stop in the Baltics to meet with the leaders of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia -- a region unnerved by Russia's annexation of Crimea. Next month, he is slated to convene a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York focused on the emerging threat that terrorists drawn to Syria could pose in the United States and Europe.

His aides have been forced to defend him against a barrage of criticism that he has been buffeted by events, not in command of them, and that he has failed to demonstrate a consistent approach to foreign policy and national security. That impression could damage his standing and hurt Democratic candidates in the November elections.

"People look at a lot of things that happen in this town through a political lens," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters this week, rejecting the critique. "That's an understandable pursuit. That's just not the way that we look at them." He said Obama is "worried about the safety and security of the American people, and that's what he's focused on."

That said, Obama's approval ratings on foreign policy, a strength early in his tenure, now are even lower than his dismal rating (39% approve, 55% disapprove) on handling the economy. Just 37% now approve of his policy toward Israel and 35% his approach toward the strife between Russia and Ukraine.

His standing on Iraq, an issue that helped propel his nomination for the White House in 2008, is now the worst of his presidency: 35% approve, 56% disapprove.

Dustin Counterman, 31, a construction worker from Angola, Ind., says Obama's decisions on Iraq, even when they were fulfilling promises he made during the campaign, may have made things worse. Obama "backed out of it, like people wanted, I guess, yet it almost seems like we have to go back now," he says. "I think he backed out too early."

IN OBAMA'S DEFENSE

The president's defenders argue he has been forced to repair damage done to international relations during the Bush administration and to deal with an unyielding Republican opposition in Congress.

"Under the circumstances, with the House and the Senate composed as they are, he's doing the best that he can," says Lisa Schreiber, 46, a communications professor at Millersville University in Lancaster, Pa., who was called in the poll. "From the beginning he's done a good job of maintaining relationships with other countries."

But Duff Watrous, 62, a real estate agent from Long Beach, says Obama's failure to exercise strong leadership over the past six years has worsened some of the problems he faces now.

"I think this administration's attempt to withdraw America from the world scene has created a vacuum that emboldens evil people," he says.

Watrous rejected the argument that Obama's approach has been consistent with public opinion. "It's the responsibility of a good leader to have a vision about what's needed, not just what his constituents want," he says.

In the poll, just 15% of Americans say the United States is playing a more important role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago, the lowest percentage in four decades. Nearly half say the U.S. is playing a less influential role.

"China's advancing; Russia's advancing; Islamic terrorism -- these radicals are expanding their influence," Chramer says. "It's going to take a long, long time to come back from this."

U.S. health officials announced that the first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine will start next week and that trials of other vaccines will follow close on its heels.

The vaccine trial will involve 20 healthy volunteers at the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., with results expected by the end of the year, said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

Although NIH has been developing the vaccine for more than a decade, the public health emergency in West Africa has pushed both the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration to accelerate its development, NIH director Francis Collins said.

"This is a public health emergency that demands an all-hands-on- deck response," Fauci said.

Fauci called the Ebola epidemic, which has killed half of the 3,000 people infected, an "uncontrolled outbreak" that needs to be contained with traditional control methods as well.

Fauci has previously said that even an experimental vaccine would not be available until the middle of next year.

In a significant announcement, Fauci said that drug giant Glaxo- SmithKline (GSK) will co-develop the vaccine. That will make it much easier to "scale up" production of large quantities of the vaccine if it proves effective, Fauci said. He noted that it has been difficult to produce enough doses of an experimental medication, called ZMapp, which is being developed by a small San Diego biotech company. That company has said that it has given away all of its doses and has none left.

Fauci stressed that the phase 1 study -- the earliest of all human tests -- is aimed at answering: Is the vaccine safe? Does it provoke the immune system to respond to Ebola? Scientists will be able to gauge the vaccine's prospects for preventing infection by measuring whether a volunteer's immune system mounts a strong response to the Ebola genes in the vaccine.

The Ebola genes carried in those viruses can't cause someone to become sick with Ebola, Fauci said. But the genes would direct volunteers' bodies to create one Ebola protein. If the body recognizes that protein as foreign and dangerous, the immune system should create antibodies against it. The vaccine is designed to protect against two strains of Ebola virus, known as the Zaire and Sudan species. The current outbreak in West Africa is caused by the Zaire strain.

Another U.S.-based vaccine study, also using 20 volunteers, will test a vaccine that protects against just the Zaire strain of the virus. That trial also will be conducted at NIH and is set to begin in October, Fauci said.

NIH scientists also are working with the Department of Defense on an early-stage trial of a third Ebola vaccine, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics. That trial will begin this fall at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

"We will share data from our studies as quickly as they become available," Fauci said.

CDC worker is flown back to USA after 'low-risk' Ebola exposure ; Employee has no symptoms, will not be kept in isolation

An employee with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been flown back to the USA from West Africa on a charter flight after being exposed to Ebola.

The CDC employee is not sick, has no symptoms of Ebola and "therefore poses no Ebola-related risk to friends, family, co- workers or the public," the CDC said in a statement Wednesday.

The Ebola virus can take anywhere from a few days to three weeks to cause symptoms.

The worker is not being isolated and can return to regular work duties at the CDC, but will be monitored for 21 days for fever or any other symptoms of Ebola, the agency says. The employee "practiced good personal infection control" while in West Africa, the CDC said.

This Ebola outbreak has killed more than 120 health workers. The World Health Organization says more than 1,400 people have died and more than 2,600 have been infected -- more than all other previous Ebola outbreaks combined.

The CDC said the employee in question had a "low-risk contact" with an international health worker who tested positive for Ebola, working within 3 feet of the sick person while the sick person had symptoms.

CDC policy says staff exposed to Ebola are only allowed to "travel long distance" by "private means" for 21 days after the last contact. The rule is based on the fact that people could become ill during flight and need "timely access" to care, the CDC says.

Earlier this month, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said his agency was "surging up" and sending 60 employees to West Africa to help contain the outbreak.

All CDC staff who return from working in the outbreak area check their temperatures twice a day for fever, and have been instructed to call a doctor immediately if they develop a fever or other symptoms.

Canada evacuated three members of a mobile laboratory team from Sierra Leone, after people at the hotel complex where they were staying were diagnosed with Ebola. Although the Canadians have no symptoms, they are in voluntary isolation.

Two U.S. aid workers who returned from West Africa to be treated for the Ebola virus were released from the hospital last week.

Like flight attendants always tell us on airplanes: Adults should put on their air masks first, then take care of the children. So giving special care for the caregivers is right.

I'm glad that some of the African aid workers have been able to get it. They are vulnerable and in short supply.

In addition, with U.S. patients Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol being treated at Emory University in Atlanta, I'm sure more was learned about treating Ebola. It also was probably a good way to practice handling an infectious disease epidemic requiring isolation in the USA.

Kathleen Robinson

I am glad that the world community is taking this seriously and doing what we can to contain and study the virus. A vaccine would be nice, because one mistake in international travel could spread the disease more.

Betty Simmons

I thank God for their recovery, but I still am uncomfortable with allowing either of them out of quarantine. Blood tests looked good, but if the scientists are not correct, we now have Ebola loose in this hemisphere.

Given the nature of this disease and the fact that scientists really don't know that much about it, we ought to be more cautious.

Lela Markham

LETTERS

Fear and confusion are multiplying the dangers of the current Ebola outbreak. Immediate help is needed to contain it. Hopefully, one day there will be a vaccine, but today the answer is quarantine.

The GAVI Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) is working with developing countries to ensure that all children are vaccinated against childhood diseases. These countries are able to get vaccines at reduced rates and create their own plans for taking over this important process, making the process sustainable.

Perhaps, one day the Ebola vaccine will be part of this work. Treating disease worldwide protects us all.

We asked followers what they thought about an experimental Ebola drug being given to aid workers but not other patients.

Every aid worker who stays on the job is saving lives. If there is a limited supply of the drug, it's understandable.

@WTFIII

It's new. It takes time. Let's not criticize when we can hope that it will help everyone.

@NatashaBellaa

It's not fair. Those other patients are sure to die without the treatment. Sadly, that is the way science works.

@jayhenington

That's why it is called experimental; it has to be tested first. Hopefully, the test was successful.

@InfantryLeader

No. It's not right that Ebola drug hasn't been given to all.

@sorrylew

Experiment means scary. It may not work!

@JanetJlassie

Experimental drugs often aren't used on the masses before tests in a small population first. Caution is needed.

Two American aid workers who contracted Ebola while working in West Africa have been released from the hospital. Doctors say the former patients are no longer contagious, posing no threat to others.

Kent Brantly, a physician with the humanitarian group Samaritan's Purse, was discharged from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital on Thursday. Missionary Nancy Writebol, of SIM USA, was discharged Tuesday.

"God saved my life," said a gaunt Brantly, whose arrival at a news conference Thursday drew applause from the crowd. He thanked his medical team and the millions of people around the world praying for his recovery. "Please do not stop praying for the people of West Africa."

Bruce Ribner, medical director of the hospital's infectious disease unit, said Brantly will go to an undisclosed location with his wife and children.

Brantly and Writebol were flown to Emory from West Africa in early August and were treated in the hospital's specialized unit.

Ribner said the hospital performed extensive tests on both patients and consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before deciding they were ready to be released. Both are now likely immune to the strain of Ebola with which they were infected. There are four other known strains.

In his statement, Brantly said his family arrived in Liberia last November, and he saw his first Ebola patient in June. "We took every precaution to protect ourselves from this dreaded disease," Brantly said. On July 23, a few days after sending his family home for safety, Brantly said he woke up feeling sick. He soon learned he was infected.

The World Health Organization says 1,350 people have died from Ebola during the outbreak, more than all earlier outbreaks combined.

Writebol chose not to appear publicly. Brantly said that as she left her isolation unit, she said, "To God be the glory."

In a written statement, Writebol's husband, David, said, "Nancy joined the ranks of a small but hopefully growing number of survivors. We decided it would be best to leave the hospital privately to give her the rest and recuperation she needs at this time."

Ribner said he hopes what he and his colleagues learned can help save patients in Africa.

Brantly and Writebol received an experimental drug called ZMapp. ZMapp has shown promise in animals but has not been tested in humans. It's not known whether ZMapp cured their disease, although getting good supportive care at Emory probably improved their chances.

On July 26, I learned a key Samaritan's Purse doctor, Kent Brantly, medical director of our case management center in Liberia, had tested positive for Ebola. In that moment, my heart sank and I could hardly speak. As I hung up the phone, uncertain and anguished, I prayed -- along with hundreds, and soon thousands, of others around the world.

Seven days later, with God's help and assistance from the U.S. State Department, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the world watched Brantly, dressed in hazmat gear, slowly walk into a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. We owe a debt of gratitude to all these partners, and we thank God for his release from the hospital Thursday.

Reason for hope

Since December, more than 2,400 people are known to have contracted Ebola in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, according to WHO. More than half have died, including 576 in Liberia, where Brantly was serving, making this the deadliest Ebola outbreak since the incurable virus was discovered in 1976. More are infected and die everyday.

Now there might be hope in the form of an experimental drug. ZMapp is a mix of monoclonal antibodies that was recently given to three Liberian health care workers and two U.S. aid workers, including Brantly. And so begins an ethics debate among intellectual elites far removed from Africa's primitive deathbeds -- a debate doing nothing to help save people at death's door.

The debate, according to The New York Times, is about "disparities in treatment between white outsiders and the (African) victims in the Ebola epidemic." This saddens me. Brantly, driven by his strong faith in God, was devoting every waking hour to save dying Africans, until he contracted the virus and was flown back to America for treatment. He and others who give up the comforts of home to serve in the poorest regions of the earth deserve better than cheap criticism from academics and talking heads.

Samaritan's Purse has been working in Liberia since 2003, long before this most recent Ebola crisis. Brantly didn't move to Liberia to fight Ebola. The fight came to us. He was part of our organization's post-residency program before volunteering to lead our Ebola case management center. His wife and two children had been living with him in Liberia but are safe and healthy because they flew home to the U.S. to attend a wedding before he started showing any signs of illness. He stayed behind to continue treating patients.

God and science

While our staff in North Carolina and around the world prayed for God's healing hand, the medical team in Liberia (I could not be more proud of its members) did everything it could to save his life, just as it was doing for every Ebola patient under its care. As Brantly's health deteriorated, he received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy who had survived Ebola and now wanted to help Brantly, the man who had saved his life. He also received a dose of the experimental drug. This was voluntary and risky. No one knew whether it would help, and only three doses existed. As his condition worsened, he had nothing to lose. It might well be the reason he survived, although that can't be confirmed at this point.

Whether it was the unit of blood or the Zmapp, God's hand was at work. But instead of cheering for lives saved or thanking God for his mercy, some are debating whether a heroic doctor such as Brantly should have received the experimental drug. If an African patient had been given the ZMapp, we could have been criticized for experimenting on African patients. This debate isn't helpful to anyone.

What the critics seem to be missing is that Kent Brantly has a calling by God. He left a comfortable life to serve those less fortunate. He did not receive the best medical care America has to offer so he can retire. Rather, one of the first things he and his family wanted to know when they arrived in Atlanta was how soon they could return to medical work overseas. This drug is being used to save a doctor who will say thank you by returning to some of the darkest, dirtiest, loneliest places on earth to bring hope and healing to others. Where is the ethical dilemma in that equation?

Those working on the front lines of this crisis are making life and death decisions in real time and don't need politically correct analysis from the cozy confines of America. It's a debate that wastes time in the race against the clock to stop a deadly virus. The world needs our president, Congress and the might of the Western world to end this epidemic. Let's all remain focused on the real fight -- stopping Ebola.

Franklin Graham is the president of Samaritan's Purse.

There is no end in sight to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, according to the head of the World Health Organization.

"No one is talking about an early end to the outbreak," Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, writes in today's New England Journal of Medicine. She says the outbreak is likely to last "many more months."

Chan blames the severity of the outbreak -- which has killed 1,350 people -- on poverty.

"The hardest-hit countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- are among the poorest in the world," Chan writes. "They have only recently emerged from years of conflict and civil war that have left their health systems largely destroyed or severely disabled and, in some areas, left a generation of children without education."

In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, "there is no confidence in government or its ability to respond," says Peter Hotez, founding dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "This is all a consequence of public health breakdown."

In West Africa, only one or two doctors are available for every 100,000 people, Chan writes, and "even hospital capacity for infection control is virtually non-existent." Nearly 160 health workers have been infected, and 80 have died. Poverty also has driven the spread of the Ebola virus by forcing people to cross borders to find work. The intersection of these three countries, she says, is the "designated hot zone."

Even in the best case, health officials say, promising experimental drugs and vaccines won't be available in time to curb the outbreak. The greatest risk of infection today comes not from people diagnosed with Ebola but from "delayed detection and isolation," CDC Director Thomas Frieden writes in an accompanying editorial. "Every day that disease transmission remains uncontrolled," he writes, "the likelihood of spread to unaffected countries increases."

As kidnapped photojournalist James Wright Foley languished in the hands of terrorists, the news outlet he had been working for in the U.S. sought his release through highly secretive security channels.

Working with a security firm founded by a former Australian army officer, the international news website GlobalPost, where Foley was freelancing when he was abducted on Thanksgiving 2012, had made contact and continued to negotiate with Foley's kidnappers.

While he declined to reveal specifics, GlobalPost CEO Phil Balboni said he worked extensively with the security firm Unity Resources Group and other intermediaries with contacts at the FBI, security services and the White House as well as the Foley family.

"All those points, we were constantly in the process of communications and sharing knowledge," Balboni said in an interview with USA TODAY. "Anything we learned, we shared with the U.S. government."

He added: "We've not revealed any of these details over the last 20 months. Time will come for that."

Foley's beheading by terrorist group Islamic State serves as a sober reminder of the need for and limits of the risk-mitigation procedures that are in place for correspondents in hot zones. Most news organizations, including GlobalPost, train war-and-disaster correspondents, even if they're not eager to talk about it openly. But kidnappings and assaults of journalists still occur.

Jill Carroll was kidnapped in Iraq in 2006 while working for the Christian Science Monitor and released after nearly three months in captivity. Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was kidnapped and beheaded in 2002 by Pakistani militants, an act captured on video that served as a visceral reminder of the dangers faced in covering the war in the region at the time.

Balboni says he followed established protocols when he learned of Foley's kidnapping in 2012. He called a colleague who was a senior executive of a security firm GlobalPost was working with at the time.

The firm chose to no longer take kidnapping cases in January 2013 but continued to pursue leads and develop contacts until the effort to free Foley was transferred to another firm, Unity Resources, this year.

"I personally supervised (the case) the last two years," Balboni says. "It's an immensely complicated undertaking to try to manage recovery operations of this kind."

The Pentagon said Wednesday that U.S. ground troops attempted but failed to rescue several American hostages in Syria. Foley was one of those hostages.

Foley, like other GlobalPost writers, underwent conflict-zone training offered by a third-party firm and was required to check in "at least once a day, if not more often," Balboni says.

"It's an immensely dangerous business," Balboni says. "Jim is an example of courage and incredible bravery not only in doing his job but how he met the end of his life. It's something every reporter should examine and be reminded of the important work we do."

Dealing with kidnappers is a sub-branch of the security- management industry, whose business has been growing in recent years. Staffed often with former hostage negotiators, these firms, including Unity Resources, often partner with other security firms that specialize in other areas of the process, such as transportation or insurance, says Dan Richards, CEO of Global Rescue, which offers medical evacuation and security advisory services.

Unlike what Hollywood might have you believe, a lot of these negotiations happen over a protracted period of time, Richards says. "A relationship develops between negotiators and hostage-takers. It is through the success of that relationship that individuals get released."

"Where kidnappers have ideological motivation, like ISIS, then it becomes much more challenging," he says. It was "a very challenging mission."

Many news organizations and companies have standing arrangements with search-and-rescue companies -- often staffed by former military and CIA types -- whose job is to serve as an emergency point of contact and rescue employees who are in danger.

But the business of ensuring foreign correspondents' safety has been irrevocably altered, particularly in the Middle East, by a confluence of factors. Ideology-driven terrorists often have no interest in ransom money, making negotiations difficult. With the emergence of online news outlets focused on foreign news -- GlobalPost launched in 2009 -- the number of correspondents working in dangerous terrain has grown. And reporters sent abroad are also noticeably younger than in the past, says John Rose, COO of iJet, a rescue company that works with corporations and media organizations.

Media companies that engage in reporting from abroad have a sizable security industry to tap into for help. Up-front training is becoming more emphasized, Rose says.

"You're seeing a lot of work done in pre-phases," he says. "Back in the glory days of media, you had certain reporters known for being war correspondents who were highly trained. Now, you're seeing a lot of media organizations sending less-experienced reporters. And they're looking for preparation and monitoring."

With the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the violence in the Middle East, news outlets' interest in security services has intensified, Richards says. "In the last three or four months, we've seen an unprecedented volume of inquiries coming into our operation centers," he says.

Still, understanding the level of risk for employees can be difficult to assess for many employers with no regular presence in hot zones. "We do see institutions often -- I don't think it's a choice but they're operating in the blind -- that don't know what their risk exposure is," iJet's Rose says. "Sometimes they're sending people into areas where they may not have expertise."

Drug found effective against virus similar to Ebola ; New approach months from helping very many

A study out Wednesday shows that an experimental treatment for Marburg virus -- a close cousin to Ebola -- can be given after symptoms of the terrible disease have started to appear.

The finding suggests that similar treatments may work for Ebola patients. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed at least 1,350 people -- more than half of those infected.

Treatment options are extremely limited, though patients who get better supportive care faster generally have a higher rate of survival.

One experimental drug -- given to two Americans and several Liberians -- appears to have been helpful, though it is not clear whether the victims would have survived anyway. The drug, ZMapp, includes proteins that interfere with the way Ebola attaches and enters a host cell.

Wednesday's study, published in Science Translational Medicine, looks at a different drug that takes a genetic approach to fighting the disease. The drug uses bits of genetic material to block Ebola genes from acting, the way sticking gum in a lock would prevent a key from slipping in.

The research team from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and Canadian drug company Tekmira Pharmaceuticals injected the Marburg virus into four groups of four rhesus monkeys and then treated them with the drug at varying times afterward. All of the treated animals lived.

Although the study was on the Marburg virus, not Ebola, senior researcher Thomas Geisbert said he thinks the results mean that a related Ebola treatment, called TKM-Ebola, will also work once symptoms appear.

It's "very high on our list of things to do," he said Tuesday of testing TKM-Ebola in infected monkeys who have begun to suffer Ebola symptoms.

TKM-Ebola, like other experimental treatments, is months away from helping large numbers of Ebola patients. The first clinical trial of TKM-Ebola in people started in January.

Tekmira's technology, though promising, is a new approach to treating infectious diseases, so it needs to be carefully tested, said John Connor, a microbiologist and Ebola expert at Boston University School of Medicine. But given the misery caused by Ebola, countries are justified in bending the normal rules, he said.

Nigeria scrambles to contain Ebola ; Government sets up isolation centers, border checkpoints

Africa's most populous country is scrambling to avoid the fate of nearby nations that failed to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.

An epidemic could devastate Nigeria's economy and overrun its meager health facilities. So the country has taken drastic measures to contain the spread of Ebola since Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer brought the virus to Lagos on a flight July 20.

The government has set up isolation centers for potential carriers, established checkpoints at border crossings and kept a close eye on anyone who might have come into contact with infected people. President Goodluck Jonathan declared a national emergency last week and called on the public to avoid large gatherings.

Lagos Health Commissioner Jide Idris recommends that Nigerian families keep anyone suspected of carrying the virus in one room. He suggested roping off rooms and boarding up windows, so others aren't exposed.

"We'll not lose the war against Ebola," he said this week.

The Nigerian health system scored at least one victory, Idris noted. A Lagos doctor who contracted Ebola from Sawyer recovered from a short bout with it. "He has made a dramatic recovery and has been discharged" from isolation, Idris said.

The World Health Organization said Tuesday that 84 people in West Africa died from Ebola in three days last week, Thursday through Saturday. Total infections rose to 2,240 cases, including 1,229 deaths. Liberia confronts the worst outbreak, in which there have been 466 deaths. In Guinea, 394 have died; Sierra Leone has had 365 deaths.

In Nigeria, despite the government's precautions, 15 cases have been reported, and four people have died, including Sawyer.

The WHO said the situation in Lagos "looks reassuring" because all those infected were tied to health care workers or had direct contact with Sawyer. The 21-day incubation period has lapsed, indicating he did not pass the virus to passengers on his flight from Monrovia, Liberia, the WHO said.

Late Tuesday, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf set a curfew and quarantined a slum in Monrovia where angry residents attacked an Ebola observation center over the weekend.

In Nigeria, there are concerns that people could turn to alternative treatments. Last week, two people died and 20 were hospitalized in central Nigeria after they consumed excessive quantities of salt and bitter kola, a seed used as folk medicine, to ward off Ebola.

"We will not wait for the government to give us wrong medicine and die of the virus," said Halima Abubakar, who sells vegetables in Lagos.

Information Minister Labaran Maku tries to counter such conspiracy theories: "There is no cure yet for the Ebola disease."

Give terminally ill people easier access to new drugs

The deadly Ebola outbreak spreading through Africa is so extreme, it is driving health officials to do something that they would instinctively resist in normal circumstances: Subject patients to unproven experimental drugs.

The drugs are risky. Some have not even been tested on humans. Even so, a World Health Organization ethics committee just declared such use ethical, and its reasoning is hard to dispute, at least for patients who would otherwise die. Some chance is better than none, even with unknown side effects.

Too bad American patients suffering from terminal illnesses have so much trouble getting the same chance.

The process for getting experimental drugs is so daunting that fewer than 1,000 people sought and got federal approval to take such drugs last year.

Food and Drug Administration rules require patients to clear a series of hurdles. First, they and their doctors must find a company to provide its drug. Many drug makers -- worried that a patient's death will spur a lawsuit or harm their chances for final FDA approval -- refuse.

Even then, patients still need a hospital review board to sign off, a contract between the hospital and the drug maker, and FDA approval. The FDA application process, according to its own estimates, can take up to 100 hours.

Now, the bureaucratic absurdity is generating a backlash.

Colorado, Louisiana and Missouri recently approved "right to try" laws, which seek to simplify the process. The Michigan Senate passed a bill last Wednesday; in Arizona, an initiative will appear on the November ballot.

These carefully crafted measures allow patients and their doctors to go directly to a pharmaceutical company to seek access to drugs, but only those that have cleared the first phase of clinical trials and remain in development. The laws protect drug makers from lawsuits. And, pointedly, they seek to cut out the FDA, which now has final say.

That's worth thinking about. The FDA's system for judging the safety and effectiveness of drugs prevents charlatans from peddling snake oil to desperate people. But in this case, the FDA's process is fatally flawed.

Although the agency says it often grants approval in 24 hours, the reality is that the system is too cumbersome for people with just weeks to live and little to lose. People such as Austin lawyer Andrea Sloan, who fought ovarian cancer for seven years.

After learning last July that she had exhausted all treatment options, Sloan sought a promising, unapproved drug. When she was turned down by one company, she flew with friends to Washington to lobby lawmakers.

With two top oncologists and a major cancer center, MD Anderson of the University of Texas, behind her, she found a drug maker to agree. Even so, it took until October to get the first dose.

By then, Sloan's health was failing. She died on New Year's Day. Her mother, Karen Sloan, wonders why exhausted cancer patients are forced to "run the obstacle course to the treatment that might save their lives."

The answer is that they shouldn't have to. The FDA should pre- empt the right-to-try movement by adopting its practices.

It's not the kind of memo you want to have ricocheting around the Internet.

Cristina Everett, deputy managing editor for entertainment for New York's Daily News' digital operation, was congratulating her troops for their strong performance covering the death of Robin Williams.

In particular, she was pleased with their effective use of search engine optimization, tricks to make sure your stories get prime position on Google and other search engines. But now, they could back off a little. No longer would they have to use the "Robin Williams dead at 63" header.

"Starting tomorrow morning," she wrote, "we can scale back on the robot talk (meaning no death header) just as long as the stories continue to 'start' with his full name and include buzzy search words like *death, dead, suicide, etc.*"

Buzzy. Nothing quite as buzzy as death and suicide.

Naturally, the memo rapidly found its way to Jim Romenesko's journalism blog, as all juicy journalism memos do. The memo didn't win Everett too many new fans. Tweeted Pulitzer-winning syndicated columnist Connie Schultz: "The dark soul of the new 'journalism.' No thank you."

The Daily News also didn't acquit itself too well in old-school print with its dreadful "HANGED" front page.

This is a turbulent and exciting time in journalism. Traditional media organizations are struggling to adapt to the digital era, while new outlets and new forms of storytelling are emerging, many of them quite promising.

There's no doubt that the Robin Williams story is a big deal. He touched many lives profoundly. But the crass tone of the Everett memo underscores one of the darker sides of the current landscape. In the frantic effort to attract large volumes of traffic, to in turn bring in advertisers, websites often turn to all manner of SEO manipulation and sensational, empty-calorie fare. (USA TODAY is hardly immune to this development.)

Of course, going after readers with less-than-cerebral material is hardly new. Tabloid journalism and its wretched excesses go way back. "If it bleeds, it leads" has been a byword in TV news for decades.

In the digital era, though, the powerful amalgam of technology, financial pressures and fierce competition for audience has put the phenomenon on steroids.

Fortunately, journalism news now surfacing brings us a needed reminder of the noble mission that underlies the field. Because, clicks or no clicks, journalism continues to involve reporting on important events, often at great personal risk.

Journalists covering the deadly Ebola outbreak in Africa risk catching the highly contagious disease. Joe Pompeo of Capital New York wrote Wednesday about The New York Times' Adam Nossiter, who earlier this week filed from Njala Ngiema, Sierra Leone, which he described as the the village perhaps "most devastated" by the disease.

In a previous dispatch from a hospital, Nossiter quoted a medical technician yelling, "Don't touch the walls! Totally infected."

This is not work for the fainthearted. But it's what journalists do. This is a hugely significant story, and it must be covered.

Reporting on war is always risky. Many great journalists have died doing so. In recent years we lost two of the finest war correspondents of our era, Marie Colvin, an American-born journalist who wrote for Britain's Sunday Times, and The New York Times' Anthony Shadid. But reporters keep returning to the battlefield. Because they have to.

On Tuesday, New York Times correspondent Alissa Rubin was injured in a helicopter crash while covering the fighting in northern Iraq. Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet wrote in a memo to his staff, "This is a good time to reflect on our colleagues who are covering the world at a particularly violent, tumultuous time. I don't recall a period when so many writers, photographers and videographers have been in harm's way for The Times and other news organizations, taking risks and living away from their families to tell important stories."

Then on Wednesday, Simone Camilli, a video journalist for The Associated Press, and his Palestinian translator, Ali Shehda Abu Afash, died when a bomb exploded in the Gaza Strip.

Yes, the search for audience in a wrenching time doesn't always bring out the best in journalism. But it's important not to let that overshadow the fact that journalists continue to do work that is critically important in a democratic society.

The use of unproven drugs to combat the deadly Ebola virus won support Tuesday from the World Health Organization, which cited deep concerns over "the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history."

The endorsement from the U.N.'s health care agency came after two American health care workers were treated with an experimental Ebola drug called ZMapp and seem to be improving. Officials warned, however, that the improvement they showed may not have been directly related to the drugs.

In an update Tuesday, WHO says 1,013 people have died since the outbreak began in March, the vast majority in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Officials estimate that this Ebola outbreak has killed just over half of those afflicted with the disease.

A number of drugs to treat and vaccines to prevent Ebola have been produced. But in what Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director- General, declared a "market failure," those approaches have not yet been tested on people. "If it hadn't been for the investment of a few governments, we'd be nowhere," Kieny said Tuesday, praising the American and Canadian governments in particular for backing research. That research has stopped short of clinical trials with people -- the most expensive part of the drug development process -- which is generally handled by industry.

"This is why there are no stockpiles and we are not there yet," she said.

While studies in monkeys can suggest effectiveness and safety, it is impossible to know how people will respond until they are given a treatment, Kieny said.

An American man seems to have improved dramatically after the first dose, an American woman also improved but only after the second dose, and a Spanish priest who was to receive a course of treatment died Tuesday.

The company that makes ZMapp has agreed to send the few remaining courses of the three-dose treatment to Liberia.

Ebola halts university travel plans ; Several schools say they won't send students to region

American universities are suspending programs in West Africa in light of the Ebola outbreak, and taking measures to ensure that no one comes back to campus with the disease.

On July 31, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans against non-essential travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone because of Ebola. The disease has sickened more than 1,700 in those countries and claimed more than 960 lives.

Since then, several schools have announced that they would not send students to the region.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign suspended its program in Sierra Leone for the semester, but with spring exchange programs more popular than the fall, the decision doesn't affect any students, said Andrea Bordeau, an international risk adviser in the study abroad office.

About 10 students who had applied for the winter term and spring semester "are in limbo," said Bo White, the school's assistant director for international health and safety.

"We'll continue to monitor and reassess throughout the fall semester," Bordeau said. "Our real goal is to balance and weigh the academic value of our programs with keeping our student safety paramount."

New York University said Monday that it would not send students to its program in Ghana for the fall. Ghana has not had any cases of Ebola, but it sits between the nations at the center of the outbreak -- Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- and Nigeria, which has seen at least 10 cases since a sick American traveled there and died last month.

"The decision to suspend classes for this fall was made less out of an immediate concern that students might contract the Ebola virus," Carlo Ciotoli, associate vice president for student health, said in the statement. "It was driven more by our concern about our ability to get students out of the country easily should the virus have spread and about the experience that students would have had in Ghana, given the current state of affairs."

NYU, which expects to resume its Ghana program in January, is now helping the 11 students who were supposed to go this fall find other alternatives. The school also suspended its operations in Tel Aviv for the fall because of the unrest in Gaza.

At Harvard University, an e-mail circulated on Friday signed by the provost and the director of health services encouraging anyone who had traveled to the region to reach out to Harvard University Health Services within three days of their departure from any country with Ebola.

"We are contacting everyone in the Harvard community known to have recently visited these West African countries, offering guidance and support," according to the e-mail. "However, there are likely students, faculty or staff whose travel to the region is unknown to us."

Dangers lurk for workers heading overseas ; With Ebola spreading and regional conflicts widening, corporations take heed

When corporate trekkers travel abroad, they're most likely focused on the business at hand.

But with U.S. health officials issuing a travel warning for parts of West Africa in the wake of an unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola virus, and violence gripping regions from the Middle East to Ukraine, it's clear that knowing the politics and perils at your destination is as crucial as mapping out a corporate presentation.

"Given the significant elevation of travel-related health, terrorism and war risks, it is essential that business travelers understand the locations of and types of hazards they will likely face," says Kevin Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition. "Likewise, it is important that family members are made comfortable that their loved one has a strategy to keep safe while traveling overseas."

Much attention is being focused on the health of travelers as the international community grapples with an Ebola outbreak that has infected more than 1,700 people and left more than 900 dead. U.S. health officials have issued a travel warning for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. U.S. and international health officials are encouraging airline crews to isolate travelers who have been to those nations if they are exhibiting symptoms of the deadly virus. And some airlines have suspended flights to parts of West Africa.

Still, more businesses need to take steps to safeguard employees' health when they're overseas.

"Unfortunately, there are not enough that do," says Phyllis Kozarsky, travel health consultant with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Travelers' Health Branch. "Most companies understandably are focused on other types of things and don't tend to think about travel health, and we'd like to encourage business travelers and companies to start engaging in this kind of activity, certainly as more companies become global."

It makes sense for a company's bottom line, too. The CDC Foundation says that for every 100,000 travelers visiting a developing country for four weeks, 50,000 will have a health problem while on the road, 8,000 will need to visit a doctor, and 50 will need to be evacuated by air for treatment.

And while it costs $162 on average to protect an employee from malaria, treating an infected adult adds up to $25,250, and the employee, on average, will lose six to 24 days of work.

To help business travelers prepare for their trips abroad, the CDC Foundation launched an online health primer in June as part of its "business pulse" series. Business travelers can click on a world map to get general information about the challenges they might face in a given region, then tap on various links to access more specific information.

"Business travelers tend to think they're not vulnerable, and common sense often goes out the window," says Kozarsky, a physician and co-director of the travel clinic at Emory University. They think, "'I can eat anything I want; I can do anything I want and I'm fine.'"

But, she says, travelers need to be aware of vaccinations they need, and not just those that may be specifically required to enter a particular country.

With measles, for instance, "people naturally don't think it's a hazard of travel," Kozarsky says. "But particularly when we're stepping out to developing countries, where vaccine-preventable diseases have not been managed, there's even a greater risk."

CDC literature even addresses the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted disease.

"Casual and unprotected sex is something that occurs not uncommonly," she says, "and business travelers need to consider that and travel with condoms from home and be wise."

USA TODAY's panel of Road Warriors draws on a variety of resources to prepare for an international trip, such as online research and reading their destination's local newspapers, and reaching out to friends and business associates for information on a given area.

Brian Kujala, who spends about a month each year overseas in his role as a sales director, makes sure any mentions in the news of the country he's visiting are automatically fed to his e-mail inbox. He includes sources that have a sharper focus on where he'll be traveling. "We do business in Turkey," he says, "so Al Jazeera is a lot better news source than NBC or CNN."

Business travelers should consider travel insurance. Such policies, provided to some employees by their companies, can ensure an ill traveler gets proper medical assistance on the road, and, if necessary, evacuated to receive care back home.

George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, says visiting the State Department's website and portals hosted by other nations can help travelers keep track of advisories. And registering your presence in a foreign country with the consulate or embassy can bring peace of mind.

In the end, it's smart to be cautious. But, Hobica says, the "truth is, the chances of something dire happening are small."

Doctors not deterred by Ebola virus ; Despite outbreak, groups continue to pursue missions to Africa

As researchers scramble to concoct an antidote to the Ebola virus and health workers try to contain its outbreak in Africa, Jo Weddle is busy making last-minute arrangements for her upcoming trip to the continent.

Weddle, 32, recently completed her surgical residency at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and, in a few weeks, will embark on a four-month trip to a Cameroon hospital to work as a training surgeon. The Ebola outbreak will be nearby, in neighboring Nigeria. Most of the deaths, however, have occurred farther west in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The Ebola outbreak -- which has now claimed 932 lives and sickened more than 1,700 others -- is worrisome but won't deter her from her trip, she said.

"It's something I've been wanting to do for a long time," Weddle said. "It's going to be challenging. But there are a lot of portions of the world that need a tremendous amount of help."

News of the African Ebola outbreak hit home this week when two Americans infected with the virus were flown to an Atlanta hospital for treatment. The two -- Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol -- were on medical missions in Africa when they were infected.

But the epidemic has done little to dissuade others from embarking on the rigorous, often dangerous missions. Groups like Dallas-based Faith in Action Initiatives, New York-based Doctors Without Borders USA and the Christian Medical & Dental Association, known as CMDA, all report a steady stream of doctors, nurses and medical workers still willing to go off to places like Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti and other developing nations.

At a CMDA training session last week, one female doctor was readying to go to the same hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, where Brantly contracted the virus, said David Stevens, a family practice physician and CMDA's chief executive. The group has recently seen a steep rise in the number of medical students signing up for missions abroad, he said.

"The level of commitment to these missions is significant," said Stevens, who served as a physician in Kenya in the 1980s.

Faith in Action, which is affiliated with the Baylor Health Care System, helps send about 150 doctors, nurses and other medical workers to missions around the world each year, with one-third of those going to Africa. Some have expressed caution about going directly to Liberia, Sierra Leone or other countries reporting Ebola deaths, director Don Sewell said. But interest in the missions -- even in Africa -- hasn't waned.

"In no respect has it deterred the enthusiasm and fervor of people ready to go," he said. "People are still making plans to go."

About two-thirds of the 400 medical workers sent abroad each year by Doctors Without Borders USA go to Africa, said Kate Mort, director of field human resources for the group. Unlike many faith- based groups that help mobilize medical missions, Doctors Without Borders USA makes pretrip vaccinations mandatory. While in country, a doctor at the site and another one in the country's capital constantly monitor the workers for any signs of contagious diseases, she said.

But sometimes even the most vigorous preparation isn't enough. Paul Gray left for south-central Ethiopia, with his wife, Rebecca, and 7-month-old son Nathan in 2008, shortly after finishing his residency program at Baylor University Medical Center. They got all the necessary vaccinations. But four years into his trip, Gray contracted a bad fever that went on for nearly three weeks. He was airlifted to South Africa. It took him several months to fully recover.

They returned to the USA in June. Upon arriving, Gray tested positive for tuberculosis.

"Overall, it was very rewarding," he said. "It's something I certainly wouldn't trade for the world. But it was definitely challenging. It's a very difficult environment to try to serve."

Preventing the Ebola virus from spreading in Africa is the best way to protect people worldwide, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden told lawmakers Thursday.

"We can stop Ebola: We know how to do it," he said. "We have to stop it at the source in Africa. That's the only way to get control."

The House Foreign Affairs Committee special hearing -- unusual because Congress is on August recess -- came on the heels of a highest-level alert issued in response to the outbreak. The CDC has moved to a "Level 1" response, which means the government has increased staff and resources to address the situation.

About 50 people from the CDC have been sent to West Africa to help with the outbreak, and the World Bank has pledged $200million.

Ken Isaacs, vice president of program and government relations at Samaritan's Purse, told lawmakers that containment of the disease and international response has been "a failure," and that he and members of his organization had been warning of the impending outbreaks since April.

There have been more than 1,700 cases of Ebola, and nearly 1,000 deaths, in the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

Fauci: New drugs not the best answer for Ebola ; Basic care is more effective, doctor says

There's excitement over possible drug treatments in the fight against Ebola, but America's top infectious disease doctor says the most powerful tool against the outbreak is basic medical care.

Drugs under development will not be a big part of the solution, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. They are too early in development for enough to be manufactured, even if they are shown to be safe.

The real area of focus, he said, should be setting up medical infrastructure in the affected countries to provide sick people with basic medical support such as replacement fluids and blood.

"That's the way you help people," he said.

There are no drugs or vaccines approved for treating or preventing Ebola. Supportive therapy, such as replacing fluids, particularly when it is done shortly after infection, can significantly improve survival from the disease.

In some Ebola outbreaks, as many as 90% of those infected have died, but the death rate is about 55% in this outbreak. Numbers out Wednesday from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed the outbreak, which began late last year, has sickened 1,711 and killed 932 in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.

Interest in possible drug treatments ramped up last week after two Americans who caught the virus while treating patients in Liberia received an experimental Ebola therapy called ZMapp, which had been tested only in animals. After transport to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol are recovering, though it is unclear whether the drug made the difference.

President Obama said Wednesday that it's too early to say whether the experimental drug can help stop the Ebola virus or whether it should be made available to African nations.

"We've got to let the science guide us, and I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful," Obama said at a news conference to cap the first-ever U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.

Medications are promising and will hopefully help in outbreaks, Fauci said, but they can't be made in enough quantities to benefit current patients.

"You'll never have enough (ZMapp) to give it to everybody -- you won't even come minutely close to that," Fauci said.

Next week, WHO will convene a panel of medical ethicists to explore whether drugs that have never been tested on humans should be used and, if so, who should receive them when there is an extremely limited amount.

In New York City, Mount Sinai Hospital said a patient placed in isolation since Monday does not have an Ebola infection, as feared. The patient is in stable condition and "improving," a statement from the hospital said.

Sometimes, misinformation can spread faster than a deadly virus, as proven in recent days by the hyperventilation about Ebola.

Tuesday, while a man who had visited West Africa was screened for the disease at a New York hospital, tabloids screamed about an "Ebola scare" in the Big Apple. On Wednesday, officials said the man doesn't have the virus.

With similar irresponsibility, Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind., suggested that "with Ebola circulating and everything else," the U.S. needs to screen kids crossing the Mexican border. Never mind that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an Ebola case has never originated outside Africa.

Rumor and myth are a dangerous brew when battling a deadly outbreak, even one centered half a world away. In the U.S., they can confuse the public and drive bad policy. In Africa, where rumors have kept people from seeking treatment, they can kill.

What's needed is accurate information, so here are a few facts:

Despite suggestions that each patient could be a modern-day Typhoid Mary, there is little chance of Ebola taking hold in the USA. Ebola is not spread through the air, like the common cold or flu, where droplets from coughs or sneezes can infect others. To get sick, a person would have to come in direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or with a contaminated object, such as a needle.

Though there is no cure for Ebola, experimental treatments are being developed, including one that appears to be working on two American missionaries being treated at Emory University. The World Health Organization was pushing Wednesday to explore the ethics of using the unproven drug in Africa.

Death rates have reached 90% in some outbreaks -- a number widely publicized. But they've also been as low as 25% in Uganda in 2007. The rate in the latest outbreak is nearly 60%. If the disease reached the USA, patients almost certainly would fare better. Modern medicine can fight the symptoms of diarrhea, bleeding and dehydration.

The outbreak, the worst in Africa's history, started in Guinea, spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, and appeared most recently in Nigeria. While West African leaders have ordered extraordinary measures -- closing schools and quarantining households where someone is sick or has died -- many people flout the rules because of tribal customs. Families continue to treat infected loved ones and personally bury the dead, spreading the disease. Some villagers ignorantly blame aid workers for bringing it.

Laurie Garrett, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says her greatest fear is that the rest of the world might "stand by like giant global voyeurs and watch these people. Period."

Fortunately, the world is starting to respond. More than 60 courageous CDC staffers have been dispatched to battle Ebola in the stricken countries, and Director Tom Frieden is optimistic the outbreak can be contained. The World Bank promised as much as $200 million to help fight the disease.

Americans are right to be concerned, but the threat is less about catching Ebola than about controlling it in Africa.

Post-Ebola, Peace Corps vows to return to work ; Historic evacuation from West Africa 'was a tough decision'

The Ebola virus prompted the biggest evacuation in Peace Corps history last week when 340 volunteers were withdrawn from West Africa. But the agency's director vows that the program will return when the situation there is safe.

"It was a tough decision," Carrie Hessler-Radelet, 57, told Capital Download on Monday, "but we thought that the very nature of our volunteers' work, the fact that they are living and working in communities, exposed them perhaps to a degree that we felt the risk was just too great."

Two Peace Corps volunteers who came into contact with a person who later died of Ebola are still in a 21-day isolation regimen, but Hessler-Radelet says they have shown no symptoms of the disease.

"We are committed to bringing our volunteers back to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone just as soon as we possibly can, and our volunteers want to go back," Hessler-Radelet said in an interview on USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. However, she noted that the health infrastructure in the region is weak, "so it's going to be a while" before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Department and the Peace Corps agree it's safe to return - - "several months, for sure."

Turbulence around the world has affected Peace Corps operations this year to an unprecedented degree, leading to evacuations of volunteers from Ukraine, Kenya and now West Africa. The Peace Corps has more than 7,000 volunteers stationed abroad.

"Our volunteers are at the places where they're needed the most," she says. "Sometimes that means they're in places that are not as stable as our country, but it means they are working in some of our world's most important development challenges, that they are really in the forefront."

Four generations of Hessler-Radelet's family have served in the Peace Corps: her grandparents in Malaysia, her aunt in Turkey and her nephew in Mozambique. Hessler-Radelet and her husband volunteered in Western Samoa.

Since the Senate confirmed her nomination in June, she has been working to encourage applications from more African Americans and Latinos. As of last year, the agency has allowed same-sex couples to serve together. The corps is offering more technical training so volunteers can tap new technology and social media.

The Peace Corps also has changed its rules to allow applicants to specify where in the world they would like to serve, although half say they would be willing to go wherever needed.

The most popular location requested? "Fiji was right up there," she said.

A second American health worker infected with Ebola left Liberia and was on her way for treatment in Atlanta today, as health officials reported more deaths and cases in West Africa, and more details surfaced on an experimental treatment.

Officials at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City also admitted a man Monday who had recently been to West Africa and had symptoms consistent with Ebola -- high fever and gastrointestinal problems.

In a statement, Mount Sinai said, "The patient has been placed in strict isolation. All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff."

Monday evening, the New York City Health Department issued a statement saying the department, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Mount Sinai, had concluded "the patient is unlikely to have Ebola."

The toll from the outbreak has risen to 1,603 cases and 887 deaths, the World Health Organization said Monday. The death rate stands at 55%. Some previous Ebola outbreaks have had death rates up to 90%, and medical experts have speculated that faster, improved medical care may be a factor in the lower rate.

There is no approved medicine or vaccine specifically for Ebola, but supportive care, including maintaining fluids, can help. Two Americans stricken with the virus in Liberia may be showing signs of improvement after additional experimental treatments.

Physician Kent Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol each "received a dose of an experimental serum while still in Liberia," Brantly's organization, Samaritan's Purse, said in a news release. "Dr. Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy who had survived Ebola under his care."

A detailed report from CNN, quoting unnamed sources, says Writebol and Brantly received infusions of antibodies tested only in monkeys. The antibody drug, called ZMapp, was developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical.

Writebol remained in serious but stable condition as she prepared to return to the USA for further treatment, her sponsoring organization, SIM USA, said Monday. She was aboard a chartered plane that took off early today from Liberia's capital, Monrovia.

Writebol, who is to join Brantly in a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, showed at least one sign of improvement, says Bruce Johnson, president of the charity group. "Her husband, David, told me Sunday her appetite has improved, and she requested one of her favorite dishes, Liberian potato soup, and coffee."

Brantly also "seems to be improving," CDC Director Tom Frieden said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation. Emory is not commenting on the condition of the patient.

Infection with the Ebola virus causes fever and headache in early stages but can lead to hemorrhaging, liver failure, kidney failure and death in rapid progression.

If the two patients are improving after antibody treatment, "that's fantastic," says Thomas Geisbert, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Geisbert, an Ebola researcher not directly involved in the cases, says it may be difficult to know whether the treatment made the difference. "There are a reasonable number of people who live even without treatment. The longer you can keep someone alive, the more likely your immune system kicks in and fights this off."

Most of the current cases originated in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria reported a second confirmed case Monday.

We asked our followers what they thought of the decision to bring two Americans infected with the Ebola virus to the USA for treatment.

They're U.S. citizens doing good in the world. Let's bring them home and take care of them.

@citizenXIV

It's a good call. The medical staff here in the U.S. is better prepared to care for the patients. Those not informed of the transmission of the Ebola virus need to read up on it.

@NASCAR_Hula

Foolish! It's reckless endangerment.

@wiml2

It will expose people who don't know about a disease that is easily contained in America and show how poor countries are given the shaft.

Last week, I read the headline "Ebola only a plane ride away from the USA." If you read the article, you'll find that while the headline is technically true, a widespread outbreak is very unlikely (USATODAY.com, July 28).

With the time from actual infection until development of symptoms being up to three weeks, it's almost inevitable that some individual with Ebola will arrive in the U.S. or another country outside of Africa. But, unless another person comes in direct contact with infected bodily fluids, he or she is not at risk. And, as soon as the infected person becomes severely ill, he or she will end up in a hospital and become isolated.

I know I shouldn't assume, but when I read that such and such disease could go global, or is a plane ride away, I think an outbreak is potentially imminent. I am all for everyone being prepared, knowledgeable and up-to-date, but to do that, you'll need to read beyond the headlines.

James Hubbard, M.D.

Every day, doctors and nurses face unknown threats and dangers to their physical health and emotional well-being. This might come in the form of a needle-stick injury, a blood splash or a simple sneeze. Today, it is the Ebola virus.

Health care clinicians voluntarily choose their profession, accepting the inherent risks that come with the job. But the realities of living in a global society means these clinicians might face greater risks from new diseases. Ethically, it seems fair to question whether our society should expose doctors and nurses to something that is exceptionally dangerous.

Ethical codes of conduct obligate doctors and nurses to care for all patients regardless of their condition. But they also have a duty to protect themselves from harm. Can they refuse caring for Ebola patients? Some would say yes; others might say no.

Ebola is here. It is time for local, state, national and systemwide policy guidelines that protect doctors and nurses, whose compassion, dedication and selfless giving serve us all.

Carl Bialik, FiveThirtyEight: "As the worst Ebola outbreak in history spreads through West Africa, media reports have repeatedly cited health officials who say the virus kills up to 90% of people it infects. Behind these numbers, though, lies considerable uncertainty: about the typical death rate about the death rate for the current outbreak and about what that rate will end up being when the infection is halted. In the four months of the current outbreak the death rate has been lower: 56% through last Wednesday, the latest available numbers from the World Health Organization."

William F.B. O'Reilly, Newsday, New York: "They don't make heroes like Dr. Kent Brantly anymore. When the Ebola epidemic broke out he found himself treating victims of that virus. Brantly (who returned to the U.S. on Saturday) is now fighting Ebola himself. After contracting Ebola, a single batch of experimental medicine landed in the Liberian camp. It was his chance to survive, (but Brantly) gave it to a fellow missionary with Ebola named Nancy Writebol, who is on her way, under strict quarantine, to an Atlanta clinic."

Laurie Garrett, CNN: "Short-term focus on Ebola control cannot be disconnected from a longer-term commitment to economic and technical support of these nations' health care systems, roads, schools and general development. The potential for global panic is genuine. If responsible leaders worldwide hope to stave off hysterical reactions to the virus and bring this epidemic to a halt, serious contingencies and agreements must be reached immediately."

The Christian Science Monitor, editorial: "Health workers are raising hopes by talking about the many patients who have survived Ebola. That helps dispel the myth that Ebola is a death sentence. They are also providing details on how to deal with those who are infected and how to observe a quarantine and other containment efforts. No medical cure yet exists for ebola. But at least there is a cure for the dread that surrounds it: calmness in dealing with it."

Kim Yi Dionne, Al-Jazeera America: "Border closures and the shutting down of hospitals underscore the governments' inability to respond to the epidemic. Were the state better equipped to deal with the outbreak, anyone coming into contact with a presumed or confirmed case could be identified and isolated. The severe health worker shortage impedes capacity to do so."

President Obama this week convenes the largest gathering ever of African government officials in Washington in an effort to bolster the U.S. relationship with one of the world's fastest-growing economies.

But preparations for the historic summit have been overshadowed by the march of the Ebola virus through West Africa, a health crisis that has claimed more than 700 lives and has international health officials scrambling for solutions.

An all-day event Tuesday will focus specifically on business and investing opportunities in the continent. As Africa's economies gain momentum, democratic governments take hold and the continent's young population grows wealthier, investing there is becoming easier and more attractive to international investors.

Insurance and infrastructure represent some of the best investing opportunities as companies expand to meet the growing demand of countries that are becoming wealthier and more educated, says Ryan Hoover, founder of InvestinginAfrica.net.

"There's huge demand for energy, roads and water," he says. "Any companies that have exposure to building or owning or operating power plants are seeing huge gains."

Africa also has age on its side, with 200 million people between the ages of 15 and 24, and many more of them educated than past generations of young adults. Africa is expected to have the largest global workforce by 2040.

NIH to launch early Ebola vaccine trial in September ; The latest deadly outbreak has drugmakers racing

The USA will launch an early-stage trial in September of an experimental vaccine against Ebola, the deadly viral disease that has now killed 729 people in the largest outbreak in history.

The National Institutes of Health has been developing an Ebola vaccine for several years that has had "encouraging results" in primates, says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci said he's working with the Food and Drug Administration to fast track the vaccine into a human trial this fall to test safety and efficacy.

If the vaccine proves itself, Fauci said he expects that it could be given to health workers -- "who are putting themselves at extreme risk" -- in affected African countries sometime in 2015.

Ebola has infected more than 1,300 people in West Africa, including two American health workers, says the World Health Organization, which announced a $100 million response plan to fight the threat.

Officials at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital said they expected one of the Americans to be transferred there "within the next several days." The hospital, which has a special isolation unit for such cases, declined to identify which aid worker, citing privacy laws.

"Ebola is worsening in West Africa," said Tom Frieden, director, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warned against non-essential travel to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Frieden also said the agency is sending 50 additional staff to advise countries on controlling the disease.

There are currently no effective treatments or vaccines for Ebola, which causes fever and headache in early stages but can lead to hemorrhaging, liver failure and kidney failure. But scientists have been working on four or five preventive vaccines that appear effective, said Thomas Geisbert, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

The only positive development to come from the epidemic is it's attracted long-needed attention from drugmakers, Fauci said. Pharmaceutical companies have seen little potential for profit because outbreaks are unpredictable and typically small, Geisbert said. "It's not like cancer or heart disease, or even a prevalent infectious disease like malaria."

Until the current outbreak, many believed there wasn't a great need for a vaccine because the virus would cause only 10 to 100 cases a year, said Scott Lillibridge, assistant dean at the Texas A&M School of Public Health.

Ebola doctors sacrifice all to bring hope ; Like AIDS outbreak, they work front lines

Back in the late 1980s, when AIDS was emerging, I was a resident in the medical trenches at New York's Bellevue Hospital, drawing blood from patients and sometimes sticking myself with needles.

Medicine was a calling back then, and doctors in training were expected to take risks when necessary. We put intravenous lines in drug abusers with scarred up veins who were suffering from heart or AIDS-related infections. We came to know the statistics like our own telephone numbers -- one out of 250 needle sticks from a patient with HIV infection converted the health care worker to HIV positive. Some of us even came to know and worry about the unfortunate doctors who were afflicted.

Back in those days, when AIDS was an almost certain death sentence, fear of AIDS was dominant, yet we managed to overcome this fear and continue to do our jobs.

Flash forward to 2014, when Ebola rather than HIV is the emerging virus in the news. Ebola also carries with it a high likelihood of a horrible death, this time from lack of immune response, organ failure or uncontrolled bleeding. Ebola has been around for decades, but previous outbreaks have been controlled.

Now that there are more than 1,300 cases in West Africa and more than 700 deaths since March, people are becoming alarmed.

In Britain and Hong Kong, health officials have tested airline passengers showing early flu-like symptoms of Ebola. But travel advisories or even restricting travel won't help as they didn't help very much with SARS in 2003.

The ability to contain this outbreak, as in the past, starts at the source, and with the doctors working on the front lines. As it was with the early years of AIDS, so it is now: treating doctors who disregard their own safety in order to help others.

Americans Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, both of the aid group Samaritan's Purse, contracted the dreaded disease while treating patients in Liberia. On Thursday, Brantly received an "experimental serum" to treat the disease, but because there was only one dose, he gave it to Writebol.

Earlier this month, Ugandan doctor Samuel Muhumuza Mutoro and Samuel Brisbane, a prominent Liberian physician, died from the disease. In Sierra Leone, another top Ebola doctor, Sheik Umar Khan, has also died.

These doctors are inspiring role models for young doctors in training. They see medicine as a high calling, and they put their lives on the line to try to stop a viral freight train that is picking up speed.

The courage these doctors display is the only antidote to fear and the best protection we have from a deadly disease.

Marc Siegel, a physician, is an associate professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center. He is the author of False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear.

Ebola's spread gaining speed ; But outbreak risk low in USA

The Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in some areas but it is unlikely to pose a major public health threat in the USA, even if infected passengers arrive here on a plane, disease experts say.

The outbreak in West Africa is the largest and deadliest on record, with more than 670 deaths and more than 1,200 infections in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It "is gaining more speed in some locations and killing even more people and now is affecting even more countries," said Unni Krishnan, a doctor with British relief agency Plan International. "It is all quite worrying."

But the virus -- which has an incubation period of a few days to three weeks -- is actually much harder to spread than ailments such as the flu or measles, which can spread through coughing or sneezing, says Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota. Ebola spreads only through contact with the bodily fluids of people with active symptoms, the CDC's Stephan Monroe says.

Health experts at the CDC have been working with African nations since the Ebola outbreak began in March. But officials are on alert now, after news that a man with Ebola was able to board a plane and arrive in Lagos, the capital of Nigeria. He later died.

Ebola has spread in Africa partly because of customs in which family members wash the bodies of the dead. Health care workers are vulnerable because hospitals in developing countries often lack infection-control measures, Osterholm says.

Help is needed from around the world, says Stephen Morse of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. "People tell me they're working flat-out 20 hours a day."

West Africa's first-ever Ebola outbreak in humans is the most deadly and geographically widespread outbreak on record, and it threatens to spread.

According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 635 cases of Ebola have been diagnosed across three countries in the region since the outbreak was first declared in southeastern Guinea in March. It has since spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. At least 399 people have died.

"It's very much a serious outbreak," said Daniel Epstein of WHO. "I wouldn't say it's out of control, but the emergence of this outbreak definitely threatens regional public health security."

About 150 WHO experts work alongside local health ministries and clinics, as well as international partners, to stop the transmission chain, prevent new cases and treat those affected.

Key players from 11 countries in the region will meet in Ghana starting Wednesday to discuss the outbreak, as well as how countries in the region can work together to step up response efforts, WHO said.

Many challenges to fighting the virus -- one of the world's most virulent -- have developed, stirring concern the outbreak could get worse because of ignorance, the free movement of people, local customs and suspicion of foreign doctors.

"We've had really bad experiences where we've sent teams of health communicators into villages: They've been run out of the town; stones have been thrown at them; they've been threatened with machetes and told to stay away," Epstein said.

That's because many people are suspicious of foreign doctors and nurses and often deny the existence of Ebola, he said.

Despite mass public health campaigns about the modes of transmission, many communities continue to practice traditional burial rituals, which can help spread the virus.

"People come to say goodbye -- they touch the body, they kiss the body, they leave presents with the body," said Hilde de Clerck, a physician with Doctors Without Borders who just returned from Guinea.

---

CONTAGION

The Ebola virus, which has a mortality rate of up to 90%, is transmitted by contact with the blood, fluids or tissues of infected animals or people.

It causes high fever, vomiting, muscle pain and diarrhea and can result in unstoppable internal bleeding and organ failure.

Transmission risk is especially high among doctors, nurses and other health care workers. There is no vaccine for it, nor any known cure.

Television's latest supervillain: a killer with the ability to remain invisible and change shape while committing mass atrocities.

Viruses -- and the accompanying prospect of infection, illness and even pandemic -- are a core elements of Syfy's Helix and two upcoming series, TNT's The Last Ship (Sunday, 9 ET/PT) and FX's The Strain (July 13, 10 ET/PT).

Viruses have long played a dramatic role in film, appearing in such movies as The Andromeda Strain (1971), Twelve Monkeys (1995), Outbreak (1995) and Contagion (2011), whose producers consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and shot part of the film at its offices. On television, an Andromeda miniseries appeared on A&E in 2008, while 24's Jack Bauer dealt with bioterrorism in its third season and Heroes characters tried to prevent the release of a deadly virus in Season 2.

"It's an invisible monster that could run rampant and kill all of us. When we conceived of the show, that's what we thought could be a really interesting starting place for an end to the world," says Ship executive producer Hank Steinberg, adding that viruses can meld scientific accuracy with horror elements. "You walk into a room and everyone is your enemy. You breathe it and you die."

A virus' ability to adapt as it moves from host to host -- and also quickly around the world via air travel -- adds dramatic appeal. (That capacity to spread quickly is seen as an asset in the case of viral videos.)

"Viruses have the capacity to mutate, to change, to become more deadly, and therefore they're a great evil antagonist to your protagonist in a story," says the CDC's Barbara Reynolds, who has a Ph.D. in social psychology.

Range of treatments

Depictions in entertainment media range from "the almost documentary-like" science in Contagion to campier presentations, she says, and the topic has a strong pull on the public's imagination both in fiction and real life.

"We're dealing with MERS right now and, for some people, it's quite fascinating to understand what it does. If you use the word Ebola in a sentence, people perk up. Bacteria can be very deadly, but they don't tend to make the Hollywood scene in quite the same way."

The current TV shows deal with their shared topic in a variety of ways. Ship follows a Navy destroyer on a secret assignment in the Arctic, where it escapes a viral pandemic and, with the help of a virologist on board (Rhona Mitra), could be the source of a cure.

Mitra, who believe viruses are a piece of a larger conversation about humanity's ability to sustain a healthy lifestyle in the face of neurotoxins and rising autoimmune disease, says she is committed to conveying the science accurately on Ship while showing her character's passion for solving viral mysteries.

"It becomes this very intoxicating obsession, where they're so elusive and intelligent and brilliant and Machiavellian, almost," she says. "A strange sort of romance exists between a scientist and a virus. I love the fact that this woman is so locked in with this particular relationship, with a view that she can possibly save the human race."

Ship delves into humanity's influence on the environment, especially climate change, Steinberg says. "It relates to people's fears of global warming. In our show, the permafrost has melted and an ancient microbe that has been dormant for years that we've never been exposed to is released, and we have no antibodies."

Helix, which finished Season 1 in March and returns in 2015, looks at the potential ravages of a man-manipulated virus at a research center in Antarctica.

Primal fear

The modern-day story connects to our more primitive fear of epidemic disease, which goes back to the scourges of smallpox and the Black Plague, executive producer Steven Maeda says. The series explores man's relationship to nature, whether it is in manipulating viruses or changing the environment.

"The first season it was: Play God, pay the price. There is definitely a sense that even in your best intentions, you don't know what the ultimate result is going to be down the line," he says.

The Strain, based on the novels of Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, is less literal, as its virus is spread by vampires who feed on and infect the blood of their victims, who then become vampires. The lead character is a CDC official (Corey Stoll) and the show's title alludes to the biological connection.

"We live in a world where there are a lot of blood-sucking, parasitic creatures. In the case of our show, they just happen to be a lot larger than a mosquito," says executive producer Carlton Cuse. "The fear of infection is a much more tangible fear for people than being attacked by a vampire."

Beyond the damage caused by the virus, the show looks at the potential harm suffered by society if it is unable to cope with the threat of a pandemic.

"There's a deep cynicism about our social system's ability to cope with this kind of an epidemic. In a society where self- interest dominates, it's entirely likely that we might not respond with the alacrity we would need to contain something serious," Cuse says.

However large the threat, there is room for optimism in both the real and fictional worlds, the CDC's Reynolds says.

"We have some victories over viruses, so there's room for the storyline to come out as a success."

A few moments ago, I got the alert I didn't even know I had been waiting for during the course of the past 12 months.

At first, I assumed, because my iPhone was dinging with the urgency of not one but three sources, that the news must be of some urgency. Perhaps a piece of debris had been officially recovered from the wreckage of Flight 370?

I subsequently turned on CNN to find breaking news that a piece of the plane had officially NOT been found and that the plane was still missing.

Then, I thought maybe there was a major confrontation brewing on the border of southern Ukraine, but again, this was proved patently incorrect by President Putin's calming reassurance that he'd never do anything to harm his neighbors. (I don't know about you, but I take him at his word.)

So what, then, could this breaking-news alert be that sent my phone into a explosion of bells and dings? What would require every major news agency to stop what it's doing and text me frantically with the urgency of an impending nuclear annihilation? What could be so important that I was to stop cold in my tracks to look down at these ferocious news alerts?

Lupita Nyong'o was named People magazine's Most Beautiful Woman of the Year.

How could I have been so shortsighted to have forgotten that it had been 365 days since Gwyneth Paltrow had received the honor of being hotter than 7billion other people on the planet? How were residents in Sudan without cell service going to be made aware of this urgent information? What about my mother, who has not yet figured out to push the alert button on her settings page? Would she have to wait until her friends at the Tuesday night mahjong tournament broke the news to her in person? How would that make her feel?

You see, for the first time in history, news can be immediately dispersed and instantaneously consumed. I no longer need to sift through stories about unrest in the Middle East and impending climate-related catastrophes, because I now have Duran Duran (yes, I use Duran

Duran ringtones for breaking-news alerts) to notify me of a story's importance.

We have knowledge and information at our fingertips, so when important news like "There are 50 people more beautiful than you" breaks, we don't have to wait until 7p.m. for Brian Williams to tell us.

Of course, this all hinges on news media outlets not taking advantage of this enormous resource. This hinges on editors being discriminating enough to not alert me of something that isn't of the utmost importance. This hinges on the unspoken trust that exists between us and our news outlets. But when stories such as "the actress from 12 Years a Slave is so hot, she's hotter than Gisele Bundchen" are given the same precedence as "Ebola outbreak in West Africa kills over 140 people," one has to believe we're on the right track.

Oh, wait -- I had to look that ebola story up the old-fashioned way. I'm sure if it comes to the U.S., Duran Duran will alert me. Until then, how good does Lupita look in that dress?

Ebola toll spreads panic in West Africa ; Virus is 90% fatal, with no known cure

The rising death toll in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has sparked fear across the region with at least 80 already having died from the nearly always fatal virus.

"Every day we're reading about it in the newspaper, hearing about it on the radio, and wondering when it's going to come here," said Mossa Bau, 32, who lives in Dakar, Senegal. "Everyone is very scared because, really, it's a dangerous disease and no one has the means to stop it."

The World Health Organization estimates that 125 people in three countries have contracted the virus. Senegal shut its border with Guinea, where the outbreak is thought to have originated.

It was initially contained in four remote towns in south Guinea. But the country's Ministry of Health confirmed last week that eight cases arose in the capital, Conakry, with a population of almost 2 million people. Many of them live in slums without proper water or sanitation -- which is an opportune breeding ground for the highly contagious virus.

Two people, including one person who died, tested positive for Ebola in neighboring Liberia. The Ministry of Health there says at least six more people are suspected of contracting the virus, five of whom died. Sierra Leone recorded the same number of fatalities.

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids, such as sweat, blood or saliva, of an infected person or animal. One can get it through sex as well. There is no vaccine and about 90% of those who contract it die.

Bats are believed to be a natural carrier of the Ebola virus, but it is also found in primates and bush meat, like antelope. The first symptom is a high fever followed by vomiting, diarrhea and body aches. Some people even bleed through the eyes, ears and nose.

This is the first time an Ebola outbreak has hit West Africa. Countries in central Africa, such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, see outbreaks every two to three years.

As director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden leads an organization that protects Americansfrom disease outbreaks and other health threats. The former commissioner of the New York City Health Department met with USA TODAY's Editorial Board recently to discuss CDC's projects and current mission. His comments were edited for length and clarity.

Q: How is the flu season shaping up?

A: Well, so far, the strains we're seeing are extremely well- matched with the strains in the flu shot. But it's too early to say that that's what we'll see throughout the flu season. The only thing I can predict with certainty about the flu is that it's unpredictable. There are important trends with the flu. We have a high dose vaccine for the elderly, we've got a four-antigen vaccine, we've got the intradermal vaccine, we've got the intranasal vaccine, so there are more choices. We're also seeing more health care workers getting vaccinated, more pregnant women getting vaccinated.

Q: What about vaccines more generally, they're controversial?

A: We're doing well. One of the great success stories of CDC and the public health community is the Vaccines for Children Program, having its 20th anniversary, now. It has virtually eliminated health disparities in vaccination rates in our kids. It provides about half of all the childhood vaccines, and that protects the other half of the kids, too.

Q: HPV vaccine is effective in preventing cancer, but its controversial because it is supposed to be given to preteens before they become sexually active?

A: We are falling down on HPV vaccines. Human papillomavirus causes cervical cancer and oral cancers in men. We're only at a 30% vaccination rate. When we introduce a new vaccine, we expect to see a 10%-a-year increase in vaccination rates. We had no increase whatsoever last year. For every year we delay getting to 80%, it's another 4,400 girls who are going to get cervical cancer, even if we do pap smears.

Q: What's being done about that?

A: Ultimately, doctor recommendations make a big difference, and that's why we really focus on health systems. If you look at well- performing health systems all over, they have much higher vaccination rates, much higher disease control rates, so yes we need to do a better job of educating. We work very closely with providers, with the American Academy of Pediatrics and others, identifying best practices and figuring out how to scale them up, but I think there was a premature move to mandate vaccination for school entry, and that caused a backlash. It set us back a few years.

Q: The Food and Drug Administration's proposal to restrict the use of trans fat, which is in many popular foods, has made news recently. What is your perspective?

A: Artificial trans fats are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. You take any vegetable oil and you bubble hydrogen through it, and it turns solid at room temperature. That has great properties for your food, such as cake icing. Unfortunately, it has terrible properties for your heart, because it's also solid at body temperature in your coronary arteries. So it increases the risk that you're going to have a heart attack. The Institute of Medicine reviewed all the data and said there is no safe level of artificial trans fat.

Q: New York City, with you as its health commisioner, was among the first to act against trans fats. What happened?

A: The Board of Health banned artificial trans fats from restaurants. We heard that was going to be too expensive and, you know, we kind of believed them. So we ran a help desk for restaurants to replace their artificial trans fats. It was like being the Maytag repairman. Often for restaurants, it was as simple as calling their supplier and saying send us the trans fat-free variety. That's not the case with all products. But since New York City took the lead a few years ago and since the FDA required labeling of trans fat in 2006, more than half of trans fat is out of our food supply, and we've learned how to measure it in bodies. Around 5,000 people a year are dying from heart disease because artificial trans fat is still in the food supply.

Q: Dangerous new diseases now race around the world. There's one in Egypt and another in China. Can such outbreaks be contained?

A: Our ability to stay healthy is in large part dependent on the globe's ability to stay healthy. We are all connected by the air we breathe, by the water we drink, by the food we eat. We have more people with malaria in this country than ever before even though there's less malaria globally because we have more travel. So, one of the things that we are now focusing on is the concept of global health security, where we would help a country develop its capacity to find outbreaks and stop them, both to protect them and to protect us. We've been doing this for really decades, but we haven't yet brought it to scale.

Q: Is the global effort working?

A: We have some real success stories. Thailand didn't do any monitoring of flu. We taught them how. We trained their staff, now they're doing it with their own money. In China, after the deadly SARS outbreak, the Chinese came and said we want to learn how you do it at CDC. We had a collaboration before then, but it got much more intensive. Since then, we've been helping them learn how to monitor the flu, learn how to grow it in the lab, learn how to sequence it. When H7N9 flu hit, within hours China posted the DNA sequence on the Internet. We could download it, and with modern genomics, we could begin making diagnostic tests, which we've now sent to every state in the country and 100 countries around the world. We began the work to make a vaccine, and that extra couple of months really helped us.

Q: What do you need to have that you don't have?

A: We can deliver vaccines, antibiotics to any place in the U.S. within hours. We operate 24/7. We have an emergency operation center staffed consistently. We have people in every state and 50 countries. But we've seen about a billion dollars go out of our base budget, $7 billion to $6 billion basically, over the past few years, with accommodation of sequestration and shifts to other funding sources. Partly, we're concerned about things we're not finding because we're not tracking as intensively as we could. And I'm particularly concerned about the global threats. There are too many blind spots. What's happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo? Where's the next Ebola virus going to come from? We don't have some of the molecular genomics that would allow us to find bacterial risks faster and stop them faster, what we call advanced molecular protection. There are 46,000 fewer people working at state and local health departments today then there were five years ago. Those are my biggest concerns.

Q: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one problem under your jurisdiction, what would it be?

A: It would have to be tobacco. It still kills more than 440,000 people a year. Most Americans who have ever smoked have already quit. Most who still smoke want to quit. And it just is unparalleled as a cause of suffering and death in this country. We think there are ways to make a lot more progress. We've got a tobacco lab that has found out some very interesting things about what the industry is doing to increase the addictiveness of cigarettes. We've got a tobacco control program that ran the first-ever program tips from former smokers, which we'll be running new versions of in the coming year, and they really work. There's an interesting statistic: The more coverage there is of the harms of tobacco, the more people quit.

Q: Are we seeing a revival of the tobacco epidemic, with flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes?

A: We're seeing kind of Whac-A-Mole. We've got flavored small cigars getting around at least three or four loopholes. Flavored cigarettes are banned. Flavored cigars that look just like cigarettes are not banned. They are not taxed at the same level as cigarettes, so they cost a lot less. They're sold a few at a time instead of in 20 packs so they're easier for kids to buy. I really worry about our kids. Because if the next generation gets hooked, you're talking about a lifetime struggle with addiction.
