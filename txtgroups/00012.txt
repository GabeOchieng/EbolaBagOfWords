CURED Ebola victim Teresa Romero is given an emotional farewell from doctors and nurses as she leaves hospital yesterday.

The Spanish nurse, 44, was the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa as she cared for dying missionaries in Madrid.

She was given a number of treatments, including blood plasma from an Ebola survivor.

Ms Romero was discharged as President Obama asked Congress to approve £3.88billion in new funds to combat the disease which has killed nearly 5,000 people.

OF all the charities which do their bit for suffering humanity, I confess a particular admiration for Medecins Sans Frontieres.

The spectacle of highly qualified unarmed professionals putting themselves in harm's way to relieve the agonies of distant people is inspiring and humbling.

They could be at home or scanning cruise magazines to recover from the stress of, say, working in the NHS. Yet they give up vacations or years to engage in this most noble of services to their fellow humans.

The outrageous American quarantining of these heroes and heroines on their return from Ebola-affected countries has at least had the benefit of giving their work a higher profile.

To me, they are the true "missionaries" of our time, not only doing extremely practical work but carrying in their very presence the vital message of non-judgmental compassion.

Age and the lack of skills would prevent me joining their ranks even if I could summon the courage for it.

That leaves me with the second-best option of donating whatever my selfishness might allow.

BRITAIN is spending £20million on three labs in Sierra Leone to halt the spread of Ebola.

The centres will increase capacity and speed up the testing of samples.

The first lab opened in Kerry Town last week and doubles the number of tests that can be carried out.

Two more are being built in Port Loko and Makeni.

When all three are running they should quadruple the daily number of tests.

Test results will be obtained in 24 hours, compared with five days.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: "Britain's best scientists will be at the forefront, ensuring that people are isolated and treated as soon as possible."

The UK has now committed £225million to the fight against Ebola.

TD Mick: I was on plane..& this will hurt Irish tourism

A TD has claimed the "overzealous" reaction to an Ebola joke on an aircraft last week could damage tourism.

Mick Wallace was on the Milan to Dublin service when businessman Roberto Binaschi sparked mayhem by writing "Attenzione Ebola" [be careful, Ebola] on a coffee cup.

The Independent deputy slammed airline and security staff reaction as "over-zealous and over-officious".

He said: "The only thing at risk of getting infected were our tourism numbers. This was clearly an over-the-top reaction and the whole situation could have been quickly and easily resolved with common sense and discretion."

He urged people to try and act rationally in these situations to avoid future scares.

The TD added: "Our airline staff have serious responsibilities, we all know that, and they do a fine job.

"But knowing the difference between a family joke and an international incident shouldn't be difficult."

The incident occurred last Thursday after a cabin crew member went to dispose of the cup and spotted the message.

She notified the pilot and gardai and the HSE were informed.

All 142 passengers had to remain on board for more than an hour until the incident was declared a hoax.

Binaschi, his 51-year-old wife and 23-year-old daughter were brought to an isolated section of Dublin Airport and later taken to Ballymun Garda station.

The women were released without charge but Binaschi appeared at Dublin District Court on Friday where he admitted writing the message.

But the company director insisted he was just teasing his daughter over "the fact she was quite keen on cleanliness". Binaschi also confessed to using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour on board an aircraft.

Judge Anthony Halpin ordered Binaschi to pay a €2,500 donation to a homeless facility under the Air Navigation and Transport Act.

Comparing the incident to a bomb scare, Judge Halpin said he could not think of a "more serious offence", given the current crisis.

Italian sorry for coffee cup alert

AN Italian businessman has been spared jail and a conviction after an Ebola joke with his daughter led to a security scare at Dublin Airport.

Roberto Binaschi from Milan admitted writing "Attenzione Ebola" on a coffee cup on board an Aer Lingus flight from Italy.

The 56-year-old later handed the polystyrene mug to cabin crew to dispose of and a security alert was launched.

Appearing in Dublin District Court yesterday Binaschi pleaded guilty to using threatening abusive or insulting behaviour on an aircraft.

Judge Anthony Halpin said he couldn't think of a "more serious offence" in the present climate and compared it to saying there was a bomb on the flight.

Despite this he let Binaschi off under the probation act and ordered him to donate €2,500 to a homeless facility. Dressed in jeans, blue top and jacket Binaschi appeared before the court yesterday morning where garda evidence was given that the IT company director had been on flight AI433 from Milan to Dublin on Thursday.

During the course of the flight his daughter ordered a cup of coffee but Binaschi took the first sip "knowing the fact that she is quite keen on cleanliness".

His daughter finished the coffee.

Speaking through an interpreter Mr Binaschi explained that 20 minutes from landing he handed the mug to cabin crew "in the ordinary course of cleaning up". An air steward, who didn't speak Italian, returned a w a short time later to ask him what was written.

The pilot landed the flight in Dublin airport at 1pm on Thursday but did not allow passengers to disembark.

A cordon was placed around the plane and Binaschi, his partner, 51, and 23-year-old daughter were moved to an isolation area where it was established they did not have the Ebola virus.

All three were later arrested under section 48 of a the state airport act 2014 but the two women were released. Binaschi's solicitor Michelle Finan said it was an extremely unfortunate incident and her client, who was travelling to Ireland for a job creation conference, had no previous convictions.

Judge Halpin told the court: "I can't think of a more serious offence given the present day fear of Ebola.

"The only comparison I believe is someone writing on a napkin, 'There is a bomb on the plane'."

Binaschi said: "I clearly realise what I have done and never again in my life would I treat such subjects with such a superficial attitude in a public space, especially on public transport."

Judge Halpin said he believed the accused had learned his lesson from the incident.

He ordered Binaschi pay €2,500 to the Capuchin Friary on Bow Street, Dublin.

The accused left court with his wife and daughter after the hearing.

SO the world's most famous work experience girl Monica Lewinsky continues to cash in on her affair with Bill Clinton as part of what could only be called her "It's All About Me" tour in the States.

Speaking in Philadelphia, the 41-year-old told how she now made it her mission in life to end cyber bullying.

"I fell in love with my boss in a 22-year-old sort of a way. It happens.

"But my boss was the president of the United States,'' Lewinsky gushed to the audience about her infamous sexploits.

Her affair with Clinton almost cost him his presidency after he was impeached by Congress and later acquitted by the Senate in 1999 on charges of lying under oath and obstruction of justice.

However, not content with playing the victim since getting to know the White House carpet all those years ago, Lewinsky is now on her anticyberbullying campaign after saying she was the world's first person to be trolled online.

"I was Patient Zero,'' she said.

Her tastelessness appears to know no bounds.

Its one thing to continue, almost 20 years after, to make money from her affair with Clinton but to use the phrase "patient zero" at a time when people are dying worldwide of Ebola is insensitive at best.

After all, didn't she bring her "sickness" on herself?

UK force may grow to 3,000

BRITAIN is about to commit more troops to tackle deadly Ebola in West Africa.

As the UK pulls out of Afghanistan, sources say the MOD expects to be asked to increase the 800 personnel it is sending to Sierra Leone. The US has dispatched 3,900 troops, mainly to Liberia, to help contain the virus.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of chemical and biological weapons for the British Army and Nato, said: "Ebola is winning on all fronts.

"The military should help contain the disease to treatment and isolation centres - and this might be by force. Nobody else can react quickly enough." Mr de Bretton-Gordon, now boss of Avon Protection Systems, added: "Vaccines will not be available to the masses in West Africa for six to nine months.

"The US has 3,000 troops - it would not be a surprise if the UK matched that."

Travel firm to flog tours of despot Kim's secretive state...despite closed borders

ADVENTUROUS travellers are being offered holidays to North Korea - the world's most isolated state.

Dictator Kim Jong-un's country has little nightlife, a ban on jeans and trainers, a strict haircut policy and insists all tourists have a government guide with them.

But a holiday firm wants to show another side to the hardline Communist nation when it exhibits at the World Travel Market in London for the first time next week.

Experience North Korea boss Nathalie Armengol said: "We want to change people's minds about North Korea. People are really surprised when they visit.

"You have to respect the rules and stay with your guides, but you will see amazing beauty and untouched nature."

A seven-day city tour starting in the capital Pyongyang costs £2,000.

North Korea, which recently executed 10 officials for watching foreign soaps, has closed its borders due to Ebola but Nathalie expects the ban to be lifted shortly.

Russia will get to mine North Korea's rich natural resources in return for a £15billion project to upgrade the country's railways.

Full-scale emergency action after a man claimed to have deadly disease

THREE people were arrested yesterday after a sick Ebola hoax was pulled on an Irish plane.

The three, all Italian, were detained by police at Dublin Airport after it was claimed a man wrote "Be careful, Ebola" on a coffee cup.

A man, 56, and two women - aged 54 and 23 - were brought to Ballymun Garda station for questioning.

Another passenger who was on the flight contacted his daughter to say a man had written the disturbing message on the paper cup.

The pilot decided to contact the authorities and HSE paramedics raced to the scene.

A spokesman for the DAA confirmed the matter was investigated and health officials were satisfied a short time later the suspect did not have the virus.

The Aer Lingus plane was put in lockdown after the pilot radioed the details back to the emergency services.

The 1pm flight from Milan was held on the runway and gardai and the HSE were alerted. It was released an hour later after paramedics discovered it was a hoax.

An airport spokesman said: "A passenger on board an Aer Lingus flight from Milan has made a claim during the flight that he had the Ebola virus.

"As a precaution the plane's captain alerted authorities and opted not to deplane passengers pending further investigations.

"Passengers have now disembarked the aircraft. An Garda Siochana are dealing with the matter.

"As this is a security matter, we have no further comment."

A day earlier, emergency services conducted a mock run of how to treat a real Ebola victim.

Streets were shut down and the dummy-patient was brought to the Mater Hospital.

A 56-year-old man is due to appear in court this morning charged in connection with the scare.

The Italian national, his partner and her daughter were all arrested after a cup was allegedly handed in with "Attentione Ebola" written on it to a flight attendant.

The trio - supposed to begin a holiday in Ireland yesterday - were brought to an isolation section of the airport where it was discovered that it was a hoax.

The two women were later released. The man is facing the possibility of jail but sources say a fine is more likely.

Gardai, the fire brigade and ambulances were put through their paces in preparation of a patient bringing the potentially-lethal virus into the country. Although the HSE said the chance of an infection here is low, it was taking no precautions.

Health workers in full protective suits could be seen wheeling a "patient" into Dublin's Mater Hospital.

Gardai shut down roads during the test, which officials labelled "major incident planning".

A spokeswoman said: "Supervised evaluation of ambulance and hospital staff will take place at all stages to ensure a potential patient is safely managed and staff are well versed in necessary procedures."

Civil servants check for killer virus

CIVIL service pen-pushers with just half a day's training have been drafted in to carry out checks for Ebola on passengers at Heathrow.

The 80 volunteers quiz travellers from high-risk countries such as Liberia who could be infected with the deadly disease, then take their temperatures.

The civil servants were drafted in to get the system up and running while Public Health England recruit staff to work in the screening rooms.

The Cabinet Office stressed that they are working alongside clinicians who take charge if anyone appeared to be carrying the disease. But Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh said it was "more evidence of this government's shambolic handling of this serious issue".

The Labour MP added: "Public health should not rely on people's goodwill. If there is a job to do, it should be done by properly-trained staff."

The Cabinet Office insisted that the volunteers had been given proper training. This included being told about how the virus is transferred and the risks they face, which officials said were "very low".

They have also been taught to use a gun-style thermometer that allows them to take travellers' temperatures from a safe distance without physical contact.

A spokesman said: "This Government's first priority is the safety of the British people. Trained civil servants are helping staff screening rooms as a short-term measure to deal with a serious public health issue."

But Shadow Health minister Jamie Reed said: "If screening at airports is going to work, Ministers must make sure there are enough health workers. A lack of staff cannot mean something so serious is left to volunteers."

More than 10,000 people have now been infected with Ebola worldwide and around half have died, global health chiefs said over the weekend.

Screening started at Heathrow a fortnight ago. And it is also being brought in at Gatwick. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt sparked confusion when he suggested that travellers would have to volunteer to be tested. But Downing Street said the checks were compulsory.

Experts said tests are unlikely to detect infected travellers but they do provide an opportunity to tell anyone who might develop symptoms the importance of seeking medical help.

Cam talks tough but doesn't rule out UK coughing up £1.7bn

FURIOUS David Cameron yesterday refused to pay the UK's bombshell £1.7billion bill from Brussels by the December deadline as he took one step closer to an EU exit.

The rattled Prime Minister described the demand as a "lethal weapon" that made Britain leaving the EU more likely.

The backdated 2billion euro bill arrived last Friday after officials recalculated how much countries should put into its coffers. Britain was given just six weeks to pay.

At a press conference, a red-faced Mr Cameron raged: "It is completely unacceptable. I am not paying that bill on December 1. It is not going to happen."

He said the demand "does not help" his case that the European Union had to be reformed. He ranted: "You do not join an association that suddenly thumps you with a bill for two billion euros, weeks before you've got to pay it. It shouldn't get surprised when its members say it's got to change."

But experts said Britain would eventually be forced to hand over the cash.

Labour blasted the Government after Treasury officials sat on the bill for nearly a week before the PM was told. Chancellor George Osborne had known for days.

Outgoing European Commission boss Jose Manuel Barroso insisted all member states had "approved" the new approach.

Yet the PM said he only found out last Thursday as he headed for an EU summit in Brussels. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls fumed: "What has our Prime Minister been doing? Surely the Treasury's known for weeks?" He warned the UK now had little clout in Europe and added: "David Cameron is isolated."

Mr Osborne could be hauled before MPs next week over why his Treasury appeared blind-sided. The Commons European scrutiny committee launched an "urgent" inquiry.

It is a disaster for the Tories as they gear up for a by-election battle with UKIP next month.

UNigel Farage said the bill would "boost" his anti-Europe party and the PM had no choice but to pay. The UKIP leader said: "There's nothing he can do. He's in a weak position."

Holland, Italy and Greece also face big bills. France is up for an £801million rebate while Germany gets £614million and Denmark £253million. Mr Cameron said he and Italy's Matteo Renzi had torn into officials yesterday.

He revealed: "Renzi said 'This is not a figure, it is a lethal weapon'. That is what the Italian Prime Minister said. I agree."

Mr Cameron hinted he may be prepared to compromise on a smaller figure.

Commission spokesman Patrizio Fiorilli insisted: "Britain's contribution reflects an increase in wealth, just as in Britain you pay more to the Inland Revenue if your earnings go up."

It overshadowed other developments at the summit, as leaders agreed more cash to fight Ebola.

Mr Barroso delivered a parting shot to Mr Cameron by offering him a copy of his 600-page memoirs. Tories described the gift as a "slap in the face" for Britain.

Action stepped up as NY doc gets virus

MILLIONS of experimental Ebola vaccine doses will be ready by the end of 2015, health officials announced yesterday.

And it was revealed a doctor has become the fourth person in the United States to get the killer virus.

The World Health Organisation said vaccines could be offered to medics in West Africa as soon as December.

Officials say "several hundred thousand" will be produced in the first half of next year, rising to millions in 14 months.

But experts warned vaccines to counter Ebola, which has no proven cure, will not be a "magic bullet" for ending the outbreak, which has killed more than 4,800.

Yesterday health officials in New York began tracing people who had been in contact with Dr Craig Spencer, who has tested positive for the disease.

He returned from Guinea on October 17 where he was treating Ebola patients. The 33-year-old came down with a fever on Thursday and was rushed to the city's Bellevue Hospital, where he is stable.

Dr Spencer had travelled on the subway and had gone out jogging before he started feeling unwell. His fiancee and two friends have been placed into quarantine.

Texas nurse Nina Pham, 26, who was infected with Ebola earlier this month, was yesterday declared free of the virus and was greeted at the White House in Washington by President Barak Obama.

The WHO is accelerating vaccine development. It normally takes years to produce and test a vaccine, but drug firms are working to get one ready within weeks.

Two experimental vaccines, by Glaxo-SmithKline and the Public Health Agency of Canada, are in safety trials with results expected in December.

European Union leaders agreed to boost their financial help towards fighting Ebola from £475million to £790million.

HEALTH officials were monitoring 43 people around the clock in Mali yesterday after the country confirmed its first case of Ebola.

It has become the sixth country in West Africa to be hit by the outbreak after a girl of two who recently arrived from Guinea became the first to contract the killer disease.

Two of those countries, Senegal and Nigeria, have now been declared virusfree by the World Health Organisation.

A DRUG smuggler was left to die when bags of cocaine in his body split because airport staff feared his shivering was a sign of Ebola. The Nigerian man collapsed in Madrid airport and lay trembling for an hour with officials unwilling to touch him.

He arrived on a flight from Istanbul on October 18 and died from an overdose 90 minutes later, El Mundo newspaper said.

It added: "A civil guard put the man on his side and identified him from personal documents.

"When it was clear he was a Nigerian, no one dared touch him. Medical staff decided there was a risk it could be Ebola."

HOSPITALS in Ireland were yesterday urged to prepare for the possibilty of an Ebola outbreak.

Although the scenario was described as "unlikely", the National Public Health Emergency Team held a meeting to consider the level of preparation required.

As well as briefings on the virus, hospitals have appointed co-ordinators to deal with Ebola issues.

Medics were also told to ask patients with fevers about their travel history as soon as possible.

EBOLA could kill 90,000 people in one Liberian county by mid-December unless control efforts are increased, experts say today.

Researchers predict 170,996 people will catch the disease in Montserrado.

Britain last night gave a further £80million to fight the virus in Africa, bringing our funding to £205million. But Downing Street is angry others are not following suit.

Yale University Prof Alison Galvani says: "The possibility of averting calamitous repercussions from an initially delayed response is eroding."

Back in 1949, the Californian science fiction writer George Stewart wrote Earth Abides, one of the all-time sci-fi best sellers. In it he warned that the growth of air travel could enable a new disease to spread rapidly round the world and wipe out most of the human race.

Sixty five years on, our governments are scrambling to try to cope with Ebola.

If a science fiction writer could work out the potential risk, it says a lot about the short-sightedness of governments around the world that they didn't put in place the mechanisms to cope with what was always going to be inevitable.

We discovered Ebola nearly 40 years ago and yet we are still weeks away from getting the jabs that could provide the cure.

Britain's given £125million, four times as much cash as France and £31million more than Germany.

People who have recovered from Ebola have antibodies which fight the virus. If the vaccine is successful it could be rolled out to tens of thousands by January.

DJ Read puts on bad Caribbean accent in song backing Farage

DJ Mike Read yesterday released a bizarre UKIP tribute song which he sings with a mock Caribbean accent to a calypso tune.

The 67-year-old former Radio 1 host provoked dismay and anger with lyrics which included: "Illegal immigrants in every town - stand up and be counted, Blair and Brown."

Labour MP David Lammy said: "UKIP Calypso is everything we've come to expect from a party whose politics is based firmly on prejudice."

The song continues: "Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in."

UKIP activists are urging supporters to buy the calypso, by The Independents, for 79p on Amazon to push it to No1 in the charts.

But one Amazon reviewer wrote: "Surely we should have moved on from white men singing in funny accents? Sad reflection of a sick society."

Read first performed the calypso - a musical style originally from the West Indies - at a private dinner during UKIP's party conference where leader Nigel Farage gave his seal of approval.

And Mr Farage gets a special mention y "in one verse: "Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new Prime Minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again - when Nigel is at No 10."

But Labour veteran John Prescott tweeted: "I never knew Mike Read had a criminal record. I do now."

Former Tory supporter Read claimed it was not "remotely racist" to sing in a mock-Caribbean accent.

He said: "It's a satire and a bit of fun. It wouldn't have sounded very good sung in a Surrey accent." And he added later: "Apologies if anyone has taken offence, but I've worked and sung in Jamaica for the tourist board and had fun with the guys there doing the accent."

Comments on Amazon yesterday also included: "My god, the musical equivalent of the Ebola virus. Anyway, isn't calypso music a bit foreign for UKIP?" Read, who now works for BBC Radio Berkshire, has had limited musical success. His musical about Oscar Wilde closed in 2004 - after just one night.

Bookies last night made UKIP Calypso 50-1 to reach No1.

Mr Casey was asked to give an internet interview instead.

He raged on Facebook: "I'll be on BBC World tonight from my London hotel room, speaking about how they're reaching me by Skype because of their ridiculous policy. For f**** sake, I don't have f***ing Ebola!" And a New York Times journalist due to appear on BBC2 was told to use Skype because she could be "a health risk", even though she has no symptoms.

The BBC said: "There is no ban.

Where people have been exposed to the virus we recommend interviews by phone or videophone." The World Health Organisation yesterday declared Nigeria free of Ebola as screenings for the virus began at Gatwick Airport.

TYRRELSTOWN VIRUS SCARE

Daughter slams reaction after mum-of-three falls ill at apartment

THE daughter of a woman rushed to hospital with suspected Ebola has claimed she had a headache.

Ireland was placed on alert yesterday after the 37-year-old mum, who is originally from Nigeria, fell ill at her apartment in Tyrrelstown, West Dublin.

She was taken by ambulance to the Mater Hospital at noon, where she was kept in an isolation unit while tests were carried out for the deadly virus.

The mum-of-three tested negative a short time later and last night her 18-yearold daughter blasted the heavyhanded the heavymily response .

Speaking at the family home the young student, who asked not to be named, said: "She only had a headache.

"There were all these stickers outside saying don't come in, what the f**k is that for?

"They are making a big deal out of nothing and honestly my mam, if she gets back and you guys write anything, she will sue all of you because you are making a big deal out of nothing.

"The gardai are wrong, we are going to have to speak to them later. You can say that."

The woman's close pal last night described the response as an "overreaction".

She said: "This week Nigeria was declared Ebola free. She does not have Ebola.

"We do not want to come here and pollute Ireland with this as we are equally Irish. I think the HSE should take it easy."

The drama unfolded when the woman, who has lived in Dublin for 15 years, fell ill at her home in the The Plaza apartments in the village.

An ambulance was called shortly after 10.30am and upon arrival paramedics from Dublin Fire Brigade became concerned she was displaying symptoms of Ebola.

The woman had recently returned from a visit to Nigeria and medics were concerned that she may have contracted the virus there.

Gardai were called and the HSE was informed. The National Isolation Unit at the Mater Hospital was prepared for the woman.

It has 12 beds and was set-up to treat people with highly-contagious conditions. Paramedics, dressed in hazmat suits, attended the apartment.

The woman and members of her family were seen leaving the flat wearing masks.

Members of the Garda traffic unit cleared the roads to get the woman quickly to hospital.

Despite this measure, TD Mattie McGrath claimed they were still delayed by an earlier rally.

He explained: "Although the ambulance crew clearly made every effort to get this unfortunate woman to the Mater Hospital as quickly as they could, they were hampered by the backlog of traffic caused by a protest earlier this morning."

The HSE issued a statement a short time after the tests.

It read: "The patient was considered a low risk for the Ebola virus but this has now been ruled out.

"The HSE must, and does, take each Ebola scenario seriously no matter how low the risk.

"All appropriate infection control procedures are being taken by all relevant healthcare personnel.

"The patient is receiving appropriate treatment at the Mater Hospital. HSE public health protocols have been, and are being, put in place."

The HSE went on to say there are no known cases of Ebola in Ireland and the overall risk of it being brought into the country is low.

The news comes after it was revealed earlier last week that more than 12 people in Ireland have been tested for Ebola.

The Dail's Health Committee was told 23 tests have been carried out on 14 people but none of them have been positive.

Leo Varadkar confirmed a case had emerged in Co Louth on Wednesday but had been ruled out by officials.

The Health Minister said: "We have had one or two presenting in unusual scenarios claiming they have Ebola but they have never been to the region or come in contact with it.

"Nonetheless you have to take these things seriously. You can't dismiss them."

The World Health Organisation said the death toll from Ebola has reached 4,447 out of 8,914 reported cases.

Brit who caught virus 'delighted' to go back

THE British nurse who survived Ebola has flown back to the country where he caught the virus to rejoin efforts to tackle the epidemic.

William Pooley, 29, said he was "delighted" to return to Sierra Leone as he attempts to prevent "as many unnecessary deaths as possible".

He was due to arrive in capital Freetown last night before resuming work today in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff.

He became the first Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Mr Pooley, from Eyke in Suffolk, said: "The real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them."

He will be working with the King's Health Partners team, training local staff and helping to set up isolation units.

In neighbouring Guinea, British scientists have arrived to begin work on finding a cure for Ebola. Dr Peter Horby, of the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health at Oxford University, is leading a four-strong team which will fast-track trials on prototype drugs.

At home, a legal wrangle is holding up the construction of a new NHS unit for Ebola victims at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle. The city's NHS Trust is in dispute with Laing O'Rourke construction over alleged shoddy work.

In Colchester, Essex, a man in his 50s is being treated in isolation at the town's general hospital after complaining of a fever. He travels regularly to Africa but health officials say it is unlikely he has Ebola.

Meanwhile, a hospital laboratory worker from Dallas, Texas, has tested negative for the disease.

The woman had spent most of a cruise holiday on the Carnival Magic in isolation after it was thought she may have been exposed to Ebola.

Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero, 44, in hospital in Madrid, is now clear of the virus, tests have showed.

She became unwell on October 6.

PATIENTS could be treated with untested medicines from early next year after the Government backed a controversial new bill.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night supported Lord Saatchi's proposed Medical Innovation Bill, which has divided opinion amongst doctors.

If approved, it will allow victims of rare diseases to volunteer to be treated with experimental drugs.

Advertising boss Lord Saatchi, whose wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer in June 2011, told the Daily Telegraph: "In dealing with the Ebola outbreak, the World Health Organization has decided a departure from evidence-based treatment is fully justified. It has set ethical guidelines for the use of new therapies."

The bill will be debated in the Lords on Friday.

Headmistress Carolyn Brown said in a letter to parents: "We take the risk of Ebola seriously but here is no more risk of catching it in Kenya than there is in the UK."

He leads African video campaign to fight disease

DAVID Beckham has told how seeing thousands die from Ebola is "heartwrenching" as he leads a "race against time" to beat the virus.

More than 9,000 people have been infected so far in the world's deadliest ever outbreak of the disease, with at least 4,500 killed.

The global football icon, who visited the worst-hit nation Sierra Leone six years ago, appears in a new video to be screened there telling how to prevent the bug spreading.

It will be broadcast on TV, in football stadiums, town halls and community centres.

The video aims to help break down any stigma and shame connected to the disease, highlight the importance of cleanliness and encourage people to protect themselves and seek medical help if they have symptoms.

Becks, 39, has also recorded a second video message in his role as a Unicef ambassador, urging people around the world to donate to the organisation's urgent Ebola appeal.

His involvement came as David Cameron revealed his fury at other nations for failing to help finance the fight against the virus.

DEVASTATED The Prime Minister stressed that Britain is "leading the way" with a commitment of £125million - and wrote to EU leaders calling on them to pledge a billion euros in aid.

Ex-England captain Beckham, in his Sierra Leone video, tells of his visit in 2008, saying he was inspired by the "amazing people" in a country then devastated by civil war.

The dad-of-four goes on: "Today the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy - a ferocious Ebola disease that is spreading fast across West Africa.

"The images are heart-wrenching. As a father, I can't imagine what it must feel like seeing your child suffer. Give Unicef the help it needs. We're in a race against time."

Barack Obama last night asked three emergency drug labs in the US to submit plans to boost production of the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp.

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron, in Milan for a summit meeting said: "This is the world's biggest health problem in a generation. Britain has been leading the way. "It's time for other countries to act in a similar way to Britain in Sierra Leone, America in Liberia and France in Guinea."

While the attention of the world has been focused on Syria and the Ebola crisis the people of the country are on the brink of starvation.

Mr Clarken pointed out that while widespread famine can be prevented, urgent action is needed to avoid a human catastrophe.

By the time an emergency was declared during the 2011 humanitarian disaster in the Horn of Africa 125,000 lives had been lost.

The international community simply cannot allow this to repeat itself in South Sudan.

Oxfam's plea as nation edges closer to humanitarian disaster

THE Ebola crisis is dominating the headlines in Africa but charity workers have warned South Sudan stands on the edge of disaster.

The combination of hunger and conflict has pushed the region to the brink of devastation and Oxfam Ireland has appealed for help to combat the situation.

South Sudan achieved independence in 2011 but since then 10,000 people have been killed and more than one million have fled their homes.

Almost four million people are on the brink of starvation and Oxfam Ireland Chief Executive Jim Clarken has called on people for their help.

As humanitarian crises in the Middle East dominate news headlines and the world rallies to tackle the Ebola outbreak, hunger and conflict have combined to push South Sudan - the world's newest country - to the very brink of famine.

The recent Scottish referendum is a stark reminder that even in times of peace and democracy, the path to independence can divide a nation.

In Ireland, we know too well the enduring struggles the journey towards independence can bring.

South Sudan became the newest country in the world in 2011 following two decades of civil war in what was then part of Sudan.

A green country not unlike our own where the River Nile flows, independence brought optimism for a brighter future.

But the high hopes of just three years ago now lie in tatters.

At least 10,000 people have lost their lives and more than one million have fled their homes.

Around four million people (more than the population of Leinster and Munster combined) are struggling to find enough to eat.

Oxfam Ireland and other Irish aid agencies including Christian Aid, Concern, Goal, Trocaire, Tearfund and World Vision have warned the number of people in South Sudan facing dangerous levels of hunger is expected to increase by one million between January and March next year.

They are not the victims of nature, but of a disaster which is the result of a political dispute between two leaders that has escalated into a conflict rooted in the unresolved tensions of the Sudan civil war combined with the proliferation of arms and the lack of development in what is one of the poorest countries in the world.

Despite this, the sheer number and scale of crises worldwide - Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Ukraine, the Central African Republic and now the Ebola virus among them - means the rapidly deteriorating situation in South Sudan has slipped off the news agenda.

The UN has declared South Sudan the world's worst food crisis. But if we wait for an official declaration of famine to put South Sudan in the global spotlight, it will be too late. The conflict has meant that people were not able to plant crops.

Camps are becoming overcrowded and poor sanitation is increasing the risk of disease. Gwada Joseph, 27, walks through open sewers in the Malakal camp for internally displaced people in the Upper Nile province, where heavy rains are making life intolerable for civilians. She fled her home in Malakal town during the second rebel attack on her area in February.

Her husband was unable to escape and died in the fighting, while Gwada, her mother and four children made it to the safety of the UN camp.

Her home routinely floods in the rains, making life unbearable for her and her children.

The rains in Malakal mean flooding is a regular occurrence and it is common to see people having to wade through water and mud that's knee deep with little escape from mosquitoes, sewage and disease.

International aid - including Ireland's contribution - has had a significant and positive impact on Gwada and her people's lives.

Food distributions make the difference in people eating even one meal a day and clean water has prevented more serious outbreaks of disease, while the distribution of solar lamps is helping keep girls and women safe.

Yet a massive funding gap remains (the UN World Food Programme estimates that €61million is needed each month to deliver assistance) and the outlook for 2015 is of great concern, with news that 2.5 million people are projected to be in crisis or emergency from January to March 2015.

Sadly, this is not a crisis that will be ended simply with more aid. There needs to be political pressure to end this conflict.

If the international community really wants to avert a famine then it must take a stronger stance towards the leaders of South Sudan increasing diplomatic efforts to end the fighting.

The world must protect the country's people from violence - without ending it, the threat of famine will never be far away.

With more vigorous diplomacy and swift action to convene a political solution inclusive of all people in South Sudan, the world has a chance to prevent that.

Otherwise 50,000 children will die from malnutrition unless we wake the world up and act now.

Because declaring a famine is like declaring a car crash - once it happens, it's too late.

He visited Sierra Leone in 2008 and went to the town of Makeni, which has been particularly badly hit by Ebola, with many young children dying.

New figures published by Unicef reveal around 3,700 youngsters have already lost one or both parents to Ebola.

In the message, Beckham says: "I was inspired to have met so many amazing people and to see the beautiful country.

"While there I was lucky enough to get a glimpse into the lives of children in remote villages and the challenges they faced in a country then devastated by civil war.

"Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy - a ferocious Ebola disease that's spreading fast across West Africa."

A MEDICAL supervisor with a clipboard walks without any protective clothing just feet away from a nurse with Ebola.

He handles items given by someone in protective clothing who has just touched US nurse Amber Vinson, 29, then joins staff on the plane at Dallas, Texas. He left the plane at Atlanta, Georgia, where the nurse is now in isolation.

Medical airline Phoenix Air claimed their supervisor made the process safer because he had better vision and mobility. Medical director Vance Ferebee said: "Protocols were followed and there were no violations."

It has emerged that Ms Vinson went on a commercial flight from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas on Monday though she reportedly warned she had a temperature. Officials are trying to track the 132 passengers.

Ms Vinson nursed a Liberian who died of Ebola last week in a Dallas hospital. A second nurse there also has the virus.

Panic as man falls ill with symptoms

A PASSENGER sparked panic on an Air France flight yesterday when he fell ill with Ebola-like symptoms.

Spanish health chiefs were forced to activate emergency measures after the man, flying into Madrid on flight AF1300, was feared to have the killer bug.

The passenger had begun to shiver with a fever during the journey from Lagos, in Nigeria, which went via Paris.

After landing at Barajas International, he was rushed to hospital and was last night undergoing tests for Ebola.

The 156 passengers, two pilots and five crew were eventually allowed off the Airbus A321 and were monitored for symptoms.

Meanwhile, Danish authorities revealed they were testing a health worker for the disease while a nurse in France was also being observed. And Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the UK could see cases here before Christmas. He said: "We will see someone with Ebola arriving in the UK. The Chief Medical Officer thinks it will be a handful of cases in the next three months." His comments came as immigration officers at Heathrow were banned from shaking hands with passengers arriving from Ebola-hit areas. France became the fourth country after the UK, the US and Canada to introduce screening for the virus at its main airport, Charles de Gaulle.

Last week Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, a nurse in Madrid, became the first person outside of Africa to contract Ebola.

The World Health Organization puts the death toll at 4,440, with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea the worst-hit countries. The disease has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the US.

Yesterday, a team of British Army medics flew to Sierra Leone and will be joined at the end of the month by 225 troops on board the Navy's RFA Argus, which is due to sail for West Africa today.

Minister confirms latest case emerged 2 days ago

MORE than a dozen people have been tested for Ebola in this country with a suspected case emerging two days ago.

The Dail's Health Committee was told 23 examinations have been carried out on 14 people but none of them have been positive.

Leo Varadkar confirmed a case had emerged in Co Louth on Wednesday but had been ruled out by officials.

The Health Minister said a number of people have presented themselves at hospitals claiming they have the deadly disease.

He added: "We have had one or two presenting in unusual scenarios claiming they have Ebola but they have never been to the region or come in contact with the region. Nonetheless you have to take these things seriously. You can't dismiss them."

The Health Minister said there were 59 Irish citizens registered in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

He said if any of the these people contracted the virus they would have to consider whether it is worthwhile bringing them home.

Mr Varadkar added: "If they can be treated on the ground and treated well on the ground, that would make more sense than taking the risk of repatriating them from the country.

"We do also have to bear in mind that by its very nature repatriating someone does bring the disease into Ireland.

"But at the same time, I can't possibly countenance the idea that we would leave an Irish citizen uncared for."

Independent Senator John Crown said the strongest infection control in the world has been caught "a bit like deer in the headlights" by the spread of the Ebola.

He added it is "plausible" this country could see cases of the deadly virus but there would not be a Hollywood apocalypse.

The Irish Medical Organisation yesterday expressed concern over how prepared we are here.

President Trevor Duffy said: "Obviously everyone in this country hopes that the Ebola virus is a problem that we never have to deal with.

"But in the event there are incidents of the virus that emerge here or scares about potential incidents, it is critical that we have arrangements and structures in place."

£46bn wiped off FTSE as markets slump worldwide

NEARLY £46billion was wiped off the value of Britain's biggest companies yesterday amid mounting fears about the global economy.

The FTSE 100 slumped to a 16-month low, closing 181 points down - or 2.8% - at 6,211.6.

There has been a sharp slide in share prices over recent weeks.

Around £169billion has been knocked off the stock market value of Britain's biggest 100 firms since the middle of May, with the FTSE tumbling by 666 points between then and now.

Yesterday's tumble was mirrored by markets around the world.

More than £160billion was wiped off share prices elsewhere in Europe, which endured the biggest fall for three years.

In the US, the Dow Jones slid by more than 300 points - 1.9%. David Buik, market commentator at or at British investment bank Panmure Gordon, said: "There is an awful stench of fear about."

He believes the sell-off may be limited because of the paltry returns on offer from other investments.

The global panic was triggered by a wave of gloomy economic figures. Data in the US revealed a worrying 0.3% fall in shop sales last month.

It came a day after Germany cut growth forecasts for this year and next. Last week the International Monetary Fund reduced its prediction for global economic growth, warning the recovery was "weak".

Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG France, said: "All the ingredients are there for further losses."

Justin Urquhart Stewart, from even Investment Management, said that yesterday's slump was partly down to fears about the impact that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa will have on airlines.

MEDICAL staff have been praised after dealing with a suspected Ebola case.

Health Minister Jim Wells said there was a "potential scare" at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry on Tuesday.

A man arrived with possible symptoms of the disease.

He thanked staff who worked with different agencies to quickly declare the incident a false alarm.

A Western Health Trust spokesman added: "Following advice from the Public Health Authority and health experts in London it was determined the patient would not have been in danger from contracting Ebola."

Mr Wells estimated between 15 and 20 staff from here were among the 600 UK medics treating victims in West Africa.

He said: "It is unlikely someone would travel directly, for instance, from Liberia to Belfast so, crucially, entry points, ports and airports, will have to be very carefully checked. It is a worry."

The DUP man took part in an emergency meeting with UK health ministers yesterday to discuss ways to prevent the virus landing on our shores.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he will make sure proper liaison takes place between Northern Ireland and the Republic to stop Ebola spreading here.

Nurse sparks outbreak fears

World leaders' summit on disease

US health chiefs were last night racing to track down 132 people who flew with a nurse the day before she was diagnosed with Ebola.

Amber Vinson, 29, had cared for Liberian Thomas Duncan, who died of Ebola last week at a hospital in Dallas. She flew back to the city from Cleveland on Monday.

The revelation that Ms Vinson had been on an internal flight shortly before being diagnosed sparked fears the virus could spread across America. However, crew members on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 said she showed no symptoms. The virus is only contagious once symptoms appear.

Next morning Ms Vinson developed a temperature and on Tuesday night tested positive. Last night her stepfather reportedly said: "She's doing OK. Her temperature is going down."

Dallas city officials are contacting the residents of all 330 flats in the complex where Ms Vinson lives, as doctors urged all passengers on the flight to call them so monitored. Yesterday they could be monitored. Yesterday David Cameron had a video conference with US president Barack Obama, and leaders of Germany, France and Italy, about efforts to beat Ebola, which they described as "the most serious international public health emergency in recent years".

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was last night due to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. It came after a UN official said the world is falling behind in the race to contain Ebola, which has killed 4447 contain Ebola, which has killed 4,447 people. Meanwhile, Brit volunteer nurse Will Pooley, 29, who survived the virus, said he is preparing to return to west Africa to help deal with the epidemic.

Howden-le-Wear Primary School in County Durham has cancelled the visit of a teacher from Ghana in West Africa because of fears over the disease.

YESTERDAY'S turmoil shows the fragile state of the UK recovery.

Things may be picking up here but there are looming dangers. The most obvious is the crisis-hit eurozone, hurtling towards another recession.

When Germany suffers a sharp slowdown, you know Europe's in trouble. And we rely on the EU for 40% of exports, so it matters hugely.

But there are wider fears, not least the Chinese economic juggernaut stepping down a gear. Then there's the big unknown: Ebola.

Fears about its impact have already hammered airline share prices but that would be nothing compared with what happens if the outbreak spreads.

The stock market tumble in recent months matters for millions, as it is affects the pension funds we rely on.

And while the lower oil price means cheaper petrol, it is also an indicator of weakness in the global economy.

So while the UK is an island, it is inextricably linked to the rest of the world economically. What happens over the next few months will impact the strength of our companies, the pound in the pocket and, potentially, the outcome of next year's election.

Screen airline passengers BEFORE they leave

UK troops should carry out Ebola screening on people flying out of West Africa, a top military expert believes.

The stark warning came as the first checks on people arriving at Heathrow yesterday were branded "a joke".

One of the first passengers to be screened for Ebola said he was only tested after he told staff that he had arrived from Liberia.

As fears grew that the killer disease will continue to spread across Europe, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former Army head of chemical and biological weapons, said the only way to contain the killer bug was to test everyone as they left the affected countries instead of as they arrived in others.

Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who now runs consultants SecureBio, says UK troops being sent to Sierra Leone should screen everyone leaving Freetown by land or sea.

He said: "We have to rigorously enforce a quarantine in West Africa or we are not going to get this under control." He added screening once passengers arrive in the UK is too late. He said: "We should approach Ebola as though it's a biological weapon."

Public Health England claimed passengers who had boarded an indirect flight to the UK from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone would be automatically flagged at passport control.

But Sorious Samura, 51, had to volunteer to be checked at Heathrow yesterday after arriving via Brussels.

He had spent 10 days in Liberia making a film about Ebola.

Mr Samura said: "Most of the people who had been on our flight didn't go into the screening room.

"I only went because I felt a sense of responsibility, having seen the s effect of Ebola. The official even shook our hands. That's something nobody does now in Liberia."

The World Health Organisation said the death toll had reached 4,447 out of 8,914 reported cases.

The death rate for those infected had risen from 50% to 70%. A UN worker died in Germany yesterday after he caught the virus while working as part of a medical team in Liberia.

Airport checks are expected to be extended next week and will cost £9million over the next six months.

VOICE OF THE

THE confusion in Government over how to keep the UK safe from Ebola doesn't instil confidence.

Either airline passengers from West Africa are screened properly or travellers with the virus will be admitted unwittingly and it will be too late.

When even answering a questionnaire is voluntary because, according to Downing Street, it was the "polite thing to do", you have to wonder if the authorities have a grip.

Far better than monitoring airline passengers when they get off a flight in Britain would be to screen them before they board the plane.

Where the Government does deserve praise is in sending NHS staff and troops to combat Ebola on the front line in West Africa. Why not send health staff to work alongside airline and immigration staff stationed abroad? The best way to avoid panic is for the Government to be in control, implementing a sensible strategy to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.

Teething problems are understandable and indeed initially forgivable but it isn't too much to expect competence and professionalism when lives are at stake.

Let's take the fight to Ebola instead of waiting for the virus to reach us.

Football host sees red over remark

TV football presenter Jeff Stelling has red carded himself from Twitter after his son was shot down for his "s****" goalkeeping.

The host of Sky Sport's Gillette Soccer Saturday said he was shutting his account as he did not trust himself to reply in the "correct way" to certain people.

Stelling, 58, said he was "steaming" after confronting a tweeter who slagged off his 14-year-old son Matthew.

The Twitter user is said to be a player who scored against Stelling's boy. The former Countdown presenter launched a furious defence of his son while saying he would "chat" to the tweeter when the teams play again. Speaking directly to the user zakutd, Stelling said: "u called my son a s**** keeper then deleted it.

Don't go all innocent now. It is not banter. It's abuse My son is 14." The host, who also presents Sky's Champions League coverage, then asked the user how good he was at football.

The Twitter user posted: "if someone called my son a s**** keeper id probably laugh. why is he having a tantrum."

In a final Twitter posting yesterday, Stelling said: "Thanks for your support over last couple of years. Am closing account as I don't trust myself to respond to some people in a correct way."

Followers waded in to the row, with some questioning why Stelling was so angry over one comment.

Hartlepool fan and dadof-three Stelling is not the only high-profile presenter to quit the social network after a row.

Last week BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew, 54, said he was leaving Twitter to "the bullies al and trolls" after he received a torrent of abuse. He had got into a heated debate with Jessica Taylor, the wife of ex-England star Kevin Pietersen, and was suddenly deluged with comments from other users.

One person even contacted him directly saying they hoped he would become the first British victim of Ebola.

On his account, Agnew said: "This is not what Twitter was when I joined."

The Test Match Special commentator briefly re-opened his account yesterday to tweet messages of support to Stelling but reaffirmed his intention to quit.

Stelling has presented Sky's Saturday football show for 20 years and introduces games on the Fifa 14 computer game.

Experts warn of global infection spike

THERE will be 10,000 fresh Ebola cases worldwide every week by the end of the year, it was warned yesterday.

The World Health Organisation also revealed the fatality rate of the killer virus has jumped from 50% to 70%.

Its experts said 1,000 new cases have been diagnosed weekly over the past four weeks and this is set to soar.

Speaking from its HQ in Geneva yesterday, Dr Bruce Aylward said more needs to be done to combat Ebola.

He added there have been 4,447 deaths and 8,914 infections with most cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Critical of the slow international response, he warned unless efforts are stepped up, over the next 60 days "a lot more people will die".

Dr Aylward said more co-ordination is needed between the various health teams and charities on the frontline.

He added: "There's a lot of actors on the ground and an awful lot of them are working with Ebola for the first time.

"The challenge now is making sure all of that adds up to the kind of plan to stop this disease.

"Any sense that the great effort that's been kicked off in the last couple of months is already starting to see an impact — that would be really, really premature."

Fears that Ebola is creeping closer to our shores were reaffirmed as it claimed its first fatality in Germany yesterday.

The Sudanese United Nations official died after contracting the disease during a medical mission in Liberia.

A spokesman said: "The patient sick with Ebola fever died during the night in St Georg Clinic in Leipzig.

"Despite intensive medical measures and maximum efforts by the medical team, the 56-yearold succumbed to the serious infectious disease."

The man arrived in Germany just five days ago and was one of three people being treated in the country, one of the others has since been released from hospital.

Meanwhile, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla donated almost €20million to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation.

The 30-yearold said: "We need to get Ebola under control in the near term so t it doesn't become a long-term global health crisis we fight for decades at a large scale, like HIV or polio."

THE World Health Organisation has warned the number of cases of Ebola detected each week could hit 10,000 by the end of the year.

The global response to this killer virus has been negligent to say the least and the group has insisted more needs to be done.

WHO boss Dr Bruce Aylward said talk of stemming the tide would be "really premature". Plenty of charity groups have been making their way to Africa to try and assist but a truly co-ordinated effort is required.

Failure to heed these warnings now could lead to an international catastrophe.

Hunt admits lethal virus may be here within weeks

AIR passengers arriving in Britain from West Africa will be given a fever test after health chiefs warned yesterday the UK will be hit by its first case of Ebola within weeks.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the killer disease is expected to arrive here soon and there could be a "handful" of cases over the next three months.

Mr Hunt told MPs that starting today people arriving at Heathrow Airport's Terminal One from West Africa would be made to take a temperature test.

He said that by the end of the week this and other checks would be extended to other Heathrow terminals, Gatwick Airport and Eurostar terminals.

Mr Hunt said the advice of the nation's Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies was to boost preparations "for a possible increase in the risk level".

But he said the overall threat to Britain remained low and we were "among the most-prepared countries in the world".

He added: "The situation will get worse before it gets better but we shouldn't flinch in our resolve to defeat Ebola, for the safety of the British population and as part of our responsibility to some of the poorest countries on the planet."

The Government last week said arriving passengers could be subject to a health check. But ministers have now decided to also demand the temperature tests. Public Health England said checks would involve a reading from the ear or forehead. Passengers will also have to fill in a questionnaire on their travel plans.

Mr Hunt admitted that airport screening would only cover 89% of travellers coming to the UK from the affected region.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told MPs the Government should be planning for the "worst case scenario".

Professor Derek Macallan, of St George's, University of London, said airport screening for the virus would prove "really difficult".

Mr Hunt said the number of Ebola cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea was doubling every three to four weeks. So far 4,033 people have died.

Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organisation, said the crisis threatened international peace. She added: "I've never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure."

The nurse believed to be the first person to contract Ebola in the US during the outbreak was yesterday named as Nina Pham, 26, of Fort Worth, Texas. She was stable in hospital.

The price of chocolate could rocket as the Ebola crisis threatens cocoa growers, industry experts have warned. Two-thirds of the world's cocoa beans are produced in West Africa.

CRISIS IN THE HSE

Save money at all costs culture to blame for failings

Not even €4billion boost could rescue sinking system

Nursing boss's damning attack on flawed policies

NOT even a €4billion cheque would be enough for Leo Vardakar to save our sinking HSE, a nursing boss claimed in a damning attack yesterday.

Irish Nurses' and Midwives' Organisation general secretary Liam Doran also said "poor decisions and flawed policies" have left us with a medical service that is unsafe, unsatisfactory and failing patients.

Speaking exclusively to the Irish Mirror, he unleashed a scathing assessment of a succession of health ministers and insisted seven years of a "save money at all costs" policy is to blame for our inadequate health system that is €650million in the red.

Painting a bleak picture of the reality in Ireland's understaffed, underfunded and overcrowded hospitals, Mr Doran claimed we'll struggle to cope with an outbreak of flu this winter - never mind Ebola.

He also described how:

waiting lists and trolley lists have grown

we have 5,000 fewer nurses than we had five years ago

2,100 public beds have been shut

dismayed medical staff have quit Ireland because their hearts, souls and minds are broken

700 people have been discharged with nowhere to go, and

the public has been "far too tolerant" of the shocking inadequacies.

The INMO chief said "you couldn't make up the level of mistakes" that have been inflicted on our health service - and rubbished the Government's excuse that it has no money to fix things.

Claiming it will take at least three years to get the HSE back on track if it gets adequate investment, Mr lH a Doran admitted the biggest crisis facing our health service isn't a shortage of money but rather a complete lack of staff.

He revealed: "As much as I would like to say 'give us back the €4billion you took out over the last six or seven years', I think it would be foolhardy to say that because you would have money but you wouldn't have the staff.

"I think we have a very, very difficult situation now facing the health service because if you turned on the tap with regard to money, we don't have the manpower to recruit the staff we need to open any additional beds. If you now look at all the large hospitals around the country, they'll tell you the nurses have all gone.

"If we had sat here 10 years ago today, we'd be having the same conversation.

"The reforms that have gone on since 2005 have been reforms of management system structures, not of how we deliver care to patients."

As we revealed last week, Health Minister Leo Varadkar has hit the ground running and secured an extra €500million for his department.

But while the INMO has faith in the new man in charge, the fear is there's no political will around the Cabinet table to give the ailing service the kiss of life.

Mr Doran claimed: "There's been a short-sightedness in policy which has always said 'you can do more with less' but you can't and now it's doing less with less.

"Sadly, we've not just hit the wall, we're below the waterline now. But I do think the new minister gets it - the health system can't continue under the policies of recent years. The litmus test will be whether his Cabinet colleagues agree with him and whether they will allow him the funding necessary to stabilise it and then to grow it over the next five years."

Mr Doran told the Irish Mirror the result of years of savage cuts is a health service that's "unsafe, there's no dignity and there appears to be no real plan to deal with it".

And describing how bad our Third World-style system has become, he said a lack of reforms had failed the country, the medics and the people who rely on it.

Mr Doran added: "We are counting trolleys for 10 years and I have to say that if you're still counting something after 10 years, then haven't we all failed miserably to deal with the problems?

"The abnormal becomes the normal and the fact two people are on trolleys just two feet apart and can hear every bit of each other's medical history being taken, using commodes in front of each other."

And throwing down the gauntlet to the Coalition, Mr Doran said: "This business we have no money is, at the very least, an inadequate response.

"We have choices, this Government has made choices and the choices it's made have been very, very difficult on the public health system.

"I think they've assumed incorrectly the service will always make do, will always deliver."

He pointed to the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, Co Louth - which has been in the spotlight lately because nurses are protesting over the severe overcrowding and lack of resources - as a shocking example of the state of the HSE.

Urging the Government to back its Health Minister and give him the funding he needs, Mr Doran warned: "Health has been open to attack by all shades of political parties.

"The health service doesn't have any political friends and I think it's been left in an impossible situation.

"No one is winning. No matter what measure you back apply to the health system in the last six months, no one is winning."

But even if there's money to play with, the union chief fears ministers have underestimated just how many healthcare staff have been forced to emigrate - and how difficult it will be to get them back.

Mr Doran added: "If and when the Government realises it has gone too far, too fast and it has done damage so it tries to undo that damage. I think it has totally underestimated the mobility of healthcare professionals and I don't think they realise how difficult it's going to be to attract back and retain the number of nurses, midwives and doctors of the highest calibre that we need.

"All they've done for the last five years is cut numbers in an unplanned and unmanaged way and that is doomed to failure.

"I mean how can we attract back our staff when, not only do we have a problem with our health system, but then we have problems with mortgage access and the price of housing?"

However, he warned of not robbing Peter to pay Paul, adding: "You can't give Medical Cards to all under-sixes when you can't guarantee a bed to anyone within a reasonable number of hours when they come into hospital and you can have your entire stay on a trolley."

Nurse the HSE back to health

THE general secretary of the Irish Nurses' and Midwives' Organisation paints a bleak picture of a health service that is approaching the point of total collapse.

In an interview with the Irish Mirror he claims the "save money at all costs" policy has left people with a highly-dysfunctional health service.

While money might have been saved, lives have been lost and will continue to be until this madness stops.

The reality is the health service we are lumbered with came about through dreadful decisions made by incompetent health ministers and uncaring governments.

Mr Doran is right when he says these "flawed policies" have given us a system that can actually be a threat to patients' health.

In a bid to please their Troika paymasters this Government continued with the cuts that have left Ireland with a Third World health service.

That the HSE resorted to attempts to doctor the waiting list figures is proof that the situation is rapidly deteriorating.

What is even more alarming is Mr Doran's claim that even if an extra €4billion was injected into the health service it wouldn't be enough to save it such is the damage that has been done.

It is comical to hear ministers and HSE officials boast of dealing with Ebola when it would struggle to cope with a moderate outbreak of flu.

The health of the nation must take precedence over all other issues and cash must be found to reopen beds and hire medical staff.

THIS is nurse believed to be the first person to have caught Ebola in the US.

Nina Pham, 26, of Fort Worth, Texas, was stable in hospital yesterday - as the British government announced air passengers arriving from West Africa will be given a fever test.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the killer disease is expected to arrive in the UK soon and there could be a "handful" of cases over the next three months.

Atarting today people arriving at Heathrow Airport's Terminal One from West Africa would be made to take temperature test.

By the end of the week this and other checks would be extended to other Heathrow terminals, Gatwick Airport and Eurostar terminals.

Professor Derek Macallan, of St George's, University of London, said airport screening for the virus would prove "really difficult".

Mr Hunt said the number of Ebola cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea was doubling every three to four weeks. So far 4,033 people have died.

Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organisation, said the crisis threatened international peace. She added: "I've never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure."

Meanwhile, the price of chocolate could rocket as the Ebola crisis threatens cocoa growers, industry experts have warned.

Two-thirds of the world's cocoa beans are produced in West Africa.

Maybe by the time I get back, the Executive will be functional, a cure for Ebola will have been confirmed and world leaders will have relearned the lesson of European history that you can't defeat religious fanaticism with weapons.

Clearly, I need some sunshine and a bit of fun - not least because I have a feeling in my waters that we need something like a peace movement.

All of a sudden the Ebola outbreak is a potential global catastrophe. Do I detect a whiff of racism? It was down the lists when it was only affecting thousands of West Africans.

But suddenly a few Americans and Europeans are infected and the powers-that-be are finally listening to what Medecins Sans Frontieres has been warning for months.

Not only have thousands already died but daily life in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone has been wrecked.

The wide economic damage - which will indirectly shorten the lives of many more - is already horrendous and ramshackle health services have simply been overrun.

For some reason, I find myself comparing the panic to the response to the barbaric beheadings of four westerners - and indeed to western foreign policy since 9/11.

Within three months of the latter event which cost almost 3,000 lives, 10,000 Afghans - mostly non-combatant men, women and children - were killed in the massive US-led reprisal attack on the country blamed for harbouring the perpetrators.

The fact that 9/11 was carried out by fanatical Saudi Arabians was buried.

Within a couple of years, Cheney, Bush and Blair attacked and totally destabilised Iraq - against the advice of the expert Arabists in the US State Department and the British Foreign Office.

That's not to mention leaders of the World Council of Churches and the Vatican who cherished the relative religious freedom under Saddam Hussein compared to the crazy sectarianism they knew - and warned - would be let loose if he was toppled.

Within a year, something of the order of 100,000 Iraqis were killed - and we're surprised by the rise of jihadis all over the place? As a lifelong witness to political folly, I have developed a black sense of humour. I'm tempted to suggest the West's well-equipped disinformation machines feed the supine media the line that Ebola is a jihadi plot and then you'd see a really serious global effort to defeat that little virus.

However, I know they would simply increase the militaristic response that is recruiting more and more to the jihadi cause.

New virus threat as Boris warns it will come to UK

A NURSE who treated the man in the US who died of Ebola has tested positive for the disease, officials confirmed yesterday.

The female health worker, who was in an isolation unit last night, had worn a protective mask and suit while dealing with the patient in hospital.

Boris Johnson yesterday warned he had "no doubt" that the lethal virus would end up in the UK too.

The nurse in America had cared for Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed in Texas soon after arriving from his native Liberia where he is believed to have contracted the disease.

Dad-of-one Thomas, 42, died at the Dallas hospital on Wednesday, 11 days after being admitted.

HIGH-RISK

The nurse tested positive in a preliminary test for the disease and was in a stable condition last night as she waited for the results of a follow-up check.

It will be the first case of the virus being contracted in the US. It is thought the nurse may have come into contact with the bug while taking off her protective gear after the patient's dialysis treatment.

An inquiry is looking at possible breaches during two "highrisk procedures".

Health boss Dr Thomas Frieden said: "We're deeply concerned about this development." He added "clearly there was a breach in protocol".

London Mayor Mr Johnson said plans to screen people at Heathrow and Gatwick airports was a "far from perfect solution".

He added: "I have no doubt, I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city."

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that calls to the NHS non-emergency 111 phoneline are to be screened for possible Ebola sufferers.

It came after a major eight-hour exercise was staged in the UK - including in Newcastle and West London - to test medics' readiness for an outbreak.

Yesterday Spanish authorities said there was growing hope for a nurse infected with Ebola while treating patients in Madrid.

The disease has killed more than 4,000 people during this outbreak which has mainly hit three countries in West Africa. Liberia is the worst affected with 2,316 victims.

Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contamination from objects such as needles.

Python John: I'm looking forward to death

JOHN Cleese has admitted he is looking forward to being as dead as the parrot in his much-loved Monty Python sketch.

The comedy legend, 74, also said he would never make another film because the gruelling workload would end up killing him.

Asked if he would write a third movie after A Fish Called Wanda and Fierce Creatures, he replied: "No, because it is too much like hard work.

"It is two-and-three-quarter years and I am too old for that process. If I started on it now I would die.

"I have only got five or six years left and I will be gone - I won't have to worry about ISIS or Ebola, I am looking forward to it. Most of the best people are dead - I will be in excellent company having a wonderful time."

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literary Festival to promote his autobiography, So, Anyway..., the Fawlty Towers star also admitted he no longer watched comedy on TV.

He said: "The sad thing is, and this is quite sincere, when you have been doing comedy for as long as I do, you really do know most of the jokes."

And he revealed he and the Python team were never "huge friends". John said: "The key to understanding Python now is we have all driven off in completely different directions.

"Michael [Palin], as you know, makes those travel programmes that I put on any time I can't sleep. Eric Idle is very good at lyrics so he is writing songs. Terry Gilliam is off trying to raise money for one of his plotless extravaganzas.

"And Jonesy [Terry] is just insane - he writes children's books and recently went to Lisbon and directed an opera about vacuum cleaners."

John said he wrote his autobiography in pencil in Moleskine notebooks over the space of four months.

He went on: "I settled down to write it and it was the most enjoyable thing I've done for years. A great deal of the time I made myself laugh."

Charity hits out at Irish Army not joining fight

GOVERNMENT plans not to deploy troops to West Africa to help fight the Ebola virus have been branded "a disgrace".

The question of sending an Irish Army mission to join forces from the US, the UK and other countries had been raised last week at a Government task force meeting, but was reportedly shot down by a number of senior Cabinet officials.

Charity organisation GOAL claimed the decision sent out the wrong message.

Chief executive Barry Andrews said: "If the Irish Government takes on board this recommendation and confirms it will not be deploying Irish troops to West Africa because of health and safety concerns it will be nothing short of a disgrace.

"What they will essentially be saying is that it is acceptable for Irish aid workers to step up to the mark and travel to the region, but that it is too risky for the men and women of the Irish Army.

"This will clearly send out all the wrong messages."

He added: "No one doubts the bravery of our defence forces. We have seen them deployed successfully to some of the world's most dangerous regions, including the Golan Heights, Chad, Kosovo, the Lebanon and other conflict-torn areas.

"Firstly, there is no conflict in West Africa. Secondly, because they won't be working directly with Ebola patients, the risk of contracting the virus is minimal, if non-existent. This recommendation does not make any sense."

The advice came after GOAL recommended Ireland consider developing a national response plan for the crisis.

The plan would incorporate deployment of experts from the Irish military to West Africa to lend their expertise in building treatment centres.

A BRITON who died abroad may have sparked an Ebola scare by joking he had the virus, a friend revealed last night.

Colin Jaffray, 58, fell ill with a fever during a business trip to Macedonia and passed away on Thursday evening.

The hotel he was staying in with pal Mike English, 62, was sealed off by armed police.

Mr Jaffray last visited Africa six years ago. If tests prove he died of Ebola he would be the first UK victim.

But Mike and 27 other guests still quarantined in the Skopje hotel are said to be convinced the samples will come back negative. There is speculation locally that the Brit died after a drinking binge although he was not a heavy drinker.

Speaking from the hotel last night Mike said: "Colin had a very English sense of humour. My theory is that he joked, 'Oh, it's Ebola' and they took it seriously."

Mike, on a trip with his friend to find investors for a fish farm, said medics panicked when Colin's passport showed stamps for Kenya and Rwanda.

He suffered from vomiting, fever and internal bleeding, all signs of the killer disease.

Mr Jaffray lived in Heydon, Cambs, with wife Dawn and daughters Erin, 20, Makenna, 22, and Morgan, 25. Mrs Jaffray was too upset to comment yesterday.

BRITAIN'S fight against Ebola could be crippled by cuts to border control staff.

Unison claim 33 of 43 health-screening workers at Heathrow have been axed by the Coalition or face redundancy next month.

General secretary Dave Prentis said: "The Government's short-sighted decision to reorganise on-entry screening is based purely on money and ignores the risks to public health."

Yesterday, it emerged flights from Gatwick to Sierra Leone will resume next week. Fledgling West Africa carrier Gambia Bird said it was responding to economic and humanitarian needs.

It came as British Airways extended its suspension of direct flights from Heathrow to Liberia and Sierra Leone until March.

Scientists at a British firm say they have developed a 90-minute test for Ebola. Current checks can take up to 24 hours to process. The outbreak has now killed more than 4,000 people.

Morocco last night called for the African Cup of Nations, which it is due to host in January, to be postponed over Ebola fears.

The FTSE 100 was down another 1.4% yesterday, falling 91 points to 6339.9.

It leaves the group of London's top 100 listed companies worth £140bn less than they were a month ago.

Worries about the global economy, particularly in Europe and Asia, have been accompanied by a wave of selling in energy and commodity stocks due to oil price falls.

Fears over the spread of Ebola from West Africa have also unsettled markets.

EBOLA is now a global crisis and the Taoiseach is right when he says the outbreak is of the "gravest concern".

With more than 4,000 deaths and the number of cases doubling every three or four weeks, it seems like an epidemic that is out of control.

Of most concern is that the World Health Organisation has confirmed that the virus is now "entrenched" in the capital cities of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea where medical facilities are at best primitive.

Medecins Sans Frontieres has reported a huge increase of new cases in the last few days.

The WHO has said the best way to stop the disease spreading out of Africa is for Ebola to be tackled and contained in the countries where it is now rampant.

The international community must make all possible resources available in this fight.

While the HSE insists clear protocols are in place for health staff to manage any suspected case the public are concerned that the threat is not being taken seriously enough.

The Irish Medical Organisation yesterday said doctors and frontline staff needed the resources and structures to deal with any eventuality.

To its credit the HSE has provided much useful information in the last few days and to a great extent has reassured the public.

While there is no immediate danger, the potential threat is so great that all public health agencies must be ready to deal with the disease should it reach these shores.

STATESIDE

The rate at which Ebola continues to spread coupled with fears generated by the first death of a victim on American soil has led to calls in the US for travel to and from West Africa to be stopped.

The idea was mooted following the shambolic handling of victim Thomas Eric Duncan who died on Wednesday after vital time in his treatment was lost when bungling staff in Dallas sent him home with antibiotics despite being informed he had just flown in from disease-ravaged Liberia.

This failure to screen him properly and allow him to walk out the door led to up to 100 others needlessly being put at risk in the days before he was finally placed in isolation.

The situation was compounded further by the long delays in the cleaning of the home where he had been staying and the moving of other residents in the area to a safer location.

But the lessons Americans were quickly forced to learn should serve as a warning as the threat of Ebola moves ever closer to our shores, despite measures being in place.

At present anyone leaving West Africa is screened before being allowed to board a plane. Their temperature is checked, and they must fill out a detailed questionnaire asking if they have various symptoms, such as headache, vomiting or fever, and if they have had any contact with Ebola patients or other possible exposures.

On the whole, the system appears to be working.

Though the epidemic has been growing since it was first identified in March, scores of people have been blocked from boarding planes and only the Dallas case has reached the US.

However, despite the thorough questionnaire for travellers, it has proven to be open to abuse.

The Governor called West travel Duncan, who brought the virus here on a flight from Liberia via Brussels, did not answer honestly.

He had no temperature when he left Liberia or when he first arrived in Dallas but it is said that he lied on his form.

When asked if he had been exposed to anyone with Ebola, he answered no, even though he had carried a pregnant victim just days before she died.

Thankfully, despite his tragic death, none of the people he had close contact with have yet to develop symptoms.

But the arrival of Ebola in the States has brought about an almost hysterical reaction in many.

Some, including heavyweight politicians such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, pictured above, have even gone as far as to call for travel to and from West Africa to be banned.

Their thinking is just plain wrong and could in fact hinder the fight to stop Ebola rather than help it.

What is not in question is that America has some of, if not the best, personnel and expertise to tackle such epidemics.

And if such doctors as Kent Brantly and Rick Sacra as well as aid worker Nancy Writebol - all of whom contracted the disease - were to be prevented from returning home, they may elect not to go in the first place, therefore weakening the fight against the virus.

Louisiana has for a Africa ban Such people's worth to West Africa right now is immeasurable and one that must not be prevented.

It is through such people's expertise that screening in West Africa has vastly improved preventing hundreds, if not thousands, from becoming infected.

By all means look at possible screening of inbound fliers to any country, after all once on foreign soil they might be less tempted to lie since they will already have arrived at their destination.

However, we should not let the mistakes in Dallas see the rest of the world suffer as a result.

Texans believe everything is bigger in their state but, when it comes to ridding the world of Ebola, so far only their stupidity has proven to be.

PANIC swept through the Macedonian capital of Skopje last night after it was feared a British businessman died of Ebola there.

The 58-year-old was rushed to hospital at 3pm yesterday from a hotel with fever, vomiting and internal bleeding - symptoms of the killer disease. Just hours later he was dead.

A second man who had been staying with the victim was in a hospital isolation unit after suffering a high temperature.

Tests have been sent to Germany in a bid to find the cause of death. If it is the virus, the man will be the first British victim of the disease that is raging through Africa and has killed more than 3,000 people. The Macedonian health ministry's Dr Jovanka Kostovska said the victim had "symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions". But he added: "We can't confirm the patient died from Ebola.

"The patient had a body temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius when he arrived. That is not characteristic for Ebola."

The medic said test results should be known within 48 hours. The Super Osmica hotel where the two men were staying was quarantined after the scare.

It was believed neither had visited Ebola countries before their arrival last Thursday.

There were local reports the victim was an alcoholic.

BATTLING EBOLA: GOVERNMENT U-TURN

It is an awful disease... we'll screen at airports

MINISTER IN MORNING

GEORGE OSBORNE LUNCHTIME

PEOPLE entering the UK from countries affected by Ebola will be screened for the deadly virus, following a panicked U-turn by Downing Street yesterday.

After days of dithering, ministers finally announced that passengers landing at Heathrow and Gatwick or arriving by Eurostar from areas hit by the killer bug will face "enhanced screenings".

But just hours earlier, Defence Minister Michael Fallon insisted that the measures were not needed. Yet faced with growing anger at the lack of action when Britons could be at risk, No10 later rushed out plans to screen anyone travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

These passengers will now have to give details of their travel history, the people they have been in contact with and any onward travel plans they might have.

And they may have to undergo a health test carried out by medical staff. Passengers will also be given advice on what to do should they develop symptoms later.

There are more than 40 flights a day to the UK from West Africa, but no direct ones from the countries at the centre of the epidemic, which has killed around 3,400 people so far this year.

No10 said that the new measures were advised by the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies. A spokesman said: "Enhanced screening arrangements at the UK's main ports of entry for people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will offer an additional level of protection to the UK.

ISOLATE

"These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. But, given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases."

The spokesman went on to say that although the risk to the public in Britain was "very low" the Government was drawing up contingency plans for a possible major outbreak. Dame Sally said: "We remain alert and prepared, should an Ebola case be identified here. We have well-tested processes in place."

Pressure mounted on David Cameron to act after the United States said it would be introducing screening at five major airports - New York's JFK International, Newark Liberty in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta.

Passengers there must take temperature tests and answer a health questionnaire. These measures are not mandatory as part of the UK screenings.

On a day of confusion, Mr Fallon said yesterday morning said the UK had "very robust procedures in place" and screening was not necessary. He added: "The World Health Organisation advises that screening is best done when you leave a country... rather than the country you come into."

But by lunchtime, George Osborne signalled there had been a change of heart, saying: "If the medical advice is we need to screen, then we will absolutely take that action. The steps we have taken are designed to protect Britain from this awful disease."

Shortly after 5pm, Downing Street confirmed the U-turn by announcing enhanced screening would be introduced. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, welcomed the rethink. "This is very important," he said. "The Government has shown it has listened to those who felt there needed to be change."

Earlier Mr Vaz had stepped up the call for action, saying the public needed reassurance.

"With the greatest respect to the WHO, a virus does not wait for are viru direct flight," he said. "The public does need to be reassured and convinced we are doing everything we can. Americans are doing it and South Africa is doing it and we need to do these things as well."

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham had also called for passenger screening. He said: "The public and airport staff want to know that the Government is doing everything it can to prevent this terrible disease from reaching the UK.

"Ministers need to look at passenger screening, without delay." But Professor George Griffin, the chairman of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, which advises the Government and Public Health England, warned that testing travellers for signs of fever was likely to prove ineffective.

He said that it would not have detected the first Ebola sufferer to be diagnosed in the United States - Thomas Eric Duncan - who died on Wednesday morning in a Texas hospital.

Prof Griffin added: "Screening just for body temperature is a very ineffectual tool. We know the clinical course of the disease now very well - a maximum incubation period of 21 days - and fever is only part of the clinical syndrome at the end of that period.

"So screening body temperature would have missed the recent case that went into Dallas."

Earlier this week a Spanish nurse became the first person to contract the deadly virus in Europe. Yesterday, Teresa Romero Ramos's condition had deteriorated and she was now being helped with her breathing in hospital.

The two doctors who treated her were also admitted for observation.

It brings the total number of people under quarantine at the hospital in Madrid to six. Elsewhere, officials in France last night sealed off a building near Paris over suspected Ebola cases, but later said the threat had been lifted.

And an Australian nurse recently returned from working with the Red Cross in Sierra Leone was having tests in a hospital in Queensland. Sue Ellen Kovack was reported to have had an increased temperature but was "feeling well", the Red Cross said.

Professor Peter Piot, part of the team that first identified Ebola in 1976, warned: "We'll see other cases in Europe, this is unavoidable. People travel, people get infected, people come back." Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the West had been slow in responding to the crisis in West Africa.

Mr Miliband, who was in Sierra Leone as head of aid organisation International Rescue Committee before heading to Liberia today, called for more help.

He said: "You need the big guns of the international system as well as an enjoined and focused local government if this kind of virulent disease is to be properly attacked."

THE worsening condition of the Spanish nurse is further evidence that Ebola is creeping ever nearer.

The worldwide movement of people means we on these shores are unlikely to remain immune much longer.

So let us see no more of the confusion and squabbling between Cabinet Ministers before a decision was taken to introduce "enhanced screening" at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar terminals for arrivals from affected countries.

David Cameron must get a grip. Because indecision and incompetence in Downing Street, with senior Cabinet Ministers contradicting each other, does not instil confidence.

We have repeatedly argued the best policy is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The NHS is equipped to deal with isolated examples and prevent the spread of the virus if victims are detected.

What it could not cope with is the failure of Ministers to approve measures to protect the British public.

ISLAMIC State may use Ebola as a biological suicide weapon against Britain, experts have warned.

Military analysts fear the terror group could send infected militants to western countries, sparking widespread outbreaks.

Capt Al Shimkus, of the US Naval War College, said: "Individuals exposed to the virus become carriers.

It doesn't take much sophistication to go to the next step and use terrorists as carriers."

Prof Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University's Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, said: "IS fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission. They are sufficiently murderous and well-informed to consider it.

Emergency meeting as fears deadly disease will strike here grow

KILLER VIRUS RISK 'LOW'

IRELAND was put on Ebola alert last night as the Government demanded a briefing on how to deal with a deadly outbreak.

The Emergency Planning Task Force is to report to the Cabinet today as fears intensified that the disease will soon reach Irish soil.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: "Ireland is preparing well for this in the event that a suspected case might come to our country." Ebola concerns grew on Monday when the first case in Europe was confirmed after Spanish nurse Teresa Romero Ramos was diagnosed as having contracted the virus.

Prof Sam McConkey, Head of the Department of International Health and Tropical Medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said: "If we can stop it spreading in West Africa then it isn't going to come to Ireland.

"But unfortunately all of the screening in the world and all of the protectionist measures on our borders will not stop people coming in if there are millions and millions of cases on another continent.

"The world is a very connected place, we're all travelling all the time."

The Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children will also hold a meeting with Health Minister Leo Varadkar and Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan next Thursday on Ebola preparations.

Committee chairman Jerry Buttimer TD said: "It is important that people's fears about a potential outbreak of the virus are allayed and calmed."

The HSE moved to ease concerns by insisting the risk is low but all acute hospitals have been sent directions on what to do should the killer virus reach Ireland.

At the moment there's no Ebola screening at Irish airports and ports but health chiefs are advising anyone returning from West Africa to look out for headaches, temperatures and body aches for three weeks after they come home to Ireland.

Meanwhile, people entering the UK from countries affected by Ebola are to be screened for the deadly virus following a panicked U-turn by Downing Street.

Yesterday Ms Ramos' condition had deteriorated and she was being helped with her breathing.

The two doctors who treated her were also admitted for observation.

It brings the total number of people under quarantine at the hospital in Madrid to six.

And Australian nurse Sue Ellen Kovack, who recently returned from working with the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, was having tests in a hospital in Queensland.

Prof Peter Piot, part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, warned: "We'll see other cases in Europe, this is unavoidable. People travel, people get infected, people come back."

A US health official said the Ebola outbreak, which has so far claimed almost 3,500 victims, was the biggest medical crisis since HIV/Aids.

UK TROOPS TO BATTLE KILLER EPIDEMIC

Britain pledges 750 soldiers to fight Ebola in West Africa

US patient dies as America steps up checks at airports

BRITAIN will aim to stop a "crisis becoming a catastrophe" as it sends troops to tackle the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In the next few days, a medical ship and three Merlin helicopters will join 750 troops in Sierra Leone, where the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: "We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe."

His announcement came after the death early yesterday of Thomas Eric Duncan - the first patient to be diagnosed in America.

US officials responded by stepping up security checks at five airports, while the UK identified four NHS hospitals ready to take in patients should the virus arrive here.

The latest outbreak is the world's deadliest with 3,800 deaths from 8,000 cases. At a press conference with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Washington yesterday, Mr Hammond described the military's role in Sierra Leone.

UK and US troops, including engineers, logistics experts and medical staff, will build and run Ebola medical centres and a health training facility.

It is believed the measures will help the country treat 9,000 patients in the next six months. Casualty-receiving ship RFA Argus, which boasts a 100-bed medical unit, will be sent to capital Freetown. The helicopters will be based off the coast and will transport UK forces.

Mr Hammond described Ebola as "an unprecedented threat that knows no borders" and added: "We have to get ahead of this disease. If we get ahead of it and rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it."

He urged other countries to commit more resources, including medical staff, to lead the effort on the ground. At home, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned it was "entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK by one route or another".

London's Royal Free Hospital, which successfully treated British nurse William Pooley, currently has the UK's only high-level isolation unit.

But health chiefs have now named hospitals in Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield as three others which could treat Ebola patients if it hits the UK.

The Mirror revealed yesterday how Chief Medical Officer Prof Dame Sally Davies has sent a five-page Ebola warning to every doctor, pharmacist and chief nurse in the country.

In the US, Homeland Security chiefs ordered agents at airports and other ports to "observe" arrivals for potential signs of Ebola.

Public Health England insisted there were no plans to bring in extra checks for arrivals here.

But Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called for "screenings at airports, train stations and ferry ports to ensure this deadly disease cannot take more lives".

He added: "We don't want to deal with this after the event just because we have the best health service in the world. We don't want to test it to see if it can cope with Ebola."

The killer bug spreads through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. There is no cure and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate the infected.

Symptoms include fever, bleeding and damage to the central nervous system.

US patient Mr Duncan, 42, who caught the virus in his native Liberia, had been kept in isolation in a Dallas hospital and received experimental drugs.

The courier driver, tested positive in Dallas on September 30, 10 days after arriving on a flight from Monrovia via Brussels.

Ten people he was in contact with were being monitored. But just hours after Mr Duncan's death, a police officer walked into a clinic in Frisco, Texas, and told medics he was feeling ill after being in contact with the victim.

Sgt Michael Monnig was a member of Dallas County Sheriff 's Department, which had gone with health officials to Mr Duncan's flat to get the occupants to sign a court order to prevent them from leaving.

He was checked and taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance.

Later colleague Sgt Chris Dyer played down the threat and said his symptoms were not Ebola-like.

The US has sent 300 troops to Mr Duncan's home country to set up field hospitals.

Another 3,000 will arrive in the next few days to help with logistical support and training for health workers.

Save The Children warned the infection rate was increasing rapidly in neighbouring Sierra Leone, with five new cases an hour. Burial workers there have reportedly gone on strike this week, leaving victims' bodies on the streets. Local media said they were angry over unpaid wages, but Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman insisted yesterday the strike had been "resolved" and staff would return to work.

Downing Street stressed yesterday the threat of Ebola to the UK was "low" but confirmed the British response at home and abroad was discussed at a Cobra meeting led by PM David Cameron.

It also emerged yesterday that infected journalist Ashoka Mukpo, 33, who holds US and British passports, will receive blood from Ebola survivor Kent Brantley.

Ashoka's girlfriend, Helen Finlay, 25, of Fowey, Cornwall, has described the heartache of seeing him suffer.

She said: "When you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them you're going to be OK and be close to them and obviously you can't do that."

Ashoka was diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia and is being treated in Nebraska. It is hoped antibodies from Mr Brantley's blood will beat the virus.

WEST Africa, not Heathrow or Dover , is the frontline in the fight against Ebola.

So sending nurses, medical equipment, troops and helicopters to Sierra Leone is sensible.

Beating the virus at its source is the best way to keep Britain safe - as well as a humanitarian gesture to save the lives of possibly millions of innocent victims of this killer disease.

We can't wrap our country up in cotton wool or try to stop the world and get off. And as one of the globe's wealthiest and most sophisticated nations we have a responsibility to do our bit.

We hope all our men and women return safely from Sierra Leone after playing their part in a battle we must not shirk.

"Given the fact there is now an exposure within the EU and given the rate of free movement and travel in Europe the Government should be forthcoming with information for the public."

THE nurse who is the first to catch Ebola outside West Africa revealed yesterday she found out she had the disease from a newspaper website.

Teresa Romero Ramos was waiting to be quarantined in Madrid when she read on her mobile phone she had tested positive.

She said: "Nobody told me anything. I found out on my mobile. I suspected something because at the hospital they stopped coming in.

"Nobody told me to my face." Earlier Ms Ramos, 44, said she accidentally touched her face with gloves after treating an infected Spanish missionary who later died.

The nurse was part of a 30-strong team at the Carlos III hospital treating the 69-year-old who had been repatriated after catching Ebola in Sierra Leone.

She said she might have become infected when removing protective clothing after cleaning the priest's room. She said: "I think the error was the removal of the suit. I can see the moment it may have happened."

A hospital official spoke to Ms Ramos and said it confirmed the infection "may not have been an error, but rather an accident".

Her husband Javier Limon, also in quarantine with three other people in Madrid, spent yesterday fighting in vain to stop their dog Excalibur being put down because he may be infected. About 300,000 signed an online petition to spare the dog.

KILLER VIRUS 'COULD BE IN UK IN 16 DAYS' Health chiefs insist our »services are ready to cope All medical staff warned » to look for fatal symptoms

THE NHS was last night on high alert as experts warned deadly Ebola could hit the UK in just 16 days.

Doctors, nurses and pharmacists up and down the land were warned to look out for symptoms in patients arriving from West Africa where the disease is raging or who have had contact with anyone recently returned from the region.

The red alert came as Spanish health chiefs launched an investigation into how a nurse there became the first person outside of Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea to catch Ebola, sparking panic across the country.

Scientists predict the virus has a 50% chance of reaching our shores in 16 days - October 24.

Chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies told medical staff: "This is to update you on Ebola in West Africa, and to remind you of the need to remain vigilant for cases imported to the UK.

"It is unlikely but not impossible that people infected in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia could arrive in the UK while incubating the disease and develop symptoms after their return."

In a section entitled Implications for the UK she urged "every clinician in England" to take a full travel history from all patients with a fever.

Prof Davies' five-page warning - issued via the NHS Central Alerting System and seen by the Mirror - came as David Cameron ordered an emergency Cobra meeting on how to deal with the deadly disease here.

Public Health England also announced Ebola medical advice had been sent to immigration centres, universities and schools. The body's director of global health Dr Brian McCloskey insisted "plans were in place" to deal with any outbreak.

He added: "Our robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases are active permanently, and always available and regularly tested and proven to be effective. The overall risk of Ebola to the UK remains low." But Prof Davies warned UK aid workers in West Africa now face a bigger chance of catching the disease which has killed more than 3,400 people in the region and infected around 7,500.

More than 6,000 people a week arrive in Britain on around 40 flights from Nigeria, Ghana and The Gambia which lie near the affected areas and are major transport hubs - raising the odds of the disease being brought here.

But PHE ruled out introducing Ebola screening for passengers - as the US plans to do. It said the World Health Organization does not recommend the move and it would mean screening "huge numbers of low-risk people".

Ebola victims are not infectious until they display symptoms - which include high fever, bleeding and central nervous system damage.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening yesterday said the Government will continue to review tighter travel restrictions.

British Airways has suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Earlier this week scientists calculated the odds of the virus spreading to Europe, based on flight patterns, and said there was a 50-50 chance of it hitting Britain.

Study author Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said: "If this continues to rage on in West Africa and gets worse, then it's only a matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to Europe." Mr Cameron yesterday spoke to Sierra Leone president Ernest Koroma. Downing Street said: "They discussed how the £125million in UK aid was helping efforts. The president said the situation was very serious and they need to train more medical staff and improve the burial process."

A Norwegian aid worker contracted the disease in Sierra Leone and is being treated in Oslo. Around 1,200 Germans are preparing to fly to West Africa along with troops to help with the crisis after answering a call for volunteers.

Fury was last night growing in Spain after nurse Teresa Romero Ramos contracted Ebola. She had treated two Spanish priests who later died of the disease after being flown home from Africa. The EC has asked medical chiefs to explain how she became infected.

Officials were racing to trace up to 30 staff who had been in contact with Teresa and patients they have treated.

Medics claimed protective suits given to them and Teresa were substandard and may not have stopped the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids. Hospital workers held protests over the apparent lack of standards.

The victim was yesterday moved under police escort to Carlos III hospital in Madrid. She was said to be stable.

Her husband Javier Limon Romero and two other people were in quarantine. He claimed health chiefs want to put down their dog Excalibur because of its contact with him and his wife.

Back in Britain, a boy from Sierra Leone has been banned from a school after parents feared their children would be infected by Ebola.

Kofi Mason-Sesay, nine, was due to start St Simon's Catholic primary in Stockport, Gtr Manchester, for an annual placement as his British mum Miriam, 48, carries out charity work in schools.

Health officials insisted he carried no risk. But Miriam said: "There was so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act."

THE case of the Spanish nurse who has the Ebola virus in Madrid shows why we must not be complacent in the UK.

Unless we halt the spread of the killer disease the odds are shortening on it coming here.

So the authorities are right to be on the alert and to take precautions. This is not scare­ mongering. It is sensible advance planning. Doing nothing would be criminal.

If and when a case is diagnosed in the UK we must avoid panic. But the best way of keeping safe is to devote resources to stopping its spread from Africa, where there are fears that as as many as one million victims could die.

British nurse William Pooley, who recovered in an NHS London isolation ward after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone, spoke movingly last week about the need for our country and others to do more. We fully agree. We can't turn our backs and hope Ebola goes away. It won't. It will creep ever nearer.

In the UK we must prepare for the worst and hope for the best. And in West Africa, we must spend what it takes.

MORE than 100 army medics are to be flown to Sierra Leone to run an Ebola treatment centre for infected doctors and nurses.

Troops from 22 Field Hospital are training 13 hours a day in protective suits, with fake casualties in makeup, at Strensall Barracks, York. The drill centre, once used as a replica of Afghanistan's Camp Bastion, has a variable temperature to prepare staff for Africa's heat.

22 Field Hospital, of Aldershot, Hants, deploy this month to man 12 beds where volunteer medics at risk from infected locals can be treated.

On a visit yesterday, Armed Forces minister Mark Francois said: "The critical point is to have a world class medical facility that can give other medical workers comfort that they get the best treatment."

Combat medic Private Kate Owen said: "The conditions are going to be quite arduous, but being in the Army, we are quite used to adapting to our environment."

Commanding officer Lt Col Alison McCourt said: "Our staff will know the dangers, they will have been specifically trained to face those dangers. Other health care workers may not have had that equipment available to them."

Once fully functional, the facility will be run by Save the Children.

A NURSE has become the first person to catch the deadly Ebola virus outside Africa.

The woman, 44, was part of a medical team treating a missionary with the disease at a Madrid hospital after he was flown back to Spain for treatment. He died last month.

Tests on the nurse, who has a high fever, were positive.

A health ministry spokesman said: "I can confirm she has Ebola."

The married woman was part of a team caring for Manuel Garcia Viejo and only entered his room twice - once while he was alive and again after death.

She went on holiday a day later. Her husband is now being tested for the disease. Medical colleagues said measures to protect staff had been "extreme" with workers wearing two protective overalls, two pairs of gloves and glasses.

Save the Children says Ebola is spreading at a "terrifying rate" in West Africa with cases doubling each week. So far 3,400 have died US researchers say there is a 50% chance a traveller with Ebola could land in the UK in the next three weeks.

LIKE most people seemingly chained to their emails these days, the quarantine folder is an area I fear to tread.

Among the dozens of messages offering better car insurance, help with PPI and cheap Viagra, I live in constant worry that the one I do open will lead to technology's answer to Ebola being unleashed on my computer.

But this week curiosity got the better of me.

Whether it was my renewed drive to get fit or the fear someone had seen me at my last meal, the words "Put the chicken wings down" were just too much to resist.

But on opening the email I found it wasn't some marketing ploy trying to make me switch to hamburgers but in fact part of a recruitment drive by Islamic State.

The link the sender provided led to a web page that then showed a detailed Q&A in which the respondent said he was "just like" me.

He revealed such things that his favourite pudding is hot apple pie with ice cream while he maintains his beard using shampoo.

The picture he painted of his life in war-torn Syria or Iraq was a far cry from the image most of us hold of the bloodthirsty jihadists.

The page on Ask.fm, a social networking website through which people can ask questions anonymously, also had an accompanying photo which concealed his identity.

Other questions he answered included where was he from to which he responded the United Kingdom before he then encouraged others to make "hijrah", or migrate, to Syria.

His is only one of hundreds across all various forms of pro-ISIS social media, such as "put the chicken wings down n come to Jihad bro", on Twitter which have been cleverly designed to entice the vulnerable.

The ISIS Q&A and the horrific but professionally produced videos of their beheadings all form part of a strategy never seen before in the fight against terrorism.

Through careful propaganda and a vibrant social media presence, the group are actively encouraging young people around the world to join their cause. And it seems with much success.

Already thousands of disillusioned young men and women have felt compelled to turn their backs on their country to fight against the very democracies that raised them.

The fact so many of these defectors have been radicalised without yet committing crimes and often over the internet is extremely troublesome.

But the overriding question for all countries is how do we prevent violent ideologies from taking hold of people in the first place? Why is it so many young Muslims go off to become jihadists? But because there is no easy explanation it mustn't stop us trying to answer the question and prevent them going to the Middle East to kill and be killed.

There is no question those well educated Islamic State propagandists have the ability to muster a seductive appeal for the gullible in search of excitement or recruits brainwashed on the internet who wrongly believe they're joining a great cause.

Families, neighbourhoods, schools, mosques, police and local councils all have roles to play by explaining and educating vulnerable Muslims from being lured to join the bloody war.

All the military hardware, the billions spent on bombs, will only go so far.

It is the voice in our communities, at grass roots, that will only really stop more parents, brothers and sisters mourning the loss of loved ones.

The military hardware, the bombs, will only go so far
