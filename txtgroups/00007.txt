There seems to be a bit of confusion about where everybody stands on this whole “politics” thing.

Tony Abbott is copping it for not being tough enough — and being too tough. The Greens are opposing a tax on petrol and the Palmer United Party is … the Palmer United Party.

Yet again it is left to me to set the world right and so, in yet another extraordinary exclusive, I have developed a brand new test so people can figure out what political party they belong to once and for all. The results, as usual, will shock and amaze …

THE World Health Organisation has declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in Senegal and commended the country for its diligence.

THE World Health Organisation says it commends the country for its diligence in putting a stop to the transmission of the virus.

In a statement on Friday the WHO said the sole introduced case was confirmed on August 29 in a young man who had travelled to Dakar, by road, from Guinea, where he had had direct contact with an Ebola patient.

The statement called Senegal's response "a good example of what to do when faced with an imported case of Ebola."

It said Senegal government's response included identifying and monitoring 74 close contacts of the patient, prompt testing of all suspected cases, stepped-up surveillance at many entry points and public awareness campaigns.

PM praises volunteer efforts, Dutton says government focusing on threat of regional outbreaks.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has praised the efforts of volunteers tackling Ebola overseas, but has defended the government's delay in sending soldiers and government doctors and nurses.

The comments came as chief medical officers met to ensure Australia's preparedness for a potential Ebola case.

As the UN and US President Barack Obama sought to build an international coalition to fight Ebola, Australian diplomats have been unable to secure the agreement of another country to evacuate and treat military or health personnel sent into west Africa who may contract the virus.

The 20 to 30 Australian volunteers working with non-government agencies have their own arrangements.

The US military is building up to a force of 3200 troops in Liberia and Senegal.

Former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan says wealthy countries should be doing a lot more.

"I am bitterly disappointed by the response ... I am disappointed in the international community for not moving faster," Mr Annan told the BBC.

"I point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity."

Labor and medical associations say a greater Australian effort is needed, but Mr Abbott insists it is too hazardous without the evacuation plan.

"There's a world of difference between volunteers going and displaying selfless humanitarianism, which I praise, and the government ordering Australian defence personnel to go to an area where we don't have the capacity to evacuate people," Mr Abbott said.

The Australian Medical Association has been critical of hospital preparations within Australia.

But Health Minister Peter Dutton, who met medical chiefs on Friday, said the comments were misguided.

"We are as prepared as any developed nation to deal with this virus and the risk to our country is very, very low," Mr Dutton said.

A strategy is in place to deal with any outbreaks in the region, which is where Australia is concentrating its efforts.

"They have the ability to respond rapidly out of Darwin. We have the expertise within our medical workforce here," Mr Dutton said.

One of the regional countries of concern is Papua New Guinea.

Queensland Health Minister Lawrence Springborg says the area between PNG and his state had long been a health concern.

"The porous border concerns me in general. I wouldn't even want to speculate what would happen if Ebola actually turned up in PNG," Mr Springborg said.

Queensland is ordering extra equipment in the event of Ebola reaching the state and infected patients having to be moved.

Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie said governments had been "untrustworthy and dysfunctional" in their handling of the Ebola outbreak.

She wants a ban on travel to and from west Africa, stronger checks at airports, specialist Ebola quarantine facilities at international airports and the creation of MASH-style mobile health teams within the Australian Defence Force.

Mr Abbott said the Ebola outbreak was too serious to become a party political football.

Australia's chief medical officer Chris Baggoley said after meeting his state and territory counterparts on Friday that he was impressed by the readiness of hospitals.

Prof Baggoley said the risk of an outbreak remained unchanged at "very low", but procedures would be constantly reviewed.

So far about 700 people have been identified at airports as having travelled from west Africa, with 11 tested for the virus but all were found to be negative.

Spain checks six more patients for Ebola

SPANISH authorities are monitoring six more patients over fears they may have contracted Ebola as a nurse shows signs of getting better.

AMONG the new suspect cases was a Spanish missionary recently returned from one of the countries worst hit by the outbreak, Liberia, who has shown signs of fever, the government said on Thursday.

He was due to be hospitalised at the specialist disease unit in Madrid's Carlos III hospital, the government's emergency committee on the Ebola outbreak said in a statement.

Two other people were also admitted to that hospital on Thursday, it added: a person who came close to the infected nurse, and a traveller who arrived in Madrid on an Air France flight from Paris.

Separately, on Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, a Red Cross worker who had travelled from another affected country, Sierra Leone, was hospitalised, the organisation said.

Health officials in Tenerife said they had hospitalised the man in isolation when he complained of a fever on Thursday after arriving on the island on October 12 from Sierra Leone via Brussels and Madrid.

The man underwent tests which have been sent to Madrid for analysis. He had not shown symptoms before Thursday 16.

They also put in isolation in hospital as a precaution two people who live with that man but who are not displaying any Ebola-like symptoms, said a Canary Islands health official who asked not to be named.

The missionary is a member of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Roman Catholic group that runs a charity working with Ebola victims in west Africa, the government said in a statement.

Two elderly Spanish missionaries from the same order were diagnosed with Ebola in west Africa in August and September and flown home to Spain for treatment, but they both died shortly afterwards.

Teresa Romero, a 44-year-old Spanish nurse at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital where they were cared for, was on October 6 herself diagnosed with Ebola, the first person known to have become infected with the virus outside Africa.

She remains in stable condition at Carlos III, the government's health emergencies coordinator, Fernando Simon, told a news conference earlier on Thursday.

The level of Ebola virus in her body is declining, he added.

"She talks slowly but is perfectly lucid," said a hospital source.

The person who came in contact with Romero and was hospitalised on Thursday is among 68 people considered as having had "low-risk contact" with the infected nurse. They have been monitored at home since Romero was diagnosed with Ebola on October 6.

The unidentified "contact" developed a fever on Thursday morning, Simon said. The person was transferred to Carlos III and the result of the Ebola test was due later, he said.

A passenger who arrived in Madrid from Nigeria via Paris on an Air France flight who had started shaking during the flight was also taken to the hospital, the airline and Spanish airports operator Aena said.

QUEENSLAND Health wants health workers returning from Ebola affected areas to quarantine themselves for 21 days.

CHIEF Health Officer Jeannette Young has outlined Queensland's plans to prepare for any cases of the virus in the state.

She's urging people to avoid visiting Ebola-affected areas unless it's essential humanitarian work.

"There are some people going there for fantastic humanitarian reasons and we support them," Dr Young told reporters.

"But anyone who can delay their travel really shouldn't be travelling."

Dr Young said it was important people going contact Queensland Health beforehand so they understood the risks and what would happen when they returned.

She said as a general rule health workers would be asked to voluntarily quarantine themselves in their homes for 21 days.

Government-owned housing in Brisbane was also available for them to do so.

The state's top medical experts and four key Ebola treatment hospitals were also on standby.

An isolation pod ordered from Western Australia has arrived in the state and another three, worth $70,000, were expected to arrive within the next three weeks.

A 24-hour hotline has been set up for anyone believing they could have Ebola symptoms and any members of the public with questions about Ebola can also call the 13HEALTH (13 43 25 84) hotline.

But Dr Young said there was still no therapeutic treatment or cure available for Ebola patients, only supportive medical care.

"We know from the advice of the World Health Organisation that good supportive care do go a long way to assisting people to combat the disease," she added.

"Just making sure that all the very basic things are maintained."

AUSTRALIAN health officials are today reviewing national guidelines for managing ebola as the UN warns the world has just 60 days to control the epidemic.

The review follows the US Centres for Disease Control’s announcement that it was revising its protocols — on which Australia’s protocols are based — after two US nurses were infected.

Meanwhile, the Queensland government has decided that all health workers returning from working on ebola in West Africa must remain in Brisbane, close to testing facilities, while they wait out their 21-day quarantine period.Fears that ebola could spread come after the United Nations warned the world it has just 60 days to get ebola under control, or face an “unprecedented situation for which we don’t have a plan”.

30 hours of agony in the air

AUSTRALIANS deployed to West Africa’s ebola epicentre who become diagnosed with the deadly virus would likely die on the painful 30-hour evacuation flight back to Australia because our allies cannot guarantee use of their treatment facilities.

Despite the deadly risk, the opposition has written to the government demanding Australia send personnel to tackle the ebola crisis, which has now killed 4484 in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek, who twice this year mistook Africa for a country rather than a continent, has been briefed by department heads on the lack of evacuation options, but is still persisting with calls to send personnel to West Africa.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott yesterday confirmed he would not consider sending personnel to the disease-plagued region until there was a “politically bankable” guarantee Australians could be flown to closer countries or use on-theground treatment facilities provided by our allies.

Returning ebola-infected personnel — who could be bleeding through the skin and uncontrollably excreting bodily fluids — back to Australia would involve 30 hours “in the air”, not including stopovers. Up to six medical crews would be required to alternate shifts on such flights because Hazmat suits get too hot to stay in for long periods of time.

Mr Abbott said he would take no risks until Australia had a promise of closer treatment options: “I think it would be a little irresponsible of an Australian government to order Australian personnel into this very dangerous situation if we didn’t have effective risk-mitigation strategies in place and at the moment there is no way of doing that.’’ Japan and Korea have taken the same view as Mr Abbott.Ms Plibersek and opposition health spokeswoman Catherine King wrote to foreign minister Julie Bishop and health minister Peter Dutton demanding Australia do more to fight the crisis.

THE horrifying prospect of a global ebola outbreak became frighteningly real yesterday as US authorities scrambled desperately to track down 132 people who were exposed to the deadly virus while on a flight with an American nurse who has been hospitalised with the disease.

The US government was forced to ramp up its response to the nightmare scenario that the disease, which has killed nearly 4500 in West Africa, could now be spreading on American soil.

Amber Jay Vinson (pictured right), the second nurse infected while caring for the virus’s first US victim, was cleared by the US Centres for Disease Control to board a commercial flight from Ohio to Dallas with a mild fever before she was diagnosed with ebola.

Australian health authorities will now review the national guidelines for managing ebola, which are largely modelled on those of the US CDC.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott yesterday again ruled out sending Australians to fight West Africa’s ebola outbreak ­because, if infected, they would likely die on the 30-hour evacuation flight back to Australia.î full reports pages 4-5

The 21-day isolation period of aid workers returning from ebola-stricken regions is not regulated by the government to ensure they comply with all restrictions. Australia also has a lack of portable isolation units, which would be needed to transport ebola patients from regional areas.Associate Professor Brian Owler said: “I think it is timely that we review our preparedness. I am surprised the government ... has not convened a meeting of experts to look at this.’’

US factory output rises 0.5% in September

GAINS for aerospace products, furniture, clothing and plastics have helped US manufacturing output to rise in September.

THE Federal Reserve said on Thursday that factory production rose 0.5 per cent in September after falling 0.5 per cent in August. Over the past 12 months, manufacturing output has increased 3.7 per cent.

The continued pace of manufacturing output will likely be a bellwether for the broader economy.

Job growth has been solid for much of 2014, yet the stock market has been hammered over the past week over concerns about Europe's financial footing, the slowdown in China's economy and Ebola outbreaks across three continents.

Stalled growth - if not the risk of recession - in much of Europe could cut into demand for US exports.

Total industrial production surged 1 per cent last month, as output from mines and utilities both increased.

Despite the gains, autos appear to have downshifted after driving much of the output growth of the past year.

Factory production of motor vehicles and parts slid 1.4 per cent in September, the second straight monthly decline after tumbling 7 per cent in August.

Most economists expected a decline after auto production soared in July, largely because there were fewer plant shutdowns in July made output look stronger after the government adjusted the figure for normal seasonal variations

That decline was more than offset by improvements in other sectors. Furniture output rose 2.4 per cent in September, while aerospace products climbed 1.7 per cent. Clothing increased 1.5 per cent, as plastics, rubber, chemicals and computer production also improved.

STOCK markets in Europe fell by 3.0 per cent or more, and were down across the world including in the Middle East, hit by falling oil prices.

A NEW lifeline for Greek banks and a weak Spanish bond auction spotlighted deep problems in the eurozone, widely seen as the main drag on recovery of the global economy.

Stock markets in Europe fell by 3.0 per cent or more, and were down across the world including in the Middle East, hit by falling oil prices.

The cost of borrowing for weak eurozone countries surged.

Spain failing to achieve its maximum target in a bond sale and paying higher rates, signalling an end to the benign climate that has helped the eurozone recover from years of crisis.

"Any hopes that we would see a period of consolidation after yesterday's (stocks) sell off appear to have been firmly dashed with traders reaching for the sell button yet again," said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.

The European Central Bank and EU rushed to promise Greece extra help for its banks, after Greek shares plunged two days running on worries that the country could sink without help once it leaves its debt-rescue program.

Madrid's benchmark IBEX 35 index dived 4.28 per cent to 9,422.30 points after the Spanish government revealed that it fell short of target in the auction of long-term debt.

The Paris, Milan, Lisbon and Amsterdam exchanges each fell by more than 3.0 per cent at one point, while Frankfurt and London both shed more than 2.0 per cent compared with Wednesday's closing levels.

Sentiment was also rocked this week by investor concerns over the Ebola epidemic, while tumbling oil prices have weighed on the energy sector.

"This definitely contains a hint of panicking; the global economic situation simply does not warrant this much of a sell off," said Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria.

"Add a potentially disastrous virus into the mix and the result is what we have here - pandemonium in the market place."

Eurozone exports fell for the third month running in August, dropping 0.9 per cent in the latest sign of economic weakness, official data showed.

Inflation in the eurozone had dipped to 0.3 per cent in September, the lowest level since financial debt crisis in 2009, separate figures confirmed.

Exports from the eurozone dipped by 0.9 per cent in August compared with July to 140.5 billion euros ($A210.7 billion). They had already fallen by 0.3 per cent the previous month.

"This was a third successive fall in exports, which fuels concern that stuttering global growth is limiting demand for eurozone goods," noted IHS economist Howard Archer.

Low inflation has meanwhile become a central problem for the eurozone economy, with sluggish demand from households and businesses slowing price rises and stoking deflation worries.

World markets had also plunged on Wednesday as new US data underscored the fragile state of the global economy.

The US Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell in September for the first time in seven months, dropping by 0.3 per cent.

In London, shares in Shire Pharmaceuticals plunged by another nine per cent after US drugs giant AbbVie announced that its board would no longer recommend a $US54-billion ($A58-billion) takeover.

In foreign exchange deals, the European single currency nudged lower to $US1.2804, from $US1.2834 late in New York on Wednesday. The ruble fell to another record low against the euro.

Bond yields for eurozone periphery countries shot up in the secondary markets following the Spanish auction.

The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds jumped to 2.356 per cent from 2.116 per cent on Wednesday.

Portugal rose from 3.585 per cent from 3.286 per cent, while Italy climbed to 2.665 per cent from 2.422 per cent.

Yields on 10-year bonds from Greece, which has been considering ending its bailout program early, jumped to 8.656 per cent from 7.854 per cent.

THE federal opposition says Australia isn't doing enough to tackle Ebola, but the government says it has the right focus.

THE federal opposition says the $18 million provided by the coalition government to tackle the virus, which is killing thousands of people in west Africa, is not enough.

Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek believes Australia should be sending in health workers and other experts to help fight Ebola, which presents a threat to health and international security.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the aid spending, which came on top of $40 million for the World Health Organisation, was a creditable effort so far.

Mr Abbott thinks it is irresponsible to send in Australian personnel without an agreement to fly them out immediately and get them quickly to a high-quality hospital if they contracted the virus.

Senior diplomats have been in talks with the US, UK and European countries in a bid to strike a deal guaranteeing evacuation and treatment.

The other governments have been saying their priority is dealing with their own nationals who need treatment.

The 30-hour flight to Australia is long enough for someone with Ebola symptoms to die.

"We are quite rightly and understandably focused on being prepared here at home and in our region," Mr Abbott said.

More than 700 people have arrived at Australian airports from west African countries since the outbreak.

The 11 arrivals suspected of Ebola have all tested negative.

Most of the estimated 4500 Ebola cases worldwide have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and US have also recorded cases.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said airport checks were working well but if medical advisers suggested any improvements they would be swiftly put in place.

He said Labor's criticisms of the government's efforts were naive.

"The government is focusing on what we are doing to protect the Australian community and also acting in concert with regional partners to ensure that we can respond to any regional escalation of this threat," he said.

The UN this week warned the world has less than 60 days to stem the epidemic, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts up to 1.4 million people could be infected by January.

Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler said the government funds were inadequate, especially when compared with the spending on tackling terrorism.

"I think we need to be thinking about this type of problem, not just as a local health problem of west Africa, but an international global emergency," he said.

Between 20 and 30 Australians are working with non-government organisations in west Africa to combat the virus.

The charities have their own evacuation and treatment plans.

A PETITION calling for the federal government to deploy military aid and logistical support to west Africa has gathered more than 37,000 signatures.

PERTH woman Ali Readhead, who organised the online petition, has been working with the Health Ministry in Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst hit by the deadly virus.

Ms Readhead says she fears the response from governments has already been "too little, too late".

While the US and United Kingdom, and even Cuba, have sent health and military personnel in their collective thousands, Australia has only offered financial support of $18 million to help combat an outbreak that has so far killed almost 4500 people.

"Unfortunately, Australia isn't one of these countries," Ms Readhead said from London.

"Despite having been told repeatedly that 'boots on the ground' are what is required to control the outbreak, more so than financial resources, the Australian government continues to refuse to send in military support."

Ms Readhead said funding and supplies were not reaching the affected countries fast enough.

"What we need is international health workers on the ground now."

The petition, addressed to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, calls on the government to deploy military aid, including engineers, logisticians and medics to Sierra Leone.

It emerged last month that Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma had written directly to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, making a desperate plea for Australia to scale up its response to the Ebola crisis.

In the letter, Mr Koroma says his country is counting on Australia and specifically requests military aid.

The prime minister's office has refused to confirm whether it has responded to Mr Koroma's plea for help.

The federal government says it has not yet been able to secure a commitment from other countries to treat Australian health workers should they become infected.

Mr Abbott on Thursday repeated his position that it would be irresponsible of an Australian government to order Australian personnel into a dangerous situation without having an effective risk mitigation strategy in place.

"At the moment there is no way of doing that," he said in Melbourne.

Fears protective gear failing

A SECOND worker at the US hospital where the country’s first diagnosed ebola patient was cared for has tested positive for the deadly disease.

Health authorities last night confirmed the second ebola case traced back to now dead patient Thomas Eric Duncan at the Dallas hospital as Australian infectious disease experts questioned the adequacy of protection equipment being used by healthcare workers treating victims of the virus.

The health worker reported a fever on Tuesday and was immediately isolated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The Texas Department of State Health Services said a preliminary ebola test was conducted at a state public health laboratory in Austin.

Officials have said they don’t know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected after treating Duncan.

But the second case pointed to lapses beyond how one individual may have used personal protective garb.

The World Health Organisation said more than 416 healthcare workers in West Africa’s disease zones have so far been infected — and more than 233 have died.

Raina MacIntyre, Professor of ­Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology at the University of NSW, said the rate of infection among health workers ­raised serious questions about the ­adequacy of control procedures.

She argued that, at the very, least ­P2/N95 respirator masks should be used instead of surgical masks.

The US National Nurses United, has demanded nurses dealing with ebola be issued with hazmat suits.

Health experts and governments are insisting ebola can only be transmitted by contact with bodily fluids.The president of Australia’s College for Infection and Prevention Control, Belinda Henderson, and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation have rejected the need for hazmat suits, claiming the difficulty of removing the suits could help the disease spread.

Masks may be the problem

INFECTIOUS disease experts are questioning the adequacy of protection equipment being used by health care workers treating ebola victims as more of them succumb to infection.

The World Health Organisation said more than 416 health care workers have so far been infected and more than 233 have died.

Even nurses from Spain and the US following strict infection control procedures have caught the deadly virus.

Raina MacIntyre, Professor of ­Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology at the University of NSW, said this ­raises serious questions about the ­adequacy of control procedures.

“In West Africa, health workers are dying faster than their patients, illustrating the tragic price they pay for doing their jobs,” she said.

She argued that at the very least ­P2/N95 respirator masks should be used instead of surgical masks. The largest nurses professional association in the US, the National Nurses United, has demanding nurses be issued with hazmat suits. Public health experts and governments are insisting ebola can only be transmitted by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

But Professor MacIntyre said there was uncertainty about how you catch ebola, with studies showing pigs, primates and some humans have caught the disease without direct contact.

“There is plenty of uncertainty about transmission,” she said. The president of Australia’s College for Infection and Prevention Control, Belinda Henderson, and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation have rejected the need for hazmat suits.They claim the all-in-one suits could help the disease spread because they are difficult to remove. “Hazmat suits are like a big plastic overall with a breathing unit built in, they are quite sweaty and bulky,” she said.

A NEWCASTLE aid worker who ­returned from watching 50 people a day die from ebola in Liberia says she would happily go back to the disease-plagued country.

For five weeks Libby Bowell educated locals and helped the Red Cross aid the thousands with ebola before she came home on Tuesday.

She would take her temperature six times a day and wash her hands in buckets of chlorine up to 20 times a day. There were no hugs or kisses when she landed back in Australia. Instead — isolation.

Ms Bowell watched people die in front of hospitals and had Liberian friends who lost more than a dozen of their closest friends.

“On average between 30 and 50 a day die and on average 50 to 70 or 80 get sick, you see people drop in the front of hospitals,’’ she said.

“You are lying if (catching ebola) is not in the back of your mind.’’ Ms Bowell had a message for anyone worried about aid workers spreading ebola in Australia: “If I had any symptom there would be no way I would be around anyone, I would never put anyone at risk.

“I have to check my temperature twice a day and have to report to the public health unit in Newcastle every day for 21 days.”Ms Bowell said she would rest for three weeks but would like to go back if the opportunity arose: “I would happily go back.’’

BIOTECH company CSL is in talks with the World Health Organisation about obtaining antibodies connected to the Ebola virus.

CSL says it is in talks with the World Health Organisation about the possibility of purifying antibodies collected from people who have survived the Ebola virus after becoming infected with it.

CSL chairman Professor John Shine told shareholders at its annual general meeting on Wednesday that CSL was not directly involved in developing a vaccine for the Ebola virus, which would take a long time.

"But in the meantime we are in dialogue and discussion and interaction with the World Health Organisation because it has become apparent that those patients who do recover from Ebola have antibodies in their blood against the virus," Professor Shine said.

"So it should be theoretically possible to purify those antibodies and use that as therapy to treat patients that are infected."

Prof Shine said CSL was one of the leading companies around the world with the capability to purify antibodies.

"So we're discussing with the World Health Organisation whether we could in some way help and participate," he said.

He said there were enormous logistical challenges in collecting plasma from people in West Africa who had been infected with the Ebola virus.

Meanwhile, CSL has announced a share buyback of up to $950 million.

Professor Shine said the board was pleased to continue a buyback program that had delivered benefits for shareholders.

"Buybacks remain an effective way to manage our capital that delivers improved investment returns for shareholders," Professor Shine said.

The announced buyback will be CSL's seventh in eight years.

The company has returned approximately 22 per cent of its shares to shareholders since 2005.

Professor Shine said that the previous six buybacks, totalling some $3.3 billion, had helped boost earnings per share by more than 15 per cent.

He said earnings per share growth in the 2014/15 year would again exceed profit growth expectations as shareholders benefit from the ongoing effect of past and current share buybacks.

At Tuesday's closing price of $72.50, a $950 million buyback represents approximately 13.1 million CSL shares or around three per cent of its issued share capital.

At 1410 AEDT on Wednesday, the company's shares were up 49 cents, or 0.68 per cent, at $72.98.

TWO far north Queensland doctors, suspended after speaking out about the handling of Australia's latest Ebola scare, admit they were unwise to do so.

THE unnamed doctors have been stood aside on full pay after they raised concerns about the case of Sue Ellen Kovack, a Cairns nurse who recently returned from Ebola-affected Sierra Leone on a Red Cross deployment.

Two rounds of testing have cleared Ms Kovack of Ebola after she developed a low-grade fever days after travelling home last week.

The local Senior Medical Staff Association unanimously passed a resolution on Tuesday night saying the two doctors admit their comments were unwise.

"The two senior clinicians involved were commenting on a rapidly evolving situation and with the benefit of hindsight have acknowledged that this was unwise," the SMSA said in a statement.

The organisation has called for the Cairns Hospital and Health Service to deal locally with the two doctors' possible breach of the Code of Conduct.

The SMSA has also agreed to create a process to responsibly release statements in future.

Queensland's Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said details of cases must be presented in an accurate, timely and authoritative manner and welcomed the SMSA resolution.

Meanwhile a separate, independent panel would review the handling of the Ebola case, with terms of reference outlined by the department's Chief Operations Officer Dr Michael Cleary.

It will involve infectious disease and clinical governance experts.

THE son of a Sydney radio legend is leading the World Health Organisation’s battle against ebola.

Dr Richard Brennan, AO, is director of WHO’s Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response unit, a post that puts him at the forefront of the crisis.

The University of Sydney medical graduate, who had to sit his first year of medicine twice after bolstering his poor science subjects at night school at North Sydney Tech, is based in Geneva where he is co-ordin-ating the agencies working on the ground to contain and find a cure for ebola. He is the son of 62-year radio industry veteran John Brennan, the man des-cribed as the ­father of Australian talkback radio.

Yesterday at the launch of his long-awaited biography, Brenno: The Life and Times of a Media Godfather, Brennan spoke humbly about his Harvard-educated son who is now working 17-hour days with “great unswerving faith and hope” that a solution will be found.

“His philosophy is that with great faith and hope you can make progress — he has great faith in God and hope for the world,” Brennan, 83, said.“He was in Liberia rec-ently when the outbreak happened ... and now he’s gone back to Geneva to run the whole epidemic crisis.”

AUSTRALIA has the capability to assist Canada and the US in developing a vaccine that finally looks set to combat the lethal ebola virus that is predicted to infect another 10,000 people by next month.

Canadian authorities yesterday announced human testing had begun on a vaccine that has had a 100 per cent success rate on animals.

About 20 vials of the drug, developed by Canada’s Public Health Agency, have been sent to the US to be tested on 40 people in a rollout being made at “unprecedented speed.’’ If successful, it could be trialled on health workers in West Africa by year’s end.

Australia’s National High Security Quarantine Laboratory run by the Victorian ­Infectious Diseases Laboratory and the CSIRO’s Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong could both facilitate advances in the drug. The Geelong facility is studying the virus.

Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose said the vaccine provided the great hope to stall the ebola outbreak.

“The Canadian vaccine provides great hope and promise because it has shown to be 100 per cent effective in preventing the spread of the ebola virus when tested on ­animals,” she said. “Studies in primates have shown this vaccine works both to prevent ­infection when given before exposure, and to increase survival chances when given quickly after exposure.” A second vaccine produced by US giant GlaxoSmithKline is also testing in Africa, but is believed to be less effective.

Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne, lecturer in Communicable Diseases at the University of Sydney said Australian ­involvement would be down the track.

“Australia does have the capability to assist in such trials,’’ he said. “However, the next step will be on the ground trials in West Africa and currently there are few healthcare workers or scientists from Australia out in this area.’’ He said Australia was still relatively safe from ebola.Canada’s chief doctor, ­Gregory Taylor, said Africa would be the next stop for the vaccine.

WHO: Ebola death rate rises to 70 per cent

THE estimated Ebola death rate has been lifted to 70 per cent, and world health authorities are calling for a stronger response to the outbreak.

WHO assistant director-general Dr Bruce Aylward gave the grim figures during a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.

Previously, WHO had estimated the death rate at about 50 per cent.

Aylward said the 70 per cent death rate was "a high mortality disease" in any circumstance and that the UN health agency was still focused on trying to get sick people isolated and provide treatment as early as possible.

He told reporters that if the world's response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, "a lot more people will die" and there will be a huge need to deal with the spiralling numbers of cases.

For the last four weeks, there have been about 1000 new cases per week - including suspected, confirmed and probable cases, he said, adding that the UN health agency is aiming to get 70 per cent of cases isolated within two months to reverse the outbreak.

WHO increased its Ebola death toll tally to 4447 people on Tuesday, nearly all of them in west Africa, from 8914 cases.

Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia have been hardest hit nations in the current outbreak.

Aylward said the agency was still focused on trying to treat Ebola patients, despite the huge demands on the broken health systems in west Africa.

"It would be horrifically unethical to say that we're just going to isolate people," he said, noting that new strategies such as handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics - without much treatment - was a priority.

TWO far north Queensland doctors who spoke out about the handling of Australia's latest Ebola scare will remain suspended pending a review.

THE pair were stood down on full pay after they raised concerns about the case of Red Cross aid worker Sue Ellen Kovack, a Cairns nurse who recently returned from Ebola-affected Sierra Leone.

Two rounds of testing have cleared Ms Kovack of Ebola after she developed a low-grade fever days after returning home last week.

The unnamed doctors spoke to the media about concerns that Ms Kovack had been tested in a section of the Cairns Hospital emergency department rather than in isolation.

The Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation has called for their immediate reinstatement.

One was speaking on behalf of the Medical Staff Association, federation president Dr Tony Sara said.

"It is very appropriate that he raises issues of concern where he believes that they have not necessarily been properly addressed or dealt with by management," Dr Sara told ABC radio.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg has backed the hospital's decision to suspend the doctors.

"This nurse was treated appropriately in an isolated environment in an isolated room in the emergency department," he told ABC radio.

"There was certainly misleading information on the weekend and we need to understand why that information was misleading."

But Premier Campbell Newman says the hospital needs to be more transparent.

"Given that this is a public organisation and public funds are involved, I think it would be good if they were a bit more forthcoming about their decisions and I think they need to be a bit more open about why they've made this call."

The hospital stood by its decision on Tuesday, citing "the unauthorised release of patient information to the media."

The incident could undermine public confidence in the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service, chairman Bob Norman said.

"At a time of heightened worldwide concern about infectious disease, it was critical that clinical information was released in an accurate and timely manner," he said in a statement.

Mr Norman said there were internal processes available to doctors to raise any concerns about clinical procedures within the hospital.

An independent panel will review the handling of the case, with terms of reference outlined by the department's chief operations officer Dr Michael Cleary.

It will involve infectious disease and clinical governance experts.

THERE are no plans to appoint an official regulator to monitor the self-imposed 21-day isolation ­period for people returning from ebola-stricken West ­Africa, where thousands have died from the disease.

The government said last night that its advice was not to ­appoint a regulator to ensure high-risk returns from the continent did not mix with the Australian public until after the incubation ­period had passed.

The revelations came despite a respected health academic’s ­warnings against underestimating the seriousness of the outbreak, saying it could even be transmitted through the air.

Professor Raina MacIntyre, the head of the School of Public Health at UNSW, ­yesterday cited a study into a 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo showing that the deadly ­disease could be transferred in the air rather than just from bodily fluids.

Prof MacIntyre said authorities in Africa needed to take stronger ­precautions for ­nurses working with ebola and stop “ignoring” evidence.

“There is a lot of uncertainty around the transmission of ebola … the evidence is there that it can spread through other means,’’ she said. “There is a study that shows during one outbreak in the DRC at least five people got infected without any ­contact with the patient.” According to the Centres for ­Disease Control and ­Prevention, the Kikwit outbreak in 1995 was traced to a ­forest worker and infected 315 people, 250 of whom died.

“We have never dealt with a ­disease like this in ­Australia. It is ­important to think about the ­seriousness of the infection,” Prof ­MacIntyre said.

Eleven people have been tested for ebola in Australia, with no ­positive results yet. That number included Cairns nurse Sue Ellen Kovack, who was released from hospital yesterday after twice testing negative.

The Australian Government screens all arrivals from Africa and has an agreement with aid organisations that their returning workers quarantine themselves for 21 days and that they present themselves to hospital should any symptoms arise.

“The federal Department of Health is informed a week in ­advance by the aid agencies that there is a health care worker ­returning, in which case they are ­assessed by quarantine officers,’’ a government spokesman said.

Also yesterday, two senior doctors were stood down for the duration of an investigation into the handling of an ebola scare in Cairns.î EDITORIAL PAGE 24

A “BREACH of protocol” at a Texan hospital led to the first transmission of the lethal ebola virus on US soil and has put another 48 health workers at risk of contracting the disease.

A nurse, who treated ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, tested positive to the virus despite wearing a gown, gloves, mask and face shield while working at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Duncan, who returned from Liberia on September 20, died from the disease last Thursday. The woman’s Dallas apartment is in lockdown and only authorities wearing hazmat suits are allowed to enter.

Pressure is mounting on President Barack Obama who has been criticised for being too lax on the ebola risk in the US. Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed there had been a breakdown in protocolThe nurse reported a low-grade fever before she drove herself to the ER of the Texas Presbyterian Hospital where she worked. She remains in an isolation ward.

IT HASN’T been the best of weeks for Iggy Azalea.

First an ex-lover claimed they were ­married, then the 24-year-old Australian was caught on video telling a paparazzo she hoped he had ebola, before US rapper Snoop Dogg took a swipe at her on social media.

The Fancy singer, who dates NBA star Nick Young, used ­social media to defend herself.

On Twitter, Azalea denied reports her former boyfriend and manager, Hefe Wine, was divorcing her.

“I think we already know, but just to clarify. I’m NOT married. Feel free to check the PUBLIC marriage records,” Azalea tweeted. “Gotta laugh tho, now do you see the kind of craziness I deal with?!” Website TMZ reported Wine was requesting a divorce from Azalea, saying they “agreed to be married” after living together in Texas in September 2008, where state law says a couple can be considered legally married if they live together and agree to wed.

She also spoke to TMZ, adding: “That’s like somebody I dated for about six months when I was 17, I haven’t heard from this person in years.” Azalea, who originally hails from Mullumbimby, in northern NSW, then used her Instagram account to dispute her run-in with a photographer where she was filmed saying: “I hope you have ebola. I hope you die.” She then appears to shove a shopping cart at the man.

Defending her actions, she wrote: “I don’t hate paps, just the really aggressive ones ... I only treated him the way he treated me all day. Fair is fair playboys and girls.”Then Snoop Dogg posted a memo about the star to his 3.8 million Instagram followers. It featured an unflattering picture of an unidentified woman with the caption: “Iggy Azalea no make-up.”

Abbott vows to ‘shirtfront’ Russia’s hard-man president

PRIME Minister Tony ­Abbott has vowed to “shirtfront” Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Australia next month in what is shaping as a battle of the world’s ­bare-chested leaders.

A fired-up Mr Abbott yesterday promised to confront the Russian dictator face to face in Brisbane on November 15 over Russia’s role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17, in which 38 Australians were murdered.

“I’m going to shirtfront* Mr Putin – you bet I am,’’ the PM said. “I’m going to be saying to Mr Putin: Australians were murdered and they were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.

“If the Russian president turns up he will get, in no ­uncertain terms from me, Australia’s attitude to what’s been done in Eastern Europe, to the atrocity that has ­befallen our citizens and our demand from Russia that it co-operates fully and constructively with the ­criminal investigation so that justice can be done.’’ Mr Abbott’s strong stance came as the Kremlin’s puppet newspaper Pravda launched a stinging attack on the PM.

“I would advise Vladimir Putin to wash his hands after shaking the paw offered to him by Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the G20 summit,” it said.

“It is not about ebola, it is about the disease called insolence and Australia’s colonial chip on its shoulder.” When Mr Abbott and Mr Putin meet it promises to be a memorable battle of brawn. Both leaders are fitness freaks and have often been photographed shirtless. Mr Abbott has taken a strong personal interest in the MH17 disaster, in which 298 people were killed, ­including 38 Australians, when ­Russian-backed separatists shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine.

Since the outrage the prime minister has formed a strong bond with some of the victims’ ­families.

Yet despite worldwide condemnation of Mr Putin’s lack of co-operation in bringing the murderers to justice, he will be given five-star, red-carpet treatment in Brisbane.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten yesterday reiterated his stance that he did not want Mr Putin in the country.

“The government was talking tough but they haven’t been able to stop him ­coming,’’ Mr Shorten said.

Mr Abbott said that ­although it was Australia’s turn to host the G20 summit, it did not run the event and the overwhelming majority of the attending nations wanted Mr Putin to attend.

“I don’t want to be a G20 wrecker,’’ he said, adding thet Mr ­Shorten shouldn’t play ­politics on the issue.* Shirtfronting is an AFL term for banging chests.

Wing and a prayer for Qantas

AVIATION QANTAS faces a fresh round of market turbulence after revealing foreign investment in the airline is almost at its upper limit, denying the company a key source of financial support.

The carrier has announced foreigners now hold 47.8 per cent of its shares, closing in on the 49 per cent cap imposed by the Qantas Sale Act.

That compares with 44.7 per cent in September and less than 44 per cent a month earlier, with US investor Franklin Resources accounting for 17.56 per cent at September’s count.

It comes at a difficult time for Qantas, which in August posted a record $2.8 billion full-year loss, weighed down by its ailing international arm and the effects of a high Australian dollar.

Analysts said the Australian stockmarket relied on healthy support from overseas — something Qantas could no longer lean on.

By value, about 43 per cent of the domestic sharemarket is owned by foreigners. “Qantas won’t get the support it could normally expect from overseas,” said CMC Markets strategist Michael McCarthy.

Mr McCarthy said the recent drop in global oil prices — a key factor in the amount airlines pay for aviation fuel — had bolstered Virgin’s shares, up 7 per cent in the past week.

But Qantas had shed 4.3 per cent during the same period, “ Mr McCarthy said: “It’s in a tough industry in a tough part of the world. It wouldn’t be easy even if the Sale Act was repealed tomorrow.” Qantas shares closed 3.7 per cent lower yesterday at $1.30 — the lowest level in more than six weeks — while Virgin fell 0.5c, or 1.3 per cent, to 38c.

Lonsec senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said ebola fears could also be weighing on the internationally-exposed Qantas more so than Virgin, but the fact foreigners wanted to buy Qantas stock should be seen as a positive. “I’d be more worried if foreigners were bailing out. This put pressure on the government to take the shackles off Qantas.” The act, set up in 1992 as part of the deregulation of the aviation industry, was designed to ensure the airline remained Australian-owned.

Qantas earned a concession this year when the government eased parts of the act, winding out both the 25 per cent cap on individual foreign ownership and 35 per cent cap on foreign airline ownership, but kept the overarching 49 per cent barrier.paul.gilder@news.com.au

PM vows to confront Russian president at G20 over MH17 'murders'.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott will "shirtfront" Vladimir Putin over the MH17 disaster when the Russian leader attends the G20 summit in Brisbane.

Mr Abbott has imposed trade bans on Russia and expressed his anger over Russia's support for separatists who shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight, resulting in the deaths of 298 people including 38 Australians.

But after consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott said Mr Putin wouldn't be banned from the economic leaders' summit next month.

As the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending, Mr Abbott said.

Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin.

But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart.

"I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin," the prime minister said on Monday.

"I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment."

He said he would also be demanding Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation and if evidence is sought it should be provided.

Mr Shorten said there was plenty of evidence pointing to Russian involvement in the July 17 downing of MH17 over eastern Ukraine.

"It was an act of murder," Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne.

"How is it that the President of the Russian Federation, Putin, can thumb his nose at the rest of the world, go wherever he wants, without there being any repercussions or any co-operation with the independent investigation as to how this happened?"

Mr Putin knew more about the plane tragedy than he had let on so far, he said.

"I happen to think that when you deal with an international bully, the way you do it isn't by laying out the red carpet. So no, I don't think he's welcome, I don't think most Australians want him here."

Asked whether Mr Abbott should meet with Mr Putin, the Labor leader said: "No."

"I wouldn't give him the time of day," Mr Shorten said.

Treasurer Joe Hockey had confirmed Mr Putin's attendance at the weekend when speaking with Russia's finance minister.

He said that while the consensus among G20 members was that the Russian President should attend, he expected there to be "full and frank dialogue".

The G20 is an economic forum but previous summits have discussed global security issues such as Syria.

Mr Abbott's comments sparked an angry response in the Russian online news site Pravda, which called him insolent.

"I would advise Russia's President Vladimir Putin to wash his hands carefully and sterilise them after shaking the paw offered to him by Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the forthcoming G20 Summit in Brisbane," a Pravda column says.

"It is not about Ebola virus disease, it is about the disease called insolence and Australia's colonial chip on its shoulder."

VIDEO: East Lancashire health staff walk out in pay strike

HUNDREDSof thousands of health workers have walked out on strike, many for the first time in their lives, in protest at the Government's decision not to give them a recommended 1% pay rise.

Midwives, nurses, paramedics, ambulance staff, and hospital porters and cleaners mounted picket lines across England from 7am for four hours, while action will be taken later today in Northern Ireland.

MORE TOP STORIES:

Several trade unions are involved in the action, including those representing nurses, paramedics, hospital porters and ambulance crews as well as the Royal College of Midwives (RCM).

The strike, the biggest of its kind for over 30 years, will be followed by other forms of industrial action for the rest of the week, ahead of a national protest in London on Saturday organised by the TUC under the banner Britain Needs A Pay Rise.

The dispute involves over 400,000 NHS staff, who have been hit by pay freezes or below inflation rises since the coalition came to power in 2010.

Unite said a poll it commissioned showed public support for the industrial action as well as backing for a decent pay rise.

Contingency plans have been worked out to deal with the strike and union members will deal with emergencies. But a row broke out after it emerged that military personnel and the police will be deployed by the London Ambulance Service.

Unions said they had been kept in the dark about the move.

Unions are protesting at the Government's decision not to accept the independent pay review body's recommendation to award a 1% pay rise to all staff. Instead, ministers took the "divisive" decision to only award a 1% pay rise for those on the top of their pay band, which unions say has denied it to 60% of NHS workers.

Christina McAnea, national officer of Unison, said: "This is the first time in 32 years that NHS workers take industrial action over pay, and for many, it will be the first time. Up and down the country, hundreds of thousands of workers are out fighting for fair pay and for the NHS."

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, who joined a picket line near Euston in London, said: "NHS staff are always reluctant strikers - there hasn't been a national strike over pay in the health service since 1982 - and they will do everything they can to protect patients in their care. But morale has hit rock-bottom.

"Not only have NHS staff faced year-on-year cuts in the relative value of their pay, ministers have turned down the recommendations of the independent pay review body, even though it called for an affordable, below-inflation pay rise.

"It is no surprise that the NHS is finding it hard to recruit and retain staff as they find themselves squeezed between falling living standards and covering up for NHS cuts."

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: "At a time when MPs are set for a 10% pay hike, we're told that midwives don't deserve even a below-inflation 1% rise. And politicians wonder why the public does not afford them more respect.

"It feels to a great many people, including midwives, that there is one rule for them and another rule for everybody else.

"The independent panel of experts who advise the Government on NHS pay recommended a 1% pay rise for midwives, nurses, paramedics and other NHS staff. Unfortunately, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt rejected that recommendation, and he and the employers decided that midwives and others won't get a pay rise this year."

NHS England's chief nursing officer Jane Cummings said: "We know that NHS staff are highly professional and always wish to put patients first. I am sure they will think very carefully before taking strike action to ensure the safety and care of patients is not put at risk.

"As a nurse, I know that Monday mornings are often extremely busy for the NHS and it may be busier than normal this Monday because of the strike action being taken by some staff. As ever, the safety and care of patients is our top priority and we have robust plans in place to cope.

"If necessary, the most urgent cases will be put first and we would ask the public to help, for example, by only calling an ambulance if it is a life-threatening situation."

London Ambulance's director of operations, Jason Killens, said the service was expecting to be under "significant pressure" during the strike, adding: "While we recognise the right of our staff to take action, we must also do all we can to continue to provide a safe service to Londoners.

"We have plans in place to ensure we reach the most seriously ill and injured patients as quickly as possible and these include additional support from hospital doctors and nurses, private ambulance crews, the police and the military.

"In the event of a major incident we are confident that our professional and dedicated healthcare professionals would return to work and this has been agreed by our local union representatives.

"We will be sending a response to all patients in a life-threatening situation but other people may be referred to NHS111, given clinical advice, provided with alternative transport, may wait longer or will be asked to make their own way to hospital.

"As always we urge Londoners to call NHS111 and only call 999 for an ambulance in a genuine emergency so we have ambulance crews free to respond to life-threatening emergencies."

Dave Prentis, Unison's general secretary said: "Our NHS members don't take action often or lightly. For many, it will be the first time they walk out as the last action over pay was 32 years ago.

"But what NHS workers also don't do is walk out on patients. Safety is paramount and we have been working with employers to ensure urgent patient care is not compromised. Patient safety is paramount and life and limb cover will be provided.

"I reiterate my offer to Jeremy Hunt to reconsider his pay policy and negotiate with trade unions to avoid more industrial action as we get closer to the winter pressures."

Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB union, said: "Reports from across the country are that the strike action is rock solid. Members are determined to get Government to listen to them."

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We absolutely will talk to the unions, we've been prepared to talk to them throughout this. We will talk to them if they're prepared to look to reform the system of increments, which is unclear and unfair.

"I recognise frontline staff do a magnificent job in the NHS. We have had more than 650 NHS volunteers who are willing to put themselves in harm's way to help tackle the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

"We have magnificent people.

"We're offering them all a one per cent rise. The majority of NHS staff get an automatic 3% increment but we can't afford to give a one per cent rise to people already getting that.

"We're coming through a very difficult period with the tragedy of Mid-Staffordshire. We now have got 5,000 more nurses in just a year. We're recruiting nurses like crazy at the moment and to put that in reverse would not be the right move at the moment.

"The most important thing here is doing the right thing for patients. It would be irresponsible for any health secretary to accept a pay package that means the NHS has to lay off nurses."

Mr Hunt said that hospitals would be forced to lay off staff if the recommended pay award was met in full.

"Nearly 60% of NHS staff get an automatic pay rise through their increments of an average of 3%. We can't afford to offer a 1% on top of the 3%," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

"We have had very clear analysis that if we did that, hospital chief executives would lay off around 4,000 nurses this year and around 10,000 nurses next year.

"The NHS has just come through a terrible tragedy with Mid Staffs when we discovered the most appalling care happening there and indeed some other hospitals as well.

"We have turned the corner on that by recruiting in hospital wards around 5,000 extra nurses in the last year alone. We don't want to turn the clock back on that."

Midwives, nurses and other health workers mounted a noisy protest outside St Thomas' hospital opposite Parliament in Westminster.

Most passing cars, buses and lorries tooted in support and patients arriving for appointments said they backed the action.

Midwives shouted: "Don't push midwives - push fair pay."

They said they never imagined having to go on strike but were at their wits' end.

Annie Black, who has been a midwife for 12 years, said: "We haven't had a pay rise for years yet our workload keeps on increasing. It's time the Government took us seriously. It's weird being on strike, but we feel that enough is enough."

THERE are gaps in the Ebola response in West Africa that Australia and the international community should be filling, the Australian Red Cross says.

ITS international program head Peter Walton said the epidemic, which has killed 4000 people in west Africa since January, affects everybody around the world and he urged both the Australian government and the community to do more.

"We have an obligation to really up the response so that it can be contained in West Africa while there still is a window of opportunity," Mr Walton told reporters in Melbourne on Monday.

He said the federal government needed to constantly review its response to the outbreak.

The Australian government has contributed $18 million to tackle the spread of Ebola but Prime Minister Tony Abbott says no troops or logistical support will be sent to help combat the virus.

The Australian Red Cross is part of a global response that has volunteers on the ground in 14 West African countries but they need more funding to fill the gaps in the response to the outbreak, Mr Walton said.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the US has warned that under a worst-case scenario cases could explode to 1.4 million worldwide by January.

"The current response isn't meeting all the needs of the West Africa community," Mr Walton said.

"Health systems are completely over-burdened, Ebola treatment centres are not able to cope with the demand.

"This isn't just a public health crisis, it is a broader humanitarian crisis that is impacting on the way of life of people in all manner of ways."

He said the whole international community should do much more.

We can control Ebola spread: UN expert

SYSTEMS now in place, along with international help, could turn the tide and reduce the number of new Ebola cases, says a UN expert.

DR David Nabarro, the UN's special envoy on Ebola, said on Saturday the number of cases in west African countries including Sierra Leone were increasing week-on-week.

But systems now in place, along with international help, could turn the tide and reduce the number of cases from one week to the next, he told the BBC 5live Up All Night's Dotun Adebayo.

Dr Nabarro said: "As a result of the sensitisation program last month I think we have got a much better community involvement, which leads me to believe that getting it under control within the next three months is a reasonable target.

"When we have a disease outbreak like this there is a thing called the epidemic curve, which is numbers of cases over time, and at the moment that epidemic curve is increasing in an exponential fashion ... this means an upward-going curve and it's quite frightening because it means an acceleration.

"By under control I mean we bend the curve down, the numbers of cases each week diminishes compared with the previous week to the point where there is no new transmissions.

"For me under control means the epidemic curve is coming down and we are confident that the numbers of cases is reducing and will be eventually ended."

Dr Nabarro said people in the affected countries, which also include Liberia and Guinea, now had a better understanding of the need to stop the virus spreading by isolating themselves if they became infected.

He added: "The epidemiologists, the people who study disease, say that when 70 per cent of those who have got the virus are enabled to avoid spreading it to others then the epidemic curve will come down and that's our target for the next 90 days."

Dr Nabarro told the BBC screening people arriving at ports and airports was "less necessary" than screening on departure and singling out people because of their nationality or where they are travelling from was "inappropriate".

Katter comments 'unfortunate': Shorten

AUSTRALIA doesn't need to worry unduly about the Ebola virus, Bill Shorten says.

MR Shorten was responding to Mr Katter's comments on Thursday that Australians returning from west African countries should "go to a quarantine holiday resort" until they can be cleared of the virus.

The warning came as screening measures were being ramped up at international airports around the nation - despite the Health Department saying the risk of an Ebola outbreak remains low - and as it emerged 11 Australians had been tested and cleared.

Cairns nurse and Red Cross worker Sue Ellen Kovack is being held in isolation and under close observation until health authorities are sure the 57-year-old, who recently returned from Sierra Leone, via Casablanca and Dubai, Perth, Melbourne and on to Cairns.

"There were some unfortunate comments made by an Australian politician in some ways criticising her for putting herself in the position to risk Ebola," Mr Shorten told reporters in Sydney on Saturday.

"I just want to say to this nurse if you're listening, I understand and Labor understands that not every hero wears a uniform," Mr Shorten said.

"Our nurses and our medical staff, be they in Australia or people courageously volunteering and doing work overseas, they deserve a pat on the back - they are real heroes and don't deserve any criticism."

He said while Ebola was a topic of concern in the community, Australian health officials and the government have arrangements in place.

"People shouldn't be unduly worried," he said.

Mr Katter on Friday doubled down on his earlier comments, and said Australians returning from west African countries should "go to a quarantine holiday resort" until they can be cleared of the virus.

"They can have a beaut, terrific holiday there for three weeks when they come home and it will be a very nice thing for them," said Mr Katter, whose electorate of Kennedy includes the southern area of Cairns and the Cairns airport.

Australia's peak medical body has slammed Mr Katter's comments.

As of Friday, travellers arriving in Australia from west African countries will be interviewed and screened for symptoms, but very few people travel to Australia from west Africa, with no direct commercial flights from any of the affected countries.

The Health Department says the risk of an Ebola outbreak remains low.

US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew says governments in Europe, Japan and China are failing to deliver needed economic support.

TREASURY Secretary Jacob Lew said governments in Europe, Japan and China were failing to deliver needed support.

"European leaders should focus on recalibrating policies to address persistent demand weakness," Lew said in comments prepared for a session of the policy-setting committee of the International Monetary Fund, which was scheduled to conclude its discussions on Saturday.

The policy-setting committee of the World Bank also was to meet. Both groups were expected to again address the Ebola crisis in West Africa.

Lew said Japan's outlook was uncertain, with growth projected to remain weak this year and next. He said Japanese officials needed to carefully calibrate budget reductions and "move decisively to implement requisite growth-boosting structural reforms."

He said China's economy remained strong but risks had risen and the country needed to put more emphasis on consumption-led growth.

Lew did not mention Germany by name, but it was clear that his remarks on Europe focused on that nation's reluctance to do more to stimulate growth. "Countries with external surpluses and fiscal flexibility" needed to do more to boost growth, he said. Germany, Europe's largest economy, ran a large trade surplus last year.

Even some of Germany's European partners have said countries in the 18-nation euro zone should shift away from the deficit-cutting policies Germany has championed and boost investment spending to avoid being stuck in Japanese- style stagnation.

It was against that background that G-20 finance ministers and central bank presidents met for two days of talks that ended Friday in advance of the IMF-World Bank meetings.

After those discussions, the ministers unveiled plans for a global initiative to build roads, ports, railways and other infrastructure projects to help boost world growth by $US2 trillion ($A2.16 trillion) over the next five years and create millions of jobs.

The G-20 was being led this year by Australia, which was scheduled to host a leader's summit next month in Brisbane. Treasurer Joe Hockey, who chaired the finance discussions, told reporters that the plan the G-20 group developed involved more than 900 individual initiatives with the potential to lift growth by 1.8 per cent over the next five years. He said details would be disclosed at the leaders' summit.

While developing the five-year plan for infrastructure projects, the G-20 financial officials were less successful in their efforts to deal with immediate threats from slowdowns in Europe, Latin America and China. The group did not issue a communique, but individual ministers said economic problems were discussed in the G-20 sessions.

"We as a group do not want to settle for mediocre growth," Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver told reporters. "We don't think we have to."

No health workers without evacuation plan

THE Australian government will not send health workers to west Africa until it can guarantee their safe evacuation in the event they contract Ebola.

DESPITE talks with nations including the UK, US and throughout Europe, Australia has been unable to ensure a treatment or evacuation plan is in place for its personnel should they be sent to west Africa, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says.

"I do not have in place a guarantee that should an Australian health worker ... contract Ebola, they would be able to be transported or treated in a hospital either in the region or in Europe," she told reporters in Launceston on Saturday.

"And until I have that in place we will not be sending Australian health workers."

The minister has previously told parliament that Australia does not have planes equipped to transport Ebola patients back to Australia and even if it did, the flight time of 30 hours is "clinically and logistically unsafe".

The minister presumed that Australian health workers travelling privately to the outbreak region would be covered by a credible plan provided by their affiliate organisation.

The Australian government has contributed $18 million for equipment and supplies in west Africa since the Ebola outbreak.

"That's the kind of practical response we are providing but I am not putting at risk the lives of health workers," Ms Bishop said.

Ms Bishop's comments follow an Ebola scare in northern Australia where Cairns nurse and Red Cross worker Sue Ellen Kovack, 57, returned from working in Sierra Leone with symptoms, including a fever.

Initial tests have cleared Ms Kovack of Ebola but she remains in hospital isolation until at least Monday, with a second round of testing scheduled for Sunday.

Queensland MP Bob Katter has accused Ms Kovack of putting the country at risk of Ebola through her "humanitarian ambitions" in west Africa.

Mr Katter has also called for an investigation into why Ms Kovack was treated in the Cairns emergency department, rather than in an isolated medical ward, saying the handling of her case was "beyond comprehension".

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Ms Kovack deserves a pat on the back.

"Our nurses and our medical staff, be they in Australia or people courageously volunteering and doing work overseas, they deserve a pat on the back - they are real heroes and don't deserve any criticism," Mr Shorten told reporters in Sydney on Saturday.

Screening measures are being ramped up at international airports around the nation - despite the Health Department saying the risk of an Ebola outbreak remains low - and as it emerged 11 Australians had been tested and cleared. Mr Shorten said while Ebola was a topic of concern in the community, people shouldn't be unduly worried.

Ms Kovack recently returned from volunteering at hospitals in Sierra Leone - one of the countries hardest hit by the virus that has taken more than 4000 lives in West Africa.

She isolated herself at home on her return, but reported to authorities she had a low-grade fever, as per normal protocol, and was admitted to hospital on Thursday.

A Queensland Health spokesman told AAP on Saturday most of Ms Kovack's symptoms had subsided.

Queensland Health is expected to provide updates on Ms Kovack's condition throughout the weekend.

Lonely face of global epidemic

THE WORLD HAS BEEN CAUGHT OUT, WRITES BRUCE MCDOUGALL

She is not named and her precise age is not clear. Yet it is a heartbreaking image.

In the face of this young West African girl, suspected to be infected with ebola, is the sorrow and loneliness inflicted by a disease that is destroying communities and threatening the planet.

The youngster pictured, while in quarantine in a Sierra Leone hospital near the epicentre of the ebola outbreak, sits alone and with fading hope, like thousands of others, seemingly resigned to her fate.

At remote Foredugu in the West African country’s northern province, she is the human face of a tragedy that is unfolding across continents.

The world — caught unaware and unprepared by the outbreak — is struggling to stop ebola from spreading even ­further. Health officials fear more than 20,000 people could be infected by the virus in multiple countries by early next month unless its progress can be arrested.

It is known that the first reported case of this outbreak of ebola occurred in late 2013 in Guinea, in the rainforests of Gueckedou, near the Liberia and Sierra Leone border.

It is unclear how the virus found its way into the human population, although the accepted theory is it was transmitted by the bat population of West Africa.

Back then, doctors were working under the assumption the virus was Lassa fever, another abhorrent disease with similar symptoms to ebola. But then scores of people began to exhibit more symptoms and half of them were dying despite the best efforts of doctors. On March 23, the World Health Organisation posted on its website: “The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Guinea has notified WHO of a rapidly evolving outbreak of ebola virus disease (EVD) in forested areas of south-eastern Guinea. As of March 22, 2014, a total of 49 cases including 29 deaths (case fatality ratio: 59 per cent) had been reported.” In late March, ebola had found its way from Guinea to Liberia, where two people died. On April 1, Sierra Leone reported two of its citizens had died in Guinea.

That same day, the WHO urged calm. “This is relatively small still. The biggest outbreaks have been over 400 cases,” WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said at a news conference, referring to outbreaks in Congo and Uganda some years ago.

At this point, it is understood the WHO had ranked this outbreak two on a scale of one to three, with three being the worst case scenario. But that hadn’t filtered out to the general population.

As with major catastrophes, the world turned to the United States for guidance. And the US turns to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which has investigators schooled in epidemics who can move at a moment’s notice.

But the CDC ran into bureaucratic resistance from the WHO’s office in Africa. The Americans were keen to help and play a greater role in stemming the ebola tide. After much negotiations, the CDC was allowed to intervene.

Meanwhile, ebola waited for no man. It continued to race rampant through West Africa and the death toll was mounting.

On July 24, the WHO upgraded the crisis from a two to a three, the highest level, but it did not declare a global health emergency. In late July, with the epidemic roaring, the head of Medecins Sans Frontieres, Dr Joanne Liu, sought a sit-down meeting with WHO Director-General Margaret Chan.

Dr Liu urged Chan to declare an international health emergency but she was reluctant. Soon after, Chan flew to West Africa to meet with the presidents of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and see the outbreak for herself. She announced a $100 million push to stop ebola.

On August 8, the WHO declared a global health emergency.

Also in August, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said to her nation: “We have been unable to control the spread due to continued denials, cultural burying practices, disregard for the advice of health workers and disrespect for the warnings by the government.” By September, there was still no agreement among the major global health organisations and world leaders on how to tackle ebola. The WHO had released a 20-page report but still it was unclear how it could be implemented.

With the arrival of reported cases on their own doorsteps, the United States leapt into action last month, with Preseident Barack Obama deploying the military to provide equipment, logistical support and other aid to West Africa.

But the region now had thousands of confirmed ebola cases and in early September, Sirleaf contacted Obama: “I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,” she wrote.

On September 23, the CDC released a report estimating that as many as 1.4 million cases could potentially erupt in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January 2015.

The US military is gradually arriving in West Africa to build more treatment centres.

And US Secretary of State John Kerry this week issued a rallying cry to the world to urgently increase tenfold their efforts to help West Africa.

Between the end of 2013 and September 14 this year, 4507 cases were reported to WHO. For a large part of that time — due to inertia, bureaucracy and turf wars between authorities — the world sat on its collective hands.

Health experts say the risk of continued expansion of ebola is real. It has taken six months since the first case was reported for the United Nations to approve resolutions for an emergency response. Already almost 6000 people have been infected and nearly 3500 killed. More than 300 health care workers are among the infected, with 181 reported to have died.

“This is not just a public health crisis. This is a social ­crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones,” Dr Chan told the UN Security Council.

UN Secretary-General’s senior co-ordinator for the ebola response Dr David Nabarro said: “To get in front of this the response must be increased 20-fold from where it is today.” Liberia has been hardest hit with almost 2000 deaths. The beleaguered health system has been overwhelmed. Appalling scenes have been filmed on the streets of the capital, Monrovia.

In one case a burial team wearing protective clothing approached the body of the suspected male ebola victim to wrap it in plastic in preparation for the crematorium.

They doused the crumpled figure with bleach to prevent the disease from spreading and went to place the victim in a body bag. Then one of his hands moved.

“He’s not dead!” exclaimed correspondent Dr Richard Besser, who was filming the scene for the American ABC network.

Dr Besser said: “If you die from ebola they are very quick for you. If you’re living and you need help there’s really nowhere to go.” One thing health experts are agreed on — to halt the epidemic much more needs to be done, on a much larger scale, and by a world united.

WORLD’S WORST PLAGUES 1. BUBONIC PLAGUE The Black Death took place from 1348-1350 however it continued to return until the 1700s. Total estimated deaths relating to the Black Death are between 75 and 200 million, 25 to 50 per cent of Europe’s population.

2. INFLUENZA The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 40 million people. It killed 20 per cent of those who contracted the virus, which caused the immune system to overreact.

3. SMALLPOX It began through the spread of the ‘new world’ throughout the 1500s, killing up to 95 million native Americans. Despite the creation of a vaccine in 1796 the smallpox disease continued to spread until 1977 when the last natural case occurred.

4. CHOLERA It hit pandemic proportions throughout 1817 to 1824. Total deaths are still unknown however Bangkok suffered 30,000 deaths and a single town in Java recording 1225 deaths in just 11 days.

5. TYPHOID An estimated 21.7 million people were afflicted with 217,000 deaths recorded. It continues to effect individuals across the globe with an outbreak in 2004 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 214 deaths and 42,000 cases recorded.

6. POLIO Became evident as an epidemic throughout Europe and the US around the 1900s. Polio struck without warning, requiring long periods of isolation. By 1957 a vaccine was developed for thedisease.

Retreat as fear wipes $30b off the bourse

MARKETS THE Australian sharemarket is awash with red after the bourse suffered its biggest one-day plunge for 15 months.

More than $30 billion was wiped off the value of Australia’s major companies as investors drove the benchmark ASX 200 down 2.1 per cent.

The index closed 108.4 points lower in its biggest drop since last June as fears around global growth and weak economic figures out of Europe sent shareholders scurrying for cover.

It caps a volatile six weeks for the local bourse, which has shed more than 8 per cent of its value — $130 billion — since hitting a year-high of 5658.5 points in early September.

Yesterday’s drop echoed a 2 per cent fall on Wall Street the previous night, after Germany’s leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for growth in that nation. ­Germany is Europe’s biggest economy.

But CMC Markets strategist Michael McCarthy said other than the fresh fears around growth, there had been no real “trigger” for yesterday’s mass sell-off.

“It’s growth concerns that sparked this, particularly concerns that Germany is imploding. Weak overseas leads notwithstanding, there’s been no appreciable deterioration in the outlook for Australian shares over the last two months,” he said.

He said investors sitting on large capital gains and concerned about a weak Europe and some troubling global hot spots had moved to lock in profits and protect against further falls.

“The major risk is recent plunges spark a panic and ensuing irrational selling,” Mr McCarthy said.

Mr McCarthy said Australian and global volatility ­indexes, which measure fear and uncertainty by charting sharp stock movements, had jumped to nearly the highest points for the year.

AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said there could be more pain ahead for investors in the near-term, with potential US Federal ­Reserve movements, pressure in Europe and global issues such as the ebola virus likely to take a toll.

“The weakness we’ve seen in shares over the last month could have further to run in the short-term,” Dr Oliver said.But Dr Oliver was optimistic the plunge was not the start of a long-term downward trend: “This is still likely to be just a normal correction rather than the start of a new bear market.”

Ebola fears as Briton dies

SKOPJE A BRITISH man displaying ebola-like symptoms has died in Macedonia, health officials said, cautioning that the diagnosis could not be confirmed until a German lab had completed its analysis.

“A British citizen on business trip to Macedonia died. Because of his serious health condition at the moment he was admitted to the hospital, including vomiting and internal haemorrhage, as well as because of his sudden death, we believe he might have had symptoms of ebola,” the health ministry said.

Britain’s Foreign Office said it was investigating the case. “We are aware of reports and are looking into them,” a spokeswoman said in London.

To help confirm the diagnosis, “samples were sent to a German laboratory” and the test results are expected within 48 hours, the Macedonian health ministry said.

The Briton was taken to Skopje’s hospital for infectious diseases after staff at the hotel where he was staying called the emergency services, health ministry spokeswoman Jovanka Kostovska said.

He complained of stomach pain and “refused to eat or to see a doctor”, she said. The patient was admitted around 3pm local time and passed away shortly afer. The Skopje hotel where he was staying was sealed off and those thought to have had contact with him were put under quarantine. Health officials did not name the victim, saying only that he was born in 1956.

The man arrived in Macedonia from London on October 2 and was not thought to have travelled to any countries affected by ebola, his friends were reported to have said.

The current ebola outbreak, the worst on record, has claimed nearly 3900 lives since the start of the year, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

A nurse in Spain this week became the first person to contract the killer virus outside ­Africa, after caring for two repatriated ebola patients at a Madrid hospital.

Meanwhile, an international security expert has warned terrorists from the Islamic State could be planning to ­infect themselves with ebola and travel to the West, waging bio-terror as “suicide bombs”, according to a military expert.

Retired captain Al Shimkus, a Professor of National Security Affairs at the US Naval War College, said terrorist groups like IS could easily use human carriers to widely disseminate the deadly virus via the world’s air transportation system.

He said the strategy would be a low-tech weapon of ­bioterror. “The individual exposed to the ebola virus would be the carrier,” Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

INFECTION THREAT DOCTORS are outraged a suspected ebola patient was tested for the deadly ebola virus in the busy emergency department rather than in isolation in the infectious diseases unit at Cairns Hospital.

International Red Cross volunteer nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack was last night due to be transferred out of emergency to an isolation unit in a medical ward after an outcry from senior clinicians in the north Queensland hospital.

Doctors branded the decision by Queensland Health to test and assess a possible ebola patient in the busiest part of the hospital, which handles some of the “sickest and “most vulnerable” patients, as bizarre.

The 57-year-old tested negative to ebola yesterday but faces an agonising three-day stay in Cairns Hospital ahead a fresh battery of blood test results on Monday to confirm she has not contracted the virus.

Queensland’s chief medical officer, Dr Jeanette Young, said the negative test result and ongoing blood sampling reinforced how her condition posed no danger to the public.

Dr Young said the Cairns nurse was into day 10 of the 24-day incubation period for the haemorrhagic fever.

Ms Kovack had been in home quarantine, based on health guidelines, and presented to hospital with mild fever after a temperature spike on Thursday. Her flatmate, who drove her to hospital, has been cleared of any risk and allowed to return home, Dr Stephen Donohue said.

Senior doctors said there was an internal outcry after plans emerged to keep the suspected ebola patient for six days in a negative pressure room in the hospital’s emergency department, which treats up to 200 patients a day.

“It’s appalling. What the hell is going on?’’ said a senior clinician, speaking on behalf of a group of concerned doctors at the hospital.

“Why is she is still in ED? It’s the wrong place. Lights are on 24 hours a day, medical staff are incredibly busy, and we’ve got a possible ebola case in a bed in the midst of where we treat our most sick, ill and injured patients.“This must be the only hospital in Australia, even the world, where a possible ebola case is not transferred and put into isolation in a dedicated unit away from all the other hospital traffic.’’

LOCKDOWN HEALTH authorities have established an ebola emergency response plan across NSW that will transfer any returning aid worker showing signs of the highly contagious and fatal disease by specially equipped ambulances to Westmead Hospital.

NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said while NSW hospitals were equipped to isolate any ­patients suspected of having the disease, which has killed close to 3900 western Africans, Westmead had purpose-made isolation rooms.

There are 60 Australians registered on the government’s Smartraveller website for the crisis-hit West African countries of Guinea, ­Sierra Leone and Liberia.

But despite volunteer aid workers freely coming and going from the region, the government maintained its position that it was not safe to put either government-sanctioned health workers or ADF personnel into ebola-stricken areas because the 30-hour-plus flight time back to Australia was too long to evacuate someone.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Parliament last week there were few planes equipped to ferry ebola ­victims safely.

The federal Health Department said there were strict guidelines in place to isolate a person if they ­became sick from the disease on a commercial flight.

Screening measures have been stepped up at international airports after Queensland nurse Sue Ellen Kovack checked into Cairns hospital with a slight fever after returning from Sierra Leone last weekend.

She is one of at least three aid workers — including a NSW nurse returning from Liberia — who have followed strict protocols putting themselves into voluntary isolation for 21 days.

Ms Kovack, who worked in an ebola hospital for a month, received a negative blood test for the killer disease but Queensland’s chief doctor said the 57-year-old will remain under observation until at least later today.

Dr Jeannette Young said: “This is a necessary precaution given the patient has been to West Africa and has had a fever within the incubation period of 21 days”.

Dr Young also raised ­concerns about the 15 hours it took to get a result on tests for the deadly disease as Ms Kovack was in Cairns.

She said she would raise with her interstate counterparts the prospect of having a designated ebola hospital in each state capital city to speed up the process.

“If you have people who do have a risk of developing the disease because they have been exposed to sick people, it would be easier to have them in a metropolitan centre where we have a ­hospital that we’ve designated to treat anyone who should get ebola,” she said.

“That delay from yesterday 1pm when the blood was taken until 4am this morning when I got the test result is fairly lengthy, it would be nice to be able to do that more quickly.” In NSW, Westmead Hospital has already run two live exercises to test responses to an outbreak anywhere in the state, with specialist ambulances ready to isolate and ferry sick people to the ­western Sydney hospital.

Dr Chant said: “NSW Health, hospitals, healthcare providers including GPs, ambulance, pathology and other relevant parties … are trained to respond quickly to manage any suspected cases that may arise in many ­different locations.

“In the event of any suspected case of ebola … all hospitals are equipped to isolate the suspected patient.

“Westmead Hospital is the designated hospital for the treatment of ebola virus and similar conditions in NSW. It has purpose-built isolation rooms for patients in order to control and contain the possible spread of the virus to other patients, healthcare staff and visitors.” The only laboratory equipped to undertake viral diagnostic testing for ebola is also at the hospital.

Local doctors have been given protocols to isolate and assess patients with the help of experts at Westmead.

If the patient needs to be transferred all medical staff, including paramedics, have been trained in the use of protective equipment and relevant procedures.

Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton yesterday ­revealed 11 Australians had been tested for ebola and more than 650 had been screened at airports after ­arriving from African areas.

Despite the concerns, Australia will not follow the US and UK in screening people’s temperatures when they arrive back in Australia.

Officials say temperature screening does not provide a definitive answer because of the 21-day incubation period.

Discovered in 1976, ebola is a deadly virus that begins with a fever, sore throat and muscle pain before it attacks internal organs and finishes with extensive internal bleeding.

Current ebola outbreak began in the West African country of Guinea in December and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

Ebola starts with flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, headache and muscle pain. It then develops into a haemorrhagic disease which includes bleeding of the eyes, internal organs and bleeding through the skin.

Doctors keep patients comfortable until the virus runs its course. Scientists are attempting to create a vaccine for the virus.The standard mortality rate is 90 per cent, although the current strain is believed to be around 70 per cent.

VOLUNTEERS RED Cross and other aid workers will continue to be sent to treat ebola victims in Africa and allowed to return home without the enforcement of formal quarantine.

Sending health workers to ebola-ravaged West Africa contradicts government policy for its own workers, with warnings the 30-hour flight from the region is too long to evacuate any workers diagnosed with the disease.

Despite this Red Cross volunteers — all health experts — are willing to commit themselves to the highly dangerous work that will see them put into home isolation for 21 days on their return home.

Medecins Sans Frontieres has had five Australian volunteers return from western Africa. MSF spokesman Yann Libessart said in Europe the ­organisation insisted volunteers remained in a major city for the 21-day isolation period for quick access to hospital.

Registered nurse Maria Dunn from Yamba, on NSW’s north coast, is preparing to head to Liberia to help tackle the ebola crisis next week.

“I am not blase about it, but I do say we are highly trained health professionals who follow very strict guidelines to protect our own health,” said Ms Dunn, 56. She is flying out to replace Libby Bowell, who is returning from Monrovia to go into 21 days of isolation at her home in Newcastle.

They are both volunteers on the Red Cross emergency roster and say they go because they have to. People need their help. It is dangerous work. ­Almost 200 health workers have died from the contagious disease so far. Ms Bowell helps work with the management of the dead bodies.

“The numbers continue to grow every day by 50 and 70 people becoming infected and up to 50 people a day dying,” Ms Bowell told the ABC from Monrovia yesterday.“People are turned away on a daily basis.”

We live in an era of ­precautions. The latest ­involves the deadly ebola virus, which for the first time has moved beyond the African continent to infect ­victims who subsequently appeared in the US and Europe.

Australia’s great distance from most other nations has previously given us something of a barrier to many diseases. Modern air travel, however, means that an ebola case may be only one flight away. This is why authorities are putting in place very necessary contingency plans.

For NSW, this means an ­emergency response plan that will secure and isolate any returning aid worker showing signs of the illness. Already, three aid workers who have spent time in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia before returning to Australia have placed themselves in voluntary 21-day isolation. The three include a NSW nurse who previously worked in Liberia.

These are sensible precautions. Even given our geographic safety barrier, Australia has not always been protected. In 1919, about 6000 NSW residents died from a strain of Spanish influenza. At one point in some areas of Sydney, the deaths from influenza reportedly accounted for 50 per cent of all deaths.A repetition of this in 2014 must be avoided.

THE RACE TO FIND A CURE TO A DEADLY PANDEMIC LIES IN TOBACCO AND BEER

THE RACE TO FIND A CURE TO A DEADLY PANDEMIC LIES IN TOBACCO AND BEER, WRITES SUE DUNLEVY

As ebola spreads around the world with all the spectre of a Hollywood movie plot, scientists are working furiously on possible treatments and vaccines to stop the killer virus.

And, bizarrely, the much-maligned tobacco leaf and beer could hold the key to beating the disease that has claimed more than 3400 lives and is forecast to infect 1.4 million by January.

Tobacco is normally regarded as a scourge in healthcare but the tobacco leaf is needed to grow the most promising of all the ebola treatments, the ZMapp medicine.

ZMapp has already been used on seven humans with the virus in the current ebola outbreak including US missionary Dr Kent Brantly. It is made by infecting tobacco leaves with a genetically engineered virus that contains instructions to make three antibodies to ebola.

All of the 18 monkeys infected with ebola and treated with ZMapp in a trial survived, and five of the seven humans who’ve used the drug lived.

One of the vaccines that could help prevent the spread of ebola could be made in any brewery, according to the head of the pharmaceutical company that makes it.

“I joke around that you can turn any beer manufacturer’s manufacturing production facility into a temporary emergency factory for our vaccines because we use the same fermentation technology as the beer brewing,” Inovio Pharmaceuticals CEO and president Joseph Kim told US news organisation CNBC.

Last month a trial of this vaccine showed 100 per cent of vaccinated guinea pigs and mice were protected from death after being exposed to the ebola virus.

It normally takes a decade or more to carry out the clinical trials, safety tests and get regulatory approval for new medical treatments but these processes are likely to be sidestepped in this emergency.

In early August, an expert panel convened by the World Health Organisation decided that “in the particular circumstances of this outbreak, and provided certain conditions are met, it is ethical to offer such unproven interventions as potential treatments or for prevention of infection”.

Supplies of ZMapp have now run out and the US government is looking at ways to scale up the manufacture, but it could be months before a few hundred thousand doses are available.

NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who was repatriated from Liberia with ebola, is receiving another experimental drug called brincidofovir. This broad spectrum antiviral medicine is designed to beat DNA viruses like herpes, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus. Test-tube trials showed it appeared to work in the same way against the RNA virus ebola.

However, it failed to save the life of Thomas Duncan, who died in a Texas hospital from ebola earlier this week.

Canadian company Tekmira has been working with the US Defence Department to develop another genetic treatment, TKM-ebola, which could stop ebola replicating.

Biocryst is testing another antiviral drug BCX4430 that was developed to fight the lethal marbug virus, similar to ebola.

A fifth treatment sarepta developed under a US Defence Department contract to treat marbug virus could also be useful.

Even though ebola emerged more than 40 years ago, pharmaceutical companies have had little financial interest in making a vaccine or a treatment for a disease prevalent in poor African nations.

It’s mainly as a result of US Defence Department research grants there are even any candidate treatments. The US wanted to ensure it had treatments in case ebola was turned into a bio terrorist weapon.

Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton this week tried to reassure the Australian public that “we have everything in place in this country to deal with somebody who may present to quarantine, to provide medical assistance to the person”.

The Health Department has revealed more than 651 travellers had been screened at the Australian border. All state and territory health departments have provided specific guidance to hospitals, paramedic and ambulance workforces and GPs about how to isolate, test and treat a suspected ebola case.

And there are 14 hospitals designated to deal with ebola in Australia, one in each state and territory. In Sydney it’s Westmead Hospital and the Children’s Hospital Westmead.

AMA president Dr Brian Owler and Medecins Sans Frontieres, which has sent 12 Australian doctors to West Africa, want Australia to join the US in sending troops and emergency medical teams to Africa.The Australian government has committed $18 million to international organisations involved in the ebola battle, but Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says we can’t send Australian workers because we can’t evacuate them should they become infected with ebola.

AS the Ebola outbreak continues to spiral out of control in West Africa, numerous countries and agencies have pitched in to help.

- US President Barack Obama has requested $US1 billion ($A1.08 billion) for Ebola, including the use of leftover Afghanistan war money. Top lawmakers approved $US750 million after Pentagon officials said it would be enough for a six-month mission. The Pentagon has authorised sending up to 3900 troops to set up Ebola clinics and train local staff.

- Australia is donating $A16 million; the European Commission has pledged $US228 million.

- The German military has started flying in supplies including protective suits; the military is expected to build a clinic for 50 patients in Liberia.

- Britain's ministry of defence says it will send more than 750 troops to help build treatment centres and a training centre in Sierra Leone. Britain is also providing three military helicopters

- A team of 165 health workers from Cuba arrived in Sierra Leone in early October to help run Ebola clinics and several hundred more are expected in Liberia and Guinea soon.

- China is sending a 59-member lab team to Sierra Leone to join other Chinese health workers already working in the region.

- The International Monetary Fund approved $US130 million in emergency aid to the three hardest-hit countries.

- The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said it would contribute $US50 million to the emergency response, the group's largest donation to a humanitarian crisis.

FEARS KILLER HAS ARRIVED

THE global terror of the deadly ebola virus killing thousands may have finally reached Australia.

An Australian nurse who has just returned from helping ebola victims in western Africa, where the epidemic to date has killed 3900, was last night waiting in Cairns hospital for results of tests for the fatal disease.

Sue-Ellen Kovack is the 11th Australian to be tested for the highly contagious disease in Australian labs, while a returning NSW aid worker has been placed in isolation.

A registered nurse, Ms Kovack, 57, flew back to Queensland at the weekend after spending a month helping victims in an ebola hospital in Sierra Leone, one of the three countries worst hit by West Africa’s outbreak.

Ms Kovack is one of at least three aid workers — including a NSW nurse returning from Liberia — who have followed strict protocols putting returning healthcare workers in isolation at home for 21 days.

In an interview with The Australian before she left Sierra Leone Ms Kovack said: “I am not afraid of the ebola virus while I am protected in my PPE (personal protective equipment).

“My fear is getting tired, making a mistake or other people making mistakes and having to suffer the consequences. Indeed, it can be terrifying.” The nurse, who lives with a flatmate, returned to Cairns on Tuesday and developed a fever two days later — sparking fears of an outbreak.

Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said Ms Kovack developed a “low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius” yesterday morning: “We felt it important that she come into the Cairns Hospital and be tested for ebola disease.” Ms Kovack was placed in isolation and a sample of her blood was flown to Brisbane for tests. The results of the test for ebola will be known by this morning at the latest.

Dr Young said it was highly unlikely she had infected anyone else. “Ebola virus is difficult to transmit ... you need to be exposed to secretions,” she said.

“She doesn’t have any symptoms producing those secretions, so therefore her risk of infecting someone else is very, very low.” Ms Kovack was helping victims of the disease in Kenema with fellow Red Cross worker, anaesthetist Jenny Stedmon, 55, who is now at home in isolation in Brisbane.

She predicted 70 per cent of people who contract the disease will die from it after eight or nine days of nausea and pain, with bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose.

“I never had an occasion when I thought my PPE wasn’t good enough … we were in a high-risk area, touching patients so … we just got on with it,” Ms Stedmon told The Australian.

But ebola is highly contagious. In Spain two doctors who treated nurse Teresa Romero Ramos are among six people admitted to a Madrid hospital for observation.

Ms Romero became the first to contract the disease outside of Africa when she treated two Spanish missionaries exposed to ebola who later died from the disease.

Ms Romero said she believed she may have contracted the disease by coming into contact with the outside of her protective suit while changing out of it.

A UN employee from Liberia diagnosed with ebola was yesterday hospitalised in the German town of Leipzig.

In America, ebola victim Thomas Duncan died after first being turned away by hospital staff in Texas.

Now the sheriff who delivered quarantine orders to Duncan’s family members has been rushed to hospital.

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Federal Department of Health said: “Only one person in NSW is currently in home isolation because they have recently returned from West Africa.” The spokeswoman said: “Eleven Australians to date have been tested for ebola in Australian labs.” Among those was a woman released from quarantine in Perth last month.

KEY TO A KILLER * Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as ebola heamorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.

* Virus can be transmitted by direct contact either by broken skin or mucous membranes with bodily fluids from an infected person, including blood, saliva, breast milk, stool, sweat, semen, tears, vomit, and urine.

* The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.

* The average ebola fatality rate is about 50 per cent, but rates of previous outbreaks have varied from 25 to 90 per cent.

* Outbreak control relies on case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation.

* Early treatment including rehydration improves survival.

There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralise the virus but a range of drug therapies is under development.

* There are currently no licensed ebola vaccines but two potential candidates are being tested.

MP claims humanitarians are putting Australia’s health security at risk

FEDERAL MP Bob Katter says a Cairns woman suspected of having been infected with the deadly ebola virus has put the nation at risk because of her “humanitarian ambitions”.

The outspoken MP, whose electorate of Kennedy includes the southern area of Cairns and the Cairns airport, has slammed quarantine authorities after it emerged 57-year-old nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, who had worked for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, was being tested for ebola.

But Mr Katter said it was “unbelievable and incomprehensive” how a person could get into Australia from an ebola-infected country.

“There cannot be any compromise with this,” Mr Katter said.

“If you want to go to one of these countries, however laudable your motivation, I am sorry but when you return to Australia you must be quarantined for three weeks — not home quarantined.” Mr Katter said Australian aid workers travelling to west Africa, including Ms Kovack, were putting Australia at risk: “We love these people and we honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing, but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. One person’s moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia.” There are no direct commercial flights from any of the West African affected countries into Australia. It is up to border staff at all international airports to assess anyone arriving from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Between the start on 9 August and 1 October, 651 people have been interviewed at Australian airports. Six were referred to quarantine officers but no further action was taken.

Of the six, three had been to funerals in Nigeria, but none of those people had died of ebola and two were doctors returning from West Africa.

Meanwhile in the US, the Obama administration has moved to take the temperature of travellers arriving at five US airports from western African countries, but has continued to resist growing calls to shut down borders.

While Nigeria and Liberia immediately moved to shut down their borders, the director of the Centres for Disease control has said sealing off US borders or banning flights entirely will not work.“The only way we are going to get to zero risk in this country is by controlling it in Africa. Until that happens Americans may come back with ebola,” he said.

Ebola a disaster on the march to the West

While the world is grappling with the nature and ­timing of international military interventions in Iraq and Syria, there’s ­ another threat to global peace and security which is getting much less coverage, at least in the Western media.

The ebola outbreak in West Africa is out of control, has been for months. It’s presenting a real test of leadership for global health authorities and governments alike. The virus is winning. More than 7000 people have been infected and nearly 3500 people have died.

In Liberia, the number of cases are doubling every 15 to 20 days, while in Sierra Leone there are five new infections every hour.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US (CDC) say the true numbers are probably much worse. In fact, the CDC expects by the end of January there will be a total of 550,000 ebola cases, or 1.4 million if corrections for under-reporting are made.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are being ravaged, while there have also been deaths in Nigeria and a confirmed infection in Senegal. The death of the first ebola patient diagnosed in the US, and the infection of a health worker in Spain, is now attracting coverage and seems to have finally sheeted home the horror of the disease for Western audiences.

Aid is starting to flow. The US has sent more than 3000 troops to Liberia to build hospitals and co-ordinate the logistics of delivering aid to workers on the ground. Great Britain has pledged a 700-bed hospital in Sierra Leone.

Australia’s effort to date has been less well-received. Stung by criticism of their original pledge of $8 million, the Australian government has since upped our contribution to $18 million, but it too has been met with a lukewarm response by one of the main aid groups, Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). The group says their resources are so stretched they can’t spend additional money and that what they need now is resources and people — boots on the ground.

In contrast, the tiny and developing nation of Cuba has shown what is possible. They are sending hundreds of doctors and nurses to Sierra Leone and still more to Liberia and Guinea. In so doing, Cuba is delivering on the call of Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO — “human resources are clearly our most important need”.

Dr Chan, the head of the global health agency, along with Dr Joanne Liu, the president of Medicins Sans Frontieres, may well be the most important people in the world we’ve never heard of.

The task ahead of them is mammoth as they attempt to set clear priorities and build the global capacity needed to deliver on those priorities and control the spread of ebola.

Australia has already had some false alarms, suspected cases where the patient turned out not to be infected. Federal and state health officials say they are prepared. Advice to GPs and the medical community has been posted and border officials have been alerted.

The epicentre of this perfect storm outbreak may be out-of-mind, out-of-sight West Africa, but as the cases in the US and Spain have confirmed, Western countries like Australia are not immune and all of us have a role to play in the global ebola fight.Alex Malley is chief executive of CPA Australia.

Cairns nurse tested for Ebola

A NURSE being tested for Ebola after developing a fever upon her return from Africa will find out her results by Friday morning.

REGISTERED nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, returned to Australia at the weekend after a month working in an Ebola hospital in Sierra Leone, which is one of the countries hardest hit by the virus that has already claimed thousands of lives in west Africa.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the nurse returned home to Cairns on Tuesday, where she remained in quarantine as per normal protocol.

Then she rang up on Thursday morning to report a "low-grade fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius".

"We felt it important that she come into the Cairns Hospital and be tested for Ebola disease," Dr Young said.

"She's been exposed to people with the disease while working in Sierra Leone."

A sample of her blood is being flown to Brisbane to be tested and results are expected to be known by Thursday night or early Friday.

Ms Kovack lived in Cairns with a flatmate, but Dr Young said it was highly unlikely anyone else was likely to contract the virus if she was infected.

She was also isolated once she presented to Cairns Hospital.

"Ebola virus is very difficult to transmit ... you need to be exposed to secretions," she said.

"She doesn't have any symptoms producing those secretions, so therefore her risk of infecting someone else is very, very low."

Dr Young said health staff were treating Ms Kovack as if she did have Ebola, given how serious the virus was.

But she said the registered nurse followed every precaution, so there was no need to panic.

Her comments were echoed by acting Cairns Mayor John Schilling, who said: "We have a very, very well established hospital here and I'm sure they have protocols to deal with this sort of thing."

Ms Kovack admitted she was nervous before she left, but wanted to help.

"People put up their hands because they have an interest in their fellow man, that's why I'm going," she said last month in an interview.

Dr Young praised Ms Kovack's work with the Red Cross.

"I think she's an amazing lady to go to Africa and provide that service," Dr Young said.

Australia has investigated three suspected cases of Ebola previously.

A woman was released from quarantine at a Perth hospital on September 23 after being cleared of the disease.

The woman had attended a conference in Africa.

And a one-year-old child was cleared of any infection after being taken to a Melbourne hospital on September 19 with suspicious symptoms.

The child had returned to Australia from west Africa five days earlier.

A third suspected case on the Gold Coast was cleared by tests after a man claiming to have spent time in Africa complained of vague symptoms while in police custody.

THE federal health minister says the public should be reassured that everything is in place to deal with people presenting with Ebola-like symptoms.

EBOLA has been detected outside Africa for the first time, with a Spanish nurse contracting the disease after treating two missionary workers who were working in Africa.

Health Minister Peter Dutton said screening processes were in place for travellers entering Australia from Africa or people who suspect they have the disease.

"There have been some presentations in hospitals around the country where obviously it has been proven that people don't have Ebola," he told reporters on Wednesday.

"People should be reassured by the fact that we have everything in place in this country to deal with somebody who may present, to quarantine (and) provide medical assistance to that person."

Mr Dutton said Ebola was not simply transmitted through coughing or sneezing.

"There needs to be an exchange of bodily fluids; there needs to be that exchange for Ebola to be contracted," he said.

More than 3400 people had died from Ebola in Africa as of last Friday, the World Health Organisation says.

US authorities are weighing charges against the Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in the state of Texas.

"WE are investigating whether Duncan exposed the public to a deadly virus knowingly which would be criminal intent," Debbie Denmon, a spokesperson of the Dallas County district attorney's office, said in a statement on Tuesday to The Washington Post.

"One just can't hop on a plane, lie on a travel form, come to the United States and lie on a medical document," she added.

Duncan came from Liberia and landed in the US on September 22 to marry the mother of his son and start a new life.

At the beginning of his journey in Monrovia, Liberia, Duncan filled out a form claiming to have had no contact with any person infected with the Ebola virus.

This was contradicted by people close to Duncan and after knowing that he suffered from Ebola they acknowledged that a few days before his journey he helped to take an infected woman to a medical centre where she later died.

Duncan was admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with fever and abdominal pains, but the doctors let him go with antibiotics without realising that he had come from Liberia.

Duncan came back to the hospital three days later. He was quarantined and later diagnosed with Ebola.

Duncan is in critical condition and will be subjected to an experimental treatment in the Dallas hospital where he is connected to a ventilator and undergoing renal dialysis.

Airlines struggle as virus travels

THE FALLOUT THE spread of the ebola virus has sent jitters through the airline industry with carriers’ global share prices falling four per cent last month.

The International Air Transport Association reported the downturn in its latest financial monitor, blaming “investor concerns over the spread of ebola”.

“Carriers in all regions experienced a fall in share values but airlines in North America and Asia experienced the most decline,” said the report. “Despite weakness this month, world airline share prices are up 11 per cent so far this year.” The IATA report coincided with the news of the first European case of ebola. A 44-year-old Spanish nurse contracted the deadly virus treating a missionary priest in Madrid after he was evacuated from Sierra Leone.

The nurse was now in a “stable condition” in hospital, Spain’s health ministry said.

The case is likely to cause further concerns about the virus that has already infected 7500 people in West Africa and claimed about 3400 lives.

Yesterday US President Barack Obama said passenger screenings in the US and Africa would be augmented to detect the virus.

But he resisted calls for a ban on those travelling from the countries most affected by the outbreak — Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Federal Department of Health said no changes would be made to border screening here.

“Australia already has measures in place at the border and in designated hospitals in all states and territories,” she said.“In addition all state and territory health departments have provided specific guidance to their designated hospitals, paramedic and ambulance workforces, general practice and state-based quarantine and medical staff in relation to how to isolate, test and treat a suspected ebola case.”

New fear as ebola breaks out in Spain

A NURSE in Spain has become the first person known to have caught ebola outside the outbreak zone of West Africa.

The stricken nurse had been part of a team that treated two missionaries who were flown home to Spain after they were infected.

The nurse’s only symptom was a fever, but the infection was confirmed by two tests, Spanish health officials said.

She was being treated in isolation, while authorities drew up a list of people she had had contact with.

In the United States, President Barack Obama said the government was considering more careful screening of airline passengers arriving from the region.

“We don’t have a lot of margin for error (in dealing with ebola cases),” he said.

But the White House yesterday continued to rule out a blanket ban on travel from West Africa.

Thomas Duncan, a US citizen who is being treated in the US after contracting ebola in Liberia was still listed as critically ill.

Medical workers in Texas were among a number of people waiting to find out if they had been infected by Duncan.

But there were encouraging signs for an American video journalist who returned from Liberia for treatment.

Ashoka Mukpo, 33, was able to walk off the plane before being loaded on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance, and his father said his symptoms of fever and nausea appeared mild. “It was really wonderful to see his face,” said Dr Mitchell Levy, who talked to his son via video at Nebraska Medical Centre.

Debate about how to stop ebola-infected patients from flying out of outbreak zones has intensified this week.

People leaving West Africa are checked for fevers before they are allowed to board aeroplanes, but the disease’s incubation period is 21 days and symptoms could arise later.

Airline crews and border agents already watch for obviously sick passengers, and in a high-level meeting at the White House, officials discussed potential options for screening passengers when they arrive in the US as well.

Nancy Castles, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles International Airport, said the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has had employees on site at major international airports in the US for many years. Screening starts with Customs and Border Protection agents, who work with CDC on cases of concern.The Obama administration maintains the best way to halt ebola is to end the outbreak in Africa.

aviation AUSTRALIAN airlines are lucky the nation hasn’t got a Donald Trump stoking fears over an ebola outbreak, market watchers say.

American airline stocks suffered their sharpest slump since early July as concerns mounted among travellers ­following confirmation the ­disease had hit US soil.

Both Australian airlines were down slightly yesterday with Qantas shedding 1.1 per cent to $1.41 and Virgin losing 2.7 per cent to 36c. But Evan Lucas, of derivatives traders IG Markets, said local carriers had so far escaped the effects of a US-style hysteria wreaking havoc with their share prices.

Mr Lucas said the problems in the US — where a man diagnosed with the disease was being treated at a Dallas hospital after flying in from Liberia — had been stirred up by populists such as tycoon Trump.

Mr Trump took to Twitter to decry US flights to Africa, claiming the breakouts there were a “plague like no other’’.

US airline analyst Joe DeNardi said people were going to travel less if further cases emerged, warning there was “no discrimination between international and domestic”.Mr Lucas said US airlines were also a lot more susceptible to commentators: “After the 2009 underpants bomber came from Africa through Amsterdam to America there has been a focus on these routes.’’

A MAN diagnosed with the ebola virus in Texas came in contact with young children, and experts are monitoring them for any signs of infection.

The patient has been named as Thomas Eric Duncan and the hospital admitted previously sending him home despite being told he was visiting the US from ebola-stricken Liberia.

Mr Duncan's family are among up to 20 people being monitored after exposure to the man, along with the ambulance crew who transported him to hospital.

A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in Dallas helping track anyone he may have come in contact with, CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden said.

"Once those people are identified, they will be monitored for 21 days taking their temperatures twice a day - in co-operation with local and state health officials," Dr Frieden said.

Texas governor Rick Perry said: "Today we learned some school-aged children have been identified as having had contact with the patient and are now being monitored at home for any signs of the disease.

"I know that parents are being extremely concerned about that development. These children have been identified and they are being monitored. The disease cannot be transmitted before symptoms develop."

Mr Duncan travelled from Liberia to Texas to visit family, arriving in the US on September 20. He began to show symptoms on September 24 and went to hospital for the first time on September 26 and was sent home.

Mr Duncan's sister Mai Wureh said he went to a Dallas emergency room on Friday after falling ill, but was sent home with antibiotics despite telling staff he was visiting from Liberia, an ebola hotspot.

He returned two days later to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with more serious symptoms, and was admitted for treatment.He is currently isolated in hospital, where his condition has been downgraded to stable.

Sierra Leone makes personal plea to PM

THE president of Sierra Leone has written to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, making a desperate plea for military aid to combat the Ebola virus outbreak.

IN a letter addressed to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, which arrived this week, President Ernest Bai Koroma says his country is counting on Australia and specifically requests military aid, warning Sierra Leone is losing the battle against Ebola.

The development came as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Thursday announced Australia would immediately boost its financial contribution to fighting the worst ever outbreak of the deadly disease by another $10 million, taking the total commitment to $18 million.

However, the Australian government has so far ruled out sending medical experts and logistical support.

The refusal by Australia to provide medical experts and logistical support has prompted criticism from aid organisations, including Save the Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres.

In the letter dated September 18, sent through diplomatic channels, Mr Koroma warns the nation's health system had already been overwhelmed by the virus which, according to the World Health Organisation, has claimed 3338 lives and infected 7178 since the beginning of the year.

"While we are doing everything possible to stop the outbreak, further support is urgently needed from your friendly government to scale up our national response with ... education efforts, as well as infection control measures," the letter says.

Mr Koroma makes a specific request for Australia to deploy military health units, logisticians and engineers.

"Having watched the response of the Australian military to similar humanitarian emergencies, most recently Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, I know that it is uniquely placed to help us in the fight against Ebola.

Mr Koroma says in the letter that Australian military aid could potentially help save thousands of lives.

"We are counting on Australia to send us the military personnel we so desperately need to fight back against the virus and prevent the positive developments of the last 10 years from being undone."

Ms Bishop on Thursday said the government has assessed that financial contributions were the best and most efficient way Australia could make a rapid contribution to the global response to the crisis.

But Save the Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres, while welcoming the additional aid money offered on Thursday, criticised the Australian government's refusal to do more, as other world leaders deploy troops and medical experts in their thousands.

The US has committed up to 3000 troops while the UK will spend $185 million on its mission, including supporting 700 Ebola treatment beds across Sierra Leone.

"Make no mistake, this crisis is at tipping point. We need to act urgently and decisively," Save the Children acting chief Mat Tinkler said.

The UN is seeking $US50 million ($A54 million) from donors to meet immediate needs over the next four weeks, including for logistics to deliver equipment, materials and supplies to Ebola response operations.

FOREIGN Minister Julie Bishop has defended the federal government's response to the Ebola outbreak.

THE government is being urged to commit medical and technical experts to West Africa to help combat the virus outbreak, which has already killed nearly 3100 people this year.

Medecins Sans Frontieres Australia has dismissed financial aid as "inadequate" at this stage.

But Ms Bishop said there was no way Australia could safely evacuate its health workers if they were to contract the virus on the ground.

"I have made it quite clear that the Australian government will not put at risk Australian health workers without a safe and credible evacuation plan," she told AAP on Wednesday.

She said the flying time between West Africa and Australia was approximately 30 hours - far too long for a patient who may contract the deadly disease.

Australia also didn't possess a military aeroplane capable of evacuating Ebola sufferers.

"We cannot physically, logistically do it, so we're talking to other governments to see if there is a way to evacuate elsewhere," she said.

Ms Bishop was heckled in question time in parliament as Labor demanded to know why the government wouldn't send willing and able Australian experts into the field.

Australia has so far contributed $40 million to the World Health Organisation, and an additional $8 million upon request.

By comparison the United States - which has confirmed its first domestic case of Ebola - will bolster its nearly 200 military personnel on the ground in West Africa with a further 1400 by late October.

But the foreign minister remained adamant Australia was doing all it could.

"Those who say that the government isn't serious about evacuation plans they couldn't be more mistaken," she said.

Mosquito-borne illness hits The Americas

CHIKUNGANYA, a disease which emerged in Africa is sweeping through South America, causing devastating illness, although only few fatalities.

SOME cases have already emerged in the United States.

While the disease, called Chikungunya, is usually not fatal, the epidemic has overwhelmed hospitals, cut economic productivity and caused its sufferers days of pain and misery. And the count of victims is soaring.

It's spread has not gained much media attention, since the world's focus has been on Ebola.

Chikungunya is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person and then feeds on someone else.

Chikungunya is a word that comes from the Makonde language of Tanzania in eastern Africa and translates roughly as "that which bends up," in reference to the severe arthritis-like ache in joints that causes sufferers to contort with pain.

It's usually accompanied by a spiking fever and headache. There have been only 113 deaths linked to the region's outbreak, according to the most recent data.

In El Salvador, health officials report nearly 30,000 suspected cases, up from 2300 at the beginning of August and hospitals are filled with people with the telltale signs of the illness, including joint pain so severe it can be hard to walk.

"The pain is unbelievable," said Catalino Castillo, a 39-year-old seeking treatment at a San Salvador hospital.

"It's been 10 days and it won't let up."

Venezuelan officials reported at least 1700 cases as of Friday and the number is expected to rise. Neighbouring Colombia has around 4800 cases but the health ministry projects there will be nearly 700,000 by early 2015.

Brazil has now recorded its first locally transmitted cases, which are distinct from those involving people who contracted the virus while travelling in an infected area.

Hardest hit has been the Dominican Republic, with half the cases reported in the Americas. According to the Pan American Health Organisation, Chikungunya has spread to at least two dozen countries and territories across the Western Hemisphere since the first case was registered in French St Martin in late 2013.

There have been a few locally transmitted cases in the US, all in Florida, and it has the potential to spread farther, experts say.

But Central and South America are particularly vulnerable.

It may have found fertile ground in Latin America and the Caribbean because many people are outside in the daytime, when aedes aegypti bite, or lack adequate screens on their windows.

Conditions vary widely in the region. Haiti, where many people live in flimsy shacks with little protection from mosquitoes, has been hit hard. In Venezuela, air conditioning is widespread but the country has a shortage of insect repellent and pesticide sprayers due to the country's economic problems.

The chief factors are the prevalence of the main vector for the virus, the aedes aegypti mosquito, and the lack of immunity in a population that hasn't been hit with chikungunya in modern medical history, said Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch.

"There are going to be some very large populations at risk down there, much larger than the Caribbean," Weaver said.

Authorities throughout the region have been spraying pesticide and encouraging people to remove water containers where mosquitoes can breed.

LIBERIA'S chief medical officer has placed herself and her staff under quarantine for 21 days after her office assistant died of Ebola.

BERNICE Dahn, a deputy health minister who has represented Liberia at regional conferences intended to combat the ongoing epidemic, said on Saturday that she did not have any Ebola symptoms but wanted to ensure she was not infected.

The World Health Organization says 21 days is the maximum incubation period for Ebola, which has killed more than 3000 people across West Africa and is hitting Liberia especially hard.

WHO figures released on Friday said 150 people died in the country in just two days.

Liberia's government has asked people to keep themselves isolated for 21 days if they think they have been exposed. The unprecedented scale of the outbreak, however, has made it difficult to trace the contacts of victims and quarantine those who might be at risk.

"Of course we made the rule, so I am home for 21 days," Dahn said on Saturday.

"I did it on my own. I told my office staff to stay at home for the 21 days. That's what we need to do."

Health officials, especially front-line doctors and nurses, are particularly vulnerable to Ebola, which is spread via the bodily fluids of infected patients.

Earlier this month, WHO said more than 300 health workers had contracted Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three most-affected countries. Nearly half of them had died.

AN Australian psychologist who has just returned from battling ebola in Sierra Leone has made a desperate plea for Australia to send workers to help combat the deadly virus.

Malcolm Hugo said patients in West Africa were dying in the streets, treatment centres were over-run and there were not enough workers to cope with the scale of the epidemic.

Mr Hugo was working at Sierra Leone’s main treatment centre near the Liberian border.

His plea comes as pressure mounts on the federal government to send medical teams to West Africa after US President Barack Obama told the UN his country could not do it alone.

The Public Health Association (PHA), Australian Health and Hospitals Association, Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) yesterday also stepped up their pressure on Canberra.The government has already provided the World Health Organisation with $8 million.

Last weekend the world’s key economic leaders and central bankers were in Cairns. The mood was downcast. The G20 finance ministers were trudging around with furrowed brows, moaning about terrorists chopping off people’s heads, Russia invading Ukraine and an exotic viral problem known as ebola. It was grim stuff.

Joe Hockey — who had the added stress of not yet having a plan to save our own Budget which, according to yesterday’s figures of a $48.5 billion deficit, is becoming even worse — was getting frustrated.

So frustrated did our Treasurer become during the meeting he, according to sources there, thumped his fist on the table in an attempt to stir them from a collective torpor.

He warned of the effect it would have on the global investor mood if they didn’t emerge enthusiastic from a meeting which most people think is just an annual gab-fest for the political class, usually held in a beach resort.

Hockey’s attempt at a dummy spit seemed to work.

The Daily Telegraph can reveal that what eventually came out of that meeting, which went largely unreported due to the terrorism raids that swept Sydney and Brisbane in the preceding days, will be called the Sydney Declaration. The Sydney Declaration is as significant for what it will achieve globally over the next five years as it is odd for how it came about in the first place.

Hockey was only a few weeks into the job when he made his first visit to Washington. Russia was then chair of the G20 and in the process of handing over the baton to Australia — an irony that has yet to fully play out considering the possibility Vladimir Putin may still yet be uninvited.

Treasury officials apparently told him, rather abruptly, the major problem with the G20 being held in Australia was they didn’t think they would be able to get any of the finance leaders to even come, considering the program required them to attend at least three meetings over the course of the year. They were all sick of the G20 being hijacked by side issues such as climate change. They only thing they were thankful for was that they wouldn’t have to wear silly shirts at the end of it.

So the former tourism minister did what any self-respecting Australian would do and invited them over for a BBQ.

As the story goes, the finance leaders and central bankers of the world’s major economies — including the US, Europe, Asia and Russia, turned up to Admiralty House on Sydney Harbour in February for a snag and a beer.

There was IMF boss Christine Lagarde, the Governor of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen and UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Paul Osborne, along with the Mexicans, Russians, Indonesians, and Europeans all soaking up the glory of the Emerald City on the lawns of the GG’s harbourside mansion. And then came the gatecrashers.

Tony Abbott just happened to be hosting a function for Sydney’s top CEOs at Kirribilli House when he heard about the shindig next door and popped over to see what was going on. Discovering the party was better than his own, he went back to Kirribilli House and dragged his guests, including RBA governor Glenn Stevens, Westpac’s CEO Gail Kelly and Wesfarmers’ Richard Goyder, over to Joe’s sausage sizzle.

Around a third of the world finance ministers are elected politicians. The rest are either presidentially appointed or technocrats. Not all of them see the world the same way, or through the same political or economic imperatives.

Call it serendipity or a cleverly hatched plan made to look like chance, but for the first time a group of private investors were in the one room, so to speak, with the finance leaders of the world’s major economies. One group represented trillions of dollars of private investment capital. The other represented governments of the world who had no money but desperately needed to build stuff. So came about the Sydney Declaration.

Hockey’s streamlined agenda for the G20 focused on four issues, including the obvious such as economic growth and jobs and tax cheats, but for the first time there was a strong focus on infrastructure and the sources of capital to build it.

The day after the BBQ, the official meeting agreed on the fundamentals of a global infrastructure initiative to drive growth. All agreed that if governments didn’t have money then the private sector would have to be part of the solution.

For the first time a number was agreed on for the largest global infrastructure initiative of its kind. By Cairns, agreement had been reached on 1000 new initiatives for global growth, a target of $2 trillion over the next five years and 20 million new jobs.

Hockey will travel to Washington in two weeks for a last meeting in which the final wording of the Sydney Declaration will be agreed upon. This will be the document signed by the world’s leaders in Brisbane.

Some will claim the targets are rhetoric but there is no doubt the mood from last week’s Cairns meeting signalled a global shift since Hockey’s first meeting in Washington, when Europe was still talking austerity, higher taxation and regulation. We may actually get something out of a G20 summit.And when Joe has finished fixing the world’s budget problems he might get back to fixing ours — which according to figures he released yesterday is getting significantly worse.

A NIGERIAN baby taken to a Melbourne hospital with a suspected case of the ebola virus has been cleared of virus.

The one-year-old was taken to the Royal Childrens’ Hospital on Friday by paramedics in protective suits and put in isolation, amid fears the child had contracted the deadly virus.

The baby was experiencing ebola-like symptoms days after entering Australia from an affected African nation. But test results yesterday ruled it out.

The Department of Health and the Victorian government said the quick notification and containment of the child confirmed Victoria’s ebola strategy — given a trial run at the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Friday — was working. It comes after a 27-year-old man sparked an ebola scare on the Gold Coast after he arrived in Australia from the Congo this month.

The spread of ebola has been described as the worst ever by the UN as it battles the West African health crisis.Ebola has killed more than 2400 people, according to the UN. The federal government has offered an extra $7 million to fight the virus after the US committed 3000 troops to contain it.

G20 finance ministers in Cairns have discussed the Ebola epidemic as part of its two-day agenda.

IN its communique after two days of talks, the G20 said it is concerned about the human cost of the disease and the potentially serious impacts on economic growth and stability in the affected countries and wider region.

"We underscore the importance of a coordinated international response," it said.

Treasurer Joe Hockey, host of the Cairns event said this is a global challenge.

"Australia has just stepped up again to the plate with additional funding support for measures that will help to address the spread of the virus," he told reporters at the close of the meeting.

Asked if the epidemic could derail the G20's ambitions, Mr Hockey said: "Of course, there are always (such) events.

"But we need to be ambitious, we need to give people hope that tomorrow and the years beyond are going to be better than today."

THE president of the World Bank says the Ebola outbreak could be contained within months if immediate action is taken.

"THE progress even in the last few days has been tremendous, the US commitment has been very very helpful," Dr Kim said.

The deadly Ebola virus has hit more than 5300 people in West Africa, and killed more than 2,600 of them, according to the UN's World Health Organisation.

The US is sending 3000 military personnel to west Africa to combat the health crisis, and Dr Kim said the UN Secretary General had been handling the Ebola outbreak like it was an outbreak of war.

A medical doctor trained in treatment of infectious diseases, Dr Kim said he was confident the Ebola outbreak would be under control soon, despite an attitude that controlling the disease would be difficult.

"The focus must be on the implementation, getting people on board, and getting the equipment and drugs," he said.

The treatment of Ebola is simple, relying on rehydration and the use of electrolytes, Dr Kim said.

"The Ebola virus has never run to a modern first world healthcare system," he said.

"Our own sense is if you get those fundamental things in place, you can have a very high survival rate.

"It's not too complicated, you can do this using nurses and community health workers," he said.

A VIRAL THREAT WE MUST ATTACK

CLINICIANS FEAR THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE EBOLA PANDEMIC SWEEPING THROUGH WEST AFRICA IS TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, REPORTS JANELLE MILES

It’s believed to have started in a toddler living on the edge of the jungle in a remote West African village. Nine months after the little boy’s death, the world’s largest and worsening ebola virus outbreak is being dubbed a health crisis “spiralling completely outof control”.

Expert computer modelling by American scientists suggests the number of infections could eventually amount to hundreds of thousands of people without an effective international intervention.

That’s a huge jump from the latest World Health Organisation statistics showing confirmed and suspected cases not yet topping 5000 — including 2461 reported deaths.

It’s also a big leap from the WHO’s own projections suggesting the number of infections could reach 20,000 by mid-next year, a forecast criticised by some as too conservative. In the past three weeks alone, infections have almost doubled. The speed of the epidemic’s spread is so great, scientists have likened it to the medical equivalent of an out-of-control bushfire.

Dr Myrto Schaefer, of Medecins Sans Frontieres — a non-government organisation struggling to cope with the scale of the pandemic — tells The Saturday Telegraph: “Patients are dying in the streets from ebola. They’re banging on our doors and we cannot admit them because our health structures are completely overwhelmed. We’re building crematoria now for bodies because the bodies are just piling up.” University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay says cases are probably higher than the official WHO figures, given the location of the outbreak in one of the poorest regions on Earth, where some people may not get to a hospital to be counted. “Whether the numbers are two times or 10 times more — we really don’t know,” Associate Professor Mackay says. What Mackay is more certain about is the adequacy of the international response to what he describes as a potential humanitarian catastrophe.

“World governments have sat by idly for six months,” Mackay says. “The virus is spreading and killing people quickly and in vast numbers, unlike anything I’ve seen in my lifetime. It’s spreading … where there’s inadequate support to try to stop it.

“The reactions from governments internationally has been too slow.” Scientists suspect the outbreak’s so-called “Patient Zero” was a two-year-old boy from Meliandou, a village in the forest region of southeastern Guinea. The child died on December 6, possibly after contact with an infected fruit bat, believed to host the deadly virus. Within weeks, his mother, three-year-old sister and grandmother were also dead.

Mourners at his grandmother’s funeral are believed to have spread the virus outside the village and by March, when ebola was first recognised in the region, dozens had lost their lives. Suspected cases were also emerging in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, the contagion spreading from rural Africa into densely populated impoverished cities, such as the Liberian capital Monrovia, where it’s harder to contain.

On August 8, the WHO declared the West African outbreak a public health emergency of international concern as the caseload exceeded 1700 and deaths neared 1000. Five countries have recorded cases – Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.

Mackay says the region has one of the lowest ratios of healthcare professionals per capita in the world, ill-prepared for the unprecedented epidemic. Hundreds of health workers are among those who have been infected. “They’re under-resourced, they don’t have enough personal protective equipment — goggles, gloves, masks, gowns, boots — and they possibly don’t have enough training,” he says.

More than a dozen Australians have been working in the field as part of the response by the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres. But much more aid is needed. MSF Australia executive director Paul McPhun was clearly frustrated as he called on countries, including Australia, to do more after the Abbott government on Wednesday pledged $7 million, bringing its total contribution to $8 million.

“It is unacceptable that as a single, private NGO, MSF is providing the bulk of isolation units and beds,” McPhun says. “Our teams have been overwhelmed for some time now, and are forced to turn away patients that are highly infectious. What is needed is a massive increase in personnel, equipment and logistic support that MSF alone cannot supply. The response to ebola continues to fall dangerously behind and too many lives are being lost.” This week, US President Barack Obama announced the first large-scale American response to the crisis, committing his administration to sending 3000 military personnel into West Africa as part of moves to provide more treatment centres, field hospitals, personal protective equipment and training for local healthcare workers.

As the international response cranks up amid the unfolding disaster, Australian officials have moved to allay fears the ebola virus poses a risk locally — even in the unlikely event a case flies into the country.

Queensland’s communicable diseases unit senior director Sonya Bennett says the virus can only be spread through contact with the bodily secretions of an ebola patient, such as vomitand blood.

An infected person also has to be showing symptoms, such as a fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, to pass the virus on to others.

A NURSE who recovered from Ebola has travelled to the US to donate blood to an American patient fighting the disease.

WILLIAM Pooley caught Ebola while working in Sierra Leone and was flown back to London for treatment, where he recovered.

The American patient who received Pooley's blood wasn't identified.

Scientists think antibodies in the blood of people who have survived Ebola might help others infected with the disease.

The Foreign Office said on Thursday it arranged for Pooley to get an emergency passport. His original passport had been burned.

"This enabled him to fly out to the US immediately and potentially assist with the treatment of an Ebola victim," the office said in a statement.

Pooley's trip was paid for by the World Health Organization.

VICTORIA'S health department has launched a statewide plan aimed at containing Ebola, though officials say the risk is very low.

THE health department on Thursday launched the Victorian Ebola Virus Disease Response Plan, for health services and GPs.

It includes steps aimed at containing an outbreak of the deadly virus, such as isolating patients and equipping staff with protective gear.

Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said the plan was applicable to all health services and would safeguard patients and staff.

"The plan contains a simple set of steps frontline clinicians can take should a suspected case present at their service after returning from an affected country," she said.

The Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) is the designated facility for anyone thought to have contracted the disease, while children under 16 would be treated at the Royal Children's Hospital.

Health Minister David Davis said the plan was precautionary and the risk of Ebola reaching Victoria was very low, as the state had some of the best border protection in the world and there were few people returning from West Africa where the virus had spread.

"I hope we don't have to put the plan in action," he told reporters.

AN offer of millions of dollars by the federal government to help fight the deadly ebola virus in Africa has been rejec-ted by frontline medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres.

Australian executive director Paul McPhun told The Daily Telegraph he won’t ­accept the $2.5 million Prime Minister Tony Abbott offered.

Instead he wants Australia to send doctors to West Africa to help fight the spread of the killer disease.

“We have made clear we are not in a position to take the money,” Mr McPhun said. “We have been very clear with the government that we are not asking for financial support. We are asking the government to evaluate Australia’s emergency medical ­capacity and mobilise it on the ground in West Africa.” Last night, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the government had made the offer of the $2.5 million to the international arm of Medecins Sans Frontieres in Geneva and the head of that organisation, Joanne Liu, had accepted the offer.

“If the Australian arm won’t accept it we’ll donate it to other organisations fighting ebola,” she said.

Ms Bishop said the national security committee of cabinet had considered the option of sending Australian troops and doctors to West Africa to help control ebola.

However, she said the government had been advised it would be impossible to evacuate any Australians who contracted the virus back to Australia in time for treatment.

“It would be negligent of the government to go against that advice,” she said. The Australian Medical Ass-ociation is calling for Australia to send troops to West Africa, as well as medical personnel.

Mr Abbott had promised to give $7 million to help fight the ebola threat: $2.5 million for Medecins Sans Frontieres (“doctors without borders”), $2.5 million for the World Health Organisation (WHO) and $2 million for the UK to support their delivery of medical services in Sierra Leone.

The US yesterday committed 3000 troops to West Africa to build up to 17 field hospitals with 100 beds in each.The number of ebola cases is approaching 5000, and ­almost 3000 people have ­already died from the virus.

ISOLATED IN THEIR CAVES, OUR PREHISTORIC ANCESTORS WERE SAFE FROM PLAGUE

US President Barack Obama has said that “a truly global response” is needed to counter the ebola outbreak in West Africa. He has outlined a plan that involves sending more medical experts to the region, along with training first responders, setting up more hospitals, laboratories and other necessary facilities.

“The world knows how to fight this disease. It’s not a mystery. We know the science,” he said.

His statement was in stark contrast to past eras when our response to epidemics and pandemics was limited by our scientific knowledge or our technology.

Although disease visited prehistoric humans, widespread outbreaks were probably controlled by the fact people lived in scattered tribes, communities and villages.

The first big epidemics began when people started living in larger towns and cities and began travelling long distances, for trade or during times of war.

Some of the earliest known epidemics were among societies living in the Fertile Crescent, from the Nile Valley in Egypt across Phoenicia (today Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria) around to Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq).

During war between the Hittites and the Egyptians in 1350BC, Egyptian prisoners spread smallpox to their captors.

The Egyptians had been troubled by the disease for thousands of years, dealing with outbreaks using medicines to treat the symptoms along with making offerings to the lion-headed goddess Sekhmet, who was thought to bring the disease when she was displeased. The Egyptians had developed a level of immunity, but the Hittites were unprepared. Their nation was ravaged by the disease, enabling the Egyptians to defeat them. The Egyptians then made offerings to Sekhmet to try to contain the epidemic.

It was not be until the 11th century that the first successful experiments with inoculation against smallpox were made and not until the 17th century that isolating sufferers became a standard response to outbreaks, although patients were still being bled by doctors looking to cure the illness.

Systematic wide vaccination of populations, based on the work of Edward Jenner in the late-18th century, eradicated the disease ­except for samples in laboratories.

In AD250 to 270, the ancient Romans were struck by outbreaks later known as the “Plague of ­Cyprian”, named after St Cyprian, a cleric who witnessed the plague.

The disease killed thousands a day at its peak. Bodies were burned in mass crematoriums and the sites, some of them traditional burial complexes, were abandoned.

Religious leaders predicted the end of the world, offering prayer as a means of salvation. The stoicism of some Christian priests in the face of the disease won converts who ­attributed their survival to divine intervention. The epidemic eventually burned itself out but Emperor Claudius II, after defeating the Goths in battle, declined to invade their country and crush them completely because they were already stricken with plague and he feared spreading it to his army. The disease killed him anyway in 270.

Epidemics and pandemics that wiped out millions across Europe from medieval times until the 20th century drew all kinds of responses.

During outbreaks of the black death in the 14th century, wealthy people would leave town and live in the country until the disease aba-ted in the city. The Decameron, by Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio, is set during an outbreak of the plague and describes the stories told by people escaping the diseased city of Florence.

While the wealthy were out of town fires were lit in the streets to drive away the “miasma” or foul air thought to carry the disease. Victims’ belongings were burnt and bodies buried in lime pits. Ships carrying diseased passengers or crew were made to wait 40 days ­before disembarking at a harbour. The word quarantine comes from the Italian word for 40.

For centuries plague doctors were hired by towns to treat sufferers. The plague doctor wore a distinctive beaked mask, the nose of which was packed with aromatic herbs that drove away the miasma.

French mystic Nostradamus served as a plague doctor successfully treating many sufferers. His advice for avoiding infection ­included drinking only boiled water, sleeping on clean bed linen and leaving town.

In the 19th century as germ theory became more widely accepted, the practice of isolating patients became standard, as did sanitary measures like cleaning up sewers.

When rats were blamed for spreading bubonic plague, ratcatchers became frontline troops. In Sydney in 1900 mountains of rats were trapped and the slums were demolished.troy.lennon@news.com.au

Fourth doctor dies of Ebola in S Leone

SIERRA Leone has lost a fourth doctor to Ebola after a failed effort to transfer her abroad for medical treatment, a government official says.

DR Olivet Buck died late Saturday, hours after the World Health Organization said it could not help medically evacuate her to Germany, Chief Medical Officer Dr Brima Kargbo confirmed to The Associated Press.

Sierra Leone had requested funds from WHO to transport Buck to Europe, saying the country could not afford to lose another doctor.

WHO had said it could not meet the request but instead would work to give Buck "the best care possible" in Sierra Leone, including possible access to experimental drugs.

Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick patients, making doctors and nurses especially vulnerable to contracting the virus that has no vaccine or approved treatment.

More than 300 health workers have become infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nearly half of them have died, according to WHO.

The infections have exacerbated shortages of doctors and nurses in West African countries that were already low on skilled health personnel.

So far, only foreign health and aid workers have been evacuated abroad from Sierra Leone and Liberia for treatment.

Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor, was being considered for evacuation to a European country when he died of the disease in late July.

SAY GOODBYE TO FROZEN YOGHURT, CAT VIDEOS AND CLOWNS - ARMAGEDDON IS A REAL DOWNER

If you've read the newspaper lately (I have a hunch you recently bought one or are near one), you'll know it's not exactly overflowing with good news on a global scale. In the past week, I've counted seven stories that have predicted the downfall of humanity: unsurvivable drought and floods; Earth getting peppered by a celestial object so small anywhere else in the galaxy that you'd hardly notice it, but big enough to wipe out life on our planet; bacteria becoming so nonchalant towards antibiotics, due to our propensity to eat them like Skittles, that a grazed knee will soon be a death sentence; Ebola going on a world tour; a supervolcano in America blocking out the sun for a few cheeky decades; India and Pakistan using but one-tenth of their nuclear arsenal on each other and blowing Earth into pieces in the process; the Bachelor not finding love and everyone dying of sadness.

If you read enough of these stories, you'd be forgiven for thinking that, with the variety of ways the news can find to tell us our time is nigh, one of them will almost certainly happen by mid-November.

So, what better way to spend your Sunday than by soaking up some of the things we take for granted now that will be dramatically harder once 90 per cent of the world's population is obliterated and the rest of us have to compete with each other in a grim struggle to survive?

Top six things that will be harder in December, after the almost-certain apocalypse:

1. Brunch As food stores rapidly deplete, and rats and insects become serious sources of protein, lightly charred brioche toast with whipped pistachio ricotta and a drizzle of bark honey from the cafe's rooftop hive will be something we don't see around any more. Ditto barista competitions and frozen yoghurt.

2. Spin classes With no fuel or transport to the gym, no feasible way to wash Lycra and nowhere to plug in the big stereo, it's highly unlikely that your Tuesday and Thursday spin classes will still be on. Even if you stumble through the burnt-out streets to the husk of your old gym, and see on yellowed paper flapping on the notice board that they are still scheduled, it's probably because once the apocalypse hit, Stephanie (your instructor) never came back to take down the class list because she was hiding in her attic, protecting her last tin of four-bean mix.

3. The circus Circuses will also almost certainly be indefinitely postponed.

4. Enjoying cat videos If we survive, chances are cats will, too, and they'll keep doing zany and adorable things. But the bad news is, there will no longer be any way to film their antics. And even if we do, no internet on which to share the footage. It's probably this fact that really slams home just how un-fun the apocalypse will be.

5. Seeing new movies It won't just be internet videos that suffer, but all cinema. You may be lucky to make it to one of the swanky bunkers that has electricity, for a weekly movie night, but you'll just work through the bunker owner's back catalogue. Sadly, the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film may be one of the last pieces of cinema ever made by our otherwise very impressive species.

6. Keeping up with the Kardashians I'm sure the Kardashians will do their best to keep their army of publicists on for the first few weeks post The End of the World just to show off how banging Kim's designer fallout suit is. But with no one to buy or print the photos, they will collapse in a funk and moan that armageddon "totally sucks for my career", and in that moment of despair (for themselves, not the human race) they will forget to lock the bunker door and a radioactive wolf will nip in and quickly devour them. So, it's not going to be all bad. [Ed's note: Obviously Hamish doesn't agree with my decision to put Kim on the cover this week. If you do - or even if you don't - turn to page 18 to katch up ... ]

Cuba sends doctors to fight Ebola

CUBA is sending more than 160 health workers to Sierra Leone to help fight the Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands in West Africa.

IT will provide a much-needed injection of medical expertise in a country where health workers are in short supply.

World Health Organisation chief Dr Margaret Chan said on Friday the agency was extremely grateful for the help.

"If we are going to go to war with Ebola, we need the resources to fight," she said.

"This will make a significant difference in Sierra Leone."

While millions of dollars have already been pledged and countries including Britain and the US have volunteered to build treatment centres, Chan said "human resources are most important", noting a crucial need for experienced doctors and nurses across the region.

"There is not a single bed available for an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia," she said, adding that a further 1500 health workers are desperately needed in West Africa.

Dr Roberto Morales Ojeda, Cuba's health minister, called on other countries to help.

Ebola is believed to have killed more than 2200 people in West Africa, the biggest-ever outbreak of the lethal virus. So far, the death rate is about 50 per cent.

Doctors and nurses are at high risk of catching Ebola, which is spread via the exchange of bodily fluids.

Cuba will be sending experienced doctors, nurses and other scientists to Sierra Leone in early October. They will stay for six months.

Since the 1959 Cuban revolution, the country has dispatched thousands of doctors worldwide to work on issues ranging from maternal health to cataracts.

Cuba's program has been praised for improving healthcare in countries short on doctors, but also criticised for underpaying the physicians by funnelling too much of the compensation for the program to Cuban state coffers.

QUEENSLAND health authorities will review their handling of a suspected Ebola case on the Gold Coast, but say it's unlikely Australia would be hit.

QUEENSLAND Health will review the handling of a suspected Ebola case on the Gold Coast on Thursday, after a 27-year-old man complained of vague Ebola-like symptoms.

The man spent most of the day in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital and triggered infectious disease protocols, before blood tests returned a negative result for Ebola in the evening.

"There's no doubt that we handled it very well," Queensland's chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young said.

"We'll be reviewing what happened, we're going through a process early next week to bring all the people involved together."

Dr Young was adamant Australia wouldn't be seeing an Ebola outbreak.

"I think we're definitely prepared should someone with Ebola come into our country."

More than 2200 people have been killed by the disease in the west African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.

But Dr Young said Australia was not in possession of any experimental drugs that have been used to treat the disease.

"I understand that they've used all of ZMapp, one experimental drug they did have, and they're making more stocks of that, which should be available in around three months time," she said.

There were also other experimental treatments available, Dr Young said.

"Australia doesn't have any because we've not had any cases of Ebola, and we think it's unlikely that we will have."

AN Australian working as a miner in the Congo sparked a nationwide ebola scare yesterday when he was hospitalised with symptoms of the deadly virus, which is rampant in several African countries.

Gold Coast man Michael Walsh was last night cleared of having the deadly disease, but the scare put Queensland health authorities on high alert and led to a sense of panic and fear across the nation.

Mr Walsh became ill several days ago after his return from the Congo, where he has been working as a miner. At least 13 people from the Congo have died from ebola in this latest outbreak of the disease, which has claimed 2300 lives so far.

Mr Walsh was rushed to hospital yesterday morning by paramedics wearing protective suits and placed in an air-locked isolation unit after complaining of feeling unwell at Southport watch-house, where he was being held on trespass charges.î Full story page 9

THEY weren’t in the suffocating body suits with full-face coverings worn by ebola health workers in Africa — but Gold Coast medical staff were still not taking any chances.

In the first public display of the country’s ebola-readiness, the workers were well equipped with overalls, gloves, goggles and masks.

Dr Grant Hill-Cawthorne said they were not normal surgical masks but contained respirators to filter particles.

“You don’t actually need to wear the full suits that we have seen in some of the pictures from overseas. It depends on what they are doing,” Dr Hill-Cawthorne, from the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity at Sydney University said.He said health workers in Africa were dealing with patients in severe stages of ebola who were vomiting, sweating, bleeding and had diarrhoea, all body fluids that can transmit the virus.

Fly-in Gold Coast miner sparks ebola panic after work trip to the Congo THE result was negative but Australia’s first ebola scare exposed a serious risk of the contagion spreading to our shores via fly-in, fly-out miners­ returning from Africa.

Authorities last night cleared Gold Coast man Michael­ Walsh of the deadly disease, days after he ­succumbed to illness on his return from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he works as a miner.

Thirteen people from the troubled African nation have died from ebola in this latest outbreak of the disease that has so far claimed 2300 lives.

Mr Walsh, 27, was rushed to hospital yesterday morning and placed in isolation after complaining of feeling unwell while at Southport police watch-house, after he was arrested­ for trespassing at a Surfers Paradise high-rise.

He had arrived back in Australia on August 27, one of hundreds of FIFOs working for more than 200 Australian mining companies in Africa.

Chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young called for calm after reports of people cancelling Queensland holidays, checking out of Gold Coast hotels early and even pulling children out of school.

Australia-Africa Mining Industry Group chairman Bill Turner said there was a risk of ebola spreading to Australia through the workers.

“There are a lot of risks in Africa and infectious diseases is one of them,” he said.

Global health expert Dr David Heymann told the Africa Down Under mining conference in Perth this week that ebola and other infectious diseases posed a serious threat to miners. The federal health department said ­airports around Australia were on alert for ebola cases.

“The government has measures in place to assist with the identification and ­assessment of passengers who may be arriving into Australia from affected countries,” a spokeswoman said.

Dr Young said Mr Walsh did not have a fever, one of the first symptoms of the disease, which is transmitted by exposure to bodily fluids.

“So there is absolutely no need for people to panic for any reason,” she said.Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton said the actions on the Gold Coast showed Australia was well-prepared to deal with ebola.

A MAN who sparked an Ebola-virus scare on the Gold Coast has been cleared of the deadly disease.

A 27-YEAR-OLD man triggered contagious disease protocols and a "widespread" reaction from the community after complaining of vague Ebola-like symptoms in the Southport watch house on Thursday morning.

The man, named by News Corp Australia as Michael Walsh, had informed authorities that he'd returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa in late August.

He worked as a miner, but the department was unable to detail his exact travel route.

The incubation period for Ebola is between two and 21 days.

An outbreak of the fatal virus in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria has killed more than 2200 people.

Mr Walsh had spent four hours in custody after being arrested for trespassing at Surfers Paradise.

He spent most of Thursday in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital before blood tests returned a negative result for Ebola virus in the evening.

Health officials, including the hospital's director of infectious diseases, Dr John Gerrard, sought to reassure the public before the results.

He had maintained that the chance of the patient having contracted Ebola was extremely low.

"The patient was managed in a textbook fashion and I think it's a great credit to our staff as well as the ambulance officers in the way that they dealt with this patient," Dr Gerrard told reporters outside the hospital.

The Ebola virus was very difficult to transmit because it was not airborne, Queensland's chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said.

"You need to have exposure to secretions from someone - vomit, diarrhoea, sweat," she said.

"That of course has not occurred with this person, as he's not had symptoms resulting in producing secretions."

Dr Young said it would be up to the treating team on the Gold Coast to determine the man's treatment options based on his condition.

She insisted Queensland remains prepared for an outbreak of Ebola virus, should a case ever make its way into the state.

But she said fewer than 50 people return from west Africa to Queensland each week and the risk was low.

Precautionary measures were also in place at airports, Dr Young said.

"Specifically for people who've started their journey in west Africa, they're pulled aside and asked some specific questions."

Federal health minister Peter Dutton agreed the incident showed emergency services personnel in hospitals are well trained and equipped to deal with any future case.

"I want to assure the Australian public that while the threat to Australia is low, we have contingencies in place and response plans in each of the states and territories."

A MOBILE laboratory and methods to fight Ebola have been recognised as among the best of Australian science innovation at the Eureka Prizes.

SYDNEYSIDERS Tri Phan and Steve Lee won the Innovative Use of Technology prize in Sydney at the Eureka Prizes for creating a plastic droplet that can be hooked into smartphones to create a cheap high-powered microscope.

"I think where this will have a lot of potential is in the delivery of medicine to remote and rural communities," said Dr Phan before the awards.

"If someone has a suspect-looking mole you could get them to take a magnified image on the phone and send it to a specialist thousands of kilometres away and they could receive a diagnosis.

"There are so many possibilities for a portable microscope that's cheap but really high-powered ... we're looking to get a model out on the market in six months."

Dr Phan projects the technology will be available in six months.

In creating the first vaccine against the Hendra virus, a CSIRO unit in Victoria developed methods that are being used in the ongoing battle against Ebola.

The Eureka Prizes are presented annually by the Australian Museum and recognise outstanding contributions to the industry across the fields of research, innovation, leadership and communication.

In the 25th year of the awards, scientists from universities, private research institutions and even schools have been rewarded from the $150,000 prize pool.

Australian Museum chief executive Kim McKay said the awards showed the brilliance of the nation's scientists.

"An optical plastic droplet that costs a cent to make and that can be used by anyone who has a smartphone - it's an excellent example of how clever research is making people's lives better and the technology accessible," she said.

Other winning inventions included water-efficient grain farming methods and life buoys for helicopter crashes at sea.

Ms McKay says she expects the prize money to fund future inventions.

"We provide the money as an incentive because unlike you or me, we know scientists will re-invest that money and use it for more research and more innovation," she said.

THE WHO says the Ebola death toll has risen to 2296 out of 4293 cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.

THE World Health Organisation (WHO), which raised the death toll to nearly 2300, has predicted an "exponential increase" in infection across west Africa, and warned that Liberia in particular will face thousands of new cases in the coming weeks.

"We are overwhelmed. The patients keep coming in (huge) numbers. Yesterday we received up to 30 patients," Sophie Jane, a spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, MSF), said at the aid agency's Ebola unit in Monrovia.

The WHO upped the death toll on Tuesday to 2296 out of 4293 cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. Nearly half of all infections had come in the past 21 days, it said.

Liberia, with 1200 dead, has borne the brunt of the outbreak, and has run perilously short of space at the few Ebola treatment sites operating.

The WHO said Montserrado county, which contains Monrovia, needed 1000 beds. It reported that infected people were being driven to centres in the capital only to be turned away, return home and create "flare-ups" of deadly fever in their villages.

Bystanders watched warily on Wednesday as a man turned away by the MSF centre in Monrovia struggled to stay on his feet.

"I came but they say they have no space. I have strong headache and I have fever. I am trying to get back home," the man said.

Residents interviewed by AFP described an atmosphere of fear paralysing daily life in the Liberian capital.

"I am afraid. I don't know what to do now actually. Where are we going? Are we all going to die? If WHO can say this kind of thing it means we are finished," said Monrovia resident Kluboh Johnson, 45.

Meanwhile businesses said trade was drying up as people stayed indoors, afraid of infection.

"A few people will come and take one or two bottles of beer, but custom is no longer like before. They are afraid to come out because of Ebola," the owner of one bar said.

"I am afraid myself. One man came here last night and started to drink abundantly. When I asked him what was wrong, he asked me if I did not hear that thousands of people are going to get Ebola in the coming weeks."

Liberian Defence Minister Brownie Samukai told a meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the country was facing "a serious threat to its national existence".

The disease is "now spreading like wildfire, devouring everything in its path", he said.

The WHO has evacuated its second infected medical expert, a doctor who had been working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

Emory University Hospital in the US admitted an American on Tuesday who had contracted the disease in west Africa, but declined to confirm whether the patient was the WHO employee.

The agency's head of epidemiology, Sylvie Briand, said in Geneva on Tuesday that the immediate realistic goal for Liberia was to slow rather than stop the spread of Ebola.

But in Senegal and Nigeria, the aim was "to stop transmission completely", she added.

Nigeria has recorded 19 infections and eight deaths, but the news was better in Senegal, where authorities said on Wednesday a Guinean student who was the country's only confirmed case had recovered.

Harvard's health school to get $US350m

HARVARD University's School of Public Health has been bequeathed a record $US350 million by the estate of TH Chan, a Hong Kong real estate developer.

THE donation, to be formally announced on Monday, comes from a philanthropic foundation established by the family of TH Chan, a Hong Kong real estate developer who died in 1986.

In a rarity for Harvard, the school will be renamed the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. The only other school within the university to bear an individual's name is the Harvard Kennedy School, named for John F Kennedy.

"I think he would have been very pleased ... that the school would be part of his legacy," said Dr Gerald Chan, describing his father as a staunch supporter of education who often helped family friends pay for schooling or study abroad.

"It was very much in keeping with how he lived his life and what he held to be important," said Chan, who earned his own master's degree from the public health school in 1979.

Julio Frenk, the school's dean, called the $US350 million endowment from The Morningside Foundation a "transformational gift", one that will help students and faculty working to stop pandemics such as Ebola and malaria, cancer and obesity, and address global health threats stemming from war, poverty, environmental hazards, and failing health care systems.

"We can apply it to the priorities of the moment and those priorities that are likely to evolve because public health is a very dynamic field," said Frenk.

A researcher was already involved in trying to trace the origin of the current Ebola outbreak in western Africa, he said, while another was examining how mobile technology can be used to track Ebola patients.

SIERRA Leone says it will confine people to their homes in a nationwide three-day shutdown this month aimed at containing the ebola epidemic threatening west Africa.

Pedestrians and vehicles will be barred from the country’s streets, except on essential business, for 72 hours, starting from September 19.

“This will be strictly adhered to without exception,” government spokesman Abdulai Bayratay said. “We intend to ensure that the dreaded disease is checked.” The worst outbreak of ebola has claimed 491 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three countries at the epicentre of the epidemic that has so far killed more than 2000.Authorities in Freetown will use the three-day window to search for patients who have not come forward for treatment centres.

Tony stays calm, despite losing it now and Zen

ZEN master is not the usual epithet applied to Tony ­Abbott, a man who inspired a social media campaign trumpeting that ebola was more popular than his government.

“Danger, currently operated by morons” was the sign stamped over a map of Australia on Facebook.

“I Can’t Believe It’s Not ­Hitler!” was another Photoshopped image of the Prime Minister, on a tub of butter.

Black Death and empty toothpaste tubes were among the suggested items that were more popular, according to his Twitter lynch mob.

Galaxy pollster David Briggs took a more scientific approach, polling voters’ reaction to Treasurer Joe Hockey’s first budget. The proportion of voters who believed they were worse off was the highest he had ever encountered. “It is a worse result than we have seen in any Howard and Costello budget or Rudd and Swan budget,” Briggs concluded.

But, as he marks the first­ ­anniversary of his election as Prime Minister today, this is the surprising truth of meeting Abbott in the flesh. Even-­tempered, an oasis of calm, he is Zen-like at all times during the interview.

“Zen? Me? Why shouldn’t I be Zen?” Abbott asks. “Do I ever get cranky?” The Prime Minister looks over towards his communications chief for her thoughts. “Stern,” she suggests. Abbott explodes into laughter. “No worries, no worries,” he says to conclude the interview.

His pledge to preside over a no-surprises, no-excuses government has been broken.

Surprises have included the GP fee, the deficit levy to ­increase taxes on high-income earners and his indulgent decision to reintroduce knights and dames in Australia.

But there were more signs last week that the Abbott government is turning a corner, including striking a deal with Clive Palmer to abolish the mining tax that will simply apply a sunset clause on many of the spending measures linked to the tax, including the Schoolkids Bonus.

By delaying the increase in compulsory superannuation, the government risks a backlash from unions but will ­recoup the cost of the deal by delaying employers’ mandated super increases. Since super is taxed at a concessional rate, the decision to delay the ­increase in the super guarantee to 12 per cent means more tax revenue when workers get pay rises over the next decade.

Over coming months, Australia’s deepening involvement in Iraq will dominate the headlines and in the process likely transform some of the ideas Australians have about Tony Abbott as Prime Minister.

After demonstrating an ­independent streak on foreign affairs, the PM is convinced of the need to take international action on the jihadist “death cult”. “I think, like every Australian, I was absolutely ­appalled by the procession of hideous, hideous imagery which these people exalt in,” Abbott says.

“They don’t do their evil in secret. They put it all up on the internet for everyone to see.

“These people exalt in evil in a way that not even the Nazis did.” Comparing the IS terrorists with Nazis will likely outrage his critics. But he agrees there is a double standard at play in the Left, which talks up the ­humanitarian responsibility of Australia regarding asylum seekers, yet is opposed to intervention in Iraq.

“The Left has a tendency to have double standards here … there is a tendency of the Left to basically be against anything that a right-of-centre government does,” he says.

“And obviously we are a right-of-centre government, but the important thing is not to run a commentary … (it is) to do the right thing and that is what we are well and truly doing in Iraq.” In the year ahead, the bread-and-butter issues the Prime Minister will tackle is laying the groundwork for personal tax cuts and childcare ­reform. The two issues are likely to emerge as major battlegrounds of the 2016 election.

“Obviously this will depend upon the circumstances in which we find ourselves, but we very much would like to ­deliver lower personal taxes,” Abbott says.

“But the only responsible way to lower personal taxes is if we get public spending under good control, and that’s what the budget’s all about.” On penalty rates, the PM is determined to resist a concerted push to take direct legislative action in this term.

“It is certainly a fact that some businesses that would like to (remain) open (are) no longer open because of penalty rates. Now penalty rates are a matter for the Fair Work Commission and that’s as it should be,” he says.

The civil war over his paid parental leave scheme inside the government will reach its zenith in the months ahead.“It’s a policy which I am ­determined to see implemented. But I accept, like everything else, it’s got to go through the Senate,” he admits.

MONROVIA residents say Ebola patients were refused entry to an overcrowded isolation centre and left lying on the street.

SIX Ebola patients had been dropped off by government ambulances and taxis in front of a quarantine centre in Monrovia's Paynesville neighbourhood.

But when the centre did not have capacity to admit them, they were left lying on the street, residents said.

Some patients were vomiting and urinating, according to witnesses.

"I spotted them through the window. I came outside (and) when they tried come near me, I ran away," resident Betty Zamay was quoted as saying.

Community leader Anthony Kpahn said Paynesville residents were living in fear and called on the Liberian government to address the issue.

Health workers eventually arrived to disinfect the area.

Liberia is the country most affected by the Ebola outbreak, reporting more than 200 cases a week for the past three weeks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The country has a severe lack of health workers, equipment and facilities to treat patients.

The number of deaths from the Ebola epidemic has now surpassed 2100 in West Africa, the organisation said.

In addition to 2097 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, eight people died in Nigeria, where the outbreak is limited.

The WHO has counted 3944 suspected and confirmed cases in the hardest-hit countries, 23 in Nigeria and one in Senegal.

Ebola hospital escape

AN ebola-infected man has terrified a marketplace full of shoppers after he escaped from hospital isolation in the Liberian capital.

Dramatic video has emerged of a man ill with the disease escaping from hospital quarantine in search of food.

In the video he is quickly surrounded by medical workers in full protective clothing who bundle him into a van as a crowd watches.

The video comes as another US doctor contracted the ebola virus while working at a hospital in Liberia.

Missionary group Serving In Mission (SIM) said the doctor had been treating women in the obstetrics ward of a hospital in the capital.

Last month two Americans, including one from SIM, were evacuated to the US for treatment after contracting ebola in Liberia.

The two received an experimental drug known as ZMapp and recovered. The manufacturer says it has run out of supplies and it will take months to produce more.

Meanwhile, medical agency Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) says the world was “losing the battle” to contain ebola and has called for a global biological disaster response to get aid to west Africa.

“Six months into the worst ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it. Leaders are failing to come to grips with this transnational threat,” MSF international president Dr Joanne Liu told a UN briefing in New York.

“The (World Health Organisation) announcement on August 8 that the epidemic constituted a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ has not led to decisive action, and states have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction.” Dr Liu called for the international community to fund more beds for a regional network of field hospitals, dispatch trained personnel and deploy mobile laboratories across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.A separate outbreak of the ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 31 people but the epidemic remained contained in a remote north-western region, the UN health agency said.

WASHINGTON THE first human trials of an ebola vaccine will start next week in the United States, as the World Health Organisation warns the number of cases could exceed 20,000 before the outbreak is stemmed.

There is no vaccine on the market against ebola, and global attempts to get one ready are being fast-tracked as West Africa struggles with an accelerating outbreak of the haemorrhagic virus.

The first US phase 1 trial has ­enrolled three volunteers so far, and begins next week at the National ­Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

It involves a product made by Glaxo Smith Kline and US government scientists, and is being referred to as the NIAID/GSK ebola vaccine candidate.

“We have the green light to begin,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, yesterday. “The launch of phase 1 ebola vaccine studies is a first step in developing a vaccine that could be licensed and used in the field to protect front-line health care workers as well as those living in areas where ebola virus exists.”The study will focus first on the safety of the vaccine against two strains — Sudan ebola and the type currently spreading in Africa, known as Zaire ebola. Trials have shown it works “extremely well” in preventing ebola infection in primates.

A deadly epidemic sweeping through Africa, hordes of marauding savages mauling their way through the Middle East, the spiritual capital of the world imploding, and Clive Palmer describing his bowel movements.

Surely anyone looking for a sign that the end of the world is nigh should be satisfied by now.

Yet still among us there ­appears to be some confusion as to whether there is a problem and, if so, what the problem actually is.

And so, in perhaps my greatest service to society to date, I have prepared this handy ready-reckoner of the burning issues in the West today so that everyone can determine once and for all what does and does not constitute a problem — and thus sleep easier at night knowing precisely what to worry about.

THE Ebola outbreak in West Africa could eventually exceed 20,000 cases, more than six times the current level, the World Health Organisation says. A new study by the UN health agency also assumes that in many hard-hit areas the actual number of cases may be two to four times higher than is currently reported. New figures show 1,552 people have now died from the Ebola virus from 3,069 cases reported so far.

MONROVIA A LIBERIAN doctor treated with the experimental American anti-ebola serum ZMapp has died.

Dr Abraham Borbor had been improving but died on Sunday night, Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said yesterday.

“He was showing signs of progress but he finally died. The government regrets this loss and extends its condolences to the bereaved family,” Mr Brown said.

Two other health workers receiving the serum are still in treatment, the minister said, adding that there were “signs of hope”.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said there had been a “significant improvement” in the condition of a doctor and nurse being treated with ZMapp in Liberia, and that another doctor was ­getting better.

Liberia took delivery of ZMapp on August 13 and gave the serum to two US ­citizens who were declared cured last week. The Americans were ­infected in Liberia along with a Spanish priest who died on ­August 12, despite also receiving ZMapp.

The very small available stocks of ZMapp, which has never been through clinical trials on humans, have now been used up, according to the lab that produces it.

WHO has been ­discussing the use of unapproved drugs as a way of getting a handle on an outbreak in Africa that has ­already cost more than 1400 lives. There is presently no ­available cure or vaccine for ebola, but several drugs are under development.It was revealed in Tokyo on Monday that a Japanese company was ready to release an experimental drug it had ­developed to help stem the global tide of ebola.
