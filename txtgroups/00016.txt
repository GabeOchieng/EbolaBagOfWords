EXCITED by high grade results from its now completed 16,000m drill programme at the Yanfolila gold Project, which was recently acquired from Gold Fields, buyers chased Hummingbird Resources 0.5p higher to 40p. The company also points out that the only case of the ebola virus to date in Mali, which was reported last week, is located 800km from the project. Broker Cantor has a target price of 115p.

LIBYA STRIFE HITS GROWTH AT APR; MARKET REPORT

LIBYA'S troubles have cast a shadow over power rental firm APR Energy, which warned that its earnings and revenue growth are set to slow as customers become increasingly hesitant about spending on big projects.

The cautious outlook statement came as the group, whose business mainly involves renting out turbines and generators, reported a 45pc jump in its third quarter revenues driven by higher fleet capacity.

But among the problems going forward, APR highlighted the fact that the 'underlying structural electricity deficit in Libya only grows more acute'.

In reaction to the uncertain outlook, analysts at Liberum Capital cut their earnings forecasts for APR by 10pc for 2014 and by 17pc for 2015, reiterating a sell rating on the stock with a price target of 385p.

APR's shares hit a lifetime low at 342p in the wake of the profit warning, before recovering to nurse losses of 6.5pc or 26p at 370p.

APR's warning also had repercussions for the top flight, with blue chip temporary power firm Aggreko a big faller, dropping 37p to 1499p.

The overall mood was dull for the FTSE 100, which closed 25.27 points lower at 6363.46, although an early rally by US blue chips helped the index cut its losses. The UK benchmark index had reversed opening gains in tandem with European stock markets after a weak German business confidence survey countered some mainly reassuring eurozone bank stress test results.

Lloyds Banking Group was a big FTSE 100 faller, however, losing 1.38p to 75.34p after it only passed the EU authorities tests by a relatively low margin.

Broker Jefferies downgraded its rating for Lloyds to underperform from hold saying that while it likes the bank and its prospects, the risk/reward balance on the shares is 'now skewed to the downside'.

The broker reckons that the part-taxpayer owned lender is now 'at risk' ahead of the forthcoming stress tests by the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority, the results of which are due on December 16.

Lloyds investors were also nervous ahead of a trading update due today, which is expected to see it unveil big job cuts.

Fellow lenders Barclays and RBS were weak too, down 4.5p at 221.85p and 5p at 359.2p respectively, with both also due to issue third quarter updates this week.

And caution ahead of trading news due tomorrow weighed on clothing firm Next, off 90p at 6410p, with the group having already warned last month that the mild Autumn had impacted its sales.

But not all was doom and gloom as travel stocks bounced back thanks to the falling price of oil and reduced concerns over ebola after scares last week.

InterContinental Hotels added 51p to 2268p and TUI Travel took on 9.1p to 374.7p.

On the second line, electronics firm Renishaw was a top performer, adding 76p to 1666p after it said it expects the revenue growth trend it experienced in the first quarter to continue through the second half of its financial year, extending the guidance it gave for the second quarter. The brief announcement comes less than two weeks after Renishaw delivered an interim management statement which revealed a 28pc rise in first quarter revenues. The FTSE 250 index, however, followed the blue chips lower, ending down 49.16 points at 15,040.39.

Ophir Energy was the worst performer, shedding 12.7p at 190p on worries that it could be drawn into a bid battle for small cap oil explorer Salamander Energy. Salamander shares jumped 13.25p to 93.5p after confirming press speculation that it has received a conditional takeover proposal from Ophir, as well as another approach from a consortium led by Spanish oil giant CEPSA.

Among other small cap gainers, Totally jumped 35pc or 0.15p higher to 0.5p on news it has been awarded a contract by NHS Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees to handle clinical health coaching programmes. The initial 12-month contract is expected to be worth around £125,000 to Totally's Health subsidiary as it extends its services into a new region.

Africa-focused Ncondezi Energy was also in demand, up 9pc or 0.5p to 6.12p after it signed a deal with a major Chinese generation firm to develop a 300MW power plant that will be fed by the UK-listed group's Mozambique coal project.

And Canada-based Rambler Metals and Mining added 0.5p to 25.75p after the Newfoundland and Labrador focused firm reported full-year 2014 results which exceeded production guidance in many categories, notably with gold output 26pc higher and silver up 35pc.

HEALTH OFFICIALS' £1M TOBACCO BASH

THE World Health Organisation spent £1million on a tobacco conference hosted by Vladimir Putin - while having to beg for funding to tackle the ebola crisis.

Guests dined on caviar and drank champagne during a week-long event in Moscow, discussing tobacco control and e-cigarettes.

The conference for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was attended by delegates from 175 countries.

But it was boycotted by the US and Canada, who withdrew after hearing that the Russian president would be hosting.

The news comes after Doctors Without Borders criticised the WHO earlier this month for its handling of the ebola outbreak in West Africa - particularly its lack of action on the ground. When the WHO began working with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three worst affected states - it was forced to plead for funding from the World Bank.

Mariano Lugli, deputy director of operations for Doctors Without Borders in Switzerland, who treated Ebola victims in Guinea, said he saw no sign of WHO officials during any meetings on tackling the crisis.

'The coordination role that WHO should be playing, we just didn't see it. I didn't see it the first three weeks and we didn't see it afterwards,' he said.

After news of the conference emerged yesterday, Tory MP Philip Davies told the Sunday Express: 'It's quite worrying that, when we have an emerging Ebola crisis in the world WHO sees fit to waste money discussing tobacco controls.'

?Websites and bars have been accused of cashing in on the ebola crisis by selling hazmat suit Halloween costumes and hosting events themed around the deadly virus.

One costume for women which is available online - described as a 'sexy ebola nurse' outfit - features a face shield, goggles and gloves.

Meanwhile The Scotch of St James, a music venue in London, was criticised for planning a Halloween event called Saturday Night Ebola Fever.

The club said the night would be used to raise money for ebola victims.

FURY AS BBC LETS BRAND SUGGEST 9/11 WAS US PLOT
BY ARTHUR MARTIN

THE BBC came under fire last night for giving Russell Brand a platform on Newsnight to say the US government may have been behind the 9/11 terror attacks.

The controversial comedian was given a 17-minute slot on the flagship current affairs programme to promote his new book and his absurd conspiracy theories.

Bosses on the show devoted seven more minutes to Brand's bizarre musings than to the coverage of the deadly spread of Ebola across Western Africa. The interview - which took up more than a third of the entire programme - lasted as long as a piece on a key report into the state of the NHS in England.

During the live exchange the comedian repeatedly interrupted and shouted over host Evan Davis, who was reduced to pleading with Brand to listen to his questions.

After ranting about his support for the Occupy protests outside Parliament this week, Brand was asked why he described the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001 as 'controlled' in his book.

He said he was 'open-minded' as to whether the US government was behind the 9/11 attacks, adding: 'Do you trust the American government? Do you trust the British government?' He claimed there was an 'interesting relationship' between the families of former US president George Bush and the former Al Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden.

The comedian also criticised BBC coverage of the terror shootings in Ottawa this week, claiming the broadcaster was trying to build an 'anti- Islamic narrative'. He added: 'These tragic events are used to enforce further controls on us.'

Last night Tory MP Philip Davies condemned the BBC for giving Brand a platform.

He said: 'I've no idea what the BBC are up to. If they think that the general public want to see this kind of nonsense on a serious political news programme they need to get out more.

'It is bewildering why they have given Russell Brand a platform to display such ignorant views. One might wonder what expertise he brings to this subject. The answer is none. The BBC have taken leave of their senses.'

Viewers vented their disgust over Thursday night's interview online. Mark Lawson posted: 'Russell Brand is open to 9/11 theories? Of course he is. His logic on most issues is paper thin.' Another critic wrote: 'At what point do we stop holding this guy up as some intellectual darling of the Left?'

In Thursday's interview an image of Russell Brand morphed into Che Guevara, the Argentinian Marxist revolutionary, was used as a backdrop. The comedian used the slot to promote his online news show The Trews - which stands for 'true news'.

And during a series of fractious exchanges with Davis, Brand accused the host of being 'mates with CEOs and big businesses' and 'cosying up' to London mayor Boris Johnson. He told the presenter: 'Mate, I don't want to follow you down blind alleys about silly administrative quibbles.' Davis said the comedian's ideas were 'piecemeal'.

Brand retorted: 'We don't want hegemonic figures coming in and didactically shouting at us, we want to organise ourselves.'

He told Davis to 'sharpen up' as he is in 'big shoes', a reference to his predecessor Jeremy Paxman. And he claimed the BBC 'shamefully sabotaged' the Scottish independence referendum.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Love him or loathe him, Russell Brand has been one of the most eloquent voices articulating the anti-politics mood politicians are struggling to engage with.'

Brand will appear on the Jonathan Ross Show tonight to promote his book - six years after the pair faced a storm of criticism for calling actor Andrew Sachs so Brand could boast of having had sex with his granddaughter.

His misdemeanours also include being sacked by MTV for bringing his drug dealer to the studios and dressing as Osama Bin Laden the day after 9/11; being fired by radio station XFM for reading pornographic material live on-air; and 12 drug-related arrests.

Last year he wrote in The Guardian that Margaret Thatcher's death was only sad for 'a handful of people', and goose-stepped at an awards ceremony sponsored by Hugo Boss, saying the German firm 'made the Nazis look f****** fantastic'.

TRULY, IT WAS KINDER FOR OXO MUM LYNDA TO DIE BEFORE CHRISTMAS; PLATELL'S PEOPLE
BY AMANDA PLATELL

During her last interview before she died in her husband's arms, Lynda Bellingham spoke excitedly of her determination to share one more Christmas with her family.

She wanted a real tree for the first time, with all the presents laid out beneath it, and to be surrounded by those closest to her in the world.

When news broke of her death from colon cancer last weekend, many thought the fact that she didn't reach Christmas Day made the tragedy for her family so much worse.

It may sound callous, but I'm afraid I disagree.

People facing their own death are often keen to make it through to Christmas for the sake of those they love. I know this only too well, as it was my brother Michael's dearest wish, too.

Dying of cancer aged just 40, he was determined to be there with his wife and two young children as well as the rest of us. And, unlike Lynda, he did make it.

Days earlier, I had visited him at his house. He was confined to a hospital chair in his own living room, hardly able to speak because of an oxygen mask and the pain he suffered, a shadow of the strong big brother I had loved my whole lifetime.

Yet he still came round to us on Christmas Eve, the last day I saw him alive. I was staying with my parents ten minutes from his house and Michael's car swept into the driveway, with his wife behind the wheel.

He had dressed up in a smart blue shirt and shorts — we were in Australia and it was hot — which showed the long white surgical stockings he had to wear. 'You didn't have to come,' I whispered.

'Yes I did,' he replied. 'I didn't want you to remember me the way you saw me at home.'

Michael died 48 hours later, having achieved his last ambition.

Yet the fact that he spent a last Christmas with us means the day has become almost unbearably sad. Even 20 years on, it's dominated by our memory of this beautiful, brave but desperately ill man clinging onto a life that was deserting him.

AT EVERY Christmas church service, my mother, wedged between myself and my father, sobs uncontrollably. We visit Michael's grave every Christmas and still set a place for him at the table.

I try to remember the Christmases before he died, the ones when we would be larking around in the garden with the children, all of us stuffed with turkey. But those joyous memories are no longer the first that come to mind.

The tragedy is that for my family, the festival of Christ's birth has become a reminder of death.

Lynda Bellingham would not have wished that on her sons or her husband and friends. Dying peacefully as she did last weekend was kinder to them.

 

 

 HOW COULD THIS CLEVER COUPLE BE SO STUPID?It WAS supposed to be the backpacking trip of a lifetime for the newlyweds. One day a smiling James and Alex Gaskell were posing in front of the Taj Mahal, the next they were dead in their hotel room surrounded by sleeping pills and antidepressants.Like countless other 'drug tourists' to India, they'd obtained the powerful medicines from chemists who happily gave them prescriptions without asking questions.Most chilling of all is that they were both teachers with first-class degrees. You'd have thought they would have known better, but drug-taking even among the well-educated young is so commonplace that none of them seem to think of the dangers.James, 27, who had a long history with drugs, boasted in a tweet that he was 'off his face'.In another he said: 'I'm drunk and high and still drinking. Because I'm clever like that.'His new wife Alex, 24, knew of her husband's drug history, but thought she could save him. In the end, it appears she couldn't even save herself.LESSONS FROM A BABY BUMPTHIS is a tale of two bumps. Both mothers-to-be married into 'royalty' — one into the monarchy, the other into Hollywood's aristocracy.After a tough time with acute morning sickness, Kate was out and about again this week revealing a gently protruding tummy. She's been absent for 11 weeks, and rightly so, putting her unborn baby's welfare first.Meanwhile, the 23-year-old heavily pregnant mother of Jude Law's fifth baby was also showing off her bundle of impending joy. Catherine Harding's relationship with Law, 41, lasted months, yet both insist they are 'wholeheartedly committed' to raising their child.Which makes you wonder: which of the children will have the bumpiest ride through life? Having already come  up with the brilliant idea of pancakes for Pancake Day and turkeys for Christmas, Pippa Middleton is now being paid by Waitrose to share the secrets of her fabulous figure. Her daily workout includes an exercise called 'ladders' — which, as we  all know, are perfect for social climbing. Many are outraged about the leniency of the five-year sentence Oscar Pistorius received for shooting dead his model girlfriend. Reeva Steenkamp. Now South Africa's ANC Women's League is demanding an appeal, claiming that it sends a horrific message that violence against women is acceptable. The number of women killed  by their partners in that country is five times the world average. Somehow I don't think hijacking Reeva as their poster girl will do the feminists much good. After all, a female judge deemed it was a  fit punishment — as did Reeva's own mother, June. Anyone who is bewildered by the global celebrity of Kim Kardashian need look no further than pictures of her ginormous bottom squeezed into torn denim shorts (right). Kim is the embodiment of every curvaceous young woman's delusion that bulk is beautiful. Almost 26,000 children are admitted to hospital each year with tooth decay, so schools are being encouraged to show kids how to brush their teeth. Lesson one: fizzy drinks aren't mouthwash.LAMENTING the end of his year-long relationship with Jemima Khan (above), Russell Brand says that it's tough not having her dog, Brian, in his life any more. As for Jemima, it must be a relief that she now has  to control only one hairy mutt that jumps  on everything that moves.A ROCHDALE minicab company has been threatened with legal action after complying with customers' requests for white drivers after the Asian sex-grooming scandal — on the grounds of racial discrimination.I often request one of my three favourite Muslim drivers from the local cab company, or else one who's a Hindu, because they're the best drivers and utterly trustworthy — so I guess that makes me a racist, too.  After his lucrative Alimony Tour, John Cleese is jubilant that he can finally pay off ex-wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger. 'This means I can start earning money for Jenny now.' She is his fourth wife, 33 years younger than the comic, who is 75 on Monday. As Cleese himself once said: 'A man will give up almost anything except his suffering.' Much has been made of Renee Zellweger's changed appearance. But why is it always the women who get scrutinised? Take a look at this picture of George Clooney when he was in ER (above left) and tell me where all those bags under his eyes have gone (right). Back then, he had more crows' feet than a rookery.TRY THE SUNSHINE DIETLATEST ploy from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to prise fatties away from their triple helpings of curry and chips is to pay them to lose weight. It comes as a report claims warm weather can help the obese fight the flab. How long before the NHS offers free sunshine breaks to Majorca to help these poor victims?++ WESTMINSTER NOTICEBOARD ++*?ED MILIBAND ludicrously claimed David Cameron was attacking the NHS in Wales because the PM wanted to deflect attention from health service failures in England. This from a leading member of the government that  presided over the Mid Staffs Hospital scandal — in which 1,200 needlessly died, patients were abused, staff bullied and no one was held to account. As the Mail's devastating investigation into Labour's running of the NHS in Wales shows, patients are simply not safe in Miliband's hands.*?MR CAMERON has pledged £205?million to help fight Ebola in Sierra Leone, almost a third of the total amount given by the 28 EU countries. Add that to the £1.7?billion the EU has just demanded from the UK because our economy is recovering faster than other member states, and is it any wonder voters are flocking to Ukip?*?WELL done Mr Cameron for making the head of the MigrationWatch think-tank, Sir Andrew Green, a peer. He was once vilified as a racist bigot for warning of the effects of unchecked immigration, but time has proved him right. If only the same could be said for the PM's other appointments to the Lords, including his pollster Andrew Cooper, who predicted gay marriage was a vote winner and Ukip were a flash in the pan.*?MILIBAND'S pledge of a seven-day test for cancer is derided as an unworkable gimmick, while Cameron's £55 for GPs who diagnose Alzheimer's is dismissed as a meaningless bribe for doctors to do their job. Is it any wonder neither party is trusted with the NHS when both treat us all like idiots?

BT GROUP SUFFERS FROM BAD RESULT; MARKET REPORT

AHEAD of another weekend of Premier League football, telecoms firm BT Group got a bad result after broker Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating for the stock citing worries about the cost of keeping the rights to broadcast the beautiful game.

Cutting its stance on BT to 'equal-weight' from 'overweight,' Morgan Stanley suggested that the firm may pay up to £1bn a year for future Premier League rights for its fledging BT Sports TV channel, compared with around £246m it is paying now.

BT currently broadcasts matches at 12.45pm on a Saturday but Morgan Stanley said its survey shows that this slot is the least popular over the weekend, hence it believes the firm could bid aggressively for the more popular Sunday 4pm viewing slot currently taken by Sky TV.

The next Premier League TV auction is set for early 2015. The broker has calculated that if BT were to spend £1bn per annum for rights to the 2017-18 season, this would represent a 25pc downgrade on the group's estimated free cash flow for 2017, which would impact the stock's valuation.

'Of course, BT could charge more for BT Sport and target new customer wins, but there are clearly greater risks to the BT equity story, as it faces the transition to pay-TV,' Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.

The bank also pointed to increased competition for broadband customers and the group's growing pension liabilities as factors likely to weigh on the stock.

In reaction, shares in BT Group shed 9.7p to 366.9p. Sky TV owner BSkyB saw its stock gain 1.5p at 861p bucking a weaker blue chip trend.

After posting a late rally on Thursday, the FTSE 100 index went into reverse to close down 30.42 points at 6388.73 spooked by news that a case of the ebola virus had been reported in New York City. Worries over the spread of ebola sent travel-related stocks lower once again.

After putting in strong gains in the previous session, British Airways-owner IAG was one of the worst off, shedding 2.1p to 381.9p.

Discount rival EasyJet lost 17p at 1434p, and Holiday Inn operator Intercontinental Hotels fell 40p to 2220p.

Uncertainty ahead of stress tests for European banks, to be published this weekend, also took a toll on European markets.

US stocks confounded expectations for big falls in early Wall Street trade and edged higher supported by some better than expected earnings.

In London, well-received results lifted pharma group Shire as it reported record third quarter revenues of £1bn, up 32pc year-on-year, leading it to raise its earnings guidance for a third time this year. Shares in Shire, which have been hammered since US peer AbbVie withdrew a bid for it earlier this month, gained 109p at 4004p.

Generic drug maker Hikma Pharma was a casualty on the second line.

It dropped more than 5pc or 97p to 1803p after it said it had received a warning letter from the US Food and Drug Administration which raised issues related to investigations and environmental monitoring at its manufacturing facility in Portugal.

Hikma's big fall was a drag for the FTSE 250 index which ended 46.44 points lower at 15,089.55.

Molten metal flow engineering firm Vesuvius was also a mid cap faller, shedding 7.1p to 418.5p after it disappointed investors with a gloomy outlook statement, saying it has seen a 'softening in market conditions in certain regions' since the end of its first half.

Electrical engineering firm Spectris was in demand, however, jumping 5.23pc or 86p to 1731p despite warning that its full-year operating profit will be 'modestly below' market expectations.

Broker Investec kept a buy rating on Spectris shares, saying that the update was 'soft, but not disastrous'.

Among the small caps, shares in Morgan Sindall plunged nearly 13pc, down 101p, to 687.5p after the construction and regeneration specialist warned that delays and higher costs on some of its contracts would hit full year profits.

The firm said the performance of its construction division would also be hit after a fire destroyed the site for the £15.8m Glaxosmithkline Carbon Neutral Laboratory of Sustainable Chemistry being built for the University of Nottingham.

On the upside, 4imprint, the direct marketer of promotional products, was one of the market's best performers.

It leapt 14.1pc or 97p to 785p on the back of a strong third quarter performance that put the firm's revenues ahead of management expectations.

BRITAIN CAN STILL PROVE TO BE BEST; INVESTMENT EXTRA
BY CHRIS BEAUCHAMP

THE UK has produced some of the world's most powerful companies and best-known brands. But are the glory days of the FTSE 100 stalwarts a thing of the past? We look at some iconic names for investors to watch.

Rolls-Royce

THE very name is synonymous with British excellence, but the Derby-based engineer has not had a good time of late. Rolls recently issued a profits warning that took the market by surprise and sparked a big fall in the share price.

That followed a downgrade in February when the firm revealed an expected drop in first-half revenues and underlying profits, citing a combination of lower defence spending, problems caused by a stronger pound and difficult trading at its marine division.

The share price trend is not particularly appealing, but if they can find support around the £9.50 level and move back towards £11, there may be signs of a trend reversal.

Any long-term turnaround in the shares would target the all-time highs around £12.50; particularly if Rolls-Royce can show evidence of expanding its order book and improving the performance at the maritime division.

Centrica

THE past year has been one of turmoil for Centrica and investors. Last summer shares hit an all-time high of just above 400p, but then began a steady descent. The price has found a floor above 300p but this 25pc decline means it lags the FTSE 100.

Politics has played a part. As a company supplying energy to UK domestic customers, Centrica is an easy target for politicians attacking energy price rises.

Senior management departures have also exacerbated the situation but this is not an environment that makes for stable leadership.

Nonetheless there is reason to be optimistic about Centrica. It has the biggest market share in provision of energy and heating, is firmly ahead of rivals in this sphere and provides a clear stream of dividends for shareholders.

At a yield of 5.6pc the company is very attractive for income hunters and the firm has already stated plans to maintain a commitment to increasing dividends.

That will go a long way to reassuring investors bruised by poor capital growth over the past 12 months. As long as the shares hold above 300p, investors can look to Centrica with a greater degree of confidence, even if political troubles threaten to flare up ahead of the 2015 General Election.

 

Burberry

THE instantly recognisable check has made Burberry one of the most covetable luxury brands around the world, snapped up by the newly rich in emerging markets such as China. The worry is that Chinese growth may stutter, hitting Burberry's engine of growth.

Markets are looking to the future much more nervously than in the past two years. Advocates of the company have stepped in regularly over the past year to defend the £14 level but shares in Burberry are still up an astronomical 800pc from their 2008 low. The company was at pains to point out that the current strength of sterling was beginning to have a noticeable impact on profits and margins.

In another prescient warning, Burberry observed a high dependence on tourism revenues would mean any drop in such sales would be a major problem for the firm.

Given the increase in concerns surrounding potential travel restrictions regarding ebola, this warning cannot be disregarded.

Having provided stellar capital growth in the past five years, Burberry is shifting to an income stock. A current yield of 2.2pc is far from derisory, and management plans to increase this over the coming three years to a ratio of 50pc of earnings from the current 40pc.

The big question is the growth outlook. For a company with such a focus on China, the worries over growth there will keep management awake at night.

But as long as China does not run into a 'hard landing' then investors can be relatively sanguine about Burberry's prospects.

The luxury market has proven itself to be broadly immune to sustained downturns, providing a firmer base for revenues than may first seem to be the case.

Encyclopedia Paranoiaca

by Henry Beard & Christopher Cerf

(Duckworth £9.99)

While falling leaves might be the image of autumnal beauty, they also have the ability to kill - or so this book will make you believe. Wet leaves can make stopping difficult and dry leaves can be set alight from the heat of the car and engulf the vehicle in minutes. Autumn leaves are in fact 'one of the most lethal and multi-pronged driving hazards any motorist can face'.

The omission of Ebola, tornadoes and terror attacks from 'the indispensable guide to everyone and everything you should be afraid of or worried about' is a sure sign that the biggest perils lurk closer to home.

Beard and Cerf have compiled a whopping list of the seemingly inoffensive dangers of everyday life, where rubber duckies in the bath — or 'bacterial soup' — are linked to liver cancer and nearly 10,000 people a year are injured by escalators.

Laugh at your own risk.

A Story Lately Told

by Anjelica Huston

(Simon & Schuster £7.99)

Anjelica's tempestuous relationship with obstinate men is at the core of this fascinating memoir. Her father (film director John Huston) was 'a lothario, a drinker, a gambler, a man's man', and she became a carer to her 'wounded soul' of a boyfriend, Bob Richardson, who suffered from schizophrenia.

Her father — often away shooting films or womanising — received news of Anjelica's birth by telegram in the Belgian Congo filming with Katharine Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.

When the family moved to a large estate in Co. Galway, Ireland, her father stayed in the Big House while Anjelica, her brother Tony and her mother Ricki lived in the steward's quarters a few hundred yards away.

This is the first part of Anjelica's story of growing up — the second is published next month — and recounts her life from 1973 onwards. It is a beautifully crafted account packed with glamour and tragedy.

A Likely Tale, Lad

by Mike Pannett

(Dalesman £14.99)

Pannett is best known for his tales as a Yorkshire bobby in Up Beat Down Dale and Not On My Patch, Lad — but in this latest book he recalls his childhood in the North Yorkshire countryside in the Seventies.

One of the most charming stories is his account of his family's holiday to the coast. What was a simple 50-mile journey became a five-hour feat as the Pannetts took back roads instead of the motorway and all piled out of their Morris Traveller on hills to lighten the load. His father then cut the engine and let the car roll down the hills to save on petrol — 'look at that, 35 miles an hour and it's not costing a penny'.

Richly nostalgic and a delightful evocation of rural England in the Seventies, it will charm anyone who grew up at that time.

UKIP has accused the British Red Cross of putting politics above saving lives after it refused to accept the proceeds from the controversial Ukip Calypso song.

The party claimed it would donate to the charity's Ebola Outreach campaign after the song's creator, former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read, asked for the track - which has been called racist - to be withdrawn from sale.

But the Red Cross said it had not been approached by Ukip, which receives 20p from each sale of the 79p record, and said it would reject the proceeds anyway because the lyrics are party political and attack refugees and asylum seekers. The track is sung in a mock Jamaican accent and warns of 'illegal immigrants in every town'.

Ukip chairman Steve Crowther said he was 'staggered', adding: 'We regret that the British Red Cross think it's their place to put politics over saving people's lives.'

Mr Read yesterday apologised for causing offence with the song. 'That was never my intention. I've asked the record company to withdraw the single immediately,' he said.

However, the song has already reached number 21 in the midweek singles chart.

BID TALK BOOSTS CRODA'S SHARES

PUNTED more times over the years than a rugby ball at Twickenham, shares of perennial takeover target Croda - which makes raw materials that go in to sun cream, shampoos and deodorants - have risen 6pc from a recent year's low.

They touched 2107p yesterday before closing 38p better at 2093p on revived gossip that the East Yorkshire-based group's days of independence could at last be numbered.

Talk of a £3.9bn or £29 a share cash bid did the rounds with Dow Chemical and Dupont once again mentioned as possible bidders and could now pounce before Croda itself goes on the acquisition trail. It is said to have firepower of as much as £1bn.

Following Croda's shock profits warning in July, Berenberg said that Croda was an attractive bid target and a perfect fit for cash-rich Solvay, the Belgian group which swallowed France's Rhodia for £3bn in April 2011. The broker then suggested Solvay could generate synergies of £25m on earnings and £100m on sales, increasing its divisional earnings margin by 700 basis points.

Solvay was in the news recently when reports suggested that it had won a contract to provide plastic for Apple Inc's latest smartphone iPhone 6 handsets.

The rot stopped at Shire as the stock rallied 98p to 3848p on a report that Botox manufacturer Allergan's shareholder Paulson & Co was urging the drugs firm to merge with Shire as an alternative to do a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

That's no surprise as the hedge fund group has lost an absolute arm and leg following AbbVie's decision to walk away from a £32bn buyout of Shire.

Shire's performance gave the Footsie a lift and the close was 105.26 points higher at 6,372.33 although the volume of business once again left a lot to be desired. The closure of many sizeable bear positions helped the FTSE 250 rebound 269 points to 15,024.97.

Wall Street closed 215.14 points higher at 16,614.81, boosted by better-than-expected results from technology giants Apple and Texas Instruments.

Receding eBola fears helped travel firms perk up. TUI Travel advanced 16.5p to 365.7p, cruise giant Carnival 101p to 2347p and Thomas Cook 7.7p to 117.8p.

Buyers switched on to BT, 6.6p up at 369.8p, after Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy stance. It believes it could launch consumer mobile before the end of the year, driving growth and acting as a positive catalyst. Mobile phone giant Vodafone, which many people still believe will one day be swallowed by AT&T, buzzed 4.2p higher to 193.75p.

Informa jumped 31.4p to 479p after Westhouse Securities upgraded to buy from neutral following a reassuring trading statement. Current trading remains on track with full-year expectations. This despite growing problems with the division which publishes insurance bible Lloyd's List.

Ophir Energy rose 11p to 201p after saying it was confident on its Equatorial Guinea project after a successful flow-testing of its Fortuna-2 well.

Aerospace and defence giant Meggitt added 10.7p at 449.3p after landing a multi-million dollar contract to supply an advanced wheel and braking system for Gulfstream Aerospace's new G500 and G600 business jets.

Accident prone oil services group Lamprell put on 14.25p to 151.25p as buyers appeared on the announcement it expects a financial windfall after completing construction of a second oil and gas rig for an unidentified client. The group said it had finished erecting the Caspian Sea jack-up drilling rig, the Mercury, ahead of time, which meant it would be able to release contingencies for the project which will have a 'significant positive impact' on its 2014 results. Controversial Quindell rose 22p to 162.5p after winning a five-year contract with one of the top three insurers in Canada to exclusively supply their telematics technology solution. Apparently, the insurer represents over 3m customers, 1,700 broker and has a significant market share of the Canadian automobile insurance market. Broker Daniel Stewart has a target price of £7 which many bears in the City would say to be a trifle 'generous'.

On hearing the energy storage and clean fuel company had taken delivery of one of the first Hyundai ix35 fuel cell vehicles to arrive in the UK, buyers chased ITM Power 1.75p higher to 22.5p.

On a heavy volume of almost 11m shares, StratMin Global Resources soared 3.62p or 80.56pc to 8.12p after reporting its first Off-take agreement for its large flake high carbon content graphite with one of the world's largest independent processors and merchants of graphite. StratMin is the first AIM-listed graphite producer, and now supplier.

***

GOOD drilling results from Canada lifted Northern Petroleum 2.62p or 19.44pc to 16.12p. Its first well targeting the Keg River edge reef tested at a constrained rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil per day. The group expects to raise production from its three initial wells targeting Keg River to up to 250 barrels per day by the end of the year from a current combined restricted rate of about 140 barrels a day.

DJ READ PUTS UKIP SUPPORT ON THE RECORD

AFTER rising in the polls, Nigel Farage hopes Ukip will now climb the pop charts with a record by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read.

The party leader called on supporters to buy the calypso song, which looks forward to 'when Nigel is at Number Ten'.

But Read was yesterday forced to defend the track sung in a mock Caribbean accent amid claims it is racist.

The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: 'Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown.'

It continues: 'Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again - when Nigel is at Number Ten.'

Other lines include: 'With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam.' Read, a former Conservative supporter, warns against trusting the Prime Minister, singing: 'The British people have been let down, that's why Ukip is making ground. From Crewe to Cleethorpes, from Hull to Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum ... Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots.'

The song also mentions Mr Farage's love of 'fags and beer'. It is on sale online for 79p to raise money for Ukip and has reached as high as number 16 on the iTunes chart.

One review on Amazon described it as 'the musical equivalent of the ebola virus' and another said: 'Shows Ukip in its true light as a nasty racist party.'

But on his BBC Radio Berkshire show yesterday Mr Read said he 'never meant to be remotely racist', adding: 'The calypso is simply a bit of fun ... Apologies of course if anyone has taken offence, but I have worked and sung in Jamaica ... and often have fun with the guys out there doing the accent.'

A Radio 1 spokesman said: 'The song is not currently on our playlist ... we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday.'

BY THE WAY...STOP SPITTING IN THE STREET TO CONTAIN DISEASE

LAST week as I was parking my car a passing youth spat on to the windscreen — not an act of aggression at me, but simply a reflex habit.

He probably hardly realised what he was doing: this was something he, like many of us, have increasingly seen on the street and in Premier League football matches in recent years, and is a tough guy act.

Back in 1960, when my father took me to France for the first time, I asked him the meaning of a public sign that seemed to be everywhere, 'Defence de Cracher'. It means 'No Spitting'. He explained that spitting in public was forbidden as it was a cause of the spread of tuberculosis.

Twenty years earlier, when he was at medical school, three of his student peers died from TB before the end of the course, as there were no antibiotic treatments until just before 1950.

Indeed, tuberculosis was the great fear of all involved in healthcare because of their inevitable exposure.

The other day, I read that the number of people diagnosed with TB in England is set to exceed the number of cases in the U.S. within the next year, and this is fuelled by immigration — 70 per cent of cases involving people born outside of the UK.

We are lucky that most cases of TB, though not all, are cured with a six or 12-month course of three antibiotics.

And now, of course, we are in the grip of Ebola, with experts warning that the disease is coming closer to our shores. And how is it spread? Body fluids.

Now is the time to rise up against young men spitting in the street and on the football pitch — if only out of respect for the thousands who have already died from the Ebola virus, or those whose lungs are wrecked by tuberculosis.

FAMILIES DESPERATE FOR RIGHT TO BE GIVEN UNTESTED 'LAST CHANCE' DRUGS
BY CARA LEE

TIME may be running out for Andrew Culliford. But ask him whether he'd rather meekly give in to the illness that's killing him or risk taking an unlicensed drug that might stave off its devastating effects, and his answer is unequivocal: he'd take the drug — without a second's hesitation.

The 37-year-old fire officer and father-of-one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in July 2011 at the age of just 34. He was told he had just two to five years to live.

There is no cure for the disease, which affects the motor neurons — nerve cells that control muscles — in the brain and spinal cord. The muscles gradually waste away, affecting the patient's ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, swallow and eventually breathe.

Within a year of his diagnosis, Andrew started losing the strength in his right arm and hand. His speech became slurred, and in 2012 he and Donna married while he could still say his vows.

'Now I have to feed Andrew because the muscles in his tongue and throat have weakened,' says Donna. 'His speech is very slurred so I often have to interpret what he says to other people. He can't use his arms and is starting to find walking more difficult.'

The only treatment for MND on the NHS is riluzole, which offers just three extra months of life after it's been taken for a year.

But there are other drugs that might help. Through his own research, in late 2012 Andrew came across aimspro, which was being tested for neurological conditions such as MND and multiple sclerosis. Former Rugby Union player Joost van der Westhuizen was taking it for his MND after travelling the world looking for a cure.

'We figured he'd be getting the best treatment for the disease, so Andrew wanted to try it,' says Donna.

New drugs undergo three stages of testing. In the first, the drug is given in small doses to healthy patients to check for side-effects; then it's given to a larger group of people who have the disease it's been developed for; finally, some patients are given larger doses, while others are unknowingly given a placebo.

Aimspro has undergone an 'open label' clinical trial, a version of this last stage, where patients know they are taking the real drug, not a placebo.

But it could still take ten years for it to be licensed and prescribed to patients — time that desperately ill patients such as Andrew do not have. What they want is access to drugs such as aimspro before they are licensed.

However, drug companies are reluctant to allow this, even to dying sufferers, for fear of being sued if patients experience adverse effects or die as a result of taking them.

Aimspro is available for 'named patient compassionate use', meaning a doctor can prescribe the drug where no other is available, although it is still considered experimental and has to be paid for privately.

Furthermore, the doctor bears the risk of being sued, so many are reluctant to do this.

Andrew was able to find a doctor who would prescribe the drug, but had to sign a disclaimer to waive his rights to sue if something went wrong. He's since spent all his savings and money raised by well-wishers — a total of £50,000 — having the £180-a-day drug injected.

'I was able to carry on working, albeit in a more administrative role, at the fire station. I even ran the London Marathon this year,' says Andrew, speaking through Donna.

But the drug could only slow progression of the disease, and by summer he couldn't use his arms, meaning everyday things such as making a cup of tea were out of reach. 'But he still believed the drugs were helping,' says Donna who lives with Andrew and their four-year-old daughter Isla in Poole, Dorset.

However, his money has now run out and he's had to come off the drug — and in the three months since he stopped taking it, he has gone considerably downhill.

'The muscles in my throat and tongue that help me speak have deteriorated,' says Andrew. 'My speech was slightly slurred before, but now it's worse.

'Walking isn't coming naturally any more — I have to concentrate on how to do it.

'We were recently at a wishing well and Isla threw a coin in and wished I had new arms.

'I'd love to pick Isla up and cuddle her — it's what I long for.

'It's been soul-destroying knowing there's a drug out there that would help me, but I can't have it.'

Now it seems that a new law could soon make Andrew's wish a reality.

Yesterday it was announced that a Bill which would allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested drugs had received government backing.

The Medical Innovation Bill, which will go before the House of Lords on Friday and is due to be considered by MPs in December, would allow doctors to treat people with terminal illnesses — and who have exhausted standard treatment options — with drugs that are unlicensed or have not been tested for their disease.

The Bill would give legal protection to doctors so long as they obtained agreement from another specialist to prescribe drugs or surgery which wouldn't normally be given for a patient's condition.

This would apply to NHS and private doctors, meaning that funding would come down to local health authorities, now known as Clinical Commissioning Groups, as is the case with standard treatment. If passed, the Bill could become law in England and Wales by March.

The Bill was proposed by the Conservative peer Lord Saatchi, who has led a campaign to change the law after his wife, author Josephine Hart, died from ovarian cancer, aged 69, in 2011. He argued that current rules are impeding medical progress, forcing doctors to stick to traditional treatments which don't always work.

'Doctors know if they divert from these well-worn treatment paths and attempt an innovative treatment, and then something goes wrong, they will be found guilty of medical negligence,' he has said. As he told Good Health yesterday: 'I want every patient who is facing a terminal diagnosis to be able to ask their doctor: "Have you tried everything?" And for this Bill to allow doctors to say, confidently: "Yes."

'No patient should die thinking more could have been be done, but wasn't for fear of the law. No husband, wife, son, daughter, mother or father should be forced to say goodbye to a loved one with that doubt hanging over them.'

Donna Culliford says she and her husband, who have spoken previously in the Mail about the need for the law to change, 'support this Bill 110 per cent'.

'Doing nothing is not an option for us. Sitting here waiting for the Grim Reaper is not an option. We know aimspro works for Andrew, so that's the drug we want to try.'

Another patient who could benefit 'hugely' from the proposed legislation is six-year-old Jack Johnson.

He has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a terminal and incurable condition that causes muscles to weaken, and he is slowly losing the ability to walk and lift things.

His mother says there are 43 drugs in development for Jack's condition, but none has yet been approved. 'Jack will die from Duchenne, but he could have treatment,' adds Alex, 30, who lives with her husband Andy, 40, their two-year-old son James and Jack, near Chorley, Lancashire. 'This new Bill would change all that.

'I'm not some crazy parent. We want to discuss these untested drugs with doctors and make a decision together. We'd be willing to sign a waiver if they would just give us access to these drugs.

'As a mum, I see these promising drugs dangling in front of me and we can't use them. Jack has said to me: "Mummy, when are my legs going to get better?" All I can do is tell him Mummy and Daddy are working hard to find new treatments.'

'I would try these drugs on Jack. I know that might kill him. But the risk, for me, is doing nothing. My son is going to die anyway.'

Yet some clinicians don't think the Bill is the way forward. Michael Baum, professor emeritus of surgery at University College London, said yesterday: 'Changing the law is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.'

And Ammar Al-Chalabi, professor of neurology and complex disease genetics at King's College London, has warned: 'Licensed drugs have to go through rigorous trials. Even if an unlicensed drug works in some way, it might kill you in another way or cause problems.'

But many patients don't accept this argument. In August the World Health Organisation said people with Ebola should be allowed untested drugs; Andrew believes the same should apply to other people facing death. 'I know we can't compare having MND to the Ebola outbreak, but for those of us with a terminal illness, we're facing a crisis every day.

'I'd welcome being used as a guinea pig for untested drugs. It might make a difference to others and it would give me a sense of purpose, rather than just fading away.'

STOCKS DROP ON OIL PRICE SLUMP

OIL companies weighed heavily on the markets yesterday as the recent slump in the price of black gold spooked investors.

The FTSE 100 fell back 43.22 points to 6,267.07, after rising 114 points on Friday - bouncing back from a 15-month low on Thursday.

Goldman Sachs cut its earnings estimates for the oil services sector by between 18pc and 22pc.

In a downbeat note it said: 'Historical correlations between oil prices and European oil service revenues imply there is a 10pc to 20pc down side potential to revenue from 2014 levels on scenarios of Brent oil prices at $90-$80/bl (per barrel).'

Petrofac fell 30p to 1030p, Royal Dutch Shell fell 50p to 2099p, Tullow Oil was down 15.5p to 508.5p, and gas giant BG Group dropped 40.5p - or 3.8pc - to 1024.5p.

Copper prices also eased yesterday as investors braced themselves for disappointing Chinese growth figures.

Punters ditched the red metal as the second biggest economy in the world was expected to admit last night that it is going to miss its full year growth target.

David Madden, market analyst at IG, added the slowdown in China 'could not come at a worse time for the oil market, as overproduction from oil-rich nations and declining global demand continues to crush the price of crude oil'.

Fears about the malaise in the eurozone, the crisis in Ukraine and the threat of ebola are just some of the other issues making investors twitchy at the moment.

But hapless supermarket giant Tesco (up 4.75p to 179.3p) was one of the biggest climbers in the FTSE 100, as investors were cheered by reports that private equity firms are eyeing its £9bn Asian business - and that its accounting black hole may be less than originally stated.

All eyes will be on Britain's biggest grocer on Thursday - when it is expected to announce a dire set of figures for the first half of the year and provide shareholders with an update on the probe into its £250m accounting scandal. Unsurprisingly Tesco was the most viewed stock among customers of discount broker Hargreaves Lansdown.

Shares in Spirit Pub Company soared nearly 10pc to 99.75p as investors toasted news of Greene King's improved takeover offer of 109.5p per share.

Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said both firms could benefit from the proposed £723m merger, which it estimates will generate £35m in savings. It reckons the deal would boost Sprit's earnings by around 15pc and Greene King's by 12pc. It highlighted other potential benefits such as the chance for Greene King, whose tipples include Old Speckled Hen and Greene King IPA, to sell its beers in Sprit pubs. But investors in Greene King were not so excited by the prospect, with shares nudging up 7p to 775p.

British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group was flying high in the FTSE yesterday (up 11p to 361.4p) after analysts at Liberum highlighted the UK listed firm as its top pick for the European airline sector - alongside budget rivals Ryanair (up 0.14p to 7.1p) and EasyJet (up 22p at 1431p). Liberum said it sees 'opportunities for the brave', despite sentiment remaining fragile across the industry.

'Amidst concerns over ebola, eurozone recession and excess capacity, we believe there are good long term opportunities for investors with high risk tolerances.'

The broker was less bullish about tarnished engineering powerhouse Rolls-Royce, downgrading it from 'buy' to 'hold' and slashing its target price from 1225p to 900p. Investec also lowered its recommendation from 'buy' to 'hold', with JP Morgan changing its stance from 'overweight' to 'neutral'. Shares eased 14p to 818p having tumbled 11pc on Friday after it issued a profits warning.

The UK blue chip blamed deteriorating economic conditions and tighter Russian trade sanctions - with customers in the oil and gas and mining and construction sectors cancelling or delaying orders.

US stocks had a mixed day. The Dow Jones was weighed down in early trading by IBM, which fell more than 7pc on disappointing quarterly results. But the index bounced back to close 19.26 points up at 16,399.67.

Traders screen's turned across red Europe, with German business software-maker SAP issued a profits warning and was the worst performer on the German DAX, which fell 132.5 points - or 1.5pc - to 8,717.8.

German markets have been hit by sobering economic data which has raised questions about the resilience of Europe's biggest economy. The French CAC 40 index also fell by more than 1pc to 3991.2.

 

***

SHARES in Premier Foods jumped more than 12pc to 30.25p. Ahead of the firm's Q3 trading update Thursday, Shore Capital reiterated its 'buy' rating. But it cautioned that this was 'with a degree of trepidation, given the weakness of the Q2 trading performance and the clearly challenging grocery market conditions in the UK'. It said it expects the firm to announce a drop in sales of between 3-4pc in the third quarter.

BRITAIN WOULD BE IRRELEVANT WITHOUT US, CLAIMS EU CHIEF

DAVID Cameron will today be accused of leading Britain to the EU exit door where it will not retain even 'marginal relevance' on the world stage.

In a highly provocative speech, José Manuel Barroso will attack Britain's 'defensive' leaders for failing to 'make the positive case' for continued membership of the EU, insisting: 'Could the UK get by without a little help from your friends? My answer is probably not.'

The intervention by the outgoing head of the European Commission reflects growing fury in Brussels at the increasingly strident anti-EU tone being adopted by Mr Cameron and his ministers.

Yesterday Grant Shapps, Tory party chairman, insisted reform was achievable and attacked Mr Barroso as an 'unelected bureaucrat'.

Mr Cameron, who has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election, will set out plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources.

He is considering an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts, and further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants' rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers.

Though there is growing support for reform in Germany, the Prime Minister is being warned by EU officials that fundamental changes to the right to free movement across the continent would require full-scale changes to the EU treaties that will be all but impossible to deliver.

Yesterday Mr Barroso insisted an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law and condemned Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's suggestion last week that Britain was 'lighting a fire' under the EU by proposing a referendum.

'I think this reference to fires and weapons is more appropriate for defence than foreign secretary,' the European Commission boss told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, a reference to Mr Hammond's previous Cabinet job. 'I think it is very important to have a positive tone between Britain and the EU.'

In today's speech at Chatham House, the foreign affairs think tank, he will tell Mr Cameron that it is never possible to 'win a debate from the defensive'.

'We saw in Scotland that you actually need to go out and make the positive case. In the same way, if you support continued membership of the EU you need to say what Europe stands for and why it is in the British interest to be part of it,' he will add. Mr Barroso said yesterday he could not comment on proposals for reform of immigration rules that had not yet been unveiled by Mr Cameron.

But he added: 'What I can tell you is that any kind of arbitrary cap seems to be not in conformity with Europeans laws. For us it is very important - the principle of non-discrimination. By the way, I remember when prime minister Cameron called me to ask the commission to be tough ensuring the freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain.

'The British citizens have freedom of movement all over Europe. There are 700,000 living in Spain. So the principle of the freedom of movement is essential, we have to keep it.'

In today's speech the EU boss, who will be replaced shortly by arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker, will accept there were 'widespread concerns in the UK and elsewhere about abuse of free movement rights'.

He will point out some changes - such as the right to receive income support - have already been agreed, but insist further changes must be agreed by all countries and cannot put into question the 'basic right' of free movement.

He will also warn Britain its current rhetoric is offending eastern European countries. Mr Barroso will dismiss the idea of a European 'superstate' but insist: 'Today even the largest, proudest European nation cannot hope to shape globalisation - or even retain marginal relevance - by itself.'

Pointing to Mr Cameron's current attempt to persuade fellow EU leaders to contribute £800million to curb the spread of ebola, he added yesterday. 'What would be the influence of the prime minister of Britain if he was not part of the EU? It would be zero. Inside the EU you can get much more than outside the EU.'

Mr Shapps said Mr Barroso was 'out of touch with the mainstream's view in Great Britain, which is - it's time to have a different relationship with Europe'.

He brushed aside Mr Barroso's warnings about reform, saying he was 'only the latest person from Europe to tell us we'll never get what we want'.

VIRGIN MONEY PUTS LISTING PLANS ON HOLD

SIR Richard Branson's challenger bank Virgin Money has put on ice its plans to float on the stock market.

It hopes to resurrect the float next month. The shelving of the share offer was predicted in the Daily Mail earlier this week after fellow upstart bank Aldermore abandoned its plans to list on the London market.

Chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia said: 'Virgin Money continues to perform strongly and we remain focused on delivering a successful initial public offering as soon as market conditions allow.'

Stock markets around the world have been volatile this week. The FTSE 100 index plunged by 181 points on Wednesday, but regained ground later in the week. The flagship index is down by nearly 10pc since the start of September.

Virgin Money, which bought part of Northern Rock from the Government in 2011, had been planning to float by the end of this month. It expected to raise around £150m in a listing that would have valued the business at up to £2bn.

Two banks have floated this year: the TSB, which spun off from Lloyds Banking Group, and former building society One Savings. But a number of firms, including Scottish housebuilder Miller Homes and fashion brand Fat Face, have been forced to step back from plans to float.

Markets are likely to remain nervous due to concerns over economic weakness in the eurozone and the approaching end of money printing in the US. Traders are also jittery due to tensions in the Middle East and elsewhere, and ebola.

PM ASKS BRUSSELS FOR £800M TO FIGHT EBOLA
BY DANIEL MARTIN

DAVID Cameron yesterday challenged European leaders to stump up one billion euros to tackle the ebola crisis.

The Prime Minister said the virus was the 'biggest health problem for a generation' - and that not all states were doing enough.

He has written to Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, to say ebola should be placed on the agenda of next week's Brussels summit. Mr Cameron said the one billion euros - £800million - would pay for 2,000 extra health workers.

So far, the EU has raised less than half that sum to tackle ebola. Britain has already pledged £125million, second only to the US.

Mr Cameron brought up the need for a stronger response at the Asia-Europe Meeting of world leaders in Milan yesterday. Meanwhile, Public Health England said ebola screening is to be introduced at Manchester and Birmingham airports, on top of existing measures at Heathrow, Gatwick and London's Eurostar terminal.

Questions about the programme were raised after a Downing Street spokesman revealed only five people were screened on Tuesday - the first day of the initiative.

DOWNTURN IS NO CAUSE FOR PANIC
BY GEOFF FOSTER

OCTOBER has a reputation for panic and delivering a stock market crash or sell-off, and this month has been no exception.

It always gets a bad rap in finance because so many black days fall in this month.

Indeed, tomorrow is the 27th anniversary of Black Monday, when Wall Street plunged 508 points of 22.6pc, the largest one-day decline in history, while £63bn was wiped off the value of the Footsie as it plummeted more than 300 points.

The International Monetary Fund then warned that the world's financial system was on the 'brink of a systemic meltdown' and private investors ran for the hills fearing the end was nigh.

The 10pc fall in the Footsie since its early September high of 6,904.8 and the 7pc decline in the Dow Jones since its peak on September 19 has given investors their biggest bout of jitters since the eurozone crisis ended two years ago.

More than £190bn has been wiped off share values over the past six weeks and confidence has been shot to pieces. Markets were long overdue a correction after 18 months of strong returns.

UK markets have relapsed into a consolidation mode in recent months, especially in the small and mid-cap areas where some investors have been locking in profits.

We all know the world is a scary place right now.

Ebola, Islamic State and the Russia-Ukraine situation are all things that were not on the radar at the start of 2014.

Starving bears have been feeding off a deteriorating European economic outlook as the eurozone's recovery has not just stalled but is in a worrying decline.

Germany used to be the economic success story of the Continent but the latest survey of economic sentiment by ZEW, the Centre for European Economic Research, fell for the ninth month in a row to its lowest level in two years.

Germany is the largest economy in the eurozone and its economic performance determines the fate of the area.

It recently slashed its growth forecasts for this year and it exacerbated fears of recession. If Germany is struggling, the rest of Europe must be in a bad place.

Sentiment is not helped either when a Footsie constituent, drugs giant Shire in this case, crashes £15 in two days after America's AbbVie decides to pull its £34.5bn bid following a review of the financial implications on its proposed deal of new US tax rules introduced last month. Other pharmaceutical stocks dropped in sympathy.

But investors must feel confident that the UK economy is in a healthier state and that interest rates will not rise before next year's General Election. An imminent increase was certainly averted by this week's news that inflation fell to its lowest level in five years.

The consumer prices index of inflation collapsed in September to 1.2pc from 1.5pc in August. Before the data, interest rates were expected to rise by a quarter point to 0.75pc in April, just in time to give the Government a headache in the polls.

Now experts say there is no chance of a rise. Great news for home owners, bad news for savers.

So if that's the case, where else is there for private investors to put their hard-earned spare cash other than the stockmarket?

Investment returns on the High Street remain at a pitiful 2pc, while the average dividend yield on the Footsie is almost 4pc.

It is obviously impossible to rule out further sharp falls in share prices in the short term, but a gut feeling does suggest that recent turbulence is no more than a 'healthy correction' and presents a buying opportunity.

Brave investors could pick up some bargains in the coming weeks and then keep all digits crossed for a traditional Christmas rally.

Geopolitical concerns have led to a sharp fall in the oil price with Brent crude falling to a four-year low of $83 a barrel. But the effect of this on consumers and industry is akin to that of a tax cut, and should prove positive for the global economy.

Interest rates are likely to start rising next year in the UK and the US, and the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme will soon taper to zero. These events are bound to have a big effect on investor sentiment, but private investors should not panic.Sit tight and ride out the current storm. The worm will soon turn.

Simon French, economist at Panmure Gordon, says the market's fall over the past few weeks is a welcome correction in some inflated valuations rather than the start of a prolonged bear market.

Craig Erlam, strategist at Alpari UK, adds: 'It has been just an overdue sell-off and pretty soon we're going to see investors look at valuations as a bit of a bargain.'

Private investors should wait until the dust settles and then stick to those high-yielding, blue-chip stocks.

No reason to panic.

OIL STOCK FUELS A FOOTSIE BOUNCE; MARKET REPORT
BY JONATHON HOPKINS

(c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved
A RALLY by recently poleaxed oil stocks helped fuel a recovery in the Footsie following a week of high volatility, with the energy sector bouncing back after a hammering caused by a drop in oil prices to four-month lows.

Heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell gained 83p at 2149p, and BP added 8.5p at 428.5p as oil prices finally picked up, with Brent crude heading back towards $87 a barrel after falling below $83 in the previous session.

Explorer Tullow Oil saw the most demand, however, topping the top-flight riser board with an 8.29pc or 40.1p gain at 524p helped by an upgrade in rating to buy from hold by Societe Generale.

The French broker noted that the Africa-focused firm's share price has collapsed 44pc in the year to date due to the triple whammy of falling oil prices, mixed drilling results and concerns over a lack of progress with its asset disposal strategy.

Yet SocGen said Tullow's underlying financial situation remains strong.

'Even in an $85/barrel world, we would still expect Tullow to be able to continue to finance high-margin production growth projects in Ghana and West Africa, and at the same time add low-cost resource barrels in Kenya,' the broker's analysts said.

Societe Generale added that at the current share price, investors in Tullow 'are getting a "free" option on future exploration success in Kenya ahead of a busy period of drilling'.

Blue-chip oilfield services group Petrofac was also a good gainer, ahead 72.5p to 1060p after saying it is on track to hit profit targets this year.

Overall global markets rallied following a week of stock market turbulence, with the FTSE 100 index closing 1.85pc or 114.38 points higher at 6310.29.

The rebound was helped by a similarly strong early recovery in New York following further encouraging US economic news and after St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard said that the US central bank may maintain its equity-supportive bond-buying stimulus since inflation expectations had fallen.

The focus also was on monetary policy in Britain after the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane said he was 'gloomier' on the UK's economic outlook and that interest rates will likely remain at their record-low levels for longer than expected.

Those hopes saw financial stocks in demand, having taken a battering over previous sessions, with Barclays up 5.2p to 213.1p, Lloyds Banking Group ahead 2.36p to 74.63p, while Royal Bank of Scotland climbed 7.2p to 344.9p.

Meanwhile insurer Prudential added 31.5p to 1353p and Aviva up was 18.4p to 494.5p.

Royal Mail was also a blue-chip gainer, up 19.1p to 431.7p as broker Morgan Stanley upped its rating for the mail delivery group to equal-weight from underweight.

The FTSE 250 index notched up a similar-sized rebound to its bigger cousin, ending 277.53 points higher at 14757.62, with a rally by oil-related stocks also a feature.

Ophir Energy stood out, up 12.3p at 194.4p and Cairn Energy gained 8p at 163p.

Holidays firm Thomas Cook was also one of the top mid-cap risers, jumping nearly 7pc or 7.1p to 110.2p as the recent sell-off on fears over the impact of the ebola virus on travellers eased.

Among the small caps, medical technology specialist Angle gained 4p to 84p after it revealed that it is to partner with Barts Cancer Institute in order to examine the use of the firm's Parsortix cell separation system. The group said lead researchers from the institute recently presented data showing how the system worked well in harvesting circulating tumour cells.

AIM-listed 'internet of things' expert Telit Communications was also higher, adding 21.50p to 222.75p as it said full-year results will be in line with expectations with year-to-date revenues having grown by a fifth.

And Magnolia Petroleum jumped nearly 7pc, or 0.08p to 1.15p, after letting the market know that with a cost of production of less than $30 per barrel it remains highly profitable in the current oil price environment with lots of room to spare.

The US onshore producer also announced two more wells have commenced production, bringing its total to 163 across its leases in proven areas such as the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma.

But gold explorer Hummingbird Resources was a faller, losing 0.25p to 37p as it reported a wider annual loss after its operations in Liberia were put on hold due to the ebola outbreak and as it focused on bringing its Yanfolila project in Mali into production in 2016. The firm also said its chairman was stepping down.

EURO LEADERSHIP FAILS THE TEST; COMMENT
BY ALEX BRUMMER

THERE has been huge puzzlement over the past week due to the turmoil in financial markets, with shares giving up gains for the year and American bond markets allegedly telegraphing a 'Lehman moment' because US yields temporarily dipped below 2pc.

The reality is there should be no mystery about what is happening at all. As was the case in 2010-2011 when the eurozone all but melted down and Brussels had to call on the International Monetary Fund for assistance, the present disturbances are all about the single currency, stupid.

Greece may be the country that is in most difficulty and wants the IMF to get lost so that it can ditch austerity. But it is the three biggest nations in the eurozone, counting for most of its output, that are in the firing line this time.

Italy looks to be in almost permanent recession, France has both a fiscal and stagnation crisis, and in Germany business confidence, exports and output are falling off a cliff partly as a response to the Ukraine-Russian stand-off. Despite all of this the eurozone looks as incapable of acting to prevent a disaster as it was three years ago, and in the process threatens to undermine the hard-won stability built across the globe since the Great Recession of 2008-2010.

On paper the eurozone would appear to have all the tools it needs to rescue Greece, engage in large scale quantitative easing to deal with deflation and to rebuild confidence in a deeply damaged banking system loaded with sovereign bonds and incapable of supporting private sector recovery.

It, after all, has an emergency kitty, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), able to fund country and bank bailouts by purchasing bonds. The unused Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) scheme has been enough to stabilise bond markets without actually being fully deployed. What is lacking is the willpower to use these weapons that are no more than ornaments, which seem to have convinced some hedge funds and short-term investors that the eurozone is perfectly safe.

It is anything but. That is because many of its leaders, from Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker downwards are intoxicated by the durability of the euro.

The truth is that the most vital voice in the eurozone, that of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, is as obdurate as ever. Its president, Jens Weidmann, argues that deflation risks are low, despite the fact that prices, wages and the value of assets across the eurozone are tumbling by the day.

1920s Weimar-style inflation is so off the radar that if Frankfurt and Brussels were serious about averting disaster then they would be deploying all the tools available. In addition to using the ESM and OMT, which would be supporting immediate central bank purchases of securitised assets, special credit measures (such as Help To Buy) rather than fiddling around with easing the haircuts for Greek bonds.

In effect the Bundesbank is holding the ECB hostage and Europe's leaders are too feeble to break the deadlock. It is a frightening moment for all of us.

A STUNNING 15pc fall in Rolls-Royce shares does not speak well to investor communications at Britain's premier engineering group.

In its statement, Rolls-Royce referred to a rapid deterioration in economic conditions and Russian sanctions as damaging profit expectations.

Yet just three months ago the group was expressing confidence that revenue improvements together with cost reductions would deliver something of a recovery in the second half.

Russian sanctions clearly have damaged the economies of the advanced countries as much as they have Moscow, as the deterioration in German business confidence shows. But with just £114m of revenues attributed to Russia that seems a feeble excuse for the worsened outlook.

Rolls jettisoned a historic reputation for some heroic accounting practices some years ago. It is to be hoped they have not returned.

THE Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a terrific institution, which never tires of telling us of the wonderful work it is doing in eliminating disease across Africa.

In September, long before ebola reached US shores, it was quick to dig into its coffers and offer $50m to help prevent the spread of the disease across West Africa.

With advanced nations failing to fulfil their pledges to the emergency fast enough, as former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has made clear, the Gates Foundation, with $43bn of assets at the end of 2013, has a real opportunity to show how philanthropy can step in where nations won't by helping to plug the one billion dollar gap.

Come on, Bill, you know you can do it.

NEWCASTLE will check Papiss Cisse and Cheick Tiote for symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus.

The pair have been away on international duty in Africa this week and will return to United's training base today.

Ebola has now killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa and Newcastle's medical staff are aware of the dangers to those travelling to and from the area.

Manager Alan Pardew says precautions are in place. 'We'd be naive not to have concerns,' he said ahead of tomorrow's home match with Leicester.

'We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of. They're essential to us, and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise, and also protection for them, to make sure we do our very best to help them.'

Ivory Coast's Tiote and Senegal's Cisse took part in Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Senegal drew at home to Tunisia before losing the return fixture. Ivory Coast won at DR Congo but lost in their homeland, which borders Liberia, one of the countries affected by Ebola.

AIR PASSENGER IN PROTECTIVE SUIT AS EBOLA FEARS START TO GRIP THE WEST

FEAR in the West over the risk of catching ebola has reached such a peak that an air passenger was pictured wearing a protective suit at an airport.

The woman was seen in the blue plastic Hazmat suit - complete with gloves and mask - in the departure lounge of Dulles International Airport in Washington.

It was the latest sign of growing concerns in the West about the spread of the deadly virus, which has already killed 4,500 people in West Africa.

US President Barack Obama ordered his officials to respond to the disease in a 'much more aggressive way' as he cancelled planned visits to focus on tackling the outbreak.

There were fresh ebola scares across Europe and North America yesterday as new suspected cases were identified in Spain, France and the US. Emergency procedures were put in place at Madrid airport after a traveller from Nigeria arriving on an Air France jet with 163 passengers on board complained that he had a fever and shivers.

Health workers wearing protective suits took the man by ambulance to a hospital in the Spanish capital. The return flight was cancelled and the plane is to be disinfected.

The Spanish authorities are also examining two other people for ebola. Tests are being carried out on a person who came into contact with infected Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero, 44, whose condition is said to be improving. The other suspected victim is a missionary who came down with a fever after returning from Liberia.

In France, a nurse feared to have caught the disease from an infected aid worker was placed in isolation in a military hospital near Paris. The woman had treated a volunteer for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Liberia.

In the US, a Yale University student who visited Liberia last month to advise health officials on how to track the spread of the disease is also undergoing tests after reporting 'ebola-like symptoms'.

France yesterday announced that it would join Britain, America and Canada in screening arriving passengers for signs of ebola. But there are concerns that Western countries are not doing enough to stop the disease from spreading.

David Cameron used a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee to call on other European nations to do more.

The World Health Organisation sought to ease fears by saying that the West would probably escape an ebola epidemic because of its developed health systems. It is prioritising 15 African countries in its attempt to stop the spread of the virus.

More than 100 British Army medics from 22 Field Hospital yesterday travelled to Sierra Leone, where they will set up a treatment unit.

SHARES HIT BY A WALL OF WORRY

INVESTORS will have had their hearts in their mouths as they have watched the acrobatics of the FTSE 100 over the past couple of days.

Volatility on the stock market is no longer a worry confined to City traders and wealthy individuals: millions of ordinary Britons have a stake in the fortunes of the Footsie through their Isas and pension plans.

The index yesterday ended down just 15 points, after threatening earlier to emulate Wednesday's 181-point drop.

Relief at that relatively positive close must be tempered by the fact that we are in the teeth of a pretty aggressive sell-off, caused by crumbling confidence in the global economy.

In the US, traders are worried that the taps are about to be turned off on the billions of dollars that have flooded into the stock markets through QE money-printing.

Throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks in the US and the UK supported the markets with QE cash and ultra-low interest rates. The markets are now jittery at the prospect that this stimulus, described by one commentator as 'monetary morphine,' will be withdrawn.

Fears over the eurozone are also casting a dark shadow.

As Chancellor George Osborne pointed out at the IMF meetings last week, Europe risks slipping back into crisis.

That will inevitably cast a pall over the UK economy, hurting our manufacturers and exporters.

The single currency bloc looks set for a long period of weakness, with even the German industrial engine feeling the strain.

Worries have also resurfaced about weaker countries such as Greece, where the Athens stock market has fallen sharply in recent days. Policymakers are terrified that the eurozone could face a 'lost decade', trapped in a spiral of deflation, similar to the fate suffered by Japan.

As if that were not enough, confidence has been hit by political unrest around the world, including the conflict in Ukraine and the barbarism of ISIS.

The Ebola virus, which has already hit shares in airlines and travel companies, is another big unknown that is eroding optimism.

Looking at all of these factors, it is less a question of why the markets have panicked this week, than why they have not been affected sooner.

Shares are always driven by a balance of greed and fear and at this point it is plain that fear has the upper hand.

Predictably enough, some bankers have blamed regulators for this week's 'flash crash', claiming new rules have inadvertently exaggerated market movements, by restricting the banks' ability to trade.

In reality, one positive factor is that the global financial system is in far better shape than it was at the height of the crisis.

Things are far from perfect, but the banks are better capitalised and have more liquidity; we don't have to worry there will be no money in the ATMs, as was the case in 2008.

The gyrations on the market are stomach-churning, but research shows that over the long term, investing in shares is likely to perform better than cash deposits.

A sum of £100 invested in shares at the end of 1990, with the dividend income reinvested, would have grown to £380 by February this year after inflation, according to the Barclays Equity Gilt report.

The same amount in index-linked gilts would have grown to just £255.To put the recent falls in perspective, the FTSE dropped to just over 3500 at its low point after the financial crisis, compared with more than 6100 now.

The important thing for small investors is to take a long view - and not rush to sell when values are low.

ROSS McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, warned his peers yesterday that banks risk a worsening of their relationships with customers when interest rates rise.

Most suspect the banks will dash to hike loan rates, while dragging their feet over giving savers a better deal. When it comes, a rate rise will be traumatic for many RBS customers.

More than half of its mortgage borrowers have never experienced an increase whilst with the bank, and across the industry as a whole there are 1.5m people who bought a home after 2007 so have known nothing but rock-bottom rates.

McEwan is commissioning detailed research into how customers react to information on interest rates, and is likely to put in place a detailed policy, including advanced warning for customers and help in managing their loans.

All well and good, but the cynic in me wonders whether RBS and its peers, operating with constrained business models and with scant opportunity to earn fat returns, can actually afford better rates for savers and borrowers - or will it just be sweet talk?

STOCKS in London swung wildly yesterday as government borrowing costs across Europe's debt-ridden periphery soared.

The FTSE 100, which shed nearly 3pc on Wednesday, fluctuated between an intra-day high of 6282 and low of 6072 before finally closing down 15.73 points at 6195.91.

It was the first time the blue chip index has closed below 6200 since June 2013 and took losses suffered by investors, savers and pension funds over the last six weeks to £173bn.

One analyst said the Footsie 'demonstrated all the stability of a giraffe on roller-skates'.

The latest turmoil came amid mounting fears over the health of the global economy and in particular the eurozone, where the threat of recession and deflation is intensifying.

Borrowing costs in some of the single currency bloc's southern states shot higher as the debt crisis in the region returned after two years of relative calm.

The ten-year yield on Greek bonds jumped above 9pc while the equivalent yields hit 3.8pc in Portugal, nearly 2.8pc in Italy and more than 2.4pc in Spain.

By contrast, the yield on German bunds dropped to a new low of 0.716pc as nervous investors ditched risky assets and ploughed into perceived safe havens. The euro also took a beating, falling as low as 79.48p against sterling and $1.2707 against the dollar, as analysts warned of an autumn meltdown on financial markets. It is feared that a second sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone could engulf Italy in the coming months as the region's third largest economy struggles to recover - pushing its bond yields back towards the 7pc danger zone which could leave it requiring an emerging bailout.

'The next domino to fall could prove to be too big to bail - Italy,' said Kathleen Brooks, research director at currency experts Forex.com. 'During the peak of the sovereign debt crisis, bond yields would rise extremely quickly, so just because Italy's ten-year yields are below 3pc now, doesn't mean they will stay in stable territory during this bout of market volatility.'

Investors have been spooked by a toxic mix of a slowing global economy, the threat of recession and deflation in the eurozone, the Ebola outbreak and tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine. 'It's beginning to feel a bit like a perfect storm,' said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. 'Everyone is panicking.'

÷ ANGELA Merkel yesterday slapped down moves by France to break Europe's new budget rules as the single currency crisis deepened.

Germany's Chancellor launched a robust defence of the eurozone's tough fiscal targets and said the region's economy 'is still too fragile for us simply to go back to business as usual'.

She said: 'All, and I stress again all, member states must fully respect the strengthened rules of the stability and growth pact.'

DOUBT OVER FLOAT OF VIRGIN MONEY

QUESTION marks were thrown over the planned float of Virgin Money after challenger bank Aldermore called off its listing and put the blame on volatile markets.

Aldermore - a private equity-backed bank set up in 2009 by former Barclays boss Phillip Monks to cater to small and medium-sized businesses - had planned to sell around £300m of shares this week. Instead it pulled the plug on the float 'due to the recent deterioration of global equity markets'.

The move sparked speculation that Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money may be the next to shelve its plans to list.

The company, which bought part of Northern Rock from the government for just under £750m in 2011, had been planning a float expected to value the business at up to £2bn by the end of this month.

Sources said Virgin Money has not abandoned plans to sell a 25pc stake but admitted that hitting the timetable it had envisaged will be 'tight'.

The firm is understood to be keeping a close watch on the markets before opening the books on the deal.

Stock markets have been rocked by worries over ebola, the Middle East and economic problems in the eurozone, prompting a number of firms, including Miller Homes and fashion retailer Fat Face to put their float plans on ice.

Doubts are also hovering over the planned £1bn float of shoemaker Jimmy Choo, after poor trading updates from luxury goods companies Burberry and Mulberry.

Two banks have floated this year: Lloyds Banking Group spin-off TSB and OneSavings.

THE UK financial markets yesterday suffered their biggest one-day loss in a year amid fears over the ebola virus and global economic concerns.

As America's health authorities warned about the spread of the disease, an alarming slump on the London Stock Market was followed in by a dramatic dip on Wall Street.

Millions of shareholders, including the big pension funds, were left with heavy losses last night after stocks fell wiping as much as £46billion off the value of Britain's biggest listed companies.

The FTSE100 index of leading shares in London tumbled by as much as 2.8 per cent or 181 points, lower at 6211.6, its biggest plunge in a day for a year. It has lost 10 per cent in the last week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.64 per cent or 267.31 points to 16047.88 in late afternoon in the US after plunging as much as 450 points earlier in the day.

In a terrible day for world markets the spread of Ebola combined with a raft of negative developments caused what dealers described as a perfect storm. In the US, the fall in the Dow gathered momentum after the US Center for Disease Control said it was not clear how a second worker had contracted the virus.

Officials have said they also don't know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. The Federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 'an additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern'.

Fears over a political crisis in bailed-out Greece and gloom over the outlook for the American economy caused investors to cut their losses and sell. Markets were also spooked by disappointment after stagnation in the eurozone, a slowdown in China and unexpected falls in the global oil price.

Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: 'Carnage on the markets today as European markets hit by a perfect storm of disappointment over the health of the economy in Europe?...?as well as Ebola.'

In France the Cac was down 3.25 per cent while in Germany the Dax fell 2.5 per cent.

÷ Ebola survivor Will Pooley has said he is preparing to go back to west Africa to help deal with the epidemic because it is 'something I need to do'.

The volunteer nurse, from Eyke in Suffolk, said there was a urgent need for strong medical support as the virus has claimed almost 4,500 lives, mainly in west Africa.

Mr Pooley, 29, made a special appearance at a training and discussion session in Whitehall for NHS workers who have volunteered to help on the ground with the international effort.

INVESTORS SUFFER A PANIC ATTACK; COMMENT

THE great puzzle about oil prices is why have they been so weak when geo-political tension has been so high?

All the historical experience from the Yom Kippur war in 1973 onwards would suggest the opposite. Even the normally authoritative IMF has been predicting a price spike stemming from the war against Islamic State.

What we appear to be witnessing is a post-OPEC reaction in the markets. America's great fracking and shale revolution has transformed the oil supply channel. The US can economically pump more oil as long as the price remains above $75-a-barrel, the approximate cost of opening new wells.

The tendency is to see the lower oil price as a symbol of a slowing global economy and therefore something threatening.

It is true that parts of the global economy are not firing as they should be, from China to the stagnant eurozone. But there is a whole different way of looking at this.

High oil and gas prices mean a huge transfer of Western capital from the advanced countries to a bunch of Middle East potentates, several of whom, most notably Qatar, have dubious records when it comes to the support of extremist Islamic movements.

At $80 a barrel, the money flowing from the oil-consuming to the oil-producing economies of the Middle East plunges by $200bn from an estimated $1trillion.

High oil prices act as a tax on Western consumers, both people buying petrol at the pumps and corporations. As long as the price cuts are passed on rapidly, it should be an enormous boost to the importing countries. It is a form of quantitative easing courtesy of the Gulf states that will lead to a windfall worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

In the light of this, one might have expected equity markets to strengthen. Instead, share markets on both sides of the Atlantic have chosen to respond to the gloomy indicators and the fears of an ebola epidemic that could clog up the wheels of global commerce.

The Dow Jones and S&P have fallen heavily. The FTSE 100 fell 2.8pc in latest trading and is down more than 10pc this week. American bond yields have dropped below 2pc.

There was always a risk that the withdrawal of real QE in the US, together with eurozone weakness and geopolitical upheaval, would prove treacherous for investors. As they say on soon-to-be-revived Dad's Army: 'Don't Panic.'

AMONG the reasons for the FTSE's big wobble is the apparent death of the tax inversion.

It had been thought that despite the setback for Pfizer, when it sought to take over AstraZeneca, that AbbVie's £32bn assault on Shire would sneak through.

But political pressure in the US looks to have frightened AbbVie off.

That sent Shire shares down 21pc and has left some hedge funds, thinking they were on to a sure thing, nursing losses. It couldn't happen to more deserving people.

The more serious point is that corporations in the US have decided that these deals are not worth the political flak. Walgreen pulled back from moving its HQ to Europe via Alliance Boots, Pfizer was put back in its box (for the time being at least) and AbbVie has buckled.

Meanwhile, the Irish government has been scared by its paymasters in the EU into backing away from the 'double Irish' tax avoidance scam. Even in a globalised world governments have the wherewithal to take control of some events.

THE European Banking Authority (EBA) is seeking to show its muscle by clamping down on the use by the big global banks of 'allowances' as means of jogging around the European Union's misplaced limits on bonus pay outs.

Whatever one may think about the greed and unacceptable bonus culture in the banks, the EU's cackhanded directive, that restricts bonuses to 100 per cent of basic salary (200pc with shareholder approval) was bound to lead to distortions.

The reality is that toughened banking regulation, in the shape of stronger capital requirements, already has taken its toll on the bonus culture.

Moreover, why should anyone take any notice of the EBA whose only contribution to global finance were deeply flawed stress tests on the European banks that were woefully inadequate. Now that responsibility has been passed back to the European Central Bank.

The EBA should recognise reality, fold its tent and skulk away.

THE clampdown on Wonga and the other payday lenders has sent them scurrying for cover.

Among other things, they have gone on a recruitment drive for compliance specialists, with recruitment consultants MERJE reporting a 30pc surge in demand for internal enforcers.

Who says that an ill wind blows no good?

CHANCELLOR George Osborne confides privately to my source that he might now be prepared to give the Scottish Nationalist administration in Edinburgh full control of North Sea oil revenues - a bitterly contested issue in last month's referendum. SNP leader Alex Salmond valued them at £1.5trillion, while the Office for National Statistics came up with £120billion. Yet Osborne thinks this might be a good deal, especially if it has the useful side-effect of wrecking Labour's already dire prospects among nationalist Scots.

WITH Ed Miliband facing restlessness over his leadership, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham - who tried for the leadership in 2010 - is on full-alert status. Last time he insisted on having his campaign HQ in Manchester, to distance himself from the 'Westminster chattering classes'. Now I am told: 'If Andy gets a second stab at the leadership, we'll definitely be basing operations in Westminster.'

SKY News's new political editor Faisal Islam is struggling, says a colleague, who adds: 'It doesn't help that he has (former political editor) Adam Boulton hanging around like a bad smell.'

HISTORIAN Andrew Roberts's much-anticipated biography, the 900-page Napoleon the Great, is much discussed in literary salons. How did Roberts, who speaks little French, manage so monumental a project? Unmentioned in his six pages of acknowledgments, attractive blonde historian Lisa Hilton, pictured, helped out. When they arrived once for a party at the residence of the French ambassador in London, a fellow guest exclaimed: 'Andrew Roberts has showed up with Paris Hilton's sister!'

NOW ensconced with his third wife, heiress Sabrina Guinness, 59, brilliant playwright Tom Stoppard, 77, avoids social invitations, saying: 'I have two garden parties a year to avoid going out to dinner.' Who'd want to share Sabrina, once the consort of, inter alia, the Prince of Wales and Sir Mick Jagger?

SINGER Elaine Paige, 66, denies she's a 'high-maintenance' performer: 'I'm a professional and I like to work with professionals. I demand a great deal of myself and expect that of those around me.' Which sounds like proper diva, but judge not, lest we be judged.

RAPPER Chris Brown - who, notoriously, beat up his famous girlfriend Rihanna, and pleaded guilty to breaking a fan's nose this year - muses: 'I think this ebola epidemic is a form of population control.' South Africa's ex-president Thabo Mbeki said the same about Aids.

FRENCH superchef Alain Ducasse, 58, lobbies his government to allow the return of ortolan, a dish banned from European menus since 1999. The wild songbird is consumed bones '*' all after being fattened up and drowned in Armagnac. Diners consume it with a white linen napkin on their heads, 'to preserve the aromas'. Former French president Francois Mitterrand scoffed a brace for his last supper on New Year's Eve 1995. 'Afterwards he sat back in his chair, his face wreathed with ecstasy,' it is said.

EBOLA SHAMBLES AS HEATHROW SCREENS VOLUNTEERS ONLY

EBOLA screening plans were in chaos yesterday, as it emerged travellers might be allowed to stroll into Britain without mandatory checks.

After days of political uncertainty and a major U-turn, officials finally started an ebola monitoring programme at Heathrow yesterday morning.

David Cameron ordered late last week that checks be made on travellers from the stricken West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - after his ministers had dismissed the idea.

But the first passengers to arrive from the region were not tested until they volunteered for screening. Others were said to have walked through unquestioned, as officials revealed they might not be able to force travellers to co-operate.

One of the first arrivals from Liberia to Heathrow's Terminal 1 said he was given a questionnaire and temperature check only when he volunteered to be screened.

Documentary maker Sorious Samura, 50, who had been in direct contact with ebola patients and health workers in Liberia, said he was shocked at the relaxed attitude of staff. 'I was told it is up to you if you want to be screened or not,' he said.

'It was disappointing. I think in a situation like this, given the fear that is being spread, I would expect a mandatory screening.'

Mr Samura, who had flown from the Liberian capital Monrovia to Brussels, before going on to Heathrow, had spent ten days making a film about the crisis.

'Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didn't go into the screening room, they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport,' he said.

Clive Patterson, 32, who was working on the film with Mr Samura, also volunteered to be checked. He said: 'If you are going to make the effort and take this measure, you might as well make it compulsory.'

Journalist Gina Jere, 50, said she saw no one being screened at Heathrow after she arrived from Gambia via Brussels. Although Gambia has not been affected by the ebola outbreak, she said she was not even asked where she had flown from, adding: 'I think I should have been screened. This is real.'

A Downing Street spokesman last night insisted checks were mandatory, adding: 'We are taking a robust and proportionate approach based on the very latest medical advice.'

Dan O'Mahoney, chief of staff at the Border Force, said travellers with clear symptoms of ebola could legally be detained. But he admitted healthy-looking passengers might not be forced to undergo checks. The screening involves a questionnaire to establish whether someone has symptoms or may have been in contact with ebola, as well as a temperature check.

Currently, the virus can only be passed through bodily contact or fluids such as blood and sweat.

But scientist Lord Robert Winston yesterday warned it could become airborne. In a House of Lords debate, he said experts must 'look at the risk of mutation of this virus, so that we can make certain its mode of transmission does not change'.

WARNING OF 10,000 CASES A WEEK

MORE than 10,000 new ebola cases could be seen every week in West Africa, experts warned last night.

There have been more than 8,900 official cases since the outbreak started in March, killing 4,450 people.

But the World Health Organisation's assistant director general, Bruce Aylward, predicted the spread may accelerate over the next two months. 'This is a horrible, unforgiving disease,' he said. 'Any sense that the great effort that's been kicked off over the last couple of months is already starting to see an impact would be really, really premature.'

He said WHO projections suggest that by the first week in December, there may be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases a week, potentially even more.

SINCLAIR PERKS UP AFTER SPREE; MARKET REPORT

SHARES of aesthetics and skincare company Sinclair IS Pharma showed welcome signs of life amid talk that directors had cleared a sizeable stock overhang which had been depressing sentiment for months.

George Soros in June forked out £9m to take his shareholding above 5pc, but has since watched the stock drift down to touch a recent year's low of 23.30p. Yesterday's close was 0.75p better at 26.5p.

The buying spree by directors could be timely.

It comes ahead of this week's Worldwide Experts Meeting on aesthetic medicines in Barcelona, which kicks off tomorrow.

White coat representatives of Sinclair IS Pharma's Silhouette subsidiary, a company it bought for £69.9m earlier this year, will be giving a major presentation and demonstration of Silhouette Soft, a £1,200 anti-ageing treatment that uses dissolvable thread to beat wrinkles. Experts reckon it could prove better than botox.

If so, Sinclair's valuation would soar. Around 400 doctors were originally expected to attend the two-day meeting, but apparently 1,300 doctors are now flying in from all over the world to attend, all agreeing to pay their own hotel and travel costs.

They obviously mean business and want to see with their own eyes if there is possibly a better and cheaper substitute for botox.

As advisers of Aldermore met last night for last ditch talks to decide whether or not to proceed with its £800m flotation, another so-called challenger bank came in for renewed support.

Secure Trust Bank, 53pc owned by Arbuthnot, touched 2449p before closing 12.5p higher at 2420p on whispers that today's trading update will confirm that it is trading its socks off.

STB has experienced a strong demand for property financing and its diversified lending portfolio focuses on unsecured personal loans, motor and retail finance. It raised £50m in June, which is helping to facilitate accelerated growth especially in the SME business, where demand has been strong.

The fragile Footsie lost more than 40 points in early exchanges as neurotic traders continued to fret about the possibility of global economic weakness hurting US corporate earnings and the spreading of the ebola virus in Europe.

However, Wall Street rode to its rescue with an early leap of 120 points after US bank Citigroup posted better-than-expected third-quarter profits. London immediately rallied to close 26.44 points better at 6,392.68. Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Fund Manager's October survey showed that concerns over the imminent end of quantitative easing in the US have left investors much less confident in the outlook for the global economy and corporate profitability. The Dow closed 5.88 points down at 16,315.19.

The growing ebola threat has caused turbulence in the travel sector over the past week or so with shares down 10pc-plus. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines, 15.5p better at 339.6p, regained altitude after HSBC upgraded to overweight from neutral, saying ebola fears are excessive and the impact of falling fuel has not been appreciated by the market.

The broker recognises the ebola epidemic is very serious in West Africa, but thinks it unlikely to substantially impact air travel demand across IAG's network.

Unpopular with investors following boss Mike Ashley's surprise decision in September to enter an expensive put option agreement on a small stake in beleaguered British grocer Tesco, Sports Direct International rallied 18.5p to 593.5p.

In broker Panmure Gordon's opinion, Prudential has distinguished itself as the 'quality' stock amongst the large cap UK listed life insurers. Analyst Barrie Cornes believes the market is underestimating the opportunities for profit and cash generation, particularly from Asia. He raised his target price to 1712p from 1638p, which compares with last night's close of 1382.5p, up 17.5p.

A Westhouse sell recommendation ahead of a trading statement on October 24 dragged FT-publisher and education giant Pearson 10p lower to 1137p. The broker remains concerned about recent developments in the North American education market, which provides 55pc of group revenue.

It was recently dropped from a £625m contract to provide digital books to pupils in Los Angeles due to alleged irregularities in the tender process.

Anglo Pacific jumped 16.25p or 14.41pc to 129p after announcing it is expecting the royalty from Rio Tinto's Kestrel coking coal mine in Australia to be significantly higher in the first half of 2015 than had formerly been expected. FinnCap's upgraded to buy from hold and lifted its target price to 158p.

SHARES in Burberry fell nearly 4pc after it became the latest luxury goods firm to sound a pessimistic note about future trading.

The firm, famous for its camel, red and black checked raincoats, pictured, used an interim announcement to warn the 'external environment' is 'becoming more difficult'.

Finance director Carol Fairweather said the turmoil in the Ukraine meant fewer high spending Russians were buying macs and leather accessories, and the democracy protests in Hong Kong were also having an impact.

The prospect of the ebola virus denting tourist travel was also a concern. 'We are clearly mindful of the situation and watching it closely,' she said.

The firm, down 54p to 1425p, posted a 14pc rise in total sales for the six months to 30 September to £1.1bn. Retail sales grew 15pc to £748m.

The update came on the same day that rival Mulberry issued a profit warning wiping 17pc off the shares.

The shares were down 75.5p to 675p after it said sales in stores were down 9pc to £45.1m and full year profit would be 'significantly below current expectations.'

THE VIX, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, is commonly referred to as the stock market 'fear factor'. It measures investor nervousness and implied volatility in the S&P 500 index on Wall Street.

The VIX is at what many analysts and traders see as a critical level, this week heading towards 25, its highest point since 2012. It suggests that there is plenty of volatility to come over the next few weeks with October once again proving to be a difficult month for investors.

There are multiple things playing on investors' minds, from worries about the health of the global economy and the prospect of recession and deflation in the eurozone, to the ebola outbreak which has claimed more than 4,000 lives in West Africa. Geopolitical tensions are also making investors jumpy, with the conflict in the Middle East and the crisis in Ukraine to the fore.

Not well. The FTSE 100 index closed at 6392.68 in London last night, down more than 7pc on the 6878 reached last month. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 is down nearly 7pc since September while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 5pc of its value. In Europe, the Dax is down 10pc in Frankfurt and the Cac down more than 9pc in Paris.

÷THE nurse who became the first person to catch ebola in the US breached safety protocols, officials believe.

Officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas insisted Nina Pham had been wearing full protective gear while treating Liberian Thomas Duncan, who died there last week after he had initially been sent home with antibiotics. Miss Pham, 26, was described as 'clinically stable' yesterday.

Federal officials said she may have caught the virus as she tried to take off her bulky protective gear without any of the material touching her skin, eyes, nose or mouth.

'The care of ebola patients can be done but it's hard to do it safely,' said US disease control chief Dr Thomas Frieden.

HUNT'S WARNING AS HEATHROW SCREENING STARTS TODAY

UP to ten ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas, the Health Secretary warned last night.

Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that the health crisis will get worse before it improves.

As the death toll in West Africa passed 4,000, Mr Hunt announced that screening for ebola will begin at Heathrow airport today.

He told MPs: 'In the next week, Public Health England will start screening and monitoring UK-bound air passengers identified by the Border Force coming on to the main routes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

'This will allow potential ebola virus carriers arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice should they develop symptoms.'

The World Health Organisation yesterday described the epidemic as the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' as the number of cases hit 8,400, killing 4,030. Screening measures - a questionnaire followed by a possible medical examination and temperature check - will be introduced at Heathrow Terminal 1 today, followed later this week at Gatwick, Eurostar stations and other Heathrow terminals.

Mr Hunt said the procedure should pick up 89 per cent of people travelling from the affected region, and it could be extended to Birmingham and Manchester if the risk increases.

Anyone who tests positive for ebola will be transferred to Royal Free Hospital in north London, where British nurse William Pooley, 29, was successfully treated when he contracted the virus in August. There are also plans to provide ebola 'surge wards' in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield, to make a total of 26 beds available. 'The situation will get worse before it gets better,' he told the Commons.

He said it was 'genuinely very difficult' to predict an exact number of UK cases but, when pushed, said up to ten would be expected in the next three months.

Mr Hunt admitted he could not guarantee UK patients would receive the experimental drug ZMapp that was given to Mr Pooley. The Health Secretary also announced that calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 phoneline will be screened for potential ebola sufferers.

Medical experts have criticised the screening - which stops short of the automated temperature scanning introduced by the US - as a 'political gesture'.

The ability of NHS hospitals to deal with ebola was called into question after reports that one patient suspected to have the virus was allowed to receive visitors and use a communal toilet and kitchen at Lewisham Hospital, South London.

The patient, later given the all-clear, was only isolated when staff reportedly refused to go near him. Mr Hunt said the case highlighted, 'the importance of making sure that the guidance is widely understood'.

Underlining the potential turmoil, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said yesterday: 'I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.'

THE FIRST ELECTED UKIPPER ENTERED THE LAIR OF LIARS; QUENTIN LETTS SEES THE RETURN OF THE TORY TURNCOAT

AS REVOLUTIONS go, it was an engagingly British event, brushed by paradox, throbbing with half-swallowed vanities.

The new MP for Clacton arrived at 3.37pm to 'take his seat'. This new MP for Clacton is also the old MP for Clacton, having stood for re-election a few months short of a General Election at high public expense, even while deploring public overspending. Do keep up.

The ceremony of taking one's seat is remarkable not least for the fact that the new MP does not immediately go and sit on the green benches. He leaves the Chamber at once, usually to buy supporters a few beers. The new MP yesterday was Douglas Carswell and he is not much of a boozer. More a Bournvita man.

Mr Carswell has become the first person elected to Parliament for Ukip. The result from the Clacton souk is being interpreted as evidence of impending catastrophe for 'the cosy elite'. Charterhouse-educated Mr Carswell, whose party dislikes public-school toffs, smiled at Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove. The Aberdonian fish-monger's son nodded back in salute. Mr Carswell, historian of imperial Britain, caught the eye of Commons Leader William Hague, historian of Parliament. Yorkshireman Hague doffed his head, as any gentleman would.

Killer Carswell is v. hot on democracy. His Big Thing is the principle of parliamentary power. You could almost say he has become an empiricist on the matter, following arguments to logical conclusions and bravely acting thereon. Yet he happily swore yesterday on one of the Biblical Testaments that he would be faithful to our unelected Queen and her successors.

His arrival - to be pedantic his re-arrival - in the Chamber contained moments of solemnity and silliness. Some of us had wondered if anyone would turn up to watch the first elected Ukipper enter the demonised Lair of Liars. In fact, the House filled with quite a reasonable number of MPs on all sides to see their old chum Douglas do his bit. Party politics - which Mr Carswell so disdains that he has joined another, intensely partisan party - is perhaps not quite so resentful as we all thought.

It is customary when new MPs arrive for party colleagues to cheer. Being the first of his kind, Mr Carswell had no such teammates. The House therefore watched initially in silence. Some absent commentators have suggested this signalled Establishment apoplexy. Rot. It was just a parliamentary first and no one quite knew what to do.

Labour's new MP for Heywood had just been introduced. Speaker Bercow said 'next', or the parliamentary equivalent. A formal bow from Bercow. Hands in front of his groin, like a footballer in a wall when Wayne Rooney has a free kick near goal. Not that Mr Bercow need have anything to fear. Mr Carswell actually admires the Squeaker!

There had been puzzlement as to who would accompany Mr Carswell to the Table, for a new MP needs two 'supporters'. The Father of the House, Sir Peter Tapsell, proved to be one. The other was Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park). Ukippers are usually vicious about liberal, zillionaire, not-entirely British environmentalists who were schooled at Eton. In the case of Mr Goldsmith they are prepared to make an exception. First we have an outbreak of ebola. Now tolerance.

Mr Carswell approached the Table with his Popeye mouth sloping rightwards. He has an unusual gait: leans back, like a man steering a yacht in a highish sea after a couple of sherries. He radiated a self-belief - a sexy swagger - which I have not seen in him before.

Mr Goldsmith, having delivered the goods to the Table, did not know where to go and made for the Labour side. Hilarity as some pretended he must be about to defect. Watching upstairs was Nigel Farage, leader of Ukip. He was accompanied by a couple of burly chaps who or may not have been there to prevent him abseiling to the floor of the Chamber, screaming 'it should have been ME!'

TESCO'S UK ARM VALUED AT ZERO; MARKET REPORT
BY RUPERT STEINER

Daily Mail
DAIM

A WEEK might be a long time in politics but that maxim seems to also apply to embattled supermarket Tesco.

Seven days of hell saw another senior executive suspended, delivery of a shiny new corporate jet at the worst possible time, and billionaire Warren Buffet rueing his investment.

All fuelled the growing crisis.

It was just 24 weeks ago that former chief executive Philip Clarke spouted: 'I have no intention of going anywhere.

'We've got a strategy, and I'm going to see this thing through.'

Now he is out on his tod and the once mighty giant - Tesco not Clarke - is the subject of break-up talk.

Shares in the grocer fell 2.5pc or 4.65p to 180.6p after another negative research note estimated the value of different parts of the business if it was to be broken up.

The UK arm, it concluded, could be worth a fat nothing, quite damning given Britain was the crucible for its success.

Tesco's fall from grace has been as swift as it has been brutal, but Clive Black, an analyst at broker Shore Capital has placed it on hold in the hope of a bid.

He wrote that work is under way across the market to value Tesco's different parts, adding, 'and for good reason as this is an asset rich business'.

The most valuable part of the firm is Tesco's Asian business conservatively worth the equivalent 55pc to 65pc of the group's current £15bn market value.

Without Asia, the group's growth would need to be considerably re-appraised.

Black adds: 'Additionally, we can see strong market interest and value in Tesco Bank, Tesco Ireland, elements of the Central European businesses, Dunnhumby [loyalty card], Dobbies [garden centre] and One-Stop [Tobacconist]. 'As such, if fully disposed on a market capitalisation basis, the core chain could arguably be valued at close to zero, noting a further £10bn of liabilities in debt and the pension deficit.

'Such analysis and, indeed, scope for Tesco to be vulnerable to a financial buying consortium, are reasons why we have the stock on our "hold" roster.'

There are few other reasons to remain in the stock and plenty to pile out.

Many feel the worst is yet to come with much of the bad news not yet in the public arena and then there is the delayed second quarter trading update which could see underlying sales down as much as -6pc.

But Tesco was not alone in hitting new lows yesterday. At one point the FTSE 100 index of leading stocks plumbed to a 15-month low over concerns the eurozone is about to plunge back into the recession spilled over into a new week.

Faltering global growth also hit Asian stocks which succumbed to seven-month lows, while crude oil prices were pinned near a four year furrow.

Back home the Footsie actually recovered to close up 26.27 points to 6366.24, buoyed by the miners.

Anglo American was the top stock up nearly 5pc or 62.5p to 1388p, while Randgold Resources lifted 184p to 4381p and Rio Tinto climbed 125p to 3090p.

News that the Government has organised for passengers to be screened from the ebola virus at Heathrow did little to reassure investors.

Airlines and travel groups were struck down. British Airways owner International Airlines Group was down 1.3p to 324.1p, Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels fell 30p to 2165p, and TUI, parent to Thomson holidays, lost 8.4p, falling to 335.4p. Carnival was down 52p to 2155p. Coincidentally it was medical products maker Synergy Health which was a star performer after it announced an agreed bid.

The firm which sterilises medical equipment agreed a takeover offer worth £1.2bn from Americans based rival Steris sending shares up 31.43pc or 440p to 1840p.

It seems the main motivation for Steris is to incorporate the business in the UK to benefit from our lower 25pc tax rate.

Other fallers included, Arm Holdings which makes computer chips for the Apple iPhone.

It was down 2.43pc or 20.5p to 822p falling in the wake of the big losses seen on America's Nasdaq index on Friday which comprises mostly of technology stocks.

Thorntons, maker of chocolates, also fell 4pc, or 4p to 95p, a 12-month low after sales at its commercial arm which supplies supermarkets fell 12.8pc to £20.8m over the past quarter.

SCREENING 'WON'T STOP EBOLA FROM REACHING BRITAIN'

EBOLA screening plans are 'far from perfect' and will fail to stop the deadly virus hitting Britain, Boris Johnson said yesterday.

The London Mayor joined those questioning Britain's response to the outbreak, following delays and indecision over the introduction of screening.

In the latest move, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says callers to the NHS's non-emergency 111 helpline will be quizzed about potential exposure to ebola if they report common symptoms.

The Government announced last week that screening would be introduced at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal in London, but has so far failed to say when it will start.

Mr Johnson admitted that it was a 'far from perfect solution' and said it put No?10 'at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense'.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been 'fantastic preparations' to cope with any cases in Britain but warned he still expected to see it reach London.

'I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of ebola in this country and probably in this city,' he said, adding that it was impossible to blood test everybody coming into the country.

Britain's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said the country should expect ebola cases in the coming months. She said screening was a 'blunt instrument' but insisted it was 'the right thing to do', adding: 'It will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country, so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months.'

Mr Hunt will make a statement to the Commons today giving greater detail about the screening, and announced that he had asked for 111 workers to refer 'higher risk' cases to emergency services.

Callers with potential symptoms of ebola, including breathing problems, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, will be questioned about their travel history and those at risk of exposure will be assessed by ambulance workers 'with appropriate protective equipment', he said.

Similar questionnaires about travel history and potential exposure are expected to be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal. Travellers arriving from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - the three countries worst hit by the disease - will be quizzed, followed by health checks for those who admit they could have come into contact with the virus.

Experts warn that people could lie to avoid delays and inconvenience and that anyone with ebola can go for days or even weeks without showing any symptoms. Doctors say screening is unlikely to be effective in stopping the virus from entering Britain and have accused the Government of using it as a 'political gesture'.

In the US, it has been confirmed that a nurse in Texas has tested positive for ebola - the first person known to have caught the disease in America. The woman, who has not been named, had tended to a Liberian victim at a hospital in Dallas and authorities said her diagnosis suggested there had been a breach in safety protocol.

In Spain, another nurse who contracted the disease treating patients from West Africa remains in a serious condition in a Madrid hospital, although she is showing signs of 'slight improvement'.

Ebola has killed more than 4,000 in West Africa, although Dr David Nabarro, the British expert in charge of the UN's response, said he hoped the spread of the killer virus will be 'under control' in three months. Knowledge about the need for quarantine and isolation of sufferers was growing in the region and international help has increased, he said.

Britain has begun loading a hospital ship, RFA Argus, with medicine and equipment to take to West Africa and has promised to deploy 750 soldiers to help.

The ship, currently docked in Falmouth, Cornwall, will carry three Merlin helicopters that will be used to transport medics in the area.

A British aid flight also landed in Sierra Leone yesterday. It was delivering beds, biohazard suits, tents and ten vehicles, plus equipment for a 92-bed unit being built by a UK team.

Aid delivered so far includes ambulances, water tanks and incinerators for the disposal of contaminated material.

UNIVERSITIES are to monitor students from ebola-hit countries amid fears they could have been exposed to the deadly virus.

Some 20,000 students from the West African region worst hit by the outbreak are studying at British universities.

Cleaners in student halls have reported to been warned to watch out for symptoms including signs of blood or vomit in bedrooms.

Ebola is spread through contact with body fluids and any outbreak in shared halls could spread quickly with students sharing kitchens and bathrooms. Students have already begun to return but will be monitored for up to three weeks, the maximum incubation period for the virus, The Sunday Times reported.

Fay Sherrington, student services manager at Lancaster University, said: 'Most universities are making sure cleaners are briefed on the risks. They have more chance of coming into contact with body fluids because they are cleaning bathrooms in residences.'

LEADERS TURN A BLIND EYE TO EUROZONE FIX; MONDAY VIEW

GLOBAL Challenges, Global Solutions. They were the words plastered around the IMF and World Bank buildings during their annual meetings in Washington last week.

There was certainly no shortage of challenges for the powers that be to discuss - from the slowdown in the global economy to the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

Solutions are never so easy to come by, however, and World Bank President Jim Kim admitted that the international community had 'failed miserably' in its response to Ebola.

But it was another, more familiar failing that dominated much of the debate - the deterioration of the sclerotic eurozone.

The region now looks to be heading for its third recession since the financial crisis and the outlook for the unemployed millions is grim.

International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde even appeared to compare the state of the single currency bloc with that of Japan during its lost decade of stagnation and deflation from which it never fully recovered.

While Britain and the US are, in the IMF's words, 'approaching economic lift-off', the eurozone is back in intensive care.

The frustration is palpable. But so too is the fear.

The periphery was for a long time seen as the problem but the one-time 'PIGS' of Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain are showing signs of grasping the nettle of economic reform.

The most worrying aspect of the latest downturn in the region, which remains Britain's biggest export market, is that it is now firmly gripping the core.

Germany, France and Italy, the eurozone's three largest economies, saw their growth forecasts slashed by the IMF last week.

Britain, of course, is not immune, as the Chancellor pointed out.

For the first time since the recovery in the UK really got underway George Osborne is now warning that the British economy is slowing.

The biggest worry is Germany, where exports and industrial production have suffered their worst month for five years.

Germany is suffering in part from the sanctions and loss of confidence stemming from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine but also from sagging demand at home and among its closest neighbours.

'The issue that gives the greatest cause for concern at the moment is the German data,' the Chancellor warns.

'We know about the weakness of other European economies. Germany has been the exception. There has been surprisingly weak German data. Let us hope that doesn't continue.'

Europe, however, is split over what to do.

Germany, with the support of Osborne, is resolute in its determination to keep a tight grip on the public finances.

There is no such thing as a free lunch, is the Chancellor's mantra.

But France, Italy and others want the budget rules relaxed, while the IMF is now calling for an infrastructure spending splurge.

Against this backdrop, a coordinated response to the crisis is unlikely. Some sort of Grand Bargain even less so.

And any agreement that is reached is likely to come only after a series of very public spats between Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris and Rome.

This will do nothing to lift the 'animal spirits'. The danger is that an acrimonious process will render whatever is decided useless.

No one should be surprised.

 

O NE of the great tragedies of the euro is that there are no discussions about how to make the currency union sustainable in the long term.

The problems in the euro area are deep-seated and move from the acute to the chronic so a bit of extra spending here or a tax cut there is fiddling while Rome and the rest of the region burn.

The answer is either fiscal union - which would see German taxes paying Greek and French unemployment benefits - or the break-up of the eurozone.

But these choices are not up for discussion.

So the biggest 'challenge' to the global economy remains - yet those with the power to do something about it will not even consider 'solutions' that might work.

IF power is an aphrodisiac, it certainly seemed to work its magic on Gwyneth Paltrow when she met Barack Obama.

She appeared to flirt with the US President during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party at her home in which she openly gushed at his attractiveness.

After taking to the stage to introduce the guest of honour, the film actress was about to hand the microphone to the President when she said: Youre so handsome that I cant speak properly.

Miss Paltrow, who separated from husband Chris Martin earlier this year, added: I am one of your biggest fans, if not the biggest.

The 42-year-old, who earns £12million a film, also thanked Mr Obama for addressing equal pay for men and women because she said the issue is very important to me as a working mother.

The excruciating performance came in front of 200 guests, including actress Julia Roberts, who paid up to £25,000 to spend the evening in the back garden of her £6million Los Angeles mansion on Thursday evening. It is not thought that First Lady Michelle Obama was present.

Mr Obama, 53, thanked the actress and her children Apple, 10, and Moses, eight, for letting us crash your house.

He spoke eloquently on the ebola crisis, saying: I want to assure everybody that the likelihood of an epidemic here in the United States is extraordinarily small.

But theres a humanitarian crisis thats happening right now in West Africa where children not much older, and in some cases younger than Apple and Moses, are dying on the streets alone.

PANIC ON PLANE AS MAN SHOUTS: I'VE GOT EBOLA!

A PASSENGER caused panic on a holiday jet when he joked he had ebola.

The man had been coughing and sneezing throughout the four-hour flight before shouting: 'I have ebola. You're all screwed.

He later said he was 'just kidding' but pilots on the US Airways flight from Philadelphia alerted health officials. Four officers in full biohazard suits and masks boarded the plane when it landed at Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

Mobile phone videos showed the man being booed by his fellow passengers as he was taken off the jet, still protesting: 'I ain't from Africa.'

The 255 passengers were quarantined for two hours while officials checked the man's travel history.

Cabin crew had appealed to them to stay calm as the blue-suited experts boarded the plane.

An air stewardess said: 'I need your attention. It's going to look worse than it is. I have done this for 36 years, I think the man who said this is an idiot. I want you to keep your wits about you. We have people coming on - we've all been watching the news - they look like they're in a bubble... This is all new territory for all of us.'

The biohazard team found the man and escorted him off the plane for medical checks.

Alberto Smith, the airport's director of operations, said: 'It was a false alarm set off by a passenger who is slightly unbalanced. The passenger did it for attention and his passport does not show any recent trips to Africa.'

The airline said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused, but the safety of our customers and employees is our first priority.'

* Passengers sparked panic and a full-scale alert because they feared an elderly woman who fell ill on a coach journey was suffering from ebola.

The woman is thought to have flown to Britain from Africa before boarding a National Express service to Liverpool at Victoria station in London on Wednesday evening.

The driver alerted the authorities when she became feverish on the journey and police closed the National Express station in Liverpool. Witnesses said paramedics in full body suits and protective masks boarding the coach as passengers fled in fear. The medics spent more than two hours treating the woman, who was also placed in protective clothing before she was taken to hospital.

Doctors at Royal Liverpool University Hospital established the woman, who was in her 70s and had 'stroke-like' symptoms, did not have ebola.

BRITISH BUSINESSMAN WHO MAY HAVE DIED OF VIRUS

A BRITISH businessman who may have been killed by the ebola virus in Macedonia was vomiting and shaking for two days before he died, his travelling companion revealed yesterday.

Father-of-three Colin Jaffray, 58, travelled with business partner Michael English from the UK to the Balkan state to try to set up a fish farm business.

Health officials in Macedonia sparked an international panic in the aftermath of his death by claiming he was displaying some of the symptoms of the disease.

But Mr English said last night it was 'crazy' to think his friend was suffering from ebola - because Mr Jaffray had not travelled to Africa for six years. Claims that his friend died as a result of drinking too much alcohol were also denied.

Mr Jaffray fell ill during his stay in the Hotel Super 8 in the capital Skopje. Although feverish, he was unaware he was suffering from internal bleeding, and refused to see a doctor.

On the third morning of being ill, he was taken to hospital from his hotel by ambulance suffering from severe stomach cramps. Within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital on Thursday afternoon, he was dead.

Last night Mr English, 72, said: 'For two days he was saying he didn't feel very well. [The next] morning he said he felt better. We agreed to meet downstairs at the hotel at noon. He called and said he didn't feel good, his hands were shaking. He was confused.'

The pair travelled to Macedonia on October 2, after enjoying a farewell dinner with their wives at Mr Jaffray's home in the upmarket Cambridgeshire village of Royston.

Last night Mr English's wife Olga said Mr Jaffray appeared 'healthy and jokey' the night before he left Britain. She suggested that Mr Jaffray may have suffered from an underlying medical condition linked to his nervous system, and revealed he had been admitted to hospital in Macedonia during previous business trips. She also denied he had a drink problem.

Tests have yet to confirm his cause of death but Dr Jovanka Kostovska from the Macedonian Ministry of Health said that initial observations suggested it was not ebola.

She said none of the 25 guests and staff at the hotel or any medical staff had shown any symptoms. However, both the hotel and hospital remain under quarantine as a precaution.

Mr Jaffray leaves behind a wife Dawn, 55, who runs a catering firm, a son and two daughters.

FURIOUS nurses threw surgical gloves at Spain's prime minister yesterday in protest at the country's response to the ebola crisis.

They accused Mariano Rajoy's government of providing substandard protective clothing and training to doctors, nurses and ambulance workers.

Their protest came as Mr Rajoy visited the Madrid hospital where a nurse who tended two dying Spanish missionaries is seriously ill with the virus.

Teresa Romero's brother said her condition was critical and her family had been told to gather at the hospital. 'There isn't much hope,' he said. Fourteen people are in quarantine, including Mrs Romero's husband and three medics who treated her.

The 44-year-old nurse, who tended two priests who died after returning to Spain from Liberia with ebola, is the first person known to have caught the virus outside Africa.

Some health workers at the hospital are said to be refusing to treat possible ebola cases while others have quit their jobs.

EBOLA SCREENINGSTILL IN CHAOS

BRITAIN'S ebola screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions.

After days of Government indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus, Downing Street was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it.

With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK.

While the US said it would begin screening with temperature checks today, a Downing Street spokesman would only say that Britain's programme - consisting mainly of questionnaires - would start 'as soon as possible in the coming days'.

Last night airports, airlines and Eurostar all said they were still waiting for instructions. Gatwick said it knew nothing about the new measures, with an airport spokesman adding: 'We've not had anything at all. We're still waiting for Public Health England.'

Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work. Labour MP Keith Vaz said the lack of precise information was 'shambolic' and critics called the proposed questionnaires 'a complete waste of time'.

David Cameron said the Government was 'taking all the steps we can' to keep Britain safe from ebola but experts said the continued spread of the disease meant it was likely to arrive in this country soon.

The UN warned the number of cases is doubling every four weeks, with more than 4,000 people now dead in the worst ever outbreak of the virus.

Downing Street said screening will be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the St Pancras Eurostar terminal for passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa - the three nations at the centre of the outbreak.

They will be given a questionnaire about their potential exposure to ebola and their health. Those assessed to pose a risk will have their temperature checked to test for a fever. Any with a high temperature will be isolated while they undergo further tests.

But critics said a sufferer could show no symptoms on arrival in Britain but still fall ill days later.

Others said travellers would lie on questionnaires to avoid delays.

David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the proposed screening was 'a complete waste of time'.

He said: 'Why would anyone admit they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control?'

Asked if he believed ebola would reach Britain, he said: 'I think it's bound to happen.'

Passengers arriving at Heathrow from Nigeria said their temperatures were taken in Abuja before they boarded, but there were no checks on arrival in Britain - or any warnings about symptoms or where to seek help if they fell ill.

GONE GIRL AND THIS WORRYING DEMONISING OF HUSBANDS
BY AMANDA PLATELL

THE book has sold six million copies. The film has taken £53 million at the box office. No wonder everyone is talking about Gone Girl — not least because Gillian Flynn's thriller invites all married couples to assess just how well they truly know their other halves.

Flynn said the basis of the novel was her belief that marriage is one 'long con'. Herein lies the most chilling aspect of her story — its casual demonising of husbands as ineffectual, unreliable, selfish oafs.

This has become a constant refrain in popular culture today. Whether in films, books, newspaper columns, TV shows or adverts . . . husbands are inevitably portrayed as irritating, inadequate, barely house-trained Neanderthals.

If they don't snore or leave their wet towel on the floor, they refuse to do their fair share of household chores. Like the husband in Gone Girl, they disappoint at every level.

But do we ever stop to think how much we women might disappoint men in marriage? If we are honest, how often does he come last in our list of priorities — behind the children, our parents, our careers, even our pets?

Much though we may moan, the vast majority of husbands I know work themselves to the bone, trying to do the best for their families in tough economic times. Is it any wonder young men are put off marriage altogether? The average age a man marries is now 37.

Do women think constantly harping on about their men's shortcomings is conducive to a deep and fulfilling relationship? It's basic psychology that if you constantly tell a person they're worthless, they will act as if they are.

A particularly nasty side-effect of the feminist revolution is that in securing equality, too many women seem hell-bent on reducing men to second-class citizens.

We want men to play an equal part in parenting. Yet fathers rarely win custody of their children if a marriage falls apart, though they are inevitably forced to foot the bill to care for an ex-wife and family, even if it's the wife who has left.

Women should remember they are not perfect. So why do so many of us expect our men to be? Why denigrate the men we fell in love with?

One thing I am sure of. That if we take a Gone Girl view of marriage, the only thing likely to be gone is our husbands.

A REAL ROLE MODEL

THE girl who survived an assassination attempt by Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Malala Yousafzai was targeted because she insisted on going to school even though it was prohibited by the Taliban.

Now living in Birmingham, she continues her tireless work of trying to secure education for other girls.

What a contrast to Salma and Zahra Halane, who took their British education for granted and fled to Syria to become jihadist brides, forfeiting their freedom and embracing a life of ignorance and utter servitude.

If there was a Nobel Prize for ingratitude, they surely deserve it.

JUSTICE FORJULIA

RUMOURS abound that Julia Roberts is divorcing cameraman husband Danny Moder (pictured with the star), despite a year of 'couple's therapy'. She's said to object to him working on movies without her, as she's worried he'll be unfaithful.

Given that when Moder met Julia (on a film set) he ditched his long-term partner to be with her, I'd say what goes around, comes around.

NOT A SEX CRIME... JUST VERY STUPID

HUNGER Games star Jennifer Lawrence says she'd swap all her millions rather than have had to call her father and say her naked photos had been hacked. She insists the sharing of intimate images intended for an ex-boyfriend should be treated as a 'sex crime'. What is a crime against humanity is that we have to endure listening to these celebrities, who make their millions flaunting themselves, whining on about 'violation' having been stupid enough to pose for personal porn shots in the first place.

WESTMINSTER NOTICEBOARD...

+ Miriam Clegg said in an interview she didn't want it all, she just wanted what men have. In her husband's case, that would be a job he doesn't deserve and the utter contempt of the nation.

+ speaking of leaders' spouses, Mrs Farage has kept out of the public eye. The absence of the tokenistic political wife might be one of the best things yet to emerge from the Ukip bandwagon.

+ More must be done to support women in the workplace, says Theresa May. So why has she sacked her special adviser, the clever Fiona Cunningham, after an unseemly row with Michael Gove, and has only one very junior female minister in the Home Office?

+ Before the by-elections, Boris Johnson described Ukip supporters as the kind of people who might engage in unusual practices with vacuum cleaners. In the end they sucked up Tory and Labour votes more efficiently than a Dyson.

+ A new poll says women MPs are more likely to have a drink problem and unhealthy lifestyle than men. Only 19 per cent of male MPs said they drank to excess — proving they are liars or just too drunk to remember.

He misses her every day, he says, while promoting his new book Killers Of The King: The Men Who Dared To Execute Charles I.

DESPITE her polite smile, I can't imagine the Queen was 'purring' with pleasure when she awarded Hollywood star Angelina Jolie an honorary damehood for her campaign to end sexual violence in war zones.

Miss Jolie had said she would dedicate her working life to the cause. Her comments had echoes of the Queen's solemn act of dedication in 1947, aged 21 when she pledged: 'I declare that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.'

HEALTH officials warn the ebola threat is equal to that of Aids, yet the world is desperately slow to act.

TRAVEL FIRMS SEE STOCK GROUNDED

AS governments around the world announced more measures to curb the spread of the deadly ebola virus from Africa, travel-related stocks took flight on worries travellers will be put off going abroad because of the escalating outbreak.

Holidays firm TUI Travel was a big blue-chip casualty, losing 13.1p at 343.8p, while cruise ship operator Carnival fell 61p to 2207p, and British Airways owner IAG shed 7.6p at 325.4p.

Drug makers also came under pressure as they struggle to find a cure, or at least something to prevent the spread of the virus, took a toll, with GlaxoSmithKline down 20p at 1375p.

But although the sectors have been knocked by the ebola fear, one leading online broker said it had seen a 33pc increase in customers actively trading travel and pharma stocks as some investors take advantage of the drops in share prices.

Darren Hepworth, director Global Trading and Product at TD Direct Investing, said: 'This is not the first time investors have capitalised on the economic impact of a virus outbreak.

'When swine flu hit in 2009 we saw trading by TD customers increase heavily as fears infected the stock markets.'

City broker Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note earlier this week that it viewed the SARS pandemic in Asia during 2002-03 as the closest parallel to the potential impact from ebola.

During November 2002 to March 2003, the broker noted, the global airlines sector fell by around 25pc as tourism in some regions dropped by 90pc.

However, Cantor added, the sector rebounded strongly in the following six months, bouncing about 50pc, helped by a strong recovery in the global economy. 'If the ebola case in Spain is a one-off and the virus is contained, the sector should rally sharply, in our view. Otherwise, expect a sharp but perhaps short-lived sell-off,' analysts at Cantor concluded.

But while a strong economy recovery helped the post-SARS bounce back in 2003, the current global growth outlook looks far from healthy, with worries about the impact from ebola and a struggling eurozone economy again taking their toll on stock markets.

After a roller-coaster week, the FTSE 100 Index closed down 91.88 points at 6339.97 - another year's low - while the FTSE 250 index dropped 169.75 points to 14,641.58.

American blue chips were volatile in early trading, swinging higher than lower then higher again. A reversal by heavyweight mining stocks was a drag, with the sector having notched up gains in the previous session thanks to support from firmer metal prices after the dollar fell on Federal Reserve comment that US interest rates are unlikely to rise soon.

Having been a strong riser then, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo lost 21p at 749p, while Anglo American shed 30.5p at 1325.5p, and Chilean copper miner Antofagasta was down 24.5p at 661.5p losing recent support from some broker upgrades.

Mid cap India-focused miner Vedanta Resources suffered as well after issuing a mixed production update for the second quarter, falling 71p to 852.5p.

With crude prices weak again on fears of oversupply and falling demand, explorer Tullow Oil was the biggest blue-chip big loser, dropping nearly 8pc or 45p to 526p after the company said oil shows at the Sputnik-1 well on its part-owned Arouwe block offshore Gabon were 'non-commercial'.

Broker comment weighed on some blue chips too, with tobacco firm BAT down 53.5p to 3427p as broker Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating to sell from neutral in a review of the consumer staples sector.

Grolsch brewer SABMiller fell 7.5p to 3290p despite Goldman reiterating its positive stance on the stock, still seen as a potential bid target for global peer AB InBev, in the same review.

RSA Insurance was among the few FTSE 100 gainers, adding 2p at 465p with traders mentioning positive data on UK car insurance pricing from a Confused.com/Towers Watson survey.

On the second line, utilities provider Telecom Plus, which trades under the Utility Warehouse brand was by far the best performer, up 86p to 1342p after saying it expects first half profits to be 'significantly ahead' of the previous year.

Among the small caps, cloud service provider Outsourcery jumped 3pc higher, up 0.5p to 17p on news Encore Capital subscribed for 5m new shares in the company at 20p each, giving it a 10.6pc holding.

But plastics firm Carclo dropped more than 15pc, or 17.5p to 95.5p, as it launched a full strategic review of its underperforming inkjet technology business.

***

IN spite of the glum market environment, a new issue saw good demand on AIM, with business-grade broadband, mobile and data services provider Gamma Communications returning a decent premium. Floated at 187p a share, the stock raced up to 212p before closing at 205p. Gamma's sale of around 44m shares raised about £83m for selling shareholders making it the second-largest float of a UK telecoms firm since 2000 based on capital raised.

DARK CLOUDS OVER THE FTSE

WHAT a confusing week it has been for investors. On the positive side the IMF gave Britain top marks for growth and the UK is about to become the second  largest economy in the  European Union, as we leave ailing France for dust.But as the Chancellor George Osborne acknowledged in Washington, the descent of the eurozone into Japanese-style stagnation and deflation cannot possibly be helpful to the British economy.This was illustrated by the latest figures, showing that while the trade deficit narrowed this was largely due to falling imports.Exports continue to disappoint, dropping by 0.7pc in July. As one of the world's most open economies, the UK is particularly vulnerable to strife overseas from meltdown in euroland to the ebola epidemic.We should not be too surprised then that the FTSE 100 slipped 8pc over the week and has fallen to its lowest level in 12 months.

As a barometer of future growth that can hardly be considered positive.Then there is the Nigel Farage effect to think about.If the psephologists have it right, Ukip has held open the door to a Labour government next May should the swings of opinion in Clacton and Heywood Middleton be a clue to the outcome of the general election.If that is the case, then all investors have to look forward to is a populist Labour government vowing to clamp down on enterprise including the energy companies, the banks, the house builders, the out-sourcers and middle class voters living in houses that happen to have risen in value.If Ed Miliband in office is anything like the anti-capitalist in opposition, then Britain could find itself dragged into the mire despite growth's robust return.More for lessBRITAIN has long prided itself on having superior supermarkets to our competitors. Indeed, most of us who have shopped in Continental Europe or North America would find it hard to disagree.The business reality is rather different. For the big food shops, it is the foreign owned chains Asda and increasingly Lidl and Aldi that are making the strides. And in clothing, overseas-owned Zara, HM and Primark (an Irish-based enterprise) are making our nation of shopkeepers look a little pedestrian.One was reminded of this with the release of results from Asda, owned by US giant Walmart. Market share may have slipped a little but like-for-like sales and total sales growth are on the up and operating profits climbed by 18.2pc to £993.9m. If the trends continue it could soon join the select group of UK enterprises earning over a billion pounds a year.Asda is achieving this through a 'Price Lock', which keeps down the cost of everyday essentials without a serious impact on margins.Nor is there any indication that the timing of when Asda records the profits from supplier rebates is dodgy, as appears to have been the case at Tesco.The clue to Asda's ability to keeping ahead of the pack is what it calls an 'Operate for Less' programme which focuses on keeping costs down through greater productivity and more efficient logistics. Rivals could learn from this.There is no doubt that as a non-quoted company in the UK, Asda is able to operate below the radar and every dip in sales or margins adjustment is not seen as a disaster that sends the share price skidding, with an impact on other stakeholders. It does demonstrate that with the right stewardship foreign ownership can work.Spiked forecastTHE IMF may be regretting the decision to publish a box in its latest World Economic Report warning of the impending dangers of an 'oil price spike' as a consequence of geopolitical risk. It notes that if Iraq's oil supplies were to drop by 50pc, as Islamic State gathers momentum, then prices could jump by 20pc. Maybe. But as tensions in the Middle East rose this week the price of Brent crude dipped to $89-a-barrel, the lowest level for more than for four years. Oh dear.War horseGEORGE Osborne's normal practice after the exertions of the IMF meetings is to take himself off to American Civil War battlefields for some RR. This year he, Mark Carney and top US financial officials are going to conduct 'war games' of a different kind by re-enacting the failure of a great transatlantic bank. Hopefully they will learn from the experience.Nine months before the eruption of the crisis at Northern Rock in 2007 the then regulator the Financial Services Authority carried out 'war games' to test the robustness of Britain's banking system.It found that the government's compensation system for depositors was wholly inadequate. Nothing was done. Britain ended up being labelled a 'banana republic' as the run on the Rock unfolded.

BIOTECH IS A TONIC FOR INVESTORS

A RACE to find the cure for the ebola virus has thrown the spotlight on biotech firms. Healthcare funds have skyrocketed in recent years. Polar Capital Healthcare would have turned £1,000 into £2,401 in just three years.

Axa Framlington Biotech - the top performer out of every UK fund over that period - would have made £2,783. And by investing in these funds you can back some of the companies which are pioneering vital cures for chronic illnesses.

THE virus which destroys the liver is transferred by blood, and often a result of sharing needles.

In the US some 1.4m were diagnosed last year, and it is estimated that the same amount again went undiagnosed.

Until now treatments have had cure rates of around 45pc and come with severe side effects.

A new drug - Sovaldi - has become the fastest selling drug of all time after bringing the cure rate to almost 100pc.

Linden Thomson, manager of the Axa Framlington Biotech fund, says: 'In 2007 more people in the US died from hep C than from HIV. This drug has been a huge driver for the share prices of Gilead, which owns the product.'

First year sales of Sovaldi are expected to top £6.25bn.

FIBROSIS is caused by fattiness on the liver, which is becoming more common due to rising levels of obesity. The liver can regenerate and repair itself but fibrosis occurs when it can no longer do this fast enough to tackle the damage.

Fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and ultimately cancer. 'At the moment all doctors can recommend is diet and exercise. A new product is moving into the final phase of trials next year and if that's successful it will reverse the disease,' says Thomson.

But even at this stage there is only a 50pc chance of the drug being approved for market.

THERE'S a huge amount of work around cancer, especially immunotherapy. This aims to kick start your immune system into attacking the tumour, which the body does not recognise as a disease.

'People are very excited about the theoretical idea about turning on a person's immune system to enable it to kill the cells,' says Gareth Powell, manager of the Polar Capital Healthcare fund.

Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca are working on this.

IN the future you could survive a chronic disease such as cancer only to die from a simple infection after grazing your knee.

'After antibiotics were developed, the industry felt the problem of infection was solved and moved on to chronic illnesses. Now infections have mutated,' says Thomson.

Smaller firms including Cubist, Cempra, Tetraphase and Achaogen are working on the issue. If they make breakthroughs they could be bought by larger firms, which would boost share prices.

ALZHEIMER'S is expected to cost £620bn every year in the US by 2050. If the symptoms could be delayed by just five years that figure would halve. But it is still not entirely clear what causes the disease or how it progresses. Because of that there is nothing specific drug companies can look to target.

'If someone could do something about Alzheimer's it would be the biggest drug in the world,' says Powell.

NEXT Generation Frequency is the scientific name for looking at a person's DNA and spotting mutations in their genes, which show if they have a predisposition to a particular disease. 'For example,' says Powell, 'in cancer, if you can identify those cells then you can target and destroy those rather than just treating the tumour they are causing. It is truly personalised medicine.'

DIABETES is increasingly common as obesity levels rise.

Powell says better scan imaging could be a major innovation.

'Often scans can't detect blood flow clearly enough so diabetic patients have amputations because it looks like their limb is dying.

'If we can see better, we can see it might just be a blockage which could be easily fixed.'

Continual glucose monitoring is also being researched. Rather than manually prick your finger several times a day to test sugar levels, a sensor would be planted under the skin sending a signal to a device in your pocket. This alerts the user when their glucose levels dip.

FOR many, the idea of effectively making millions out of other people's misery won't sit well.

Investors are making a fortune from some of these shares, as are the firms - for example, Sovaldi originally sold for $1,000 per pill.

Thomson says: 'Companies are spending hundreds of billions of pounds developing these drugs and many will never make it to market. They have to price those failures in or they wouldn't make any money.'

Powell adds: 'There are a lot of moral and philosophical issues when investing in these companies, and it's not something you have to consider when you invest in any other industry.'

? RECENT years have been successful for these managers but investors should be careful when considering these funds. It is still an incredibly risky sector.

EUROZONE IS IN EYE OF A STORM

EUROPEAN stock markets tumbled again yesterday as fears deepened over the outlook for the global economy and the single currency bloc.

The FTSE 100 index fell 91.88 points to 6,339.97 in London - taking losses for the week to 3.1pc. It has now shed 8pc of its value since last month's peak of 6878.

The sell-off was echoed in Europe with shares in Frankfurt down 2.4pc, Paris off 1.64pc and Milan 0.94pc lower on another bleak day for savers and investors.

It came as George Osborne warned that the global economy is at a 'critical' juncture with the eurozone heading towards crisis.

'We are at a critical moment for the British economy and the world economy,' he said on the fringes of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. 'Serious clouds are gathering on the horizon.'

He pointed to the deteriorating outlook for the global economy - the Fund this week cut forecasts for world growth from 3.4pc to 3.3pc for this year and 4pc to 3.8pc for next year - and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as the spread of the ebola virus.

'But the biggest risk to the global economy at the moment and to the UK economy at the moment is the risk of the eurozone falling back into recession and into crisis,' the Chancellor added. 'We have seen growth forecasts cut back not just in Italy and France but also in Germany and unemployment remains over 11pc in the euro area.

'This is a weak position for these eurozone economies to weather further deterioration in their economic performance. The UK is not immune to these developments.'

Worries about the global economy also drove Brent crude oil down to as low as $88.40 a barrel, a level not seen for nearly four years.

'Stock markets are getting battered again,' said Craig Erlam, market analyst at City trading firm Alpari. 'People have been talking for such a long time about when we will get a big correction in the markets but these figures suggest that they are under way and momentum is not slowing.'

It rounded off a dismal week for investors who have been spooked by warnings that the eurozone is heading for recession and a bout of Japan-style deflation.

The outlook for the rest of the world has also deteriorated - although the IMF this week said the US and UK remain in good health. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said its investor confidence index is at the lowest level for two years. The last time it was this low, the FTSE 100 stood at 5,800.

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Negative sentiment is rife in the market right now, and indeed if you look around the globe there is no shortage of troubles to worry about.

'The eurozone is flirting with deflation. At the same time there are political tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the spreading ebola virus to concern investors.'

Britain is expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world this year, expanding at more than twice the pace of Germany and eight times the pace of France. Official figures this week showed Germany, Europe's largest economy and the eurozone's engine of growth, suffered the biggest fall in exports and industrial production for more than five years.

German exports tumbled 5.8pc in August while industrial production was down 4pc.

Richard Grievson, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, described the figures as 'disastrous' and warned that 'things may well get worse before they get better'.

He added: 'Germany's ever-growing importance to aggregate eurozone growth indicates that things could get very messy in the bloc in the next few quarters.'

HOSPITALS WILL REHEARSE FOR AN EMERGENCY

HOSPITALS are to carry out ebola drills this weekend to ensure they are prepared to deal with infected patients.

Simulation exercises are taking place in at least two major trusts - one in the North, one in the South - although others may be instructed to follow suit. At each, an actor will pretend to be a patient struck down with the virus.

Yesterday A&E units across the country were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby, including masks, goggles and gowns. Yet staff at some hospitals say they haven't received the clothing.

As part of the drills, the 'patient' will turn up at a GP surgery or an A&E unit with mock early symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and sickness.

Doctors are meant to ask 'have you travelled recently', and if the patient has been to countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia - immediately suspect they have ebola. Staff will put on protective clothing and the patient will be taken by ambulance to the hospital where the drill is taking place. Once they have been dropped off, the ambulance will be thoroughly decontaminated with a powerful chemical.

Staff across the trust will be warned about the drill beforehand, but many may get only a few hours' notice - especially those working on other wards.

Patients and relatives will also be informed that an exercise is under way - although they may not be told that it is an 'ebola drill', in case it creates panic.

The Department of Health - which is overseeing the drills - will not to disclose which hospitals are involved, but they will most probably take place at one of four with specialist infectious disease departments: the Royal Free in North London, the Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Throughout the drill, officials will check that staff take all the appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the virus.

Public health officials in the nearby area will also work out how best to alert members of the public who may have come into contact with the patient without causing mass panic.

HOW WE'LL SCREEN TRAVELLERS: ASK THEM HOW THEY'RE FELLING!

DETAILS of the British ebola screening programme were revealed yesterday - but critics immediately dismissed it as not going far enough.

While the US has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun, the British response amounts to little more than a few questions.

It will be introduced at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals for passengers travelling from the affected West African regions.

The tests will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history and who they have been in contact with, as well as a possible medical assessment. Passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea will be identified by information passed from airlines and diverted into a separate queue at customs.

In a holding area, they will be asked how they are feeling, whether they have been in contact with ebola victims and if they have touched bush meat.

If the medical staff are concerned, they will start a full assessment. But they will stop short of screening the temperatures of passengers using thermal guns, a procedure which will be adopted in the US this weekend.

Thermal screening, which was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002, picks out passengers who have an elevated temperature using an infrared temperature gun.

In the affected countries, 36,000 people have been tested and 77 have been stopped from boarding flights since health tests were introduced two months ago.

They were identified after temperature checks found they had a fever. Ultimately none of those stopped was diagnosed as having ebola. In many cases they were suffering from malaria, a disease rife in the region.

Experts have warned that screening will not necessarily pick up ebola sufferers because the virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days before symptoms emerge.

Academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area.

The British Government has so far announced few specific details about how it will implement the new screening checks at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras station.

Professor David Mabey from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said questionnaires were a waste of time and that passengers would lie.

He added: 'If last week your aunt died of ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday?'

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was prudent to carry out checks on passengers entering the UK.

'Targeted screening would help and if it discovers just one case it would make a huge difference,' he said. 'We don't want to be in the position where they are in Spain, where one case has caused so much distress.'

Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, sounded a note of caution.

He said: 'Temperature screening proved very effective at controlling the SARS outbreak, because you can spot those people who have a fever when they are at their most infectious.

'With ebola, in a similar way, anyone who is infectious should be picked up. But in the incubation period of up to 21 days, when there are no symptoms and it is not infectious, it would not work and someone could slip through. My worry is that screening could engender a false sense of security.'

FEARS OVER AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTEER NURSE
BY RICHARD SHEARS

A NURSE who volunteered to fight the ebola outbreak in Africa was last night waiting to learn if she had caught the deadly disease.

Sue-Ellen Kovack developed a fever after returning home to Australia from a month-long stint with the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone.

Health authorities said she had followed quarantine guidelines but local politician Bob Katter accused her and other aid workers of putting the nation at risk.

He said: 'We honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia.'

Miss Kovack, 57, flew home to Cairns in Northern Australia on Tuesday. She had no symptoms during her journey and began a recommended 'home isolation' - a self-imposed quarantine which was supposed to last for 21 days, in line with Australian government policy. But yesterday she developed a 'low-grade fever' and checked herself into hospital for tests.

While in Sierra Leone, the nurse worked in makeshift field hospitals and treated ebola victims, including taking blood from an infected 11-year-old.

In an interview before she left for Sierra Leone, Miss Kovack admitted she was nervous but insisted she wanted to help despite the risk of infection. She said: 'People put up their hands because they have an interest in their fellow man - that's why I'm going.

'I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills. Why me? Well, if not me, then who?'

In the US, patients at a hospital where a Liberian diagnosed with ebola was treated are refusing to attend appointments.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died at the Texas Health hospital in Dallas on Wednesday after ten days of treatment, and staff said patients had failed to show up because of fear they would catch the disease.

Sheriff's deputy Michael Monnig, who went into Mr Duncan's apartment without wearing protective gear, has been admitted to hospital after falling ill.

A nurse who caught ebola in Spain was said to have deteriorated yesterday as three medics who treated her were monitored for the disease.

Mrs Romero's brother, Jose Ramon, said her condition had deteriorated but that doctors were trying a different medication in a bid to fight the disease. She had been receiving injections of antibodies extracted from the blood of ebola virus survivors to help her immune system combat the infection.

In Paris, a social services building was sealed off by health officials after an Ebola scare. About 60 people were effectively quarantined inside the building in the suburb of Cergy Pontoise, north-west of Paris, after four people from Guinea complained of severe headaches.

The alert was called off last night after it was declared a false alarm.

Meanwhile, a Prague hospital is testing a 56-year-old Czech man with ebola symptoms. The man had recently travelled in Liberia.

SCREENING SHAMBLES OVER EBOLA

MINISTERS were accused of a chaotic response to the ebola crisis last night after it emerged new screening measures amounted to little more than a questionnaire.

Downing Street finally announced what tests would be put in place at UK borders for travellers from the three worst affected West African nations.

The row came as ebola was feared to have claimed its first British fatality.

A man with a fever and internal bleeding died after he was taken to hospital in Macedonia. Last night the Government admitted the main new measure against the disease reaching Britain would be a basic passenger questionnaire - and not US-style temperature screening which has been proven effective in other outbreaks.

Critics said passengers would simply lie on the questionnaire.

Others accused the Government of sending out mixed messages and simply not doing enough to protect the public from a disease which is now thought to have claimed victims in Spain, America and Australia as well as in Africa.

In a further sign of indecision, ministers appeared unsure of exactly when the screening would start, how many 'medical staff' would be needed to carry it out, or where they would come from.

Downing Street insisted ministers were simply adjusting policy in line with medical advice.

On a day of escalating panic over the spread of the virus it emerged:

?Hospitals are to carry out drills this weekend to ensure they are prepared to deal with infected patients - but some warned they did not have the equipment they needed,

?An African airline announced it would restart direct flights between Gatwick and Sierra Leone from next week, despite the dangers,

?The scientist who first discovered ebola said it was inevitable that the

virus would spread to Britain,

?Officials investigated whether the first case of ebola had arrived in Australia,

?The condition of a Spanish nurse infected with the disease deteriorated as three medics who treated her were monitored, The top US health official said this has become the biggest health crisis since the emergence of Aids 30 years ago,

?Sixty people were sealed inside a social services building in Paris during a false ebola scare.

The 58-year-old British victim, who has not been named, was admitted to hospital in Macedonia at 3pm local time yesterday but his condition deteriorated and he died several hours later.

The country's health officials say his symptoms raised 'suspicions' that he was infected with ebola and samples have been sent to Germany for testing

If confirmed, it will be the first time that a UK national has died from the highly infectious virus. The man was said to have been 'unresponsive' by the time he reached the hospital.

He and his friend travelled to Skopje from Britain on October 2, and had been staying in the three-star Hotel Super 8, where rooms start at £39 a night.

Police have now quarantined the hotel in the capital Skopje where the man and a second Briton had been staying.

Dr Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian health ministry's commission for infectious diseases, said the Briton had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding.

'These are all symptoms of ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,' she told a hastily-convened news conference.

But the man is not believed to have visited any of the West African countries affected by the outbreak.

On a day of political chaos over the disease in Britain, David Cameron ordered the screening start just hours after his own Defence Secretary insisted it would be pointless.

A No 10 spokesman said: 'Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals.

'It will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements as well as a possible medical assessment, conducted by trained medical personnel rather than Border Force staff.'

The U-turn came just hours after Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, insisted that screening would not be introduced, even after the US had announced it would start monitoring passengers at American airports.

And in a further damning indictment of the Government's chaotic response to the escalating crisis, health officials were still insisting last night that screening at UK borders would be ineffective.

Just an hour before the announcement, Public Health England told the Mail: 'Screening is not an effective way to prevent the virus spreading.'

Hospitals were last night bracing for ebola patients on British wards, with at least two planning to carry out 'dry runs' of infection scenarios.

But some hospitals warned they did not have the masks, goggles and gowns they needed to take even the most basic precautions.

Last night Rory Stewart, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence select committee, was among a number who questioned whether the screening programme would be effective.

He pointed out that the programme omits most airports and does not include any sea ports.

Mr Stewart told Channel 4 News: 'I'd like to see more British investment, more British troops, more British development workers in west Africa tackling this.'

Experts also warned that the monitoring announced by Downing Street would fail. Professor David Mabey from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said he believes questionnaires are a waste of time.

He said: 'I think people will lie. They don't want to be subjected to the inconvenience.'

Mary Creagh, Labour's transport spokesman, said: 'Our Government has been sending out mixed messages on screening, with ministers saying contradictory things and silence from the Department for Transport. The public deserves better.'

Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: 'It is really important with an issue as serious as this that there is a consistent and clear message from government.'

Professor Tom Solomon, the University of Liverpool's head of infection and global health, said the announced measures offered little more than reassurance for a worried public.

Downing Street said there had been no change in policy. A spokesman said they had the medical advice throughout and as that has changed, they have adapted their approach.

 

IN WHITEHALL, THREE DAYS OF CONFUSION

TUESDAY International Development Secretary Justine Greening says after news that a Spanish nurse had been diagnosed with ebola: 'It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK. The controls are there.' But Home Office Minister Norman Baker calls it 'a very concerning development' and said the case for screening at airports had to be examined.

WEDNESDAY US says it will start screening at five major airports but Public Health England says: 'There are no plans to introduce entry screening for ebola in the UK.'

YESTERDAY MORNING Defence Secretary Michael Fallon insists: 'The World Health Organisation advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure that people who are leaving are not infected'.

yesterDAY LUNCHTIME George Osborne appears to give the opposite impression, saying: 'If the medical advice is we need to screen...then we will absolutely take that action.'

yesterDAY AFTERNOON Public Health England appears confused by the Chancellor's suggestion, saying it stood by its decision not to screen but it added of its stance: 'We don't think that is going to change.'

LAST NIGHT Downing Street announces 'enhanced screening arrangements' - extra questioning - at the UK's main ports for people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Noteworthy things grandmothers have done this week. In Durham, Kim Hannant helped launch the national flu jab campaign after her daughter died from flu days after giving birth.

'I don't want any other family to go through what we have been through,' she said, putting her grief aside for the greater good of strangers. Mrs Hannant is also bringing up her two grandchildren, aged four and eight months, following the death of her daughter. Not what she expected to be doing as she approaches old age, but she is just getting on with it.

Elsewhere, a grandmother in Oldham has successfully given up cigarettes after smoking 20 a day for 45 years. 'My skin now has more colour in it,' chirped 68-year-old Audrey Shearing.

In Manchester, keen golfing granny Cecilia Leigh will celebrate her 100th birthday with friends and family before flying out on another holiday to Tenerife.

Meanwhile, in Central London, an 88-year-old great-grandmother of four, grandmother of eight, mother of four and defender of the realm to boot, graciously accepted an apology from her idiot Prime Minister, who boasted to the world that she 'purred' after the Scots voted No to independence. Evidence of this gracious apology? The fact that Cameron's head is not on a pike on Tower Bridge.

My point is that gran power is on the rise. Once upon a time, not so long ago, grannies were little old ladies who smelled of lily of the valley soap and had drifts of Coty powder nestling in their downy cheeks like freshly fallen snow.

Like reindeers and plum pudding, they appeared once a year at Christmas, with presents and shortbread. Then they would vanish back into the mists of Gran-land, the last stop but one on the Old Lady Highway. Not any more.

Today's grandmothers are capable, energetic, dynamic members of society. They seem to have worked out how to live well and prosper without demanding too much of themselves and those close to them.

Take Nancy Birtwhistle, the worthy winner of this year's Great British Bake Off. Much has been made of the fact that Nancy, 60, is the oldest contestant ever to win the show, but that is only a tiny part of her story.

A grandmother to eight and mother to five, Nancy raised her family before returning to education and completing a master's degree. She then worked as a GP practice manager before retiring, and, at some point along the way, took up dog training while trying to discipline the family pet.

Being Nancy, she became so good at it she ended up competing at Crufts. Determined and focused, glamorous and in her prime, she is an inspiration for those of us who once feared that life as we know it would end at 60 in a slurry of support tights and shattered hips and dreams.

She didn't want it all, all of the time. She worked out how to get it all in her own time — in quite a wonderful way.

Elsewhere, an Age UK survey showed that grandparents provide more than £6 billion of free childcare each year to help their own children go out to work. Is that entirely fair to rely on the olds for gratis kiddy-wrangling?

I suppose they wouldn't do it if they didn't want to, yet it is a reminder of the important role of the older generation in the framework of many lives.

Never mind disgruntled teachers going on strike, if grans did the same thing, the economy would grind to a halt overnight.

In their own quiet and unassuming way, over 65s now contribute £61 billion to the economy, including £37 billion from employment, with over a million over-65s still in paid work.

Good to know — considering those of us who hover in the age strata to the south of this are all going to have to work until we drop anyway.

So, a big kiss and a smart salute to Kim, Audrey, Cecilia, Ma'am, Nancy and all the rest.

In individual and special ways they are an inspiration, showing us all that the path towards glorious grandom need not be paved with gloom.

WOULD YOU WANT YOUR SON TO CHEER ON A RAPIST?

The London School of Economics is one of the top universities in the world, known as a centre of educational excellence.

How sad that the men's rugby club has been disbanded after members distributed a sexist and homophobic leaflet during Freshers' Week. The flyers described women as 'mingers', 'slags' and 'trollops', then included some homophobic slurs for good measure.

It's depressing to think that young men who are supposed to be among the academic elite think like this, men who are supposed to go on to become captains of industry and masters of the universe. Even worse that they thought there was nothing wrong with their offensive and shameful attitudes.

Yet should we be surprised? The world around them is full of mixed messages. Look at the case of footballer Ched Evans, the 25-year-old Wales and Sheffield United striker, jailed for five years in 2012 for rape, and who is due for release from prison soon — distressingly soon.

To their credit, the football club cancelled his contract after the conviction, and 90,000 fans signed a petition saying they did not want him back. One might imagine Evans would now be banned from every football pitch in the land, but not a bit of it.

The Professional Footballers Association, the players' union, says there is no limitation on him going back out on the pitch. He has served his time for his crime, and should be allowed to play for any team who want him.

No one is saying that Evans should not get a second chance to try to redeem his life, but surely not in the public arena of football?

Wouldn't it be wonderful if, for once, the PFA would make a proper stand against this and proclaim that any players convicted of violence against women, in any shape or form, will be banned for life.

Instead, the PFA will issue a mimsy, hand-wringing statement about not condoning violence to women. Yet what good does that do when a player convicted of a serious sexual assault will be allowed to return to the sport as if nothing had happened? Think of the message that sends to men and boys.

Would you want your son, husband, brother or partner supporting a team among whose number is a convicted rapist? No, me neither.

A BUNCH OF FIRST-CLASS CHUMPS

Total dope Will.I.Am, right, had a Twitter Me.L.Tdown after being bumped from his flight because he arrived only 45 minutes before it took off.

Just like Alec Baldwin, when he was kicked off an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his phone. And Naomi Campbell, who once had to be escorted off a plane by police after throwing a hissy fit when one of her bags went missing.

Memo to Celebs. When taking a flight, please note that you have got to turn up at the right time and behave nicely like everyone else.

Or else pay for the private jet and behave like a spoilt brat to your heart's content.

 

DO YOU THINK THAT'S WISE, SIR?

Nearly 50 years after the first shows were broadcast by the BBC, the members of the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard and their dotty adventures are as popular as ever.

It's still such a treat to come across a stray episode on a rainy Saturday afternoon; the serge uniforms, the rheumatic knees, the struggle against the evil Hun and the even worse ARP Warden Hodges.

The adventures and the rock solid scripts may have been different each week, but knowing that Captain Mainwaring will always get his comeuppance, that Sergeant Wilson will be diffident in the face of danger and that Corporal Jones will behave like a ninny brings the comfort and laughter of the familiar. But now Dad's Army is to be given the Hollywood treatment and make a comeback on the silver screen.

The big question is, do you think that is wise, sir?

Why spoil something so perfect? Yes, the casting is fantastic. In fact, with Toby Jones as Mainwaring and Michael Gambon as Godfrey, it could not be more perfect.

Catherine Zeta-Jones storming around Walmington as a sexy reporter? Private Pike. Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me?

He might be pleased, but I'm not. Shouldn't film-makers forge their own legends instead of treading on the khaki coat tails of others?

BIANCA'S RIDING HER HOBBY HORSES AGAIN

Bianca Jagger (right) was on Newsnight this week, invited on to spout inanities in the celebrity activist tradition.

Bianca is a self-styled environmentalist and humanist, who clearly sees herself as a femme serieuse. What is she against? Whaddya got?

She's against fracking, GM crops, Ebola, genocide, climate change, tidal power, crimes against humanity and double parking. Perhaps she will join Nick Clegg and his Lib Dems against jihadi uprisings. In the meantime, she is the living proof that those who know little about science and politics shouldn't chunter on about science and politics just because they're famous.

Blow-drying your own hair? Oh darling, so very last year. So very, if I may say, homespun of you. Blow-dry bars are popping up everywhere, the latest fashion must-have for ladies who want a quick blast of fabulousness.

They're big business in the U.S., where celeb stylist Rachel Zoe is a leading player. Her DreamDry salons offer blow-drys for £25, plus kiddy blow-drys to girls under-10 (£18) and BYOE (bring your own extensions) services.

Heiress Tamara Ecclestone, who has not let her inability to tell the difference between bread and toast hold her back, is entering the fray. The 30-year-old is to launch a chain of blow-dry bars in the UK and abroad, offering blow-drys from £18 to £45. Will they take off here? Consider, a decade ago there were few manicure bars in UK cities, now they are on every street corner and indispensable to many women. We are all busy. Even Tamara.

'As a working wife and new mother I know how hard it is to look and feel great when you don't have much time,' she trills. 'Show Dry aims to provide a slick, time-efficient service that allows all women the time to feel fabulous no matter how much time you "don't have".'

Guffaw. I think Tamara has plenty of time to get her hair done daily, if not hourly — as well as the cash to pay for it. However, at least she is not another bored little rich girl opening a cupcake bakery or an interior design business. We've had enough of those.

Jennifer Lawrence says she'd prefer to be with a boring person with whom she can happily watch television, rather than pinning all her hopes on a passion that will last for ever.

She means, I think, going for someone who is a companion of the soul rather than a hunk of sexy he-man — but is she just saying that because she is currently rumoured to be dating earnest Coldplay star Chris Martin? Chris was married to Gwyneth Paltrow, so he needs a laugh and a bit of relaxation.

Still, Jennifer (pictured) does seem to take rather a lot of naked photographs of herself, which suggests she doesn't have much time for telly anyway. Very confusing.

MALAYS TO CROSS OIL FIRM'S PALMS

IN CASE you didn't know, palm oil is an ingredient that can be found in one in ten products on supermarket shelves, ranging from bread to washing machine powders. New Britain Palm Oil, the world's leading producer of sustainable palm oil, soared 283.5p or 73pc to 670p after receiving an all-cash offer worth £1.1bn or 715p a share from Malaysian-listed Sime Darby, which is the world's top oil palm planter by land size.

Sime Darby's offer comes ten days after it decided not to proceed with an offer for Kulim Malaysia Bhd's controlling 49pc stake in the company. Broker Peel Hunt said that assuming Kulim agrees, the deal should go through. The size of the premium (85pc) reflects long-term prospects for palm oil rather than the current weakness in price.

The acquisition, which will give Sime Darby significant land holdings in Papua New Guinea comes when top palm oil producer Indonesia is looking to cap foreign ownership of plantations to 3pc from a current 95pc. New Britain Palm Oil has over 70,800 hectares of oil palm estates, a refinery and a bulking terminal in Papua New Guinea. As a brown-field asset, NBPOL will immediately contribute to earnings without risks associated with green-field expansion.

More than 60 points higher at the outset in sympathy with the 274-point surge on Wall Street after the Fed expressed fears that a slowdown in global growth and a stronger dollar could affect the US as it maintained forward guidance and promised to keep US interest rates low for a 'considerable time', the Footsie succumbed to profit-taking to close 50.39 points lower at 6,431.85.

Dealers were spooked by an early 140-point decline on the Street of Dreams following news that German exports slumped by 5.8pc in August, the biggest drop since January 2009, following data earlier this week that showed industrial orders and output suffered their steepest drops in more than five years.

Persisting concerns about a possible Ebola outbreak in Europe dragged British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines down 10.3p more to 333p. discount airline EasyJet 37p lower to 1341p and holiday firm TUI Travel 10.1p to 356.9p.

As the weaker dollar helped the gold price improve, Randgold Resources jumped 248p to 4298p. Numis also upgraded to buy from add. African Barrick Gold added 6.7p at 207.2p. Mining giant Rio Tinto, which recently rejected a bid approach from Glencore, rose 64p to 3,053p.

Luxury goods group Burberry improved 26p to 1,492p after Deutsche Bank lifted its target price to £16 from 1550p ahead of Tuesday's interims.

Despite reporting only a 15pc rise in third-quarter production which was below some analysts' expectations, Centamin firmed 0.65p to 58.4p. However, the company was bullish about meeting its full-year target. After producing an estimated 93,624 ounces of gold in the quarter from its Sukari gold mine, it has unearthed around 250,000 ounces so far this year, leaving production of 170,000 in the fourth quarter to meet that target.

Buyers chased Skyepharma 11p higher to 328p after the company reported more sales of its asthma treatment Flutiform. It has now been approved in 31 countries and launched in 25, including recent launches in Austria and Singapore.

News of a Norwegian Air contract failed to inspire Rolls-Royce, 1.5p easier at 942p. Nordic airline Norwegian Air has selected Rolls-Royce Trent 100 engines for nine additional leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft. It brings the total number of Norwegian's Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliners to 17.

Highly speculative Bahamas Petroleum gushed 0.12p or 3.3pc to 3.52p after a new legal framework for the Bahamas oil industry was announced. Oil services firm Cape jumped 19p to 284p following an upbeat Capital Markets Day.

Broker Arden Partners upgraded to buy saying: 'Overall we were encouraged by the presentations that the company has a clear strategy going forward in terms of growing maintenance revenues partly via initially participating in construction contracts, and also the opportunity set to carry this out - particularly in the Middle East.'

Ithaca Energy shed 6.75p to 97.5p after downgrading full-year production due to a Causeway pump failure. The company said full-year production is now expected to be 12,500 barrels of oil per day, below the 13,500 bottom end of previous guidance.

Demand on the back of increased first-half profited lifted Peel Hotels 2.5p to 84p.

Innovation edged up 0.5p to 27.5p after being contracted by one of South Africa's leading banks to deliver managed maintenance services for South Africa's largest fleet of government vehicles.

 

***

DECONTAMINATION specialist Bioquell jumped 19.5p or 22pc to 108.5p after it revealed it has been discreetly helping hospitals in the US, the UK, France and Holland with the decontamination of patient rooms - and related equipment - which have housed ebola patients. It is in discussions with hospitals in North America and Europe about practical measures to help in the treatment of ebola patients.

MARKETS SPOOKED BY WORLD ECONOMY

STOCK markets around the world fell yesterday amid mounting concerns over the health of the eurozone and the wider global economy.

Investors dumped shares and other risky assets and piled into gold and government bonds as the euphoria over the prospect of 'lower for longer' interest rates in the US wore off.

The FTSE 100 index fell 50.39 points to 6431.85 in London - its lowest close for a year - and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 300 points lower in New York.

The sell-off came amid worries about the global economy, and in particular Germany and the eurozone, as well as mounting geopolitical tensions and the spread of the ebola virus.

Analysts warned that more fund managers now believe stock markets have passed their peak.

Speaking at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, the watchdog's managing director Christine Lagarde said the world faces 'a new mediocre' period where growth is low and uneven.

The comments came just days after the IMF slashed global growth forecasts and declared that while the US and UK are recovering, the eurozone is at risk from recession and deflation.

'In the advanced economies clearly the recovery is driven by the US and the UK, while the euro area and Japan are lagging behind,' she said. 'In the emerging market economies, you have reasonably strong, although slower, growth out of China, better than what we had thought out of India, and clearly a major slowdown in countries like Brazil and Russia. The low-income and developing countries are thriving.

'From a much smaller base, granted, but their growth rates are very impressive, which is why it makes the current epidemic, ebola, even more threatening because it might certainly jeopardise economic recovery that was under way and entail a decline of those economies that would be wasting the gains that they have earned.'

George Osborne said the UK economy is slowing as the crisis in the eurozone takes its toll while Lagarde said the single currency bloc is at risk from a Japan-style period of stagnation.

The double whammy came after figures showed German exports tumbled 5.8pc in August, the biggest fall for more than five years.

It followed a separate report earlier this week showing German industrial production slumped 4pc in August, also the worst performance since 2009.

Richard Grieveson, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, described the figures as disastrous and said that 'things may well get worse before they get better'.

He added: 'Germany's ever-growing importance to aggregate eurozone growth indicates that things could get very messy in the bloc in the next few quarters.'

With the FTSE 100 index down 6pc since early September, Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards voiced concerns about the jitters in the market.

He said: 'Institutional investors are getting increasingly nervous that we have reached the end of the road and a major market top may be forming in equities.'

Manoj Ladwa, head of trading at TJM Partners in London, said: 'It's economic factors that are hitting the market. After the IMF downgraded its forecasts a few days ago, the evidence is now mounting that Europe, in particular, is looking weak.'

The IMF warned that interest rate rises are on the way in the US and UK even after the Bank of England froze them again at 0.5pc yesterday, and the Federal Reserve hinted on Wednesday that it is in no hurry to hike.

Lagarde insisted that rate hikes in the US could trigger a repeat of last year's 'taper tantrums' when markets swung violently.

She said countries should 'prepare themselves for a bit more volatility'.

FURIOUS SPANISH MOB IN DEMO AFTER VICTIM'S PET DOG IS PUT DOWN
BY MAIL FOREIGN SERVICE

A SPANISH ebola victim's pet dog was put down last night over fears it could transmit the disease, prompting outrage from animal lovers who chanted 'murderers' outside the woman's home.

Fury erupted after a government health spokesman confirmed that Teresa Romero Ramos's dog, Excalibur, had been destroyed. The official explained: 'Unfortunately we had no other choice.'

The animal was put to sleep inside Mrs Romero Ramos's home, which was disinfected before the animal's body was taken away in a white van to a nearby incinerator.

Demonstrators who mounted a vigil outside to try to stop the move shouted 'murderers' and several threw themselves on the ground as the vehicle left.

Some 300,000 people had already signed a petition urging authorities to spare Excalibur.

Twitter was awash with photographs of dogs, cats and birds which were posted alongside the hashtag 'SalvemosAExcalibur' - Spanish for 'Let's save Excalibur'.

Mrs Romero Ramos, 44, from Galicia in north-west Spain, who is one of the medical team that treated two repatriated Spanish priests who died from ebola, has been in quarantine since it was confirmed she was carrying the virus.

She has now admitted touching her face with her gloves as she took off a protective suit after leaving the room of one of the priests.

Mrs Romero Ramos confessed her accident to a doctor after earlier insisting that she had no idea how she became infected.

Hospital chief German Ramirez said yesterday - 48 hours after the launch of a probe into how Mrs Romero Ramos caught the virus - 'It looks like we have found the origin.'

But the speed with which he attributed the shock transmission to a 'slip-up' failed to silence critics who demanded that heads rolls after a string of spectacular mistakes by health co-ordinators.

Health minister Ana Mato is facing calls for her resignation after it emerged that Mrs Romero Ramos complained of feeling unwell six days before she was eventually admitted to hospital.

She was rushed to hospital by unprotected paramedics in a normal ambulance only taken out of service 12 hours later and found out she had ebola by reading a Spanish newspaper website as she waited to be quarantined.

Her home in Alcorcon near Madrid that she shares with husband Javier Limon Romero, one of those quarantined at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, was not disinfected until yesterday morning.

Six people in total have now been quarantined since the start of Monday's crisis.

They include three other hospital nursing staff who helped treat Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, the Spanish priests who died after they were repatriated from West Africa.

Mrs Romero Ramos was reportedly feeling better after being treated with antibodies from an ebola survivor. She told a Spanish TV station by phone: 'Today I'm better. It's slow going but I'm better.'

Revealing how she discovered she was infected, she said: 'Nobody told me anything. I suspected something because at the beginning the nurses and doctors came in every hour, then they stopped coming in and I thought that something was up.

'I got hold of my mobile and that's when I saw on the website of El Pais newspaper that I had tested positive for ebola twice. Nobody ever told me to my face, "Teresa you've got ebola".'

She went on to say that she had been given only 20 minutes' training in how to put on and take off her protective suit.

AGONY OF LOVERS WHO CAN ONLY TALK BY VIDEO

THE British girlfriend of photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo said watching him battle ebola is 'heart-wrenching'.

Helen Finlay said that Mr Mukpo, 33, who was flown to the US from Liberia on Monday, waved to her as he left the plane and had spoken to her via video-link from his isolation unit at Nebraska Medical Center. She added: 'When you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them "you're going to be okay" and be close to them, and obviously you can't do that.

'It is a little bit hard. I miss him, I really miss him.'

Mr Mukpo was working for NBC as a cameraman when he developed symptoms.

SCHOOLBOY 'TREATED LIKE A LEPER'; BRITISH PRIMARY SCHOOL BANS HEALTHY NINE-YEAR-OLD FROM SIERRY LEONE TO EASE EBOLA FEARS OF 'HYSTERICAL' PARENTS

A BOY from Sierra Leone has been banned from attending a British primary school because 'hysterical' parents are worried about ebola, his mother said yesterday.

Kofi Mason-Sesay, nine, was due to spend several days at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, as part of an annual visit.

But despite being tested for ebola and given the all-clear on his arrival in Britain last week, parents mounted a campaign to have Kofi's trip cancelled, saying they feared he could pass on the deadly virus to their children.

Kofi's mother, Miriam Mason-Sesay, 48, who is English, branded the parents 'ignorant' after headmistress Elizabeth Inman bowed to the pressure and refused to allow the schoolboy, who has joint Sierra Leone and British citizenship, to attend classes.

Mrs Mason-Sesay, who moved to Sierra Leone from London to set up an education charity 14 years ago, said: 'We are being treated like lepers and it's very sad.

'The school and its governors have been extremely supportive, but I'm afraid they've been put under undue pressure by an aggressive minority spreading panic and ignorance about this virus.

'I am a reasonable citizen and mother - there is no way I would be wandering around with my nine-year-old if he had ebola. We have had one case in Britain, but just one, because we contain it.

'It is a difficult disease to catch but that point has not been taken on by these ignorant parents. We have absolutely no contact with sick people - we're an education charity.'

Mrs Mason-Sesay set up EducAid, an organisation which aims to educate vulnerable children in Sierra Leone, with her brother in 2000. It teaches 3,000 youngsters across nine boarding schools, mostly in rural locations.

In 2003, she married a local tailor, Alhassan Sesay, and Kofi was born in London in 2005, but the family moved back to Sierra Leone four weeks later.

Mr Sesay died in 2009, aged just 35, of an infection which Mrs Mason-Sesay believes he would have survived if treated in the UK.

After his death, the charity worker decided she never wanted to travel without her son. Mrs Mason-Sesay returns to Britain twice a year to give talks to schools about the charity's work in Africa, so Kofi always accompanies her.

Once he reached school age, Kofi was offered an annual placement at St Simon's during his mother's visits and would attend classes for up to a month each year.

In a letter to parents, Mrs Inman said it was with a 'heavy heart' that she and the school governors had decided to cancel Kofi's visit because of 'misguided hysteria' of some parents.

She wrote: 'A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears. There are many parents who believe that the visit should have gone ahead and that we are contributing to misunderstandings by cancelling it.

'In this instance, it has been very hard to juggle justice to Miriam and the views of parents.

'It is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit; the misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience.'

Parents yesterday defended their stance. Richard Chamberlain, 36, said he had considered removing his two sons from the school if Kofi joined their classes.

He added: 'All the information we get in the media is that this disease has an incubation over 21 days, as far as we are concerned he could be ill by day 20 - who knows? The risk is not worth taking. I absolutely would be worried if he was here.'

Serenity McCann, 40, said the school were right to cancel Kofi's visit.

She added: 'You can't risk anything with children. Even if they tested negative, the next day they could be positive.

'I would be worried if they had let him come here. It hasn't been a major panic, just some parents emailing the head.'

But Peter Broom, whose two grandchildren are at the school, said: 'I think the school were over-reacting but they have got to listen to parents. If they are clear of the disease, I don't see the problem.'

Q&AWill ebola come here?It seems fairly likely. US scientists say there is a 50 per cent chance of it coming to Britain in the next three weeks.What would happen?Four major hospitals in London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Newcastle are on standby to tackle an outbreak. Anyone from a high-risk area who shows symptoms will be isolated and everyone they have been in contact with traced. Doctors say the risks of ebola spreading to the general population are incredibly small in a developed country. The disease has killed 3,800 people in West Africa partly because healthcare is so poor.What are the symptoms?A sudden onset of fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, sore throat and intense muscle weakness, followed by vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and diarrhoea. In the final stages patients bleed internally.How can we screen for it?Heat-sensitive cameras could reveal if passengers have high body temperatures. These passengers could be interviewed by doctors to find out if they are showing other symptoms of the disease.Are there blood tests?Yes, but they are unreliable. In the first few days after infection, the tests can wrongly give the all-clear.How does it spread?People are infected after coming into contact with blood, organs or bodily fluids - urine, vomit, saliva, stools, tears or semen - infected with the virus. The virus cannot get through skin, but enters the body through cuts and grazes, or through the mouth, nose and eyes. It can also be transmitted sexually. The virus lives for a few hours on hard surfaces, and can survive for a few days on the skin of dead victims.Can I get it from a sneeze?'If someone sneezes directly into your face and your eyes and lips or mouth came into contact with the spray, there's a chance you could be infected,' says Prof David Evans, a virus expert at Warwick University.Or door handles?Unlikely. If someone in close physical contact with an ebola patient got the virus on their hands and opened a door, the virus could lurk there for a couple of hours before dying.Or someone on a plane?The virus is not airborne, so you would be at risk only if you came into direct contact with infected body fluids - for instance, if you used a dirty lavatory after an infected passenger, and if you then didn't wash your hands properly. Brushing against a sweaty arm would result in infection only if you had broken skin on your arm, or if you touched your arm with your hand and then rubbed your eyes or touched your mouth.Can pets spread it?Yes.Could it become airborne?Scientists say it is unlikely. Viruses don't usually change the way they get around.

WHY WON'T UK TEST AIR TRAVELLERS FOR EBOLA? AS U.S. BRINGS IN AIRPORT SCREENING...

BRITAIN is refusing to screen for ebola victims at its borders - despite the US saying it will introduce the safeguards this weekend.

The UK receives more air passengers from the affected West African countries than any other nation, but health officials here say the screening - a simple temperature test and questionnaire - is unnecessary.

As Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the ebola outbreak a 'serious global health emergency', Barack Obama ordered his officials to screen travellers at five major airports. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said Britain should follow suit.

'We need to put in screening at our borders,' he said. 'We don't want to deal with this after the event.'

The row erupted as:

? Mr Hunt admitted it was 'entirely possible' the deadly virus will enter the UK 'by one route or another'.

? Every major hospital in England was ordered to prepare for the arrival of ebola patients.

? Health experts pleaded that anyone with symptoms do not visit their GP or A&E for fear of spreading the disease.

? The mother of a nine-year-old boy from Sierra Leone, whose visit to a school in Stockport was cancelled in case of infection, said her son was being treated 'like a leper'.

? The World Health Organisation admitted the march of the virus across Europe was 'unavoidable'.

? Some 750 British military personnel are being sent to West Africa to help tackle the spread of the disease.

? The official global death toll approached 3,900 out of 8,000 cases, making it one of the worst health disasters in modern history.

Screening at border points, which was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002, involves a simple temperature test, sometimes accompanied by a health

questionnaire. A thermal scanner is pointed at the passenger's forehead to detect an elevated fever. If the temperature is above normal, the passenger would be questioned about their movements and medical history, and taken for further tests.

Last night a No 10 source said Downing Street believed other actions were more effective than screening, but added that it had not been completely ruled out. 'The US are doing this, and we will want to look at how it is implemented and how effective it is,' the source said. 'We are not convinced it is effective, but we are staying flexible.'

US officials said screening ebola would start at five major airports - New York's John F Kennedy, Newark in New Jersey, Washington Dulles in the US capital, O'Hare in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta - as early as this weekend. Passengers arriving from affected countries Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be given questionnaires and have their temperatures taken.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders. We now need the wider international community to step up to the plate. We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.'

Britain has the busiest air hubs in the world, receiving more passengers than any other nation from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Although all direct flights between London and the three countries have been suspended, more than 6,000 people make the journey each month, changing in Brussels, Paris or Nigeria en route to Heathrow or Gatwick. The US, in comparison, sees between 3,000 and 6,000 passengers a month from the region. Mr Hunt last night admitted the scale of the crisis was almost unprecedented.

'This is clearly one of the most serious global health emergencies of recent years - we are taking it incredibly seriously,' he said. 'Our first priority as the Government is to make sure the British people are safe. It is now entirely possible that someone with ebola will come to the UK either by one route or another.'

But Public Health England reiterated its reluctance to put screening measures into place. A spokesman said: 'There are no plans to introduce entry screening for ebola in the UK. This would require the UK to screen every returning traveller, as people could return to the UK from an affected country through any port of entry. This would be huge numbers of low-risk people.'

Mr Vaz said more urgent action was needed. 'The best way to be safe is to make sure we put in preventative measures now,' he said. 'To hang on and not do this does not help the public feel there is confidence in the system.

'We don't want to deal with this after the event just because we have the best health service in the world. We don't want to test it to see if it can cope with ebola.'

It emerged last night that every major hospital in England has been put on high alert over the crisis. City hospitals, specialist centres and intensive care units have been told to prepare for an influx of patients infected with the disease. 'Any hospital that has an infectious diseases unit or is able to isolate a patient is gearing up for this,' an NHS England source told the Daily Mail.

The UK has only one high-level isolation ward equipped to deal with ebola - at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. Three other hospitals, in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool, have been identified as possible ebola 'surge' centres if there was a large outbreak.

ITV'S A COSY BET FOR THE WINTER

IT'S that time of year when the central heating gets turned on and families decide to stay in and settle down to cosy nights in front of the television.

Broadcaster ITV comes into its own by showing their extremely monotonous but mega-popular reality shows. The final weeks of The X Factor always claims a huge audience, as will the return in November of Ant & Dec's exceedingly irritating, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Meanwhile, Downton Abbey should remain at, or very near, the top of the ratings.

Ahead of last night's launch of its new channel ITV Be, aimed at young women aged 16 to 24, ITV's shares closed 1.4p dearer at 205.8p after Credit Suisse suggested that it could return cash to shareholders, and forecast that any potential bidder would have to pay north of 346p a share.

Bid hopes were raised in July when billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, bought a 6.4pc stake in the broadcaster at 185p a share from BSkyB, forking out £481m in the process. Malone said that he had no current intention of launching a full-scale offer, which ruled him out from bidding for six months.

Credit Suisse believes there is substantial scope for further capital returns to shareholders. ITV should generate £400m-plus in free cash flow this year, and more than £600m in 2015. This will give it the capacity to return a significant amount in 2015. The broker calculates it would be logical to expect £280m-£360m or 7p to 9.1p per share which compares with £156m to £160m or 4p per share in the past two years. Its target price is 270p.

The fragile Footsie presented another dull picture, easing 13.34 points more to 6,482.24, while the FTSE 250 slumped 165.7 points to 14,933.52 following the IMF's downbeat assessment of the global economy and growing fears about a possible ebola outbreak in Europe.

Holiday firm TUI Travel shed 15p further to 367p. Ahead of the start of the US third-quarter reporting season, Wall Street closed 274.83 points higher at 16,994.22.

Shares of car and aircraft parts group GKN were slammed into reverse by a swingeing downgrade by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. They lost 10.7p to 294.7p after the broker moved to underperform from buy and slashed its target price to 290p from 420p.

It cited an increasingly negative news flow on global automotive and industrial end-markets. It sees a downside risk to GKN's Driveline, Land Systems and PowderMet divisions, which together represent 70pc of full-year 2013 sales and 60pc of profits. It has therefore lowered 2014-16 earnings forecasts in these three areas by between 3pc and 6pc.

Beleaguered supermarket Tesco rallied 2.5p more to 185.1p after HSBC upgraded to overweight from neutral and lifted its price target to 195p.

Building services group T Clarke was sold down to 41p on a profits warning before rallying sharply to close 3.75p up at 48p. Investors were initially spooked on hearing that the company would rack up a 'sizeable loss' - rumoured to involve a sum in the region of £6m - on a major scheme in its 'mission critical' division after agreeing the previously disputed final account for the project. However, buyers appeared after it added that its order book had increased to a record £280m, and that its markets were in 'good shape and the company is being invited to tender for some of the most high-profile projects in the UK'.

Citigate, Grayling and Red public relations group Huntsworth fell 1.25p to 46.75p despite cautious comments from Peel Hunt following the resignation of chairman Lord Myners.

Analyst Alex DeGroote said that the broker had only discussed the group's future and the search for a new chief executive with Myners last Friday. There was no indication of his departure. He only joined the board in April, and this is a bad blow to the credibility of Huntsworth. Chief executive Lord Peter Chadlington announced his decision to stand down after a successor is found in August.

Bonmarche held firm at 269p following its surprise decision to launch a menswear range. Freddie George at Cantor has a target price of 320p and describes the move as a diversification, geared to women who may buy for their husbands. The range on the website is competitively priced, in his opinion.

Oil explorer Oilex collapsed 15pc to 5.25p after reporting delays at one of its wells on the Cambay field in India. Reflecting a delay to its drilling programme, Nigerian oil explorer Eland Oil & Gas lost 4p at 94p. New drilling is set to start in the first quarter of next year.

Conroy Gold and Natural Resources slipped 0.3p to 1.05p following a £750,000 placing and subscription to help fund the definitive mining plan at Clontibret and further work at its Clay Lake discovery.

***

DART Group, the airline operator which runs the Jet2.com holiday airline, is waving goodbye to Blackpool airport following Balfour Beatty's decision to close it. The civil engineering group put the site up for sale in August, but no buyer has been found so Dart is moving all flights to Manchester Airport from tomorrow. Dart closed 1p dearer at 215.25p while Balfour lost 6.8p to 161.6p.

LONDON MINING SHARES COLLAPSE AS IRON TUMBLES

SHARES in AIM-listed London Mining sank to less than a penny yesterday as the group warned that they have 'little or no value'.

The company, which is seeking a strategic investor to rescue it from the brink of collapse, runs the Marampa mine in Sierra Leone. It is a casualty of the sharp fall in the price of iron ore this year as well as the devastating ebola outbreak.

The virus has killed more than 3,000 people in the region and has created 'significant challenges' in the search for a new investor.

Brokers speculated that potential backers may be too afraid to conduct a site visit and carry out due diligence.

The price of iron ore has plunged by more than 40pc this year to below $80 a ton as a glut of supply from mines in Australia has hit the market at the same time as concerns about a slowdown in demand from China.

London Mining owes about £176m to bank lenders including Standard Chartered, which 'remain supportive' but is not expected to put up any further short-term funds.

Standard Chartered and FirstRand Bank agreed a new $25m (£15.6m) debt facility in August to provide short-term working capital that matures at the end of November. Potential investors include JSW Steel, India's third-largest steel maker, which has been in talks with London Mining.

There has also been speculation that commodities giant Glencore, which is involved in a dispute over iron ore payments with the company, may step in. However, its chief executive Ivan Glasenberg has his eyes on a much bigger prize, in the form of a merger with mining giant Rio Tinto that has been rejected for the time being.

London Mining floated in 2009 on AIM and its shares at their peak in 2011 were trading at more than 400p.

Yesterday the share price fell nearly 80pc to 0.75p.

EUROZONE FLIRTS WITH DISASTER
BY ALEX BRUMMER CITY EDITOR COMMENT
816 words
9 October 2014
Daily Mail
DAIM

English
(c) 2014 Associated Newspapers. All rights reserved
Many of the leading figures at the IMF, including the managing director Christine Lagarde, chief economist Olivier Blanchard and the overseer of financial stability, former Spanish central banker José Viñals, are from eurozone nations.

So what they say about the catastrophic reaction to the Great Recession and subsequent crisis among countries in the region cannot possibly be regarded as driven by a europhobe agenda. The Fund's findings ought to be of profound concern in Brussels, Berlin and Paris.

The eurozone is facing the twin problems of stagnation and deflation that led to a lost decade in Japan, from which it has never fully recovered. Moreover, the failure to deal with the region's banking problems in the aftermath of the 2008 panic, when former French president Nicolas Sarkozy saw the crisis as one of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, has proved a mistake of Great Depression proportions.

Details of Europe's deepening problems are spelt out in impressive detail in the IMF's World Economic Outlook report. Output across the region this year, at best, will be 0.8pc (after two years in negative territory) and 1.3pc next.

Even if those figures are achieved it will do virtually nothing to cure endemic unemployment at 11.2pc across the region and the grotesque levels of joblessness among a whole generation of young people.

Ever wondered why almost every shop, restaurant, hotel assistant in Britain speaks with a euro accent? It is because Britain, with its growing economy, offers jobs and hope.

And it could even get worse for the Continent.

Germany, the engine of the eurozone, is stuttering because of a lack of demand for its manufactured exports from its neighbours, the slowdown in Asia and the loss of business confidence as a result of geo-political tensions with Russia.

France cannot even get Brussels to agree its national budget, because the deficit is way above the 3pc of total output level.

The Fund's Global Financial Stability report tells of a totally dysfunctional European banking system. This has been obvious for a long time.

The Fund was warning two years ago of a €200bn black hole in the balance sheets of the major banks. Nothing has changed.

An IMF survey of 300 banks in the advanced world found that a quarter of them, mainly in the eurozone, do not have adequate capital buffers to support lending expansion of 5pc a year.

In the eurozone, 46pc of banks with 60pc of the assets are unable to support recovery.

Work on shoring up the banking system in Europe is now in the hands of the European Central Bank. It has recruited the staff but finds it all but impossible to get the work done. The Bundesbank, a powerful force within the ECB, disputes the whole concept of the ECB as a bank regulator even though that is the case in both Washington and London.

Few people in Germany, including the Constitutional Court, much like the idea of the country shoring up the whole of Europe's broken banking system

One of the lessons of the Great Recession is that the governments showing the most progress are those which were willing to put to one side anger at the role of the banks and financiers in the creation of the crisis and move to bail them out and recapitalise.

The US and Britain led the way, but Spain and Ireland followed and both nations are now showing some signs of emerging from the danger zone.

Banks supply the credit that is particularly important for smaller and medium-sized businesses, the bedrock of all economic systems, but they cannot go directly to the money markets in the manner of Siemens, Volkswagen, Danone or Lafarge. Until Brussels wakes up to this, the eurozone economies are doomed.

THE woes of London Mining almost certainly have more to do with the slumping price of iron ore, rather than the ebola crisis in Sierra Leone.

But it is a poignant reminder of what the tragedy of the ebola epidemic threatens to do to the African economy, until recently one of the most dynamic regions on earth.

The World Bank estimates potential regional impact of $32.6bn by the end of 2015.

It may not be a happy outcome for banks heavily exposed to Africa which include Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays and Bob Diamond's Atlas Mara.

WHEN we talk of the G7 we think of the world's seven largest industrial economies: the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada.

The IMF's World Economic Outlook report points out that if you add up the GDP of the Brics - Brazil, Russia, India and China - together with Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, you get a total output of $37.8trillion against $34.5trillion in the existing G7.

Out with the old.

NURSE GOT EBOLA DESPITE WEARING PROTECTIVE SUIT; EVEN HER DOG HAS TO BE PUT DOWN AS VIRUS IS CONTRACTED IN EUROPE
BY BEN SPENCER

AN urgent investigation was underway last night into how a nurse in Madrid became the first person to contract the ebola virus outside Africa.

Colleagues of Teresa Romero Ramos staged a demonstration and claimed that their anti-infection training and protective suits were sub-standard.

Last night the World Health Organisation warned that the spread of ebola across Europe is 'unavoidable'.

In Britain, David Cameron is today chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee.

Experts have warned that the UK is at risk because of Heathrow's status as a major air hub and the flights it receives from western Africa where 7,200 people have been infected with 3,400 dying.

The WHO's European director Zsuzsanna Jakab said: 'It is quite unavoidable that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.

'But the most important thing is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including ebola.' Nurse William Pooley, 29, who caught the virus in Sierra Leone, survived after he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Mrs Ramos, 44, was part of a medical team that cared for priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, 75, who died of ebola last month after travelling back to Spain from Sierra Leone.

Four other people, including the nurse's husband Javier Limon Romero, have been placed in isolation. The couple's pet dog, Excalibur, was seized in case it had been infected.

Madrid's regional government said it would put the dog down and incinerate its body.

Mr Romero insisted his wife had followed protocol. 'She did everything she was told to, and at no time was she concerned that she could have been infected,' he added.

Bosses of the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid insisted that the correct measures had been followed and said they were investigating how the virus spread.

But medical staff claimed they were given protective suits that lacked breathing apparatus and were not completely impermeable.

Jonathan Ball, virology professor at Nottingham University, commented: 'If appropriate containment measures were adopted this really should not have happened.

'It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again.'

In a statement, the Madrid College of Doctors said: 'Given that both the transmission methods and the methods of prevention are well known, it is clear that some mistake was made.'

In the US, ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was last night said to be in a critical condition in a Dallas hospital where he has been placed on a ventilator.

He became ill after arriving in Texas from Liberia two weeks ago.

More than 100 British Army medics are preparing to travel to Sierra Leone to help as back-up.

Personnel from the 22 Field Hospital have been undergoing training in full protective suits.

Armed Forces minister Mark Francois said the aim was to reassure foreign health professionals that they could volunteer to fight Ebola knowing they would receive excellent treatment if they contracted the virus.

SCARE PROMPTS SHARES FALL

SHARES in airlines and travel firms fell today after the news that a Spanish nurse has contracted the deadly Ebola virus.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group - which also owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling - dropped by as much as 7 per cent, wiping £500million off its market value.

Low-cost rival easyJet was down 4 per cent, while cruise ship operator Carnival fell 5 per cent, with travel agent TUI Travel down 3 per cent and Thomas Cook falling 5 per cent.

The drops were likely to have been prompted by fears that the spread of the disease could cause widespread travel disruption.

Keith Bowman, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the news did seem to have provoked some nervousness in the travel sector.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde also warned the 'volatile' air stocks were always the first to be hit by this type of scare.

He said: 'You could be looking at worst case scenario major travel disruption, long haul and short haul. My view is that that looks unlikely but there is obviously concern in the market today.'

BROTHERS REEL IN CINEWORLD STOCK
BY GEOFF FOSTER MARKET REPORT

8 October 2014

DIRECTOR share buying is always a bullish sign and generally makes the City sit up and take notice.

Moshe Greidinger, chief executive of Cineworld, and his brother, Israel, the group's chief operating officer, have been filling their boots over the past five months with shares of the multiplex chain that is the UK's biggest cinema operator.

After snapping up £5m worth of shares in May at 340p a pop, they forked out a stonking £11.9m between them this week on acquiring a further 3.7m shares, at an average price of around 322p.

They now both hold stakes of 27pc-plus and confirmation of their hefty purchases helped the stock climb 9.3p to 329.5p.

The Greidinger brothers have picked up stock via Global City, the business formerly known as Cinema City International, that sold its European assets to Cineworld in February in a deal worth £503m in cash and shares, partly financed by a £110m rights issue. The company is 54pc owned by IT International Theatres, itself controlled by the Greidinger family.

Cineworld's share price slumped to a low of 290p in April following the acquisition as some analysts said it had paid too much for the Poland-based group which owned screens in seven European countries including Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.

The number crunchers said it just increased the risk through exposure to 'emerging markets'.

Persistent buying by the Greidingers have prompted a strong rally with sentiment also helped by first-half figures in August which showed a 46pc rise in pre-tax profits to £25.3m, thanks to Cinema City merger benefits. Analysts remain bullish about longer term prospects, particularly as the 2015 film schedule looks excellent. James Bond 24, Star Wars Episode VII and Jurassic World are all scheduled for next year and will probably get plenty of bums on seats in Cineworld's cinemas next year.

New operational initiatives including allocated seating and the re-introduction of online bookings fees should also help.

Worrying news that Germany's economy, the eurozone's largest, saw its industrial output for August fall 4pc, the biggest decline in five and a half years, dragged shares prices lower on both sides of the Pond. The Footsie fell 68.07 points to 6,495.58, while Wall Street closed 272.58 points down at 16,719.33.

The worsening situation in the Middle East didn't do sentiment any favours either.

Growing concerns about the possible implications of an Ebola outbreak in Europe hit airline and travel stocks. British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines nose-dived 25.7p to 345.6p, EasyJet 78p to 1389p and Ryanair €0.38 to €7.12. Cruise operator Carnival sank 167p to 2328p, TUI Travel 15.3p to 382p and Intercontinental Hotels 85p to 2244p.

Mining giant Rio Tinto jumped 23.5p to 3020.5p after rejecting a £94bn bid approach from smaller rival Glencore, 8.3p cheaper at 331.05p. Rio rebuffed a £90bn approach from BHP Billiton (down 7.5p to 1668p) in 2008 and has probably lived to regret it.

Broker Investec believes that a deal could still happen eventually. The potential for a deal seems to be in the hands of shareholders, in particular Chinalco which sits on 9.8pc of Rio. A merger should not hold too many regulatory hurdles since Rio is largely an iron ore miner.

Cairn Energy spurted to 203.3p before retreating on profit-taking to close 3.6p better at 183.5p after making a potentially commercial oil discovery, offshore Senegal with the FAN-1 well. Broker SP Angel said the discovery mark the first significant exploration success for the company since it restarted its exploration programme following the receipt of the Cairn India money.

Vague takeover speculation lifted inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon 12.6p to 271.6p.

Dog of the day was Spirent Communications which crashed 21.55p or 21.84pc to 77.1p on a profits warning. The board said that trading conditions had softened in the latter part of the third-quarter in the US and China. It now expects third-quarter revenues to be slightly below £69m.

Support services company Latchways also took a hammering after warning revenues had been affected by challenging European market conditions. The close was 167.5p or 16.79pc down at 830p.

Entrepreneur Richard Griffiths has given hope to long suffering shareholders of Blinkx which was sold down to an all-time low of 27p last week following another profits warning.

Shares of the video search engine company rallied 1.75p more to 32.75p on hearing that Griffiths had purchased a further 4m shares to take his shareholding up to 4.62pc.

***

 TECHNOLOGY firm Gamma Communications arrives on the AIM market on Friday, priced at 187p with a valuation of around £165.2m. Gamma hopes it will enhance its credibility so as to improve access to the large enterprise market and public sector. Its cloud and call control products allow businesses to manage increasingly complex voice, data and mobility requirements. It expects to pay an interim dividend in November.

A SPANISH nurse is feared to have become the first person in the world to contract the deadly ebola virus outside Africa.

An initial test carried out yesterday on the unnamed 44-year-old woman, from Galicia in north west Spain, came back positive.

Reports said the married nursing assistant was part of the team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo, a Spanish missionary who died last month at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital.

Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed in the western world with the disease, contracted ebola last month in Liberia and is now 'fighting for his life' in hospital after flying to the US to visit his fiancee.

EBOLA COULD HIT UK 'WITHIN THREE WEEKS'; SCIENTISTS WARN OF 50% CHANCE VIRUS WILL SPREAD HERE
BY BEN SPENCER

THE deadly ebola virus has a 50 per cent chance of reaching Britain within three weeks, experts predict.

The disease is spreading rapidly across West Africa, with more than 3,400 people known to have died and 7,500 infected.

The first case was confirmed in the United States last month.

Now scientists have calculated the odds of the virus spreading to Europe, based on flight patterns and passenger movements.

They predict there is a 50/50 chance that an infected person will travel to the UK by October 24.

Study author Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said: 'It's really a lottery.

'If this thing continues to rage on in West Africa and indeed gets worse, as some people have predicted, then it's only a matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to Europe.'

The World Health Organisation has not placed any restrictions on air travel and has encouraged airlines to keep flying to the worst-hit countries. British Airways and Emirates have suspended some flights but other airlines continue to fly to the region.

The researchers, whose work is published in the journal PLOS, also estimate there is a 75 per cent chance of ebola reaching France by October 24, and a 40 per cent chance that Belgium will be exposed to the disease.

Britain is at risk mainly because of Heathrow's status as a major airport hub. France is seen as particularly high-risk because Guinea, one of the worst-affected countries, is a former French colony which retains close connections.

The calculations are based on air traffic remaining at full capacity. But even if there was an 80 per cent reduction in travel, Britain's risk would still be 15 per cent and France's would be 25 per cent.

Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities - but those probabilities are growing for everyone.

'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky.'

Ebola, which is transmitted via bodily fluids, becomes most infectious in its final stages. But there is still a high risk of the virus being passed on in earlier stages, especially since people may not know they are infected as symptoms can take weeks to emerge.

It is therefore feared a sufferer could travel to Britain without knowing they had the disease and infect others. Last month Thomas Eric Duncan became the first patient to fly into America without knowing he had ebola and 114 people came into contact with him before he was diagnosed. They were tracked down by health authorities and ten remain under surveillance.

Professor Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said many cases 'can slip through the net' despite screening at West African airports.

He added: 'Whilst the risk of imported ebola virus remains small, it's still a very real risk and one that won't go away until this outbreak is stopped. Ebola virus isn't just an African problem.'

So far one Briton, 29-year-old nurse William Pooley, has contracted ebola, but he was diagnosed while volunteering in Sierra Leone and was transported to Britain in an isolation tent. Mr Pooley recovered and was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in north London ten days after he landed.

COULD EBOLA VIRUS BECOME AIRBORNE?

THE deadly ebola virus could become airborne, creating a 'nightmare scenario', says the head of the UN mission tackling the disease.

Anthony Banbury, who is leading the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, said aid workers are in a race against time to bring the virus under control before it mutates.

Currently, ebola can only be caught through close contact with infected bodily fluids. An airborne virus would be much more contagious.

Mr Banbury said: 'The longer it moves around in human hosts in the virulent melting pot that is West Africa, the more chances increase that it could mutate.

'It is a nightmare scenario [that it could become airborne], and unlikely, but it can't be ruled out.'

There have been more than 7,000 cases, with almost 3,500 deaths. The Centres for Disease Control, the public health institute in the US, predicts that the number of cases could reach 1.4million by January in Sierra Leone and Liberia alone.

WHY DID SECURITY STOP ME NOT THE JIHAD TEEN?As the old whore complained: 'It's not the sex, it's the stairs.' Same goes for air travel. It's not the flight, it's all the aggravation that goes with it.Last weekend I flew from Stansted to Glasgow. Getting on a plane to Scotland should be a doddle, a glorified bus journey. But you don't have to contend with security when you catch a bus. As a fairly frequent flyer I understand the need for vigilance. Ever since 9/11, civilian aircraft have been a prime target.I know from talking to senior anti-terrorism police officers that the jihadis are always trying to find ingenious new ways to bring down planes. So I accept that some screening of passengers and their luggage is essential.What drives me mad is the sheer stupidity and inconsistency of these rules.

Whoever still believes 'It's better to travel hopefully than arrive' hasn't been through airport security lately.Last Friday, we were pulled to one side and had our carry-on cases searched because the see-through plastic freezer bag containing our toiletries was about one inch 'too big'.Everything had to be unpacked and repacked in a regulation-sized bag. The luggage then had to be sent back for re-screening. We were forced to wait while my miniature can of shaving gel was whisked away for an anti-explosives swab and the assistant filled in a special form, noting time and action taken.While all this was going on, I was chatting away merrily to a supervisor who'd recognised me and wanted a natter about something he'd read in my column.Clearly he knew perfectly well that neither my wife nor I were terrorists or had any intention of blowing up the Glasgow shuttle. So what was the point of holding us up?I didn't give him a hard time. The frontline staff don't make the rules. They're just doing what some self-important imbecile in charge of security has told them to do.If they fail to follow 'procedure' they could face disciplinary action, or even the sack.What I'd like to know, from the Chief Executive, or the Head of Security, or whoever, is what precise threat is posed to the safety of aircraft by a plastic bag being an inch 'too big'. There is no reason, of course. They do it because they can, so they're seen to be doing something. But there's no rhyme nor reason to any of it.I've written before about middle-aged Howards and Hildas being given the third degree at airports while women in burkas and young men of Asian descent are waved through security — so terrified are the authorities of being accused of 'profiling'. Hundreds of wannabe jihadists seem to have had no difficulty passing through British airports en route to joining IS in Syria. The most recent was a 15-year-old Somalian girl from Bristol, travelling via Turkey unaccompanied by an adult. Didn't that ring any alarm bells?Some of these Toytown terrorists are said to have been using false passports. How did they manage to escape the attention of airport security and border officials?Wouldn't all this money be better spent targeting them, instead of wasting time and effort treating respectable, middle-class Middle Englanders as potential shoe bombers?Security staff confiscate thousands of lipsticks, nail files, bottles of mineral water and after-shave every day. Yet once you get 'air side', you can buy perfumes, alcohol, all manner of stuff which can be turned into a weapon. What's to stop a dedicated 'martyr' attacking a stewardess with a duty-free Parker pen or a champagne bottle? Stuff a hanky into the neck of a litre of vodka and, hey presto, you've got an instant Molotov Cocktail.So why confiscate a child's carton of Ribena?I hadn't been through Stansted for over a year. It used to be one of the more efficient airports. Turn up, clear security, board your plane, take off.Last weekend, once we'd got our hand luggage back we were ushered into a retail hell, a snaking S-shaped shopping mall, teeming with disorientated passengers trying to make their way to their departure gates.My dear, the noise, the people!It was like the scrum at Harrods when the doors open for the Boxing Day sales. If you'd been rushing for your flight, you'd never have made it. Monday, the day we flew home, marked the official opening of Stansted's new shopping experience, billed as the largest airport 'walk through' retail mall in the world, complete with a performance by the cast of Jersey Boys. If I'd wanted to see the Jersey Boys, I'd have gone to the stage show, not Stansted Airport.And if I'd planned to visit a Westfield-style shopping centre, I'd have carried on round the M25 to Bluewater, instead of turning onto the M11 for Stansted. Other countries have airport stores, but you're not forced to run the gauntlet of sales assistants spraying you with Dior, or fight your way through a mob of women shopping for clothes, simply to reach your departure gate.It's madness, driven by corporate avarice, designed to cause a captive audience the maximum possible inconvenience.Mind you, having said you don't have to pass through security to catch a bus, it would appear that travelling by rail will soon be as fraught as flying.Stations have already been turned into overpriced shopping centres, with trains attached almost as an afterthought. Now the railways are becoming as 'security' obsessed as the airports.Eurostar passenger Daniel Confino was dragged off the train by police at Ebbsfleet because he objected to paying £2.20 for an extra tea bag.Not showing railway staff enough 'respect' is apparently considered an arrestable offence, just as it is at Heathrow and Gatwick. And if you think that's ridiculous, consider the case of a party of middle-aged women travelling home to Newcastle via King's Cross after a trip to Bruges.Christine Burnham, who suffers from the neurological disorder dystonia and uses a walker, was studying the departures board with her carer Carole Lawson.They were approached by four King's Cross jobsworths who asked to see their tickets. Carole reached into her coat with her right hand to retrieve the tickets from her left bra strap, where she'd put them for safe keeping.On seeing this, one of the men dived towards Carole and put her in a bear hug, so she couldn't move her arms. The other did the same to Christine to prevent her running away — which would have been difficult seeing as she was still gripping her walker.Christine tells me they must have thought that Carole was reaching for a gun.You couldn't make it up.Their luggage was confiscated and taken away to be searched. Eventually, the staff realised the whole business was absurd, bought the ladies a cup of tea and escorted them to their train.Charitably, Christine doesn't blame them and can now see the funny side. Like the screeners at Stansted who are forced to measure plastic bags, they were only  obeying orders.Christine and Carole wrote to the railway company asking for an official explanation, but predictably didn't receive a reply.So we're left to assume that some idiot in authority has been on a 'risk assessment' training course and decided that a middle-aged woman reaching into her bra strap could be a trained assassin going for an automatic weapon.Can't be too careful. With the railways going the same way as the airports, soon we'll have to pass through metal detectors and have our bags searched before we can catch the 4.50 from Paddington.And at this rate it can only be a matter of time before the aviation  security 'experts' work out that the only way to guarantee our 'safety' is simply to abolish air travel altogether?Maybe that's why they've turned Stansted into a maximum-security shopping mall.--The British Medical Journal is claiming that global warming is a 'public health emergency' which will make the Ebola epidemic 'pale into insignificance'.No, it isn't and no, it won't.Another report this week suggested that the effect of the Earth becoming warmer in the prehistoric period made Man more intelligent than other species. In the past 20 years, belief in non-existent 'man-made climate change' seems to have had the opposite effect.Nurse!--Dr Fox is the latest DJ to be arrested and have his homes turned upside down by police investigating 'historic' sex crime allegations. Meanwhile, Jimmy Savile remains dead.--DO THE HI-VIZ FLINGA friend of mine recently attended a wedding in Fife. After the toasts and the telegrams, it was time for Scottish country dancing.Before guests were invited on to the floor, a professional dancer  was wheeled out to give a demonstration for the uninitiated. She  was wearing, you guessed, a hi-viz jacket over her traditional tartan outfit. They say you should try everything once — except incest and Scottish country dancing.Now we know why.I've heard of the  Highland Fling, but not the Hi-Viz Fling.--WHO YOU LOOKING AT, JESUS?What was I saying last week about the growing trend for fancy dress fights, after a punch-up in Manchester involving a stag party in Where's Wally costumes?A couple of days later, Devon and Cornwall Police released details of more than 30  crimes committed by people in fancy dress. They included a drunken Jesus, a Sherlock Holmes, a Super Mario, a Catwoman and a bloke dressed as a traffic cone.Police must have had a hell of a job organising an identity parade.In all cases, alcohol was believed to be a factor. You don't say.Bring on the Oompa Loompas!

SO BEING NEUROTIC IN MIDDLE AGE IS LINKED TO DEMENTIA? THANKS - THAT'S ANOTHER THING FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT
BY TOM UTLEY

WORRIES, worries, worries. Are we getting sucked into a Third World War in the Middle East? Will my wife ever find a hat she's happy with, to go with the outfit she's chosen for our son's wedding three weeks from tomorrow?

Is global warming destroying the planet? Did I lock the back door before I left for work? Is that nasty tickle in my throat just a tickle, or the first sign of something more serious — Ebola, perhaps, or the Big C?

All this and, if the opinion polls are right, the Great Miliband Terror will be upon us in just seven months' time.

And now along comes another thought to frighten us neurotics out of our wits: those who worry a lot in middle age, finds a study this week from the University of Gothenburg, are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as people who take life in their stride. That's all I need.

Before I go further, I should say that the research applied only to women, 800 of whom were questioned about their neuroticism and monitored over 38 years. But this brings me to my other big worry of the week.

Unmanly

Did you take the tests in Tuesday's paper, designed to establish whether you have a male or female brain? I did.

As instructed, I clasped my hands in front of me, interlocking my fingers, and looked to see which thumb was on top. In my case, it was the right one — an indication of femininity, apparently. Uh, oh.

Next, I examined the relative lengths of my ring and index fingers. My right hand is reassuringly masculine, I was happy to discover, since my (ringless) ring finger was marginally the longer of the two. But as for the left, though there is very little in it, I have to admit that it was marginally on the girly side.

Then came the clincher. We were asked to examine photographs of four pairs of eyes and identify which moods they revealed. Women tend to be better at this, we're told, since they are much more sensitive than men to other people's feelings. I plumped for: a) concerned; b) doubtful; c) uneasy; d) interested.

Crikey! Four out of four correct! I've never been more disconcerted to score top marks in an exam. Does this mean that for the past 60 years, without knowing it, I've been wandering around with a female brain trapped in a male body — male, that is, apart from the ring finger on my left hand and a dominant right thumb?

I must say I've never felt particularly womanly. It's true that I'm not much interested in sport, while I've confessed before to a decidedly unmanly love of ironing. But surely plenty of all-male, testosterone-charged blokes share my take-it-or-leave-it attitude to sport.

As for ironing, it may not be very masculine, but it can hardly be described as a feminine pleasure either; I, for one, have never met a woman who claimed to enjoy it.

Indeed, when I confessed in print that I found ironing strangely therapeutic and rewarding, I had floods of letters from women readers (well, three) inviting me round to their place to indulge my pleasure with their weekly washes to my heart's content. It's the nearest I've come to feeling as much in demand with the fairer sex as George Clooney.

But with the possible exceptions of preferring ironing to the European Cup, and Jane Austen to the sports pages, I'd always reckoned I had a pretty standard set of male attributes.

I'm good at parking and map-reading, fascinated by useless facts (did you know that St John's Wood is the only station on the London Underground whose name contains no letter from the word 'mackerel'?), brilliant at throwing scrunched up pieces of paper into the bin from a distance of several yards, hate talking on the phone, spend my lunchtimes outside the pub, leering furtively at women way out of my class, never tidy up, never listen to a word my wife says to me, always leave the loo seat up... oh, and I'm bored to tears by George Clooney's wedding and I don't give a damn what, if anything, has happened to Nigella's face.

Conspiring

This makes me all man, I would have thought. But we can't argue with science, the configuration of our fingers and thumbs or our ability to distinguish horror from affection in the look of a woman's eyes. Which brings me back to the anxiety I mentioned above: do we men who have female brains, and a tendency to worry, face the same doubled risk of dementia as women who suffer stress and anxiety at my age?

If so, heaven knows there are quite enough pressure groups and experts of one sort or another conspiring to drive us out of our minds. Indeed, in a cursory flip through yesterday's papers alone, I counted at least ten brand new things to be worried about.

For a start, so many family doctors are about to retire, warned the ever-alarmist Royal College of GPs, that more than 500 surgeries could close in England over the next year.

Then there was the news that tracker phone apps could leave children vulnerable to sexual predators (though since the advice came from the former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett, who signed off Tony Blair's Iraq War dossier on weapons of mass destruction, we can possibly take it with a pinch of salt).

Elsewhere, we were told that Britain is in the grip of the worst moth infestation ever, UK manufacturing growth is running out of steam, migrant shanty towns are springing up in suburban parks, our clothes could give us bad backs, we're running out of phone numbers again, DVD sellers are nervous that our children could pick up racist ideas from watching Tom And Jerry cartoons, Sainsbury's dividend is at risk and 'timing of new deal could spell danger' (I can't tell you what deal or what danger, since this headline was on the sports pages, and, therefore, I read no further).

Alarmist

This is not to mention the scary finding from the University of Chicago that losing our sense of smell — and the ability to identify the scents of fish, rose, leather, orange and peppermint — could mean that we will die within five years.

I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who had a surreptitious sniff of a shoe and an orange yesterday morning, just to make sure (or perhaps I was the only one, which may be yet another thing to worry about).

No, let's face it, we worry far too much these days. Ebola? What's the betting that it will go the way of swine flu, bird flu, salmonella-ridden eggs, mad cow disease and Sars, all of which were predicted to wipe out huge swathes of the population, but somehow didn't?

Global warming? Even if it's happening, it may not be half as bad as the alarmists say. And anyway, worrying about it in Britain, and wasting billions on useless wind farms, won't help. Not while China and India belch out ever increasing tonnages of greenhouse gases every week.

The Third World War? If only we'd worried less about Saddam Hussein's imaginary WMD, and the authoritarian regimes in Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt and Syria, it might have been a whole lot less likely. So perhaps we should try worrying a bit less about the savages of the Islamic State, whose clapped-out Toyotas we're blasting to smithereens with missiles costing £200,000 a pop. I can't believe it's helping much, can you?

For the sake of retaining our marbles, I reckon we should fret only over the really serious matters we can do something about — such as keeping Mr Miliband out of No 10 and finding a suitable wedding hat for my wife.

CHILDREN in America may have been infected with ebola after a man with the deadly disease was sent home from hospital.

Thomas Eric Duncan was just given antibiotics but he is now critically ill in Dallas, Texas. The Liberian, who is in his mid-40s, was visiting family in the US. Authorities are monitoring five children who had contact with him at the weekend.

FURY AS TOP MEDICAL JOURNAL JOINS THE GREEN BANDWAGON

GLOBAL warming is a 'public health emergency' that will cause thousands of deaths worldwide, a leading medical journal warns.

The BMJ claims that the 'mayhem' it will inflict on future generations will make deaths from the ebola outbreak 'pale into insignificance'.

In a bizarre move, the journal has set aside 11 pages of this week's issue to warn doctors of the dire consequences of global warming - without any obvious relevance to medicine.

Critics described the article as 'alarmist' and 'desperate'.

But in a separate commentary, the BMJ's editor Dr Fiona Godlee defends the piece by saying doctors must understand the problem if they are to help tackle it. It is not the first time the publication - formerly known as the British Medical Journal - and its editor have spoken out on such a highly charged issue.

In July, it carried a piece calling for doctors to be allowed to help the terminally ill to die - prompting concern among medics.

In her most recent comments, Dr Godlee warns that seven million people die worldwide every year due to pollution and this will only increase if greenhouse gas emissions - which cause global warming - rise further. She points out that reducing these emissions by walking rather than using the car will have added benefits of reducing obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

And she calls on the World Health Organisation to declare the issue a public health emergency - putting it on a par with the current ebola outbreak in West Africa which has claimed 3,000 lives since February.

'Deaths from ebola infection, tragic and frightening though they are, will pale into insignificance when compared with the mayhem we can expect for our children and grandchildren if the world does nothing to check its carbon emissions.

'And action is needed now,' the article concludes.

Last year, experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the average global temperature had risen by 0.5C in 50 years. They predicted that over the next century temperatures will increase by 3C causing a rise in sea levels, flooding, disease outbreaks and, as a result, mass migration of refugees. Politicians are striving to reach an international agreement by December next year on legally-binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It would aim to limit global warming to just 2C, and will replace the Kyoto Protocol which came into effect in 2005.

However the last attempt at a deal, at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, ended in disaster, and many politicians are worried about a similar result this time.

Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Forum, a think-tank founded by former Chancellor Lord Lawson, accused the BMJ report of being needlessly alarmist.

He said: 'The World Health Organisation would become a global laughing stock if they were to follow the ridiculously over-the-top demands of a green alarmist editor. There is a real disconnect between what they are saying and the reality.'

He added that the article was 'just desperate', saying: 'The smaller the chance of an international agreement, the more desperate they get.'

THIS WAS A PINGER, HIS BEST YET, A SIX FROM THE MOMENT IT LEFT THE BAT

DEMOTIC, blistering, at times folksy with head-wobbling hints of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan: David Cameron's speech was all those things. Reagan would have loved the tax-cutting stuff.

Looking at him on that stage, hair slicked as he alternated between whacks at Labour and lip-bitten defiance about Ukip, it was striking how he has developed from the moist young Herbert who became Tory leader in 2005.

The Cameron of 2014 comes across as a world-hardened, unguented competitor, less Cotswold villagey, more Mayfair-penthouse. A salesman? Sure. Democratic politics is nothing if it does not sell policies to the electors.

Yet no artifice can explain the extraordinary moment when he defended his belief in the NHS and, without actually mentioning his late boy Ivan, teetered on emotional rupture.

'I know what it's like to go to hospital night after night with a child in your arms,' he said, stumbling as the memories bubbled in his chest. 'How dare Labour say I would ever put the NHS at risk for other people's children?' Stuff the cynics, this was a terrific moment.

His enemies on the Left and the miserabilist, ranting Right will say his delivery was calculated in its pathos. They will have been irked by the man-of-destiny lifting of that shiny chin. Who did he think he was? David Beckham in a TV ad for Gillette razors?

But if you believe, as the thousands of Tory activists at conference plainly did, that the next election is a cruncher and that Miliband-Balls-Harman presents more of a threat to our culture than Putin, ebola and Russell Brand combined, this was no time for half measures.

Mr Cameron knew the occasion demanded one heck of a performance. I'd say he gave it. To judge this pulsating effort against last week's spluttered, complacent nonsense from Ed Miliband is the work of half a second.

There was a transatlantic tang to some of the oratorical tricks - the way he pointed at the TV camera and looked down the barrel of its lens. 'I lurve this country,' he said more than once. In this era of Americanised television I suppose such schmaltz comes with the rations. His warm-up man was Michael Gove, who received his own standing ovation. 'Gosh,' said Gover the blinky mole. He declared that Labour's economic plans were 'as reassuringly robust as a Kleenex parachute'.

Ed Miliband had all the statesmanlike potential of the Gove family's 'bichon-frisse puppy dog Snowy'.Snowy might do better at PMQs most weeks.

Before Mr Cameron's arrival we had a few organ chords. Were they about to burst into a revivalist hymn? There has certainly been something Salvation Armyish about this conference. Instead we had a video of ministers doing things while wearing hard hats, hi-vis jackets and determined grimaces.

Enter the PM. A slow walk to the lectern, that of a cowboy with chapped legs. Vaseline, matron! The activists had been issued with Union Jacks. In the stalls nearby sat welfare minister Esther McVey, in black lace and Crufts hairdo. Also Lord Young, Mrs Thatcher's trade minister, nodding approval.

Mr Cameron began with the Union and moved to D-Day. Shamelessly emotive, he praised a 91-year-old Army veteran, Patrick Churchill. Mr Churchill and his wife were on a balcony in the hall and the audience rose as one. Mrs Churchill blew them a kiss.

Vivid language about militant Islam followed, Mr Cameron describing the 'hellish crucible' of our latest terrorist foes.

He told any British badhats thinking of joining ISIL, 'you are an enemy of the UK and you should be expected to be treated as such'. Boy, he gave that some wallop.

He tore into Labour's education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, for being a hypocritical public schoolboy who would deny excellence to others. Poor little Tris. He is hardly the world's worst bogeyman. You might as well fire a torpedo at a coracle.

In cookery books they talk about 'folding' egg whites into a souffle mix. Mr Cameron folded personal references into current affairs. We went from war in the Middle East to his own belief in families - 'I'm not a complicated man ... families come first.'

There were a few shafts of humour, among them a terrible impression of William Hague's accent. Mr Cameron hailed Mr Hague as our 'greatest living Yorkshireman'.

One moment he was offering us policies such as the tax breaks and protected health budgets. The next he descended to self-effacement such as 'I don't claim to be a perfect leader' and 'I didn't come into politics to make the lines on the graphs go in the right direction'.

There is a prominent television newsman I know who at restaurants will call for the wine list barking, 'I didn't come into journalism to drink house red'.

'Let's not go back to square one, let's finish what we have begun,' he said twice as he neared the end. As slogans go, it was a bit Pam Ayres. But as speeches go, this was a pinger, his best yet, a six from the moment it left the bat.

OVERSEAS AID 'HELPS FIGHT TERRORISM'

JUSTINE Greening made a staunch defence of the controversial overseas aid programme yesterday, saying it helps the fight against Islamic State terrorism.

The International Development Secretary told a sceptical conference that people should be 'proud of our country'.

Aid sent to crisis-hit Iraq has helped feed and shelter the Christian and Yazidi people driven out of their homes by fanatics, she said.

And millions of pounds of British aid has also helped countries such as Jordan and Lebanon cope with the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. Miss Greening said: 'Let's be proud that we are there, protecting the lives of families fleeing Isil; that we are supporting British volunteers working to contain ebola; and that we are rebuilding Afghanistan following the sacrifices of our servicemen and women.'

David Cameron has achieved his aim of spending 0.7per cent of Britain's GDP on foreign aid - nearly £12billion last year - despite cuts in other departments.

ONLINE RETAILERS LURE INVESTORS; MARKET REPORT

INVESTORS' appetite for e-commerce IPOs this year has been insatiable, highlighted by the recent record-setting €25bn (£19.5bn) offering of China's Alibaba Group.

Yesterday, Europe's biggest online retailer Zalando strutted its stuff following its debut on the Frankfurt Bourse after its shares were heavily oversubscribed at the issue price of €21.50, valuing the group at €5.5bn (£4.3bn).

The stock immediately traded as high as €24.10 before revisiting the issue price. Germany's Rocket Internet, which adapts Silicon Valley business models for markets outside the US and China and helped launch Zalando, also lists today after bringing its IPO forward due to strong demand. It is expected to raise up to €1.6bn.

More than £6.5bn has been raised by 27 companies listing on the London Stock Exchange so far in 2014, but several have flattered to deceive.

None more so than AO World, the group behind electricals website ao.com. It fell a further 11p to 177p to stand 37pc below February's issue price of 285p and 57pc below the 412.375p peak.

Founder John Roberts made £86m from selling shares ahead of the listing but retained a 26.4pc stake.

On Tuesday he proudly announced that the launch of its German website, ao.de, had been brought forward six months ahead of schedule. It went live for pre-orders yesterday. However, in the next breath, he apparently spooked investors by stating that the UK white goods market is 'materially flat'.

Numis nevertheless retained its buy stance and target price of 350p. Analyst Andrew Wade believes that AO's superior customer proposition underpins a huge growth opportunity both in the UK and Europe.

Sellers exerted further downward pressure on ASOS, sending the online fashion retailer 173p lower to 2.077p. Sentiment remains fragile to say the least following a recent dire profits warning and continuing fears that founder and boss Nick Robertson will have to sell some shares to fund a domestic issue.

Next's (down 30p more at 6,575p) warning that clothing sales could be hit this autumn thanks to the driest September on record sent potential buyers heading for the hills.

As shares of the major supermarkets were again put through the mincer amid increasing competition fears from the likes of Aldi and Lidl and dividend worries, the Footsie retreated 65.2 points to 6,557.52 to stand 5pc below early September's 14-year high.

Wall Street didn't help, falling 160 points in early trading as the US confirmed its first case of Ebola in Texas. US purchasing managers' data also proved weaker-than-expected.

J Sainsbury slumped 17.5p, or 7pc, further to 234p after new boss Mike Coupe reported a fall in sales for the third consecutive quarter and slashed forecasts for the year.

He said the board is to review dividend policy and bears took that as an early warning that a cut in the final payout must be on the cards. Worries about trading and dividend concerns also dragged Wm Morrison 8.4p down to 159.9p. Meanwhile, beleaguered Tesco dropped 6p more to 180.362p on hearing that its £250m accounts 'black hole' is to be investigated by the FCA.

As airline stocks in the US encountered turbulence on fears of an outbreak of Ebola in the country, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines nosedived 9.9p to 357.2p.

Royal Mail moved against the trend, delivering a 7.5p gain to 399.7p after UBS upgraded to neutral from sell.

FTSE 250 oil and gas producer Afren rallied 5.9p to 109.4p on hearing that The Wilkie Farr & Gallagher report investigating payments to board members and senior management is now expected in mid-October. Estate agency group Countrywide climbed 16.6p to 468p after a share repurchase programme for up to £20m.

Sheffield-based engineering solutions company Pressure Technologies jumped 30p to 687.5p following its acquisition of Glasgow-based Quadscot, a company which supplies the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.

Confirmation of the rumoured share placing left Audioboom, the digital social media audio platform, 0.75p lower at 15.88p. It is raising £8m from new and existing institutional and other shareholders.

Speculative Gulf Keystone Petroleum put on 2p to 64.25p after giving an update in relation to production and sales from its flagship Shaikan field in Kurdistan, Iraq. Nanoco, the world leader in the development and manufacture of cadmium-free quantum dots, eased a penny to 149.25p, despite the appointment of Keith Wiggins, as the newly created role of chief operating officer.

BRANSON'S UNLIMITED HOLS? WE'D BE TOO SCARED OF THE SACK TO TAKE THEM; COLUMN
BY JAN MOIR

There is a revolutionary new holiday policy at Virgin, meaning that there is now no holiday policy at all. Fun-loving, David Brent-ian boss Sir Richard Branson has told his Virgin staff on both sides of the Atlantic that they can now have as many holidays as they like.

Go on, go for it. Take as much time off as you want, kiddos, for as long as you want. No need to ask for permission. Here's your bucket and spade. Close the door behind you.

In his new book on leadership, The Virgin Way, Branson reveals it was his daughter Holly who drew his attention to this unconventional plan. She'd read about a similar operation at the TV streaming firm Netflix, which had apparently boosted productivity and morale.

She urged her father to adopt the scheme. 'I believe it would be a very Virgin thing to do,' she said.

Anti-establishment, hippy-dippy Dad agreed, and has deployed the free-form strategy — or flexi-time max, as I like to call it — ever since.

It works like this. Instead of being given the usual allocation of annual leave, it is left to the employee alone to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours, a day, a week, a month off.

The assumption is that each individual knows whether their work is up to date and that their absence will not in any way damage the business.

'Or, for that matter, their careers!' Branson adds, in what is a rather ominous aside. Especially for any wage slave who worries about a career and a future and clawing their way up the ladder.

It is also, perhaps, a glimpse of a despot's claw inside the velvet glove of his conspicuous libertarianism. For instead of heralding a jolly workers' revolution, surely this is a system that works on fear rather than freedom?

In the current economic climate, not many of us would be confident enough to take extra time off work, even if we deserved it.

What millionaires like Sir Richard fail to grasp is that those lucky enough to have jobs are clinging on like barnacles, not plotting extra skiing weekends and childcare mornings. For deep in the jungle of office politics, the only thing worse than being missed is not being missed.

One can see that the scheme might work, but only for an elite; specifically those pampered execs who work in the creative industries in mid to upper-level management tiers.

Indeed, so far only Branson's personal staff of 170 qualify. But I can't imagine that, say, Virgin train drivers or Virgin pilots will be allowed to sign up to the scheme any time soon, can you?

'Announcement. This Virgin flight has been delayed for ten hours because the captain is on his fourth mai tai in a bar in Bora Bora. He just felt like a break, bless him.'

And it could not work for those further down the ranks in the workplace, on whom others depend. Those who work on factory floors, in hospitals, on the night shift, in a restaurant kitchen, in a school or a shop. People who have to be somewhere at an appointed time and cannot let others down.

In his new book, Branson also airily advises people to 'delegate and spend more time with your family'. We'd all love to, Richard — but few of us can. Despite being such a successful businessman, his hatred of structure and rules, not to mention his wilful anti-establishment values, often give him a faint grasp of the realities of the workplace. And I should know, given that I used to work for him.

This holiday lark is just the sort of thing Branson loves to promote; a grand gesture that polishes his maverick credentials and also makes him seem a kindly employer in charge of a liberated workforce.

Nothing could be further from the truth. From my experience, Virgin employees were just as stressed out and worried as everyone else.

Branson started the Virgin Group in 1970 and today employs more than 50,000 people around the world.

In the early Eighties, I was employed at his record company in West London, a place where the mood was so laid back that everyone was completely outraged when we were told we could not look Bryan Ferry in the eye and had to call him 'Mr Ferry'. Imagine!

One senior woman used to bring her baby to work, a sweet little peanut who hung from a door bouncer for most of the day. It was unthinkable anywhere else, but not at groovy Virgin, even if the tot was a distraction for the rest of us.

Then, as now, Branson was curiously insubstantial in person, but he had a genius for surrounding himself with fantastic executives.

I don't mean lowly me, but the clever and committed men and women who helped turn his little mail-order record company into the global success it is today, covering telecoms, travel and financial services. And they didn't do that by bunking off whenever possible.

The free holiday time is supposed to boost morale, creativity and productivity, with the focus being on what people get done, not how long they spend at their desk.

Yet in the modern world, everyone is perma-hooked up on smartphones and tablets anyway. We never really leave our offices — or worries — behind. Underlings never have to make difficult decisions because the boss is only ever a click away, while no one ever really mentally escapes.

Flexi-max might mean no more nine-to-five or chaotic rush-hour commute, but Branson has not factored in selfish colleagues or the fraught nature of office politics.

Taking all the time off you want? Who would ever dare?

We might end up as a nation of Coleen Rooneys, bouncing from holiday to holiday like an aimless beach ball, with a year-round Dubai tan but not a thought in our silly heads.

No thanks.

All those celebrities, eager beaver to get down there and spout off about the issues of the day: wars, Russian aggression, you name it.Stars who have spoken at the UN recently include Leonardo  DiCaprio (climate change), Emma Watson (gender equality), Charlize Theron (violence against women), Angelina Jolie (war rape), Nicole Kidman (violence against women), and Victoria Beckham (my new shop). Sorry, make that assorted global issues, including HIV/Aids.The UN is supposedly raising awareness for these topics in return for giving celebrities a platform on which To Be Taken Seriously — but is  it working?Celebrities are terribly good at getting ordinary people to donate  money or do good works  without necessarily contributing much themselves apart from a sprinkling of stardust. I shudder to think what the UN expenses bill might be, ferrying the great and the not-so-good across datelines to speechify with assorted degrees of conceit. Why doesn't it concentrate on what it can do — like the Ebola virus for a start?The UN seems to have become a bloated and expensive organisation, focused on its own  self-preservation above all else.

NURSE! OAP ON THE LOOSESO who is this pair of glamorous walnuts out on the town? At first glance, he could be an escapee from the secure unit at a luxury old folks' home, quietly but firmly being ushered back to bed by a pretty nurse in a flamboyant nightie. Look closer and you  can see that it is 74-year-old Al Pacino out on the town with his Argentinian girlfriend, Lucila Sola, who is 39 years his junior.She is gorgeous, of course, the kind of breathtaking arm candy expected of a septuagenarian movie legend. Yet don't you think the strain of their spring/autumn romance is showing? All that effort — the hair dye, the extensions, standing on tiptoe, the fake tan, the cockatoo comb-over — and that is just Al. He looks grumpy, too, like a man who is secretly longing for the deep, deep peace of a cosy armchair, the crossword and his pipe and slippers. And, at his age, who could blame him? 

Purring? The Queen is certainly not going to be purring when she next meets David Cameron. Rumbling with rage might be nearer the mark, ready to give him a clonk on the noggin with her patent handbag. What an embarrassing blabbermouth. This was him showing off to Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and international nobody. Which begs the question, what does Cameron let slip when he is with President Obama or Angela Merkel or someone really important, like Sally Bercow? I shudder to think.

GEORGE, IT'S STILL NOT TOO LATE!Call Gordon Brown. Get him to make another one of his big, barnstorming speeches, full of brimstone and fury as he thumps around like a cross between the Gruffalo and a bear roused from a long hibernation.  This time, there are only hours left — not to save the union, but to stop it. Yes. The Amal/George wedding is surely imminent. On Thursday, Amal flew into Italy with a hatbox the size of a wagon wheel and a smile almost as big. No wonder! She is getting married in Venice .?.?. to George Clooney. Triumphant look on her face.Somewhere on the lagoon, George is pulling the petals off a daisy, chanting 'Eeny, meeny, miny, Jan', and looking at himself in the mirror, wondering if he has chosen the right woman. Last-ditch love alert! It is not too late for George to call it off and call me. I'll keep you posted.

 

They want him back for good, but Jason Orange has decided to leave Take That. Many are not exactly sure what he did in the group: I think he danced around a bit and sang backing vocals.However — and most laudably — what he did do was pay his taxes. Unlike the three members who are left — Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald — Jason did not sign up to the Icebreaker tax plan. Instead, he paid all his tax, just like millions of other Brits. Who would have thought it would be what he will be remembered for most. That, and the fact that he is a lovely bloke, who still cycles around Manchester and does his own shopping. More than that, he knows when to go.KAREN'S LABOURING THE EMBONPOINT ...Councillor Karen Danczuk was a big hit at the Labour Party conference. The wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk has struck on a novel way — for a councillor at least — of drawing attention to herself. She keeps posting selfies on Twitter featuring her very own — really rather marvellous, to be honest — cleavage.Depending on your point of view, Karen is either the kind of positive female role model Labour is keen to promote, or a narcissist who can't see further than her own bra.After one particularly stupendous snap, The Sun newspaper made her Hottie Of The Day. Surely she was outraged?'You are making me blush, thank you,' she tweeted to the newspaper.Karen! After all the strides feminism has made, have you decided that showing your bazooms is the best way to get noticed? Apparently so. And even more tragically, it seems to be working.

BRITISH MEDICS SIGN UP TO HELP THE EBOLA CRISIS

MORE than 160 doctors, nurses, paramedics and other NHS staff have volunteered to go to ebola-ravaged West Africa.

They will spend six weeks trying to stem the worst ever outbreak of the disease, which has claimed more than 2,800 lives.

The number of cases will 'climb exponentially', with more than 20,000 people infected by the start of November unless urgent action is taken, the World Health Organisation has forecast.

At the weekend, the Government's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies asked British healthcare staff to volunteer. By Monday night, 164 had come forward.

They will be given training before they go on how to prevent the virus spreading in hospitals - and how to protect themselves against infection.

The disease has taken a high toll on healthcare workers, including British nurse William Pooley, who caught ebola while working in blood-spattered wards in Sierra Leone. The 29-year-old, who was the first Briton to contact ebola, has since made a full recovery.

Yesterday, experts warned that the disease might be here to stay - and become a part of life like flu, HIV or TB. They said that rather than causing large but short outbreaks, it could mutate so it passes more easily between people.

If it does become endemic in West Africa, this would raise the odds of it coming to Britain, said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. A £3.2million grant from the trust, one of the world's biggest medical charities, will be used to test much-needed ebola drugs in Africa, with the first doses given in November.

THE ebola outbreak in West Africa is accelerating, the latest figures from health chiefs reveal.

New cases of the disease are being reported at about 700 a week - up from 500 a week just three weeks ago.

The number of deaths has now topped 2,600, a rise of about 200 since the last estimate, according to the World Health Organisation. Most of the deaths have been in Liberia.

The latest data from the UN health agency shows that the disease is thought to have affected more than 5,300 people.

Just under half of those cases were recorded in the last three weeks.

Ebola has also struck down 318 healthcare workers - about half of whom have died.

The outbreak has hit Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal. Barack Obama this week announced plans to send 3,000 US troops to the region to help build health facilities.

BRITON VOLUNTEERS FOR EBOLA CURE JAB

A HEALTHY British woman yesterday became the first volunteer to receive a potentially life-saving new vaccine to tackle the Ebola virus.

Ruth Atkins, 48, was injected with the experimental drug at Oxford University as part of a safety trial.

If successful, it will be used to treat patients in West Africa where the worst ever outbreak has now killed more than 2,500.

Mrs Atkins, from Marcham in Oxfordshire, is one of 60 volunteers who are taking part in the UK trial over the coming weeks, which has been fast-tracked because of the worsening outbreak. Two more will be given the jab on Friday.

After being given her injection, she said: 'I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday.'

Mrs Atkins, an NHS communications manager who has also worked as a nurse, will keep a diary of her side effects over the next eight weeks and undergo regular blood tests.

Oxford University said the vaccine does not contain infectious Ebola virus material and will not cause those involved in the trial to be infected.

Mrs Atkins admitted her friends and family had raised concerns that she was being injected with the virus itself. 'My 15-year-old son thought it was Ebola I'm having and he asked am I going to die and where is my will and how much do I get? My 12-year-old daughter was concerned but also said, "Well done, Mum for what you're doing."'

She said she first heard about the trial while listening to the radio. 'I volunteered because the situation in West Africa is so tragic,' she added.

Ten thousand doses of the drug are already being manufactured by British drug company GlaxoSmithKline in the hope that it will be approved for use in the coming months.

The vaccine, co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GSK, targets the 'Zaire species' of Ebola. It uses a single benign Ebola protein to generate an immune response.

THE World Bank warned that the economies of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone could be catastrophically affected by the region's Ebola outbreak if the epidemic is not contained by a rapid response.

US President Barack Obama pledged to send 3,000 troops to the region to help contain the outbreak, including engineers and doctors.

'This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It is a potential threat to global security, if these countries break down, if their economies break down,' President Obama said.

The disease has killed 2,461 people so far this year.

EBOLA is spreading like 'wildfire' in Liberia and 'seriously threatening its national existence', the West African country's government said yesterday.

Defence minister Brownie Samukai said: 'The deadly ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of our state.

'It is now spreading like wildfire, devouring everything in its path. The already weak health infrastructure of the country has been overwhelmed.'

He also told the UN Security Council that the international response had been 'less than robust'.

More than 1,000 people have so far died of the disease in Liberia, which has been the country worst-hit by the outbreak. Karin Landgren, UN special envoy to Liberia, warned the reported cases 'understate ebola's true toll', adding that it was the gravest threat to the country since its civil wars.

WHO MURDERED MY GORILLAS? ECCENTRIC ANIMAL LOVER DAMIAN ASPINALL RAISED A GORILLA FAMILY IN HIS KENT ZOO, THEN DEFIED EXPERTS AND RETURNED THEM TO THE JUNGLE. NOW HIS EXPERIMENT'S ENDED IN A BLOODBATH - AND THE PRIME SUSPECT IS A JEALOUS WILD GORILLA

Expressing his emotions has never come easily to Damian Aspinall, but as the conservationist and casino tycoon gazes at an extraordinary sequence of photographs from his recent visit to West Africa, there is sorrow in his eyes.

Taken two months ago, when he and his eldest daughter, Tansy, 25, journeyed to the vast wildlife reserve his foundation runs in Gabon, the pictures capture the uplifting moment when a family of gorillas raised in his Howletts animal park in Kent took their first, tentative steps to freedom.

The Aspinalls had known the ten gorillas all their lives and regarded them almost as their own kin. And they watched in awe as the troop, which had been kept for months on a river island where they learned to forage for food and fend for themselves, loped across a wooden bridge and into the great unknown.

Though Damian has returned 80 gorillas to the wild, it was the first time anyone had attempted to reintroduce a complete family, and it seemed then that this controversial experiment — which had been years in the planning and cost hundreds of thousands of pounds — had been vindicated. Among the zoological establishment, his maverick style of conservation has long been regarded with suspicion, much like that of his colourful late father Johnny, who founded the Aspinall zoos with the millions he earned from London's society gambling rooms.

Aspinall senior was decried for his insistence that his keepers should interact closely with the animals — a policy that saw five of them killed by animals during the Eighties and Nineties. 

His son has not endeared himself by criticising conventional zoos and their methods, saying he would like them all closed down and their animals set free.

His six-day trip to Gabon reinforced his conviction that he was on the right track. Before leaving, he and his daughter (who was famously videoed playing with a gorilla in its pen when she was a baby) went by boat deep into the rainforest to make contact with another group of much-loved 'friends' they released many years ago.

To their great joy, they found the animals thriving in their ancestral homeland, and were thrilled to be greeted with cuddles and nose-rubs.

'Tansy said afterwards that it had been the best trip of her life,' Damian, 54, told me wistfully at his Belgravia office this week. 'It was incredibly moving for me, too. It was a wonderful and very emotional thing to see these animals walk to freedom, knowing we had given them that opportunity.

'Gorillas don't have the same concept of freedom as humans, of course, but I sensed that Djala (the male leader of the newly arrived troop, who has been in Aspinall's care since being rescued 30 years ago, just as he was about to be slaughtered and eaten) somehow realised he was in a better place, and I was responsible for that.

'Because of his upbringing, Djala had always been very nervous in captivity, but out there he seemed remarkably calm. He had even stopped his lifelong habit of plucking at the hair on his arm. So I left the country thinking it was an outstanding success.'

He falls silent, gathers himself, then adds: 'Obviously, I couldn't foresee the tragedy to come.'

Indeed not. Two years ago, when he first told me about his most audacious project, he acknowledged that it would carry 'enormous risks'. He had been concerned that the gorillas might eat some poisonous fruit, or contract a disease their immune system couldn't combat.

Yet nothing prepared him for the horrific news relayed by his field-staff in a flurry of increasingly grim messages earlier this month.

First he was told that two of the newly freed gorillas — both adult females — had disappeared: very strange, given that they ought to have been traceable via implanted radio transmitters.

Then, a few days later, he learned that their decomposing bodies had been discovered. They hadn't been attacked by a leopard — perhaps the only predator capable of killing a fully-grown gorilla — for there were no bite wounds. From the extensive trauma to their skulls and torsos, it seemed they had been brutally battered to death or swung by the limbs with enormous force against the trunk of a tree — the hallmarks of a ferocious attack by another gorilla.

Since then, three more of the Kent contingent have been found dead, though it is unclear how they were killed. This brings the death toll to five, while a sixth remains missing.

More disturbingly still, the victims were Djala's five wives and a baby female named Akou, one of his four children. This week, Aspinall handed me the tragic list: the five confirmed as dead are: Tamki, aged 25, Kishi, 16, Mumba, 27, Kibi, 22 and Akou, three. FouFou, 22, is the missing wife.

Though Aspinall describes the multiple fatalities as a 'setback' and vows that they won't wreck his great back-to-the-wild dream, they are plainly a personal and professional disaster.

The bridge has been dismantled and the five grieving survivors confined to the island — which remained their home even after they were free to wander elsewhere in the forest — and the entire project has been suspended as measures are taken to protect them.

Meanwhile, an investigation of Scotland Yard proportions has been launched to solve a murder mystery so bizarre it appears to confound the very tenets of primatology.

In Gabon, all manner of dark theories are circulating. There is even a suggestion that the gorillas were not bludgeoned to death at all, but poisoned and then mutilated by poachers or someone with the desire to sabotage Aspinall's conservation project.

He, however, dismisses these rumours, saying he and his team have already identified the likely killer. They believe he is a silverback named Boumanga, one of many gorillas his own foundation has rescued from appallingly cruel captivity in Africa.

Boumanga was taken in 14 years ago when he was an infant, and cared for in Africa before being released into the wild shortly afterwards, where he grew into a 32st colossus.

No one saw the attacks, as Aspinall readily concedes, but he says there is a welter of circumstantial evidence against this 'rogue male'. For one thing, Boumanga nests close to the riverbank, just across from the island where the killing spree occurred, and lives a curiously solitary existence.

While another silverback living nearby heads a very big family of 26, including several wives, Boumanga has no mates or offspring. This is highly unusual, given that neighbouring males usually divide the females among themselves and seldom live without mates.

Aspinall says his team were aware of this well before the attacks, but never imagined he might pose a threat. They simply assumed Boumanga was a harmless oddball who couldn't attract females, while the male with the huge harem was a veritable super-stud by comparison.

The one thing he might try to do was steal one or two of the Kent females as his 'wives', ran their thinking. If he did it would be no bad thing, for it would help to diversify the gene pool among the gorillas in the reserve, thus making in-breeding less likely.

It now seems evident that the brooding loner had more malevolent intentions — though, as Aspinall reflects darkly, 'hindsight is a wonderful thing'.

As gorillas are habitually placid and good-natured, and it is virtually unheard of for males to kill adult females, he says Boumanga may have been 'deranged' by his traumatic early experiences in captivity and grown into what humans would regard as a pathological serial killer.

He adds: 'I have agonised about this for days — we all have. Was it because the female gorillas had been in captivity and were behaving in a way they shouldn't in the wild? It's possible. Was there a sexual motive? We couldn't tell, but he was clearly out to get the women.

'Can you get psychotic gorillas? For sure — it can happen with all animals. Maybe (as a baby) he was kept in some shed, or hung upside down, or beaten. We don't know his exact background so we don't know what mental damage there might have been.

'All I can say is that I have spent my entire life among gorillas and I have never seen anything like it. It's an absolute shock — the one thing we couldn't see coming.'

Whatever his motivation may have been, Boumanga is known to have stolen across the bridge to the island shortly before the onslaught.

Soon afterwards, the jungle was filled with chilling shrieks and frenzied thrashing sounds. It seems he had fought and won a titanic battle with Djala — the male leader of the Kent troop — who was so severely bruised and swollen, perhaps in attempting to defend his wives, that he had to be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

Then, one by one, the bodies were found.

'We're certain that Boumanga killed the two gorillas with trauma wounds, at least, but we can't be sure what happened to the others,' says Aspinall. 'It's possible they died in another way.'

They could have succumbed to stress, he surmises, pointing out that gorillas carry a parasite called balantidium, which can multiply with fatal consequences when they are under strain.

However they died, he maintains that his reintroduction project has been broadly successful, with a survival rate of 80 per cent; considerably better than that among captive-bred gorillas.

And though lessons will be learned, he says defiantly, he won't allow this incident to derail his mission — even though several of the world's leading experts this week expressed reservations about it.

To Dr Mike Cranfield, a respected U.S wildlife veterinarian specialising in gorillas, the notion that all animals ought to be returned to the wild is a 'majorly flawed ideal', regardless of these unprecedented attacks.

By effectively meddling with nature, he suggests, Aspinall — for all his good intentions — could cause untold damage to the wild gorilla population, for instance by introducing some harmful gene or disease they are unable to combat. Dr Cranfield also queries the wisdom of breeding gorillas in England and transporting them to Africa at huge expense, when the money might be better spent on conserving the 100,000 already living in the wild, which are endangered by poaching, habitat loss and the rampant ebola virus.

Dr Martha Robbins, of the Max Planck Institute, who has studied gorillas for 25 years and runs a field site in Gabon, has similar reservations, describing the release of animals that have spent their lives in zoos as 'a huge ethical question' fraught with complexities.

She told me: 'It's a bit like taking a group of teenage kids from London to the Kalahari Desert, and saying: "Off you go — have fun!" '

'We shouldn't just assume that because these animals are gorillas, they'll know how to survive in the forest — what foods to eat, how to live with other gorillas, and among predators.

'Feeding gorillas on mangos and apples in Kent is not the same as leaving them in the wild, where they have no idea what to eat, how to behave and where to go.'

As for the supposition that Boumanga — or any other gorilla — deliberately killed the six females, Dr Robbins believes it is highly doubtful. While infanticide by male gorillas is quite common (nursing mothers can't be impregnated, so the males will kill their babies to make them fertile) she says she has come across only one case where a silverback has deliberately killed an adult female.

She suggests the females might have died in any number of ways, from disease to the stress of radically changing their diet.

She even posits the theory that Djala might have killed them himself because they were about to leave him for Boumanga. 'My understanding is that there is no evidence against this silverback beyond the fact that he was there, someone heard shrieks and they died. If this accused gorilla was charged in a court of law, the case wouldn't hold up.'

And she adds: 'I appreciate that Damian Aspinall is very dedicated to this project and his animals, and I think it's human nature to point the finger.

'But it's rather as if a convenience store owner had been murdered, and the last person to use the store had been videoed. Just because he was the last customer, it doesn't mean he was the killer, does it?'

Accustomed to such scepticism, Aspinall responds with a weary contempt. His critics may be eminent in their field, he says, but he has never heard of them and they know nothing about him or his work, which not only involves the conservation of gorillas, but a huge range of animals, including the critically endangered black rhino. He says the Gabon reserve, once ravaged by poachers, has become a 'honeypot' of wildlife under his foundation's protection.

Furthermore, he clearly believes his knowledge of gorillas and their habits is far superior to that of his detractors, and having seen him mingling with gorillas as if he were a member of their family, this is hard to dispute.

'When you do something different, people don't like it, and we are trying to do things another way — we are trying against all the odds to change an entire culture in the way animals are looked after,' he says with a steely glint in his eye.

This isn't to say that the killings haven't caused him angst-ridden moments of doubt.

His pressing concern now, though, is for the future of the project and the welfare of the five surviving gorillas, and he faces some difficult decisions.

Should he dispatch more Kent-reared females to join the pining Djala? If not, how should his loneliness be resolved?

And what should become of Boumanga? Aspinall looks aghast when I ask whether he might face the ultimate punishment for murder; yet clearly if he was the killer, he must be removed to some remote corner of the reserve.

For a few days ago his hulking silhouette was seen on the riverbank, as if he were waiting for the bridge to be rebuilt.

If the 'deranged loner' with an apparent grudge against foreign females should manage to sneak back to the island, even a casino boss surely wouldn't bet against him striking again.

Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, says Britain would be better governed if more ministers had worked in supermarkets.

Miss Greening is one of the few working class voices round the Cabinet table. Her first job was in the Rotherham branch of Morrisons.

She thinks that if a few more of her colleagues at Westminster had started their careers stacking shelves they might have a better understanding of the real world.

The posher half of the Cabinet probably get their groceries delivered from Fortnum & Mason. It's a fair bet none of them has ever set foot in Lidl. They'd consider Waitrose slumming it.

Occasionally, politicians invite well-known retailers to advise them on running the country. But try to imagine what supermarkets would be like if they were run by career politicians . . .

Good morning shoppers and welcome to Cameron's Multimart. This is your manager speaking, but you can call me Dave. We particularly welcome customers from the Black Minority Ethnic, LGBT and travelling communities.

Our revised opening hours are Noon until six pm, Monday to Thursday. We are closed every year from July to October, for annual stocktaking and staff training, although we will open briefly during the first week in September, for our convenience.

If you have forgotten to pay for your parking space, let me remind you that pay-and-display machines are available in the foyer and we do not accept cash, only payment by mobile phone.

Parking is charged at the rate of £5 per 15 minutes. Anyone failing to display a valid ticket or overstaying their allotted time will be clamped and towed away. You will have to pay a fine of £100 and a recovery fee of £450 in order to retrieve your vehicle.

If this happens, please see our car park attendant Mr Johnson, who will be happy to rent you a bike.

We apologise if you have been accosted by aggressive beggars from Romania outside the store, but under human rights law we are unable to remove them from their makeshift camp in the loading bay.

Please remember to keep your vehicle locked, otherwise you may return to find a family of gypsies living in it.

Your health and safety is our number one priority. Even if you have shopped with us before, please pay close attention to the safety demonstration being conducted by our head of security Mrs May in the tinned goods aisle.

We have recently introduced new, enhanced security procedures. All shoppers must submit to a full body and cavity search, unless they are wearing a burka. Anyone physically or verbally abusing our staff will be prosecuted.

Customers are required to wear hi-viz jackets and hard-hats at all times. Please use the hand-sanitiser dispensers as you enter the store, to prevent the spread of ebola.

If possible, try not to put any litter in the bins provided, since they are only being emptied once every two weeks to comply with our targets for combating global warming.

Parents using our father-and-baby changing facilities, please remember to take any dirty nappies home with you.

E-cigarettes are strictly prohibited. To facilitate enforcement, closed circuit cameras will monitor shoppers throughout the store at all times and special 'anti-vape' alarms have been fitted in the non-gender-specific toilets.

We hope you enjoy your shopping experience today and invite you to take advantage of our special offers.

Unfortunately, we regret that our popular buy-one-get-one-free promotions have been withdrawn. In line with our deficit reduction programme, we are now offering one item for the price of two.

We have also introduced a preferential pricing system, which means that grocery bills will be linked to earnings. Before you reach the till, please have a copy of your wage slip available for inspection.

Middle-income shoppers will be required to pay a 40 per cent premium, rising to 45 per cent for higher earners. Although this may seem punitive, it still significantly undercuts our competitors at the Co-op, who intend to levy a supplement of 50p in the pound.

Our chief cashier Mr Osborne has also raised VAT on all purchases, excluding pasties.

Don't forget to visit the in-house butcher Mr Pickles. All our top-quality meat is exclusively halal, at the request of our valued Muslim customers. We regret that pork is no longer available, in any shape or form — such as joints, chops, sausages, pork pies, pulled pork and salami-by-the-inch.

In line with healthy eating guidelines recently issued by our head office, we are authorised to supply two small portions of red meat, per person, per week, but only on condition customers also agree to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. No one may purchase more than five eggs a week, including Cadbury's Creme Eggs.

The management has also decided to withdraw Terry's Chocolate Oranges from sale, ever since customers started counting them as one of their five-a-day.

As part of our anti-obesity strategy, we are no longer stocking confectionery or patisserie items, such as sticky buns and doughnuts. Anyone looking for fruitcakes should try the cut-price Ukip (United Kingdom Independent Produce) bakery in Carswell Street.

Alcohol will be sold only to people aged 65 and over, on production of a valid birth certificate, EU passport, two utility bills and accompanied by both parents. Customers able to provide satisfactory proof of identity will be permitted one small bottle of low-cal ginger beer shandy each.

Regrettably, we have cleared the shelves of all kosher and Israeli products, following representations from our local MP Mr Galloway and a visit from a joint delegation of Islamic State supporters and the provisional wing of the Workers Revolutionary Party.

On the fish counter, Mr Cable is proud to offer a tasty selection of Patagonian toothfish and snook. Unfortunately, due to the Common Fisheries Policy and the criminal destruction of the British trawler fleet, we can no longer supply cod or haddock from British waters.

We apologise that our drop-in clinic remains closed, following the unfortunate deaths of a number of customers from an MRSA outbreak. As a result of a review of our in-house pharmacy policy, aspirins have been withdrawn from sale and there is now an 18-month wait for a flu jab.

Those of you in the market for a high-powered vacuum cleaner, toaster or hair dryer should go immediately to our electrical department, since all these items are selling out fast. If you have any questions, our European Sales Manager Mr Clegg will be happy to help explain why.

Don't be alarmed if all the lights in the store go out suddenly and the electric tills and do-it-yourself scanners stop working. This happens at least three times a day, following our decision to generate all our power using the wind turbine in the car park in order to meet carbon reduction targets.

I'M FINE! EBOLA NURSE WALKS OUT OF HOSPITAL

THE British nurse infected with ebola walked out of a London hospital yesterday - free of the disease he feared would kill him.

And William Pooley, 29, who caught the lethal virus while helping sufferers in Sierra Leone, said that to the delight of his mother, he can't return there - because his passport was incinerated amid fears it was contaminated.

Mr Pooley, who said he felt 'wonderfully lucky' to have made a full recovery, talked about his ordeal in a Press conference at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.

He had been treated in an isolated tent in a sealed-off special unit since being flown to Britain by the RAF 11 days ago.

Chillingly, he first learnt he had the disease when, after falling asleep, he was awoken by a World Health Organisation doctor who did not even have to speak - because the anti-infection suit and face mask he was wearing said it all.

Mr Pooley said: 'I'd had a blood test in the early afternoon, then went to bed. I was woken that evening by one of the WHO doctors in full PPE [personal protection equipment], so I knew it was bad news.

'I was worried I was going to die, I was worried about my family, I was scared.'

Asked whether he was going to return to West Africa, Mr Pooley said: 'They incinerated my passport, so my mum will be pleased to know I can't go anywhere. I'm going back to Suffolk this afternoon and I'm most looking forward to seeing people in the village, and just relaxing in the nice countryside.'

The nurse - who spent last night at his parents' home in Eyke, near Woodbridge - was modest about his decision in July to volunteer at an ebola clinic.

He said: 'When ebola started, everyone was frightened and concerned. It was something engulfing the country, so it was just natural. I was in a place to help.

'I wouldn't change my decision. To look after people when they're really suffering - that's what being a nurse is all about.'

UK EBOLA VICTIM RECOVERING...ON BACON BUTTY DIET

THE British nurse infected with ebola is responding well to treatment and has recovered his appetite, his parents revealed today.

William Pooley, 29, is enjoying bacon butties and is now strong enough to start gentle exercise.

But he is still being kept inside an isolation tent and may have to stay there for weeks to ensure the infection does not spread.

Mr Pooley was hailed a hero for his work treating ebola patients in a remote clinic in Sierra Leone after he was struck down with the disease. He was airlifted out of West Africa by the RAF and taken to the specialist isolation ward at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Last night his parents Robin, 67, and Jackie, 66, beamed with relief as they revealed their son is responding well to treatment, including the experimental drug ZMapp.

The couple, who have spent most of the last ten days at the hospital, praised the 'world class' care he had received.

Mr Pooley said: 'He is able to get out of bed. He has a little step in there that the physio gave him so that he can rebuild his strength.

'That in itself is a good enough sign, I think. But he seems to be pretty well actually.'

Unable to have any direct contact with his parents, Will is able to talk to them via a telephone link into the isolation tent. Mr Pooley added: 'We can stand and see him indistinctly through the glass and the polythene.'

Mrs Pooley said: 'He is talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He is interested in more things.'

And a clear sign of his improving health is his appetite.

Mr Pooley said: 'His appetite has come back. It came back with a bacon butty that one morning for breakfast'.

Mrs Pooley added: 'And then we took him a vegetable rogan josh [curry].'

The couple have revealed that they were at a family wedding when Will broke the news that he had been infected with ebola.

Mrs Pooley said: 'We were at our niece's wedding and he phoned, we're out in the grounds and the photos were being taken. We assumed he'd phoned to wish his cousin every happiness.' The phone was passed around family members, but his father thought Will was sounding 'flat' and that there was something wrong.

'Fairly soon I rang him back and he told me,' he said. 'At which point the first thing in mind is, "We can't spoil the day".' The couple left the wedding early.

Mrs Pooley said it was a 'very stressful' and anxious time when 'all the worst case scenarios' were running through her mind.

She said: 'First of all we worried that he would not get out of the country. There a lot of check points that had to be cleared. He had 160 miles to travel across to get to the airport in Freetown.

'It wasn't until the plane had taken off that we breathed a very, very small sigh of relief, we knew he was on his way home.'

The couple say their son is very grateful for the expert case he has received.

Mrs Pooley said: 'I think he has feels very glad to be having such good care. He is very aware of what he has left behind.'

Her husband added: 'The fact that the British Government decided that they were going to be his insurance company was absolutely fantastic.'

The couple said they were very proud of Will for the live-saving work he did in Sierra Leone. They hope he will make a full recovery.

More than 1,500 people have died since the ebola outbreak started in Guinea. The World Health Organisation has warned as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is controlled.

HOW EBOLA IS MENACING THE UK ECONOMY; EFFECTS OF DEADLY VIRUS FELT BY BUSINESSES
BY JAMIE NIMMO

AS ebola sweeps across West Africa, the economic repercussions of the deadly virus are being felt further afield.

The economies of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been left reeling from quarantines, cancelled flights, and limited trade in and out of the region, which has had a knock-on effect on British businesses.

British Airways has suspended all flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia until at least the end of the year after initially cancelling flights for just a month.

Britain's flag carrier said it made the decision due to 'the deteriorating public health situation in both countries'.

BA usually runs four flights a week between Heathrow and Liberia's capital Monrovia, with a stopover in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.

Indeed the shockwaves from ebola, which has a 90pc fatality rate, have been strongest in these two countries, where the death toll has passed 1,500 and national growth targets are under threat.

Three-quarters of Sierra Leone's growth came from mining last year. London Mining, which mines iron ore in the country, was the first company to react publicly by imposing travel restrictions on staff and visitors from the east of Sierra Leone.

At the time, the group insisted production at its Marampa mine was unaffected, but has since warned of supply chain issues that are likely to hit output.

Coupled with a decline in iron prices, London Mining's share price has almost halved in the space of six weeks.

It has been a similar story for African Minerals, also operating in Sierra Leone and listed on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Its stock has suffered the same fate, while the search for funds has become more difficult in the circumstances.

Alison Turner, an analyst at City firm Panmure Gordon, admits ebola 'poses a very real short term risk to mining companies operating in West Africa'.

She added in an in-depth research note on the subject that the efforts of other countries to stop the spread of ebola, such as restricting travel from affected nations, create a 'major logistical challenge for companies operating in West Africa'.

Turner reckons convincing British ex pats to return to the region could become a major problem.

'When staff return to their homes at the end of their rotations they are exposed to the fears of their loved ones and the opportunity to seek alternative employment. Wouldn't you?', she asks.

Smaller mining companies in West Africa have acknowledged delays due to the late arrival of important equipment, while shipping their product has also proved to be a challenge.

Some of the heavyweights have also suffered: ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, said the virus has put the brakes on its expansion plans in Liberia; Sime Darby, the world's biggest listed palm oil producer, said its Liberian output is slowing, while Cote d'Ivoire-based Sifca Group has stopped rubber exports from Liberia.

A lack of supply will mean increased demand and ultimately higher prices for commodities produced in West Africa. That in turn could mean margins are squeezed at supermarkets around the world if a cure is not found soon.

Glasgow-headquartered engineer Weir Group, which makes equipment for mining groups, reported that its mining business suffered a 9pc fall in first-half earnings due to the ebola virus.

 

T HAT was while its oil and gas engineering arm registered a 27pc rise in profits.

Of course, the South African mining strikes played a large part in that decline, but ebola was picked out as a major culprit.

If the disease spreads into neighbouring countries, then FTSE 100 constituents Glencore, which owns the majority of the Perkoa zinc project in Burkina Faso, and Randgold Resources, with operations in Senegal and Mali, could be forced into action. Operating in West Africa, one of the last remaining frontiers for mineral exploration, is now being seen by investors as a black mark on UK-quoted companies.

Unsurprisingly, investors have been quick to avoid any exposure to the epidemic, shunning shares in West Africa-focused groups.

Those aware of the pitfalls of AIM will be no strangers to mining companies based in far-flung parts of the world.

But ebola is proving too great a risk to ignore compared with the geopolitical concerns private investors are normally faced with.

The oil and gas industry has not been immune to the outbreak.

The virus has since spread to Nigeria, Africa's biggest producer of oil and the continent's largest economy. Oil giant Shell operates there, along with American majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

Matt Robinson, senior credit officer at Moody's, warns that if a major outbreak emerges in the Nigeria's capital Lagos, 'the consequences for the West African oil and gas industry would be considerable'.

'Any material decline in production would quickly translate into economic and fiscal deterioration,' Robinson adds.

EBOLA HITS SENEGAL AS FEARS GROW THAT VIRUS IS MUTATING

A MAN infected with ebola has travelled to Senegal, taking the virus to that country for the first time.

So far, the disease has hit four other West African nations and killed more than 1,500 people in the worst epidemic since it emerged in 1976.

The traveller, a university student from Guinea, sought treatment at a hospital in Senegal's capital, Dakar, but gave staff no warning that he might have ebola. The next day, a surveillance team in Guinea alerted Senegalese authorities that they had lost track of a person who had come into contact with sick people.

They said he had disappeared three weeks previously and could have travelled to Senegal.

The man was tracked that day and immediately quarantined after a test confirmed he had ebola.

The current outbreak began last year in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

More than 3,000 people have contracted the disease, which is spread by bodily fluids and for which there is no licensed treatment or vaccine.

A separate ebola outbreak was reported this week in Congo, where 13 people have died.

Senegal is a tourist destination whose capital is a major regional transportation hub. The disease's presence there underscores that the situation is out of control despite the efforts of the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders and other groups.

WHO said yesterday that the past week has seen the highest rise in cases to date — of more than 500. It warned that the disease could eventually infect 20,000 people.

However, hopes of a breakthrough have been raised by the successful treatment of infected monkeys with the experimental drug ZMapp.

All 18 rhesus macaques in a study made a complete recovery despite showing severe symptoms of ebola.

Meanwhile, US researchers have found that the virus mutates rapidly, making it far harder to diagnose and treat, even with vaccinations. They found 400 genetic mutations in just 78 patients from Sierra Leone.

The Bucket

by Allan Ahlberg

(Penguin £7.99)

CHILDREN'S author Allan Ahlberg was born in Battersea — though not the Dogs' Home, he's quick to point out in Having A Baby, the poem that begins this enchanting observation of Ahlberg's childhood.

The book uses a mixture of poetry and prose to celebrate the much-loved author, who has enchanted generations with The Jolly Postman, Each Peach Pear Plum and Burglar Bill, among others.

Adopted as a newborn, he grew up in the Black Country in the Forties where animated characters like the butcher who dealt 'in meat and menace' conjure up a nostalgic picture of small town life. Illustrations by his late wife Janet and their daughter, Jessica, are scattered throughout, but it is Ahlberg's wizardry with words and storytelling that bring his unusual childhood to life.

The Hot Zone

by Richard Preston

(Corgi £8.99)

A man walks into a crowded room with ruby-red eyes, blood bucketing out of every orifice and spewing black vomit. He is dubbed 'a human virus bomb' but this is not a character from an apocalyptic film.

He is a patient in a Nairobi hospital waiting room in 1980, hours before he dies from an untreatable rain-forest virus. Nine years later the devastatingly infectious disease spreads to the suburbs of Washington DC.

This is the terrifying true horror story of an Ebola outbreak — it sold more than two million copies when it was first published and is now timely reissued. Preston traces theories of how and where the virus originated, the initial symptoms and the agonising traits of the victims' end. Told with chilling detail and scientific authority, the book remains a powerful and compelling read.

Spike Milligan: Man of Letters

ed. Norma Farnes

(Penguin £9.99)

On March 18, 1968 something was bothering Spike Milligan. Unable to solve the issue himself, he wrote for assistance: 'Dear Mrs Thatcher, I am writing to you asking can something be done about the unbalance between male and female Mallards in London parks. The males outnumber the females 10 to 1, the terrible conditions for the females during the mating season often ends up in death, mutilation and permanent injury.'

Thatcher responded but Milligan's silly badinage did not stop there. As this superb assemblage of his letters to friends, the police and members of the Royal family among many others shows, there weren't many situations that didn't warrant a letter. Compiled by his agent and manager, the collection pulls together bundles of Milligan's wonderfully witty and wacky correspondence spanning four decades.

UK SCIENTISTS READY TO TEST THE FIRST VACCINE FOR EBOLA

BRITONS are to be the first to test a new vaccine against the deadly ebola virus.

Sixty healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial.

If the vaccine performs as well in humans as in monkeys, the trial will be extended to 80 people in West Africa. The entire trial programme is being fast-tracked with the intention of using the vaccine on those at high risk early next year.

More than 1,550 people have died from the virus, with more than 3,000 confirmed cases - mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

It is the worst epidemic since the disease was identified 38 years ago and the World Health Organisation predicts the outbreak will last for many months, affecting at least 20,000 people.

At present there is no vaccine and no proven treatment. The new vaccine contains a single ebola virus protein from the strain sweeping West Africa - anyone inoculated cannot develop the disease itself. It is different from the experimental medicine ZMapp being used to treat William Pooley, 29, the first Briton to contract the virus while working as a nurse in Sierra Leone. He is in isolation at London's Royal Free Hospital.

The trial will be led by Professor Adrian Hill, of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University.

'The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response,' he said.

The vaccine is being co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, along with a dual vaccine containing West Africa and Sudan strains of ebola being trialled in the US. The UK initiative is backed by £2.8million from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development.

FRANCE has recommended its citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia following the ebola outbreak, while Air France has temporarily suspended flights to Sierra Leone.

The French national carrier is halting three flights a week to the capital Freetown at the request of the French government.

Air France will maintain daily flights to Conakry in Guinea and Lagos, Nigeria.

Referring to ebola, which has already killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa since March, a spokesman for the airline said: 'Measures in place at airports there guarantee... that no passengers presenting symptoms... can board.'

Paris said the increasing spread of ebola - notably in Liberia and Sierra Leone - had prompted the request for suspension of the flights and a recommendation that French citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia. Many regional and major airlines have suspended services to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the deadly virus.

Meanwhile, the United Nations has said the lack of flights to the affected area is making it increasingly difficult to bring in much-needed supplies.

UN flights bringing humanitarian workers to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have also faced restrictions.

TEKMIRA HIGH ON TAKEOVER TONIC

MERGER mania in the healthcare sector has kept dealers on their toes during the peak holiday weeks.

Cash-rich pharmaceutical majors are forever looking to acquire their smaller, more nimble counterparts, and are prepared to pay stonking premium prices.

Last weekend, Californian-based InterMune was swallowed by Swiss drugs giant Roche for an eye-watering $8.3bn. The market now hears rumours that at least four international drug groups are stalking a company that is developing an experimental treatment for the deadly ebola virus.

Shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals rose 3.24pc to $19.75 following a sharp increase last week on news that it has verbal approval from the US Food & Drug Administration that would fast-track its new drug to treat the virus.

This action may allow the medicine to be used to treat the growing tally of those stricken by the virus. TKM-Ebola is being developed by Tekmira and the US Department of Defence medical team.

Tekmira is capitalised at a measly £400m and would cost a bidder in the region of £1bn-plus, a relatively small mouthful for any cash-rich giant.

Rumours suggest two of the interested parties could be the UK's Shire (22p off at 4894p) and GlaxoSmithKline (15.5p dearer at 1463p. The mega premium paid for InterMune puts a valuation of $40 plus a-share on Tekmira.

The outbreak of ebola in Africa has killed more than 1,000 people since February and is the worst since the disease was discovered in the mid-1970s.

Scrappy small selling became contagious as the day wore on but the Footsie rallied late to close 7.9 points higher at 6,830.66. Wall Street retrieved an initial 14 points fall to close 15.31 points higher at 17,122.01, putting the record 17,138.27 level well within its sights.

Morrisons, which has been one of the worst Footsie performers this year, down more than 30pc, rallied 2.6p to 184.4p on Kantar market research data showing its sales in the 12 weeks to August 17 were better than expected.

Tesco, on the other hand, shed 2.8p to 249.3p following data showing its sales decline had worsened, falling 4pc with its market share dipping to 28.8pc from 30.2pc.

New boss Dave Lewis will have his work cut out to reverse the trend when he takes over from Phil Clarke in October.

United Utilities lost 11.52p to 896.5p on a RBC Capital Markets downgrade to sector perform. Any positives are priced-in, says the broker. Oil services group Petrofac rose 26p to 1149p after maintaining its full-year earnings guidance despite a 44pc fall in interim profits to £82m. The order book hit a record £12.2bn.

Excellent interim results helped high quality ceramic tableware maker Churchill China serve up a gain of 17.5p at 460p.

Sales rose to a record £16.8m in the six months to June as its hospitality business, which supplies crockery to restaurants, pubs and conference venues, traded above expectations due to the buoyant trend of people eating out.

Cantor Fitzgerald has advised clients to load up with motor components giant GKN, 2.8p easier at 356.8p.

The broker points out that the President of Anfavea, the Brazilian National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, has indicated that the pace of new car sales has recovered since the very depressed levels in June arising from the World Cup.

Second half Brazilian sales are likely to be up 14pc. A stabilised Brazil suggests that global auto production will beat general expectations. Its target price is 430p.

Punters were itching to get hold of Tyratech, 0.62p up at 8p, on hearing that it will be providing Sainsbury and Tesco with its Vamousse head lice products. Superdrug and Boots have already been signed up and first products will appear in UK stores in September.

In the US, Vamousse is stocked in more than 4,000 Walmart stores and is available through online retailers Walmart.com, Amazon.com, drugstore.com and Walgreens.com.

Monitise advanced 5.5p to 47.75p after strengthening its tie-up with IBM Corporation. Its mobile banking and payment technology will be enabled, hosted and sold via IBM cloud-delivered solutions, bringing it closer to its target of 200m users using its mobile money products and services by 2018.

AfriAg's agri-marketing division AfriAg Marketing has sold its first refrigerated 40ft sea container, containing a gross weight of about 20 metric tons of South African-sourced frozen fish products, to clients in China. The news lifted the stock 25pc to 0.68p.

Specialist engineering group James Fisher added 15p at 1400p following another strong set of interim results.

 

***

TODAY sees an interesting new arrival on the standard listings market. Shares of General Industries will start trading at 10p and should achieve a small premium. The cash shell raised £1m and is believed to be looking for a reverse takeover in the services sector. Its management has a good track record and its backers include the well-respected Richard Wallenberg, who has had several IPO successes over the years.

EBOLA NURSE IS GIVEN EXPERIMENTAL 'CURE'

THE British nurse struck down by ebola has been given the experimental drug ZMapp which has cured two American aid workers.

William Pooley, 29, was sitting up in bed reading and chatting to staff yesterday, the doctor treating him said.

Medical staff described him as a 'resilient and remarkable young man', but also warned it was 'too early to say' how he was doing.

Mystery surrounded how the Royal Free hospital had acquired the drug last night, following warnings that its supplies had run out.

The hospital said that they had been able to obtain the drug through 'clinical networks' and the support of 'international colleagues' but did not expand on this.

The news came as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described Mr Pooley as a 'very, very brave man' and praised the 'world class' doctors treating him.

The World Health Organisation also last night appealed for more volunteers like him to travel to West Africa, despite the risks. Mr Pooley, a registered nurse from Eyke, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, contracted the deadly virus after selflessly volunteering to care for ebola patients in Sierra Leone.

He was airlifted to Britain on Sunday in an isolation sack and taken to the Royal Free Hospital in north London, which has the only ward in the UK equipped to deal with ebola. Yesterday, Dr Michael Jacobs, consultant and clinical lead in infectious diseases at the hospital, said Mr Pooley had decided to take the drug despite the risks.

'Will is in a stable position and we are very pleased with where he is, we couldn't hope for more.' He added: 'It is an experimental medicine - we made that absolutely clear in our discussions with him. He came to the very clear conclusion in his own mind that he wanted to go ahead with the treatment.'

The doctor said that Mr Pooley, who previously told his boss in Sierra Leone that he would be fine in two weeks, was sitting up in bed reading and talking to doctors.

He said: 'What has become apparent to us is that he is clearly a rather resilient and remarkable young man.'

Mr Pooley will continue to receive experimental treatment over the coming days, although it is not known how his disease will progress, Dr Jacobs added.

Last week American ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly credited ZMapp for his recovery after he and fellow aid worker Nancy Writebol fell ill.

However, Liberian doctor Abraham Borbor died despite taking the drug, as did Spanish priest Miguel Pajares who also contracted the virus in Liberia.

A SELFLESS HERO TO LIFT OUR HEARTS
BY BEL MOONEY

Try to imagine yourself as a patient at the neglected Kenema hospital in Sierra Leone, desperately afraid, alone and in pain.

In panic you shout out for help, and then the calm young Englishman arrives at your side, offering water and murmuring soothing words you don't understand — but which make you feel cared for.

That's surely how it must have been when brave William Pooley did his rounds. The British nurse, now struck down by the Ebola virus, must have seemed like an angel to the terrified patients after most of those who should have been nursing them had fled.

William had already made the selfless decision to go to the country's capital Freetown to carry out a six-month volunteer placement at a hospice caring for those terminally ill with HIV, cancer and tuberculosis. That's the kind of person he is.

Then he heard of the place where need was even greater — the hospital with minimum standards of hygiene and care, where people afflicted by the dreaded virus were dying horrible deaths.

Though warned against such an act of selfless heroism, William put his own life in jeopardy to work horrendous hours and try to save others. He didn't heed any 'health'*'safety' considerations or consult his insurance policy, he just acted because he had dedicated his life to others.

 

Fellow Briton Dr Oliver Johnson, who worked with him in Sierra Leone, describes William as 'a pretty extraordinary guy': 'From the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could.

'He and I spoke about the risk and I think he absolutely understood. He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.'

Who could forget seeing a filmed interview with William, in which he expressed his happiness at seeing patients recover? He looked tired, but upbeat and smiling — not knowing he was about to contract Ebola. But I doubt he would have done anything differently.

Unfortunately — but predictably — there's a chorus of criticism polluting the internet: poisonous voices calling William Pooley a fool, spouting the old cliché that charity begins at home, and criticising our Government's wonderfully quick decision to airlift this British citizen efficiently to a London hospital where, despite our gripes about the NHS, clever people and first-world medical equipment should save him.

Undoubtedly, self-interest is behind many of the negative comments, since ignorant people seem terrified that William will cause an Ebola epidemic here.

Here is a choice example, posted on the Left-wing Guardian newspaper's website: 'This guy's life is not so very valuable. It was staggeringly thick to bring him home.'

Not valuable? Try telling that to Will's parents, Robin and Jackie, and all those who love him.

In stark contrast, Mr and Mrs Pooley have asked 'everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will'.

You can see where their son's generosity of spirit came from.

It's just as well William believes that all human life is valuable.

We should be celebrating that lesson. How, in a world which can seem so wicked and rotten — where murderous jihadists and other pitiless fanatics regard human life as cheap — one selfless young man calmly risked his life in the most difficult situation imaginable, to help others.

What's more, this story reminds us that he is not alone. All over the globe, men and women like him are working for charities such as Voluntary Service Overseas, Christian Aid, Oxfam, the Red Cross, Medecins sans Frontieres and Save The Children.

They are driven by altruism — and perhaps to repay some of the blessings of the privileged lives we lead in the West. Many started as teachers, social workers, nurses, engineers or doctors, but felt inspired by the challenge of working for a charity abroad.

That idea of duty used to be the backbone of education, instilled by schools, family and church.

During World War I, it led women of all classes to the front line as volunteer nurses. There was a heroism about such self-sacrifice which all recognised.

It was a heroism that accepted the overriding moral principle at the root of Christianity and Judaism (as well the charitable impulse at the heart of Islam) that you always try to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.

Sadly, it sometimes feels as if the concept is foreign to most people today — until one young man reminds us that altruism is always there, even if we can't see it; a light shining in darkness.

In an age when the idea of 'heroism' is devalued to such an extent that an overpaid footballer is called a 'hero', we desperately need the William Pooleys of our world to remind us of what the human spirit is capable.

I ask you, what would the world be, bereft of such sacrifice? What effect would it have on our daily lives?

You may think one man's (perhaps reckless) courage in Sierra Leone has nothing to do with your life, but that's wrong. It has everything to do with what Victorian novelist George Eliot called 'the growing good of the world'.

It all adds up — a great cumulative wave of strength that benefits us all in the end. It's nothing less than another battle won in the war between good and evil.

People may sneer about 'do-gooders', but what do they want? People to do harm? Lord knows, there's enough of that about.

But my point is, the day will come when you will want somebody to 'do good' to you. Then, you will be grateful for the universal kindness that lifts what psychoanalyst Carl Jung called 'the collective unconscious'.

In my long journalistic career, I have met plenty of people like William Pooley — from the retired British couple volunteering as teachers in a poverty-stricken Ugandan village for two years, to the ex-Army cook working with mentally-handicapped girls outside Bangkok, to the gentle female prison visitor in the West Country who worked with the most violent young men, to the former accountant who gave up his lucrative career to join the Christian organisation Street Pastors, which helps drunken revellers in town centres.

And so many more.

William Pooley's friends say he is determined to go back to Sierra Leone when his ordeal is over. How uplifting that is.

I pray he will recover and continue his inspiring work. Because somewhere, in a hospital bed, a man, woman or child is lying in pain — and needs him.

Somebody who has similar hopes, fears and loves, as you and me.

Is ZMapp a cure for ebola?

At present there is no proven vaccine or cure for the deadly virus, but an experimental new drug holds hope of saving lives.

Two American aid workers infected with ebola recovered after being given the untested medication, known as ZMapp.

So far it is unclear whether they survived thanks to the drug or as a result of other treatment they received.

Other victims - including a senior Liberian doctor and a Spanish priest working in West Africa - have died despite receiving ZMapp. 

How else can you treat ebola?

The standard treatment involves giving intravenous fluids, antibiotics and oxygen until the patient's immune system is strong enough to fight off the disease.

But this kind of care is all but impossible in the desperately poor African countries where the ebola outbreak has taken hold.

Stopping an outbreak requires isolating sufferers, stopping chains of transmission, good infection control in hospitals and safe burial practices.

Will other victims receive ZMapp?

The US-developed drug is highly experimental, and supplies are extremely limited. Only 12 doses of ZMapp were made initially and they have now all been used, according to London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine professor David Mabey.

It will take weeks and perhaps months to manufacture more of the drug, and it will be several years before full clinical trials are complete.

How does ZMapp work?

The drug contains a cocktail of laboratory-made 'monoclonal antibodies' engineered to stop the ebola virus from entering the human body's cells. It is made using genetically modified tobacco plants grown on a US scientific research site in Kentucky.

Will William Pooley be given it?

The Department of Health says it has 'not ruled out' using an experimental therapy on the British nurse.

Any decision to use an untested drug will be taken by Mr Pooley along with his doctors.

Are other drugs being developed?

Yes. Japan said it is ready to supply a new anti-influenza drug called Favipiravir as a possible means of treating ebola. And Canadian drugs firm Immunovaccine has reported promising results in tests on monkeys for its ebola vaccine.

Friends and relatives of patients at the Royal Free Hospital in North London, have spoken of their shock at finding out a victim of the ebola virus was being treated in the same building as their loved ones.

Laura Burbridge, 53, said she was 'taken aback' when she arrived with her daughter in labour yesterday to find several TV cameras trained on the Hampstead hospital.

The grandmother-of-four, from Holborn, said: 'If it hadn't been so urgent last night, then maybe I would have tried to go somewhere else. It's such a deadly disease - it is a worry.

'It seemed busier yesterday in the canteen; I've noticed a lot fewer people today, maybe because of what's happened.'

Ena Bradish, 78, who was visiting a friend at the hospital, said: 'I think they're taking a real risk in bringing him here that it could spread to the UK, why can't they treat him where he is?

'They might save him but I'm worried he'll kill more people infecting them - and our health service can do without that to deal with.'

But despite the risk, many Londoners said they supported the Royal Free Hospital for helping the British nurse. Russell Marshall, 47, said: 'I'm not one of those "not in my backyard" sorts of people.

'We have the benefits of living by a big hospital so this is also a consequence of that which we have to deal with. I have full faith that it will be contained,' he added. Relatives of long-term patients had been informed in advance that any British ebola victims would be taken to the Royal Free.

Penny Hopkins, 53, who has visited her mother daily for the past five weeks, said: 'I knew they would come here if there was a case - it's the only place they can go - but I just didn't think it was actually going to happen.'

The childcare worker from West Hampstead added: 'If it was a member of my family, I'd want them to go to the best place possible.'

Her brother Ben Elgar said he had been reassured by doctors, who hadn't seemed 'too bothered' by it.

The 42-year-old accountant said: 'When I first found out, I was quite shocked - but the doctors seemed very confident and told me they had no concerns as he was completely isolated.'

Other visitors praised the doctors. Medical student Catherine McCrann, 26, said: 'I think they are doing a great job here - it's nice to hear some positive news about a hospital.'

Her boyfriend Martin Catterall, who injured his little finger playing rugby on Sunday, said he was given a leaflet explaining the situation in the A&E waiting room.

The 31-year-old auditor from Kentish Town said: 'At first I thought it was a little risky, but when I found out he was a British national and it was the only place for him, I thought fair enough.'

THIS is the chilling moment medics in biohazard suits boarded a British Airways flight after fears a ten-year-old girl was infected with ebola.

More than 100 passengers aboard the London to Aberdeen flight were held in quarantine for two hours on Sunday night after the girl, believed to be of Nigerian descent, was 'violently sick'.

Specialist crews from the Scottish Ambulance Service wearing thick full-body biohazard suits boarded the flight after it landed at Aberdeen airport.

The girl was examined at the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital, but was found not to have the deadly virus.

It is understood worried cabin crew alerted the pilot, who contacted Aberdeen airport and a full emergency procedure was put in place awaiting the aircraft's arrival.

Passengers were made to wait on the tarmac for almost two hours before eventually being escorted into the airport terminal after the child was removed from the plane.

A spokesman for NHS Grampian said: 'A child was clinically assessed but has not been admitted to hospital.'

MY HAPPINESS AT HELPING SAVE EBOLA PATIENTS, BY HERO NURSE

THE British nurse struck down by ebola had spoken of his joy at seeing his patients recover - just days before contracting the disease himself.

Smiling broadly in his blue scrubs, William Pooley remained upbeat despite working up to 18 hours a day surrounded by death in a desperately understaffed hospital in Sierra Leone.

Eleven days later, he is being treated on a London ward having been airlifted back to the UK by the RAF after catching ebola from the very victims he was trying to save.

Mr Pooley, 29, had graphically depicted the horror in African hospital where he had selflessly volunteered to help those stricken by the outbreak.

He was forced to make the painful decision to leave sufferers alone overnight after the other staff fled. It came after angry locals rioted outside the hospital in response to rumours that ebola was a ruse to steal sufferers' blood and harvest their organs.

'We gave the patients water and paracetamol and then we had to walk out,' he said. 'Patients are dying the most horrible deaths.

'I'm expecting to find several corpses tomorrow morning.'

Meanwhile, colleagues said yesterday that Mr Pooley was so dedicated to helping the people of Sierra Leone that he could return to the country to complete his volunteer nursing placement.

Gabriel Madiye, executive director of a local hospice where the Briton had worked, said he had pledged to stay in the West African nation for another six months before being struck down, adding: 'He had a lot of compassion.

'He loved people, he loved patient care, and he went into the community to reach out to patients.' Mr Pooley was pictured in a white infection control suit at the hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola.

He remained positive when he was interviewed less than a fortnight ago, choosing to focus on the patients who had recovered.

'It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state,' he told the Guardian newspaper.

But the British nurse also spoke of chronic staffing shortages, the excruciating pain of ebola sufferers, mothers watching their children die, and how patients had to lie next to corpses for hours because there were not enough staff to move the bodies.

'It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference. I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping,' he told Sierra Leone-based blogger Jo Dunlop. Fellow volunteer Professor Robert Garry, of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, praised Mr Pooley's dedication to his ebola patients. He said: 'Will was working longer and harder than just about anyone out there. He was putting in 12 to 18-hour days.

'We have been understaffed at the hospital. Nursing staff have been afraid to go in.'

Dr Oliver Johnson, who has also been helping ebola victims in Sierra Leone, said Mr Pooley was an 'extraordinary guy' who knew the risks involved but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and his colleagues.

Mr Pooley's family yesterday praised the doctors treating him at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.

They said in a statement: 'We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.

'We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.

'Will is receiving excellent care and we could not ask for him to be in a better place. We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will.'

Mr Pooley was said to be 'not currently seriously unwell' and his doctors are thought to be confident that he has a good chance of fighting the disease.

He travelled to Sierra Leone in March to carry out a six-month volunteer placement as a palliative care nurse for people with HIV, cancer and tuberculosis at the Shepherd's Hospice in the capital Freetown.

But after the ebola outbreak took hold he asked for permission five weeks ago to transfer to Kenema Government Hospital to help those affected.

Mr Madiye said: 'He is a very brave man. He told me he would go in the morning and work for 12 hours. I asked why. He said, "we can't easily find nurses because they are all fearful of contracting the ebola virus".

'We feel so happy that the British Government has been able to airlift him to relative safety.

'We are hopeful that he will recover and come back to provide a service for Sierra Leonians.' 

He said Mr Pooley told him hours before he was flown back to Britain that he was feeling positive despite being diagnosed with the dreaded disease - and promised to call again within a fortnight for an update on his progress.

In emails to his family, Mr Pooley described his life in Sierra Leone, including a village meeting where he was singled out by dancing 'devils' because of his white skin. He said he lived with Mr Madiye for his first few weeks in the largest and most comfortable house in the area, but it had electricity for only a couple of hours in the evening.

Even the most basic tasks were time-consuming. Laundry had to be performed by hand, cooking was done over a fire, one pot at a time, and hot coals were used for ironing.

Mr Pooley grew up in a close-knit family in an idyllic rural setting in the Suffolk village of Eyke.

After school he travelled extensively, taking a course in teaching English as a foreign language in Calcutta as well as visiting Indonesia and Australia.

Mr Pooley's parents Robin and Jackie, who ran a removals firm, were last night at the London hospital where he is being treated.

One neighbour said: 'They are a lovely family.

'They are with him in London - not at his bedside but they are as close as they can be given the circumstances.'

Meanwhile, British universities are on high alert for possible cases of ebola ahead of the arrival of thousands of foreign students for the start of the academic year.

SEALED WARD WILL BE HOME FOR MONTHS

William Pooley will be kept behind plastic sheeting for weeks, if not months, to stop the spread of ebola.

Yesterday the 29-year-old nurse was put into an air transit isolator, a clear plastic sack, to stop the virus escaping into the RAF C-17 transport plane that flew him home from Freetown, Sierra Leone.

On board was a team of British specialists who conducted a full clinical examination before confirming he was safe to fly.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond gave the final approval for the repatriation before the transporter took off at 1.50pm UK time.Ebola is an extremely infectious virus, spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat.

The plastic sheeting that will shroud Mr Pooley's body for weeks will protect health workers and other patients from catching the disease.

Throughout the flight the doctors were covered in head-to-toe protective suits - the same uniform will be worn by everyone Mr Pooley sees over the coming weeks.

On landing at RAF Northolt last night the volunteer nurse - still inside his plastic bubble - was loaded into an ambulance and driven to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.

There, he was admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the hospital's high-level isolation unit - the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola.

He will occupy a £25,000 bed that will be burned after he leaves the hospital. The bed will sit inside an isolation tent.

Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses will be allowed to enter the room. Mr Pooley's treatment will focus on replacing the fluid he loses through internal bleeding.

An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop his organs failing. The doctors will also treat the bleeding from his nose, eyes and ears.

If they cannot get hold of the experimental ebola drug ZMapp, the doctors will simply try to manage the disease until Mr Pooley's immune system is strong enough to fight it off.

A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building. The air will also be kept under negative pressure to stop any escaping from the tent. Human waste will be collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker before it is decontaminated and disposed of.

Stephen Mepham, one of the senior doctors at the unit, said earlier this month: 'The reason behind the unit is to protect healthcare workers from highly contagious infections such as ebola.

'Everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so the air is constantly added and removed.

'Outside the tent, the air flows through a series of filters and is deposited outside the hospital.'

The UK's only previous case of ebola came 38 years ago and led to more than 50 people being placed in isolation.

In 1976, Geoffrey Platt was working as a microbiologist at the government research centre at Porton Down.

He was removing a sample of liver tissue from an infected guinea pig when he accidentally pricked his thumb with a syringe containing the virus.

Six days later he started to show signs of the disease and was placed in isolation at Coppetts Wood hospital in North London. His wife and two sons and 50 other people he had come in contact with were also placed in isolation to contain the outbreak.

Mr Platt, now 80, suffered diarrhoea, vomiting, extreme weakness, memory loss and his temperature hit 40 degrees.

He spent 40 days in quarantine before recovering and returning to work.

Ten medical staff who treated him suffered mild symptoms.

BLOOD-SPATTERED FLOORS AT HOSPITAL WHERE BRAVE UK NURSE GOT EBOLA

MEDICS told yesterday of the stressful and desperate conditions in the makeshift ebola wards where the British victim worked.

Staff were too scared to come to work at Kenema government hospital where the floors were left splashed with blood.

The 350-bed hospital is a cluster of small cinder-block buildings in the centre of Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola.

The isolation units where the afflicted are taken are in temporary covered shelters with concrete floors, plastic sheeting for walls and tin roofs.

The doctors and nurses wear masks, goggles and impermeable Tyvek safety suits.

Nevertheless, 20 nurses and healthcare workers have died of ebola since the outbreak began. Loss of concentration brought on by the gruelling workload is blamed for them exposing themselves to the deadly virus. Daniel Bausch, an American doctor and ebola expert who was at the hospital last month, said in one ward of 30 patients 'the floor was splashed with blood, vomit, faeces and urine'.

Ebola sufferers often fall out of bed, he said, creating a decontamination nightmare for medics, who would also have to haul the patients back into bed.

There were also staff shortages because nurses walked out after not receiving their £20 a week hazard pay.

One nurse who continued working, Sister Nancy Yoko, 36, said: 'No one wants to come close to us, the nurses in the general ward won't talk to us, even our families are scared they will catch the virus from us.'

Ebola is new to Sierra Leone and there is much suspicion and mistrust about the hospital. There was even a rumour that locals wanted to burn down the Kenema site, which is in Sierra Leone's Eastern Province.

'They are angry with us, they don't believe we are trying to help,' said another nurse.

Robert Garry, an American professor of microbiology and immunology who has visited the hospital many times, said conditions were getting better.

Of the nurses' decision to strike, he said: 'It's not really surprising that some people made the judgement it's not worth their personal risk - no one could fault anyone for doing that. Some have set aside their own personal wellbeing and paid the ultimate price. We only wish the best for this young British nurse who put it all on the line.'

Professor Garry said the hospital was a decent multi-purpose facility by African standards but 'with not enough doctors, not enough nurses and not a whole lot of modern equipment'.

He added: 'Working in the ebola wards is very stressful. You are dealing with patients that are carrying a very dangerous virus - one mistake and you'll become infected yourself.

'If you are working long days, up to 18 hours, day after day, as no doubt this young British nurse did, you are more likely to make a mistake. Humans can only maintain that kind of intense concentration for so long.'

Colleagues who have returned from Kenema recently told him conditions were improving with more cleaners to do decontamination work. The hospital deals with 90 ebola cases a week.

A risk assessment published last month by Public Health England said the current outbreak could raise the danger for Britons working in humanitarian and healthcare delivery in affected areas.

However, the threat to tourists, visitors and expatriates was still considered 'very low if elementary precautions are followed'.
