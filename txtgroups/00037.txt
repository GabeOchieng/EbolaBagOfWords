Inside special isolation units at an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday, Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the two Americans infected with Ebola in West Africa, appeared to be responding to an experimental medicine devised by an obscure biotechnology company with ties to the Defense Department.

In West Africa, the estimated death toll from the outbreak kept rising, to 932, by the latest official count.

How and why Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol received the drug, ZMapp, is one of the many mysteries surrounding what has been called a ''secret serum,'' including the big one: Does it really work? The Americans are the only two patients who have been treated with the medicine, out of perhaps thousands who might have benefited so far, raising old questions about who does -- and does not -- have access to medications, including experimental drugs.

But the San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the primary developer of the drug, was consumed Wednesday with how to manufacture more of it with an eye to providing the drug to more patients, probably in the form of clinical trials.

''It's absolutely overwhelming,'' Larry Zeitlin, the president of Mapp, said in an interview Wednesday. ''We are discussing with the F.D.A. the right path to make the drug available to people as quickly and safely as possible,'' he added, referring to the Food and Drug Administration.

There were signs that efforts to increase production were beginning. Caliber Biotherapeutics, a Texas company established with funding from the Defense Department to respond to biological threats, has received inquiries from the government about whether it could help manufacture ZMapp, said R. Barry Holtz, the company's chief science and technology officer.

The World Health Organization said it would convene a panel of medical ethicists early next week to explore the use of the experimental treatment in the outbreak in West Africa. Currently, neither ZMapp nor any other medicine or vaccine is approved for treatment of the virus, but there are several experimental options under development.

How quickly the drug could be made on a larger scale will depend to some extent on the tobacco company Reynolds American. It owns the facility in Owensboro, Ky., where the drug is made inside the leaves of tobacco plants. David Howard, a spokesman for Reynolds, said it would take several months to scale up.

Mapp was started in 2003 by Dr. Zeitlin and Kevin J. Whaley. They have worked together for many years, starting at Johns Hopkins University, on research that uses crops to produce immune system proteins to treat diseases in people.

Dr. Whaley, the chief executive of Mapp, and Dr. Zeitlin have not spoken much publicly since the news of the treatment broke on Monday, saying they are too busy and want to avoid the limelight. The privately held company has only nine people and has been financed solely by government grants and contracts, they said.

They say that major decisions on how to proceed are in the hands of public health authorities.

''We definitely would like to ramp up to have an impact on the Ebola epidemic,'' Dr. Whaley said. But he added, ''We're not decision makers on many of these issues. There are regulatory and legal issues that have to be addressed.''

The drug had never before been tried in people, though it and some predecessor drugs had been tested in monkeys, showing some effectiveness. Mapp was only now gearing up to start the larger animal toxicity studies typically needed before testing it in humans, with an eye to doing the first human safety studies in healthy volunteers next year. For that reason there were very few doses available when the Ebola outbreak started.

Now the company is trying to move faster and it is likely the drug will be tested in patients rather than healthy volunteers.

ZMapp uses an approach called passive immunotherapy. Instead of having a vaccine stimulate the immune system to make antibodies that attack the virus, passive immunotherapy simply supplies the antibodies to the patients. For some infectious diseases, these antibodies are extracted from the blood of patients who have survived the infection and presumably have effective antibodies.

ZMapp instead consists of antibodies that are made by exposing mice to a key Ebola protein and harvesting their antibodies. Those antibodies are then genetically modified to make them more like human antibodies and therefore less likely to provoke an immune reaction if injected into people.

The gene for each antibody is then introduced into the leaves of tobacco plants using a system developed by Icon Genetics, a German company. The leaves then produce the antibody.

In one study published last year, three out of seven monkeys treated with antibodies developed by Mapp survived being infected with Ebola, even though treatment did not start until four days after the infection. Both animals in the control group died. The treatment worked even better in another study when begun earlier after exposure to the virus.

It turns out another tiny company, Defyrus, based in Toronto, was independently developing a similar treatment with the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The companies agreed to combine the best of their antibodies into a single cocktail called ZMapp, which is what the two American aid workers received. The data for ZMapp in monkeys has not been published but is said to be substantially better than for the predecessor drugs.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it was ''too early to make any conclusions about how effective this intervention is,'' since it was tested in only two people.

Still, there is interest in scaling it up.

Monoclonal antibodies produced by pharmaceutical companies for use in treating cancer or other diseases are typically made in genetically engineered cells of mammals grown in vats. But Mapp chose to use plants instead because large quantities can potentially be produced more quickly and cheaply.

About 15 years ago, it was thought that genetically engineered crops would be widely used to produce human proteins for use as drugs. When Dr. Whaley and Dr. Zeitlin were both researchers at Johns Hopkins University in 1998, they published a paper with Monsanto scientists about a soybean genetically engineered to produce an antibody against genital herpes. But that idea has largely been abandoned, especially when it comes to using food crops, because of concerns that drugs produced in crops might inadvertently get into someone's cornflakes.

Even so, research has continued, funded by the Defense Department, on quickly producing proteins in tobacco plants that are grown inside buildings.

''You can start making protein within a matter of days,'' said Robert L. Erwin, president of iBio, another company that is working on this technology.

Still, it seems that this product will take several months to produce in any quantity. The capacity of the Kentucky facility is small, meant to support only the small scale human safety tests that Mapp had been planning. The tobacco plants have to be grown for about a month before they can be infected with the antibody gene and the proteins have to be harvested and purified.

''Starting from zero and going to 60 is not so easy, but once you're at sixty you can keep going at that rate,'' Dr. Whaley said. He would not say how many doses could be made and how quickly.

Dr. Fauci of the infectious diseases institute said officials had been told it would be a moderate amount even after several months. ''You're not talking about thousands of doses or even hundreds of doses,'' he said.

But there are some other companies that can also make drugs in tobacco, including Caliber, which has a larger capacity than the Kentucky facility. So the government is exploring using them to supplement production.

''We told them we have the capacity and are ready,'' said Dr. Holtz of Caliber. He said that together Caliber and the Kentucky facility of Reynolds could produce large quantities in six months.

Dr. Michael V. Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has responded on the ground to Ebola outbreaks, said the use of ZMapp for the two Americans raised some concerns given the limited existing supply. ''What was the prioritization that allowed these patients to be treated?'' he said.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the reason was that Samaritan's Purse, the organization that employed one of the aid workers, contacted the Centers for Disease Control, which in turn referred them to National Institutes of Health, which in turn referred them to Mapp.

Doing clinical trials in Africa will likely require approvals from authorities there. And treating large numbers of patients with ZMapp, which needs to be given intravenously, could be difficult.

''What can you give in an austere treatment environment where there is very little nursing care?'' asked Dr. Callahan. Authorities, along with the San Diego biotech company, are trying to figure it all out. Dr. Zeitlin said, ''We're kind of in uncharted territory here.''

Scrambling to catch up with the worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, the World Health Organization announced Wednesday that it was considering the declaration of an international public health emergency and would convene a panel of experts in coming days to explore the use of experimental treatments for the incurable disease.

The announcements came as fears spread that a Saudi citizen might have taken the Ebola virus home to Saudi Arabia, which is still reeling from a mismanaged epidemic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that has killed nearly 300 people in the last two years. Saudi news media said that the citizen, a businessman in his 40s, died on Wednesday at King Fahd Hospital in Jidda after exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, and that Saudi health officials had submitted biological samples from the patient to laboratories in the United States and Germany.

The Saudi accounts emphasized that the illness had not yet been identified. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said in an email that the patient appeared to have visited affected areas in Sierra Leone.

The organization also announced 108 new Ebola cases recorded from Saturday to Monday, bringing the total to 1,711, with 932 deaths. Nearly all are in the West African countries afflicted by the outbreak: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Late Wednesday, Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, declared a state of emergency, saying that some civil rights might be suspended to help slow the spread of the disease.

But in a sign of the spread of the disease internationally, the organization listed five new cases in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, bringing the Nigerian total to nine. The virus was discovered to have leapfrogged there by plane last week, carried by an American who had been working in Liberia and died in a Nigerian hospital.

A patient at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, however, was found not to have the virus, officials said Wednesday, and was improving.

The health organization said an emergency committee of international experts was evaluating whether the Ebola outbreak constituted a ''Public Health Emergency of International Concern,'' a classification that has only rarely been invoked to combat deadly contagions. The classification gives health authorities greater powers that include quarantining people in affected areas. The committee's recommendations are expected by Friday.

In a separate announcement, the organization said it was convening a panel of medical ethicists to explore the use of experimental treatments for Ebola, which has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent. The virus causes high fevers, aches and severe internal bleeding.

''We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak,'' Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the W.H.O.'s assistant director general, said in the announcement. ''We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is.''

Several experimental options are under development, including a drug administered to two Americans who had been working with Ebola patients in Liberia through Christian relief groups. Both were flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and have shown improvement, causing an international debate over why Americans were given the drug when hundreds of Africans have died without access to it.

The W.H.O.'s announcement also cited the relief group workers' apparent response to the drug, saying it had ''raised questions about whether medicine that has never been tested and shown to be safe in people should be used in the outbreak and, given the extremely limited amount of medicine available, if it is used, who should receive it.''

Asked about such treatments, President Obama told a news conference in Washington it was premature for him to say, but he did not rule it out. ''We've got to let the science guide us,'' he said.

Fighting Ebola for Us All

On July 23, Dr. Kent Brantly woke up with a fever. He immediately quarantined himself, and three days later a test confirmed his nightmare. He had the Ebola virus.

Brantly, 33, emailed a friend and said that he was ''terrified,'' for he knew better than anyone the horror of the virus. He had been treating patients in West Africa with it for many weeks, watching as they vomited, hemorrhaged internally and sometimes bled from multiple orifices -- then weakened and died.

Some people have blamed Brantly and another American missionary infected, Nancy Writebol, for bringing the danger to themselves, even objecting to their return to Atlanta to be treated for the disease at Emory University Hospital. For example, Donald Trump argued that Brantly and Writebol should not be brought back to the United States because of the risks involved.

''People that go to far away places to help out are great -- but must suffer the consequences!'' Trump said on Twitter.

On the contrary, this Ebola outbreak underscores why we have not only a humanitarian interest in addressing global health, but also a national interest in doing so. Brantly and Writebol are moral leaders in this effort and underscore the practical imperative of tackling global contagions early on. They deserve our gratitude and admiration because in Liberia they were protecting us as well as Liberians.

The human mind is very sensitive to threats from the likes of Al Qaeda. We are less attuned to public health threats, even those that claim more lives: Some 15,000 people with AIDS still die in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's better to address a contagious disease at its source rather than allow it to spread.

''If we don't fight to contain it there, we're going to fight to contain it somewhere else,'' notes Ken Isaacs of Samaritan's Purse, the Christian aid group for which Brantly works.

The World Bank has pledged $200 million to try to control the Ebola outbreak, but a tiny fraction of that sum might have contained it early on.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., cites an American-backed program in Uganda to train health workers to diagnose and contain Ebola. It worked. In 2011, a 12-year-old girl there caught the Ebola virus and died from it -- but no one else was infected. It was an exceptionally rare Ebola episode that stopped after just a single case.

A similar program in West Africa might likewise have limited the human and financial cost of this outbreak, Frieden noted, adding: ''An outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere.''

This isn't true only of the Ebola virus. Frieden recalls caring in New York for a patient from India with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, a complex case that cost $100,000 to cure. Later, a program was set up in the patient's native village that could have resolved the case early for $10.

New York hospitals have been on alert for Ebola, but diagnosis and segregation are complicated. I know because I was once such a suspected case.

Years ago, when I lived in Japan, I returned to Tokyo from Congo at the time of an Ebola outbreak there. One night a week later, I came down with a high fever. It felt like malaria, so I made inquiries about what hospital in Tokyo could best treat malaria the next day.

The health authorities heard ''Congo'' and ''fever'' and sent an ambulance staffed with people in what looked like spacesuits to rush me to a hospital. My neighbors were taken aback by the scene.

But, at the hospital, the emergency room night doctor knew nothing about tropical diseases. He poked me a bit, shrugged and told me to go home. (The next day, I confirmed that it was malaria.)

So don't see Brantly and Writebol as reckless curiosities who somehow brought Ebola upon themselves. See them as leaders on the front line of an effort to help and protect Americans and Africans alike. We sometimes forget that health workers can brave significant risks -- of infection with H.I.V., with tuberculosis, or even with the Ebola virus. Indeed, the staff treating Brantly and Writebol in Atlanta volunteered for that duty, and some offered to cancel vacation plans to help.

Bravo to them, and to so many health workers in Africa and America who try to halt the spread of disease -- because it's where humanitarian interests and national interests coincide.

''It's natural to feel sorry for Kent'' Brantly, a former medical school professor of his, Richard Gunderman, wrote in The Indianapolis Star. ''But I wonder if Kent wouldn't turn this around. Instead, he might feel sorry for some of us, at least those of us shaking our heads in dismay at anyone who would travel halfway across the world to do what he did. A ship may be safest in harbor, but that is not what ships are for.''

New York Today: A Better Egg Sandwich

Good morning on this lovely Thursday.

For decades, breakfast in Manhattan was a cup of slightly burnt Arabica coffee and an egg sandwich.

You didn’t ask questions.

But now, coffee has gone the way of wine, and egg sandwiches have gone the way of coffee.

There are egg whites and arugula sprigs, chorizo and ciabatta.

And now, higher standards have reached as far as the Midtown deli, that last frontier of culinary indifference.

A Kickstarter appeared last week that proposes to teach Midtown deli chefs how to make a better egg sandwich[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyscoops/saving-the-nyc-egg-sandwich].

“I will save the adequate-but-underachieving NYC egg sandwich by delivering instructional leaflets to all Midtown egg-sandwich makers,” declares Joseph Checkler[https://twitter.com/JoeCheckler], the Brooklyn-based reporter behind the project.

Mr. Checkler resists fancy seasonings or techniques, instead offering advice against reheated meats and over-scrambled eggs.

So far, he has raised zero dollars toward his $310 goal (for leaflet supplies).

His Kickstarter page acknowledges the “risks and challenges” of his plan:

“People are set in their ways. They might not listen.”

But a survey of half a dozen Midtown delis suggested — mostly — otherwise.

“We can take a suggestion to make people happy. That’s good for us,” said Mani Singh at 876 Market Deli on 31st Street.

“Everyone is different. We’ll do it their way,” he added.

Only one deli worker raised objections.

Ali Saleh, of Chelsea Deli on Seventh Avenue said, “If he makes it better than me, I’ll do it.”

“But it’s got to be better than mine.”

(This Just In: The Kickstarter has been funded.)

Here’s what else is happening.

Ann Coulter, the conservative firebrand, expressed little sympathy for the American doctor, Kent Brantley, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was transported back to the United States on Saturday for treatment.

Via The Hill[http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/214545-coulter-blames-doctor-for-catching-ebola]

Coulter led her comments with the controversial headline “Ebola doc’s condition downgraded to ‘idiotic.’ ”

The conservative pundit suggested the doctor invited the risk of catching Ebola by traveling to Africa and that missionaries preferred to help those overseas rather than the needy at home because they wanted to be seen as “heroic.”

“Why did Dr. Brantly have to go to Africa? The very first ‘risk factor’ listed by the Mayo Clinic for Ebola — an incurable disease with a 90 percent fatality rate — is: ‘Travel to Africa,’ ” said Coulter. “Can’t anyone serve Christ in America anymore?”

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Waiting for word.

Washington correspondents knew for much of the day that President Obama was weighing intervention in Iraq.

The deliberations at the White House stretched over many hours, according to our reporter Mark Landler.

“Shortly after 6 p.m., the White House posted a photo of Mr. Obama consulting his national security team in the Situation Room,” he tells us.

“To his right was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. Watching from across the table were Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, and her principal deputy, Antony J. Blinken.

“On the wall behind them, the clock recorded the time: 10:37 a.m.”

But it was not until after 9 p.m. that Mr. Landler, the pool reporter for the Washington press corps, was ushered into the State Dining Room, emptied of furniture, for the president’s televised statement, [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/obama-weighs-military-strikes-to-aid-trapped-iraqis-officials-say.html]announcing aid for trapped Iraqis and the possibility of limited airstrikes.

• At the mercy of the merciless.

The Sunni militants in Iraq have carried out a campaign of carnage, including beheadings and summary executions.

That all pales compared to what they could do now that they have control of the country’s largest dam[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/isis-forces-in-iraq.html].

“By breaking the dam they could flood all along the Tigris, to Baghdad and beyond, killing, potentially, hundreds of thousands of people,” says Tim Arango, our reporter in Baghdad.

It’s not an idle threat, he says. They unleashed the waters of the Falluja Dam earlier this year, causing devastating flooding that sent thousands of people fleeing.

Or the group could just use it for leverage to demand that the government halt attacks, Mr. Arango says, “or as a form of extortion, collecting money in exchange for continuing to operate.”

“The possibilities are numerous, and ominous.”

• On guard against Ebola.

The continued spread of the epidemic in West Africa has prompted American health authorities to ratchet up precautions[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/qa.html] to the highest level.

And they are on the watch for specific indicators of even greater danger, says Marc Santora, our reporter covering New York City’s Ebola measures.

“One is if something changes with the virus, where it becomes much easier to transmit,” he says.

A second is if the number of infected people goes from a few thousand now (with 932 deaths) to tens of thousands of cases.

That, he says, “would make it much more likely that a person infected with the virus makes it to our shores.”

• “Students first, athletes second.”

That’s how the N.C.A.A. describes its philosophy of college sports.

“Clearly, there are plenty of critics out there who say it’s a myth,” says Steve Eder, our investigative sports reporter.

At the highest level of college sports, programs have become moneymaking behemoths, vaulting some players to celebrity status (even represented in video games) without giving them additional compensation.

But the model is shifting, thanks to athlete lawsuits and public pressure, and a vote held today by the N.C.A.A.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/sports/ncaafootball/ncaa-votes-to-give-greater-autonomy-to-richest-conferences.html] is a piece of that. With the vote, the universities with the wealthiest sports departments are now on track to soon be able to offer athletes more lucrative scholarships and other benefits.

“The amateurism model hangs in the balance,” Mr. Eder says.

“Critics will look at the vote today and say it’s one step toward further professionalizing college athletics.”

• Tangled up in mystery.

Bob Dylan’s first Top 40 hit was in 1965 (“Subterranean Homesick Blues”) and his last was in 1979 (“Gotta Serve Somebody”), but the public fascination with him is timeless.

Sam Tanenhaus tries to explain why his piece on a forthcoming book about Dylan[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/books/a-dylan-insiders-back-pages.html] was one of our most popular stories today.

“Dylan fascinates because he resists full understanding, just like his songs,” says Mr. Tanenhaus, a Times writer at large.

“In one sense he is very present — no comparably famous artist tours so often and so widely. But the interior Dylan remains remote and unknowable.”

As a result, he says, “many of us who have felt transformed by his art hunger for every new scrap in the hope that it may add even a small piece to the puzzle and bring him closer to us.”

Bush Urges Renewed Fight Against Deadly Diseases in Africa

WASHINGTON — Former President George W. Bush made a rare return to the nation’s capital on Wednesday to rally world leaders behind a public health campaign to conquer killer diseases in Africa and to forecast what he called “the beginning of the end of AIDS.”

Mr. Bush, who has made fighting AIDS in Africa one of his biggest priorities, flew to Washington to participate in a program connected to the Africa summit sponsored by his successor, President Obama. Mr. Bush’s public policy institute teamed up with Michelle Obama and the State Department to host a daylong forum on education and health with the spouses of African leaders.

The former president used the occasion to promote a new chapter in the battle with AIDS, saying at this stage the effort can be focused with better data, better treatment options and better prevention approaches to “reach and help the highest-risk regions and groups.” He also urged African leaders to avoid discrimination that makes public health efforts harder, although he did not specifically mention laws like the one overturned by a court in Uganda last week criminalizing homosexuality.

“Applied with clear goals and accountability, this saturation approach presents an amazing prospect – the beginning of the end of AIDS,” Mr. Bush said in an advance text of his Wednesday morning speech at the forum, held at the Kennedy Center. “But it also requires something from the rest of us. It is impossible to direct help where it is most needed when any group is targeted for legal discrimination and stigma. Compassion and tolerance are also good medicines.”

Mr. Bush returned to Washington at a time when many issues associated with his time in office are being debated here, including how to combat Islamic insurgents in Iraq, what to do about Russian aggression in Europe and whether to release a Senate report on what Mr. Obama calls the torture of terrorism suspects under the last administration. Mr. Bush has come under renewed criticism for invading Iraq and for authorizing the controversial interrogation techniques, but he offered no comments on any of those issues in his prepared remarks.

Instead, as he generally has since leaving office, he stayed out of the current debates. He noted lightly that as a retired president, “I have a little more time for golf, biking and painting [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/arts/design/george-w-bushs-art-exhibition-at-presidential-center.html?_r=0] than I used to” and he joked about recent trips to Africa when he and his wife, Laura Bush, helped refurbish health clinics in Zambia.

“I was in charge of painting,” he said in the advance text. “Laura put herself in charge of going over the spots I missed. It’s fair to say she had her work cut out for her. But in my defense, I was studying the impressionist movement at the time.”

While Mr. Bush’s presidency is remembered mostly for his pursuit of terrorists after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, since leaving office he has spent more time on his public health legacy.

In the White House, Mr. Bush created the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [http://www.pepfar.gov/], or Pepfar, the largest single global response to a disease, which is credited with helping to save millions of lives in Africa. From his current home in Dallas, Mr. Bush has focused on fighting cervical cancer and breast cancer, which together kill more women in Africa than any other disease.

He announced on Wednesday that the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon project he founded in partnership with Pepfar, Susan G. Komen and the United Nations AIDS program will expand to two more countries, Namibia and Ethiopia.

Mr. Bush said ignorance, misinformation and stigmatization were obstacles to public health that should be overcome, mentioning specifically what he called “false rumors about the HPV vaccine,” intended to guard against cervical cancer.

Some conservatives, like Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, have questioned the vaccine’s safety, but doctors have rejected such claims. Mr. Bush praised Zambia’s first lady for fighting those “rumors,” adding that was “something that needs to be done in America as well.”

“Too many women with HIV/AIDS and with breast cancer and cervical cancer are really dying from stigma,” he added in the prepared remarks. “Stigma seems like a high, unbreachable wall. But it is really as fragile as glass. It can broken by honesty, compassion and courage. And for the sake of all the mothers, daughters and granddaughters, we must make this work our own.”

As Meeting With African Leaders Winds Down, Policy Issues Take the Stage

WASHINGTON -- President Obama, ending a landmark summit meeting with African leaders, said Wednesday that the United States was dispatching teams of health workers to West Africa to help contain an outbreak of the Ebola virus, but stopped short of pledging to send experimental drugs because he said he did not know enough about them.

''I don't think all the information is in on whether this drug is helpful,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference, referring to experimental treatments for the virus, which has claimed nearly 1,000 lives and cast a shadow over this gathering of African leaders.

''What we do know is the Ebola virus, both currently and in the past, is controllable if you have a strong public health network in place,'' the president said, adding that in the hardest-hit countries, ''their public health systems have been overwhelmed.''

Speaking in the State Department's Dean Acheson Auditorium, where President John F. Kennedy once jousted with the White House press corps, Mr. Obama covered topics that included the crises in Gaza and Ukraine as well as the partisan gridlock at home, which has prompted speculation that he will move unilaterally on new immigration rules.

But the president's mind was clearly on his encounters with the nearly 50 leaders during the summit, a long-planned meeting that Mr. Obama hopes will secure his legacy as a leader concerned about Africa, but that White House officials struggled to keep from being swamped by fears about a growing public health emergency overseas.

Welcoming the leaders on Wednesday morning, Mr. Obama expressed solidarity with those from the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak, saying they had ''overcome great challenges, and they are drawing on the same spirit of strength and resilience today.''

''The United States and our international partners will continue to do whatever we can to help our African partners respond to this crisis, and to stand with the people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,'' he said.

The presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone canceled their participation. But Guinea's president, Alpha Conde, made it to Washington, even as the health authorities in his country announced 485 suspected and confirmed cases of the virus, including 358 deaths.

In the end, Mr. Obama pronounced the meeting, which mixed the elaborate choreography of a diplomatic summit with the unabashed salesmanship of a trade mission, a success.

On Wednesday, the focus shifted from trade and investment to security and governance -- more delicate topics for the leaders, some of whom are facing threats from Islamic militants. Others, including some with close ties to the United States, preside over authoritarian regimes that suppress the rights of journalists, gays and other groups.

At the news conference, Mr. Obama insisted that the United States was pushing several of the leaders to lift restrictions on the news media and, in the case of Egypt, to free three reporters for Al Jazeera, whose lengthy jail terms have set off an international outcry. The correspondents were sentenced to terms ranging from seven to 10 years for engaging in reporting that the Egyptian government said aided the Muslim Brotherhood.

''We have been troubled by some of the laws that have been passed around the world that seem to restrict the ability of journalists to pursue stories or write stories,'' Mr. Obama said.

But Mr. Obama defended the continued engagement with leaders that have checkered human-rights records, several of whom were among the leaders who met with the president on Wednesday in a series of closed sessions at the State Department.

''Many times, we will work with countries even though they're not perfect on every issue,'' the president said. ''We can be effective by working with them on certain areas and criticizing them, and trying to elicit improvements, in other areas.''

Turning to the crisis in Ukraine, Mr. Obama expressed concern about reports of Russian troops massing on the border but gave little indication of what he would do about it. He rejected the idea of providing arms to Ukraine, as many Republicans and some Democrats have urged, suggesting it would not alter the balance of power.

''The Russian Army's a lot bigger than the Ukrainian Army,'' he said. ''The issue here is not whether the Ukrainian Army has some additional weaponry. At least up until this point, they've been fighting a group of separatists who have engaged in some terrible violence but who can't match the Ukrainian Army. Now, if you start seeing an invasion by Russia, that's a different set of questions. We're not there yet.''

On Gaza, Mr. Obama said the United States would support peace talks in Cairo between Israel and the Palestinians, but said the longer-term goal had to be a plan to give the people in Gaza ''a sense of hope.''

''I have no sympathy for Hamas,'' he said. ''I have great sympathy for ordinary people in Gaza.''

Mr. Obama said he was encouraged by the resolve of African countries to fight militant threats and said the United States would work with Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda to create a rapid-response unit of peacekeepers.

The summit lured an infrequent visitor back to the capitol, former President George W. Bush, who rallied world leaders behind a public health campaign to conquer killer diseases in Africa and to forecast what he called ''the beginning of the end of AIDS.''

Speaking at a daylong forum on education and health issues at the Kennedy Center, Mr. Bush promoted a new chapter in the battle against AIDS. The effort could be focused with better data, better treatment options and better prevention approaches to ''reach and help the highest-risk regions and groups,'' he told the gathering, which was co-hosted by his public policy institute, the State Department and Michelle Obama.

''Applied with clear goals and accountability,'' he said, ''this saturation approach presents an amazing opportunity -- the beginning of the end of AIDS.''

A patient at a New York City hospital who recently traveled to West Africa and reported symptoms similar to those of the Ebola virus has tested negative for the disease, officials said on Wednesday.

The patient, whose name has not been released, was kept in isolation at Mount Sinai Hospital after he arrived at the emergency room late Sunday with a high fever and gastrointestinal problems. Residents were concerned that the city could have its first case of the deadly disease, but health officials said that the patient was unlikely to have Ebola.

On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a statement saying that the patient had tested negative for the Ebola virus.

“The patient is in stable condition, is improving, and remains in the care of our physicians and nurses,” the statement said.

An Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected more than 1,300 people and killed more than 700 of them. American health officials have urged doctors to be on high alert for travelers who return from the region with common symptoms, including fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

Officials at Mount Sinai have declined to identify the patient or his occupation and did not say whether he had been exposed to a patient with Ebola while he was in West Africa.

In the Grip of Ebola

MONROVIA, Liberia — LIBERIANS have begun calling the days between July 27 and Aug. 3 “the dark week” — 173 new Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus cases and 94 new deaths. How much darker things may get is anybody’s guess.

In Johnsonville, a swampy town outside Monrovia, three dozen corpses in body bags were dumped in shallow holes marked by wooden headstones last week. Afterward, white gloves and other protective garments lay scattered everywhere — abandoned by a doctor and his burial team as the community, bewildered with fright, chased them away.

Meanwhile, in Monrovia, the government seemed overwhelmed and panic-stricken. Only on Wednesday did it declare a full state of emergency, letting the military quarantine large areas. Fear, misinformation and flat-out denial have been far too common since March, when West Africa’s Ebola outbreak reached Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. Among the government’s first reactions was to limit journalists’ coverage of it. That, in my view, is a major reason the virus has spread as fast as it has.

My first sight of an Ebola case came late in June, and only after I insisted that I be allowed to cover one of the many burials rumored to be taking place. When an assistant health minister finally said yes, I went to Paynesville, outside Monrovia, to the ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) Hospital, where the aid workers included a physician, Kent Brantly, and a missionary, Nancy Writebol, the two Americans now back in the United States being treated themselves for Ebola.

As I entered the compound I saw men in white protective suits. One, who was to walk me through the burial ritual, whispered that he and his team were about to bring the body out. But a mourner told him, “My uncle did not have Ebola; he died from high blood pressure.” Confusion reigned until Dr. Brantly emerged and made it clear that the corpse being readied was not the Ebola victim’s. So the workers took off their protective suits, and the head of the burial team said it was too late to inter the Ebola victim: Neighbors of the burial site were chasing them away, fearing that the participants were contaminated.

The next day, I went back. It was a sad sight. Only three male relatives had come to mourn the victim, a man in his 20s. White-clad men brought out his body, zipped in a bag on a stretcher that they placed on the ground. An ambulance driver sprayed the bag, which another man in white then unzipped to let the relatives glimpse the corpse; one took a picture of it.

I was scared, so I filmed the burial from afar. FrontPageAfrica published my reporting and the images I took on our website and social media platforms.

Those were, I believe, the first images of the Ebola outbreak to circulate in Liberia, and the impact was huge; at last, people began to believe that this disease was real.

Officials say the outbreak seems to have spread to Liberia five months ago, when a woman from the rural north who had treated a sick relative traveled to Monrovia, where she vomited in a taxi and later died. The driver helped clean her up, coming into contact with the virus. The victim had also come into contact with her husband, her 2-year-old child, a motorcycle rider and others.

The next thing we knew, the number of cases, and of deaths, was swelling. They are now in the hundreds. But the government strictly warned journalists not to go near an Ebola case. “I beg you,” the health minister, Walter Gwenigale, warned us at a news conference, “don’t get contaminated by trying to do investigative reporting by going near people that may be sick. We will give you the information.”

But the effect was to quarantine information about the disease, rather than spread information about how people could protect themselves. For an early hint, we journalists had to turn to the United States Embassy’s April 4 advisory to American citizens, warning against contact with blood, body fluids or contaminated items.

In May, the rate of infection slackened but then rose again, prompting calls to close the borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone. The authorities refused, saying the economy would suffer. The craziest justification I heard was that the price of pepper would go up.

Ignorance ruled. Conspiracy theories sprouted that the government was faking the outbreak to draw foreign aid. Some Liberians, paralyzed by terror of the disease, stayed home rather than go to the hospital. Some kept to the ritual of bathing their dead; pastors laid hands on the sick. This only led to more deaths.

Then, on July 25, came news of the death, in Nigeria, of a Liberian-American government consultant who had traveled while showing symptoms of the disease. At last, I saw some seriousness from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf about enforcing measures to contain the outbreak; she declared that the consultant, Patrick Sawyer, had knowingly put other countries at risk. She declared a national emergency, ordered schools closed and then raised the level of emergency to the equivalent of a state of war.

Such measures are welcome, but far too late. The Peace Corps[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/peace_corps/index.html?inline=nyt-org] is leaving Liberia. Airlines are cutting back service. We see no end to the outbreak.

Meanwhile, we watch the case of the two American aid workers, who have been flown out for intensive treatment. If it works, we can only hope the West will quickly share its methods with us in Africa, where the risk to the world is greatest.

Second Experimental Drug Allowed for Treating Ebola

The Food and Drug Administration[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/food_and_drug_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] helped clear the way on Thursday for a second experimental drug to be used to treat people in Africa stricken with the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus.

The drug, being developed by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals of British Columbia, was in the initial phase of human testing, which is on healthy volunteers, when the F.D.A. last month halted the trial because side effects were observed.

Tekmira announced[http://investor.tekmirapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=865208] that the F.D.A., while still saying the drug, called TKM-Ebola, should not be given to healthy volunteers, was now allowing its use to treat patients actually infected with the virus.

“We have been closely watching the Ebola virus outbreak and its consequences, and we are willing to assist with any responsible use of TKM-Ebola,” Mark Murray, the chief executive of Tekmira, said in a statement. “The foresight shown by the F.D.A. removes one potential roadblock to doing so.”

He said the company was evaluating options for use of the drug, which is being developed under a $140 million contract from the Defense Department.

The drug works by shutting off genes of the virus using a technique called RNA interference. Earlier this week there were reports that a different experimental medicine, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, appeared to be helping two American aid workers who had been stricken by the disease. Mapp and federal agencies are looking to provide that drug, called ZMapp, to sick people in Africa.

But supplies of both ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are limited. And there are various other obstacles, such as regulatory ones, to be surmounted before the drugs can be used in Africa.

U.S. and Global Efforts to Contain Ebola Draw Criticism at Congressional Hearing
By ANDREW SIDDONS

WASHINGTON — Members of Congress questioned Thursday whether the American response to the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak in West Africa had been effective, and a spokesman for a group battling the virus went further, saying no country had done enough.

“The international response to the disease has been a failure,” said the spokesman, Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan’s Purse. The group employed the American doctor, Ken Brantly, and nurse, Nancy Writebol, who contracted the disease and were brought back to the United States for treatment.

It was only after they were confirmed to have Ebola on July 26 “that the world sat up and paid attention,” Mr. Isaacs said during a hearing of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.

The criticism came as African leaders held their final sessions of a summit meeting here that was intended to focus on economic development, but was shadowed by the Ebola crisis. Only two meetings — both on Monday — were scheduled to address the outbreak, even as the death toll mounted. Almost 1,000 people have died of Ebola since March.

Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that it was a missed opportunity.

“It seemed to me a huge loss to have so many of the key players of the African continent — all of the heads of states, all of the finance and trade ministers, all in Washington, all available for a conversation — and there was no specific, concerted effort to ask the ‘what if’ question and reach some kind of basic agreement,” she said.

At the subcommittee hearing, Representative Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia, expressed concern that the Obama administration had taken too long to respond to the outbreak. He also said that the response by the United States and nongovernmental agencies was uncoordinated and rudderless.

“Despite early warnings from NGOs working on the ground, there was little action to get out in front of this problem, and now we are seeing the consequences,” said Mr. Wolf, a member of the subcommittee, which deals with United States policy in Africa.

The American effort has been led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]; its director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, defended his agency’s handling of the outbreak during questioning by the lawmakers.

He said it was possible to stop the outbreak by meticulously isolating patients and identifying who had come into contact with them. Dr. Frieden said his agency would have 50 staff members on the ground in West Africa in the next week or so.

“It won’t be quick, and it won’t be easy,” he said. “When we finish this response, we’re determined to not only stop the outbreak, but leave behind strong systems that will be better at finding the disease and other threats, at stopping it before it spreads, of preventing it in the first place.”

But Mr. Isaacs said that the response had been too little and too late in the three countries that have been hit the worst — Guinea, Liberia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/liberia/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].

“You have three poor countries that clearly don’t have the capacity to contain it,” Mr. Isaacs said. “And is the world willing to allow the public health of the world to be in their hands to contain the disease?”

The leaders of Liberia and Sierra Leone canceled their summit meeting trips to focus on the epidemic. Guinea’s president, Alpha Condé, was in Washington this week, and in one of the Monday meetings, he described the situation as serious, said a health policy expert who was there.

But the expert, J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Condé had tried to convey that “it’s not really as catastrophic as people are painting it.” No one was available at the Guinea Embassy to discuss Mr. Condé’s remarks.

In the second Ebola-related meeting at the summit, Mr. Condé and Dr. Frieden met with other top American health officials, including Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, and officials from Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The meeting did not result in any specific commitments from the administration, but Ms. Burwell and Dr. Frieden “reiterated U.S. engagement and support for efforts to control the outbreak and address the challenge,” according to a State Department official.

“We didn’t go to that meeting cap in hand, going to give a shopping list of what we want,” Bockari Kortu Stevens, Sierra Leone’s ambassador to the United States, said in an interview.

Liberia’s foreign minister, Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan, said the infection rate would rise for the next few weeks before Liberia could finally stop the outbreak from spreading.

“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” he said.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Thursday:

• U.S. airdrops in Iraq.

American military aircraft have delivered food and water to tens of thousands of Iraqis trapped on a barren mountain range after they fled militants.

In a speech from the White House, President Obama said he approved[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/obama-weighs-military-strikes-to-aid-trapped-iraqis-officials-say.html] “targeted” use of airstrikes against the militants.

• A “public health emergency.”

That’s today’s declaration[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/europe/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html] from the World Health Organization regarding the Ebola virus, which has killed 932 people in West Africa since March.

The United States will send[http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2014/08/07/sending-dozens-disease-specialists-combat-ebola-west-africa/znph9LL4l0VVYUzxw7sJfJ/story.html] more than 50 specialists to the region over the next week to help combat the outbreak, which officials say will take many months to contain.

• Back to war in Gaza.

Within minutes of the end of a three-day cease-fire this morning, militants fired rockets into southern Israel[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip-conflict.html]. The Israeli military says it has responded with strikes “across Gaza[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html].”

Peace negotiations are continuing in Cairo at this hour, and one proposal, from the European Union, calls for a new seaport in Gaza with international inspectors to ensure weapons aren’t smuggled in.

• Looking to November.

With about 50 percent of the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee defeated[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/tennessee-elections.html] a Tea Party-backed challenger last night.

Voters there also turned down an aggressive bid by conservatives and business interests to oust three members of the State Supreme Court.

In Montana, Senator John Walsh is ending his campaign[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/politics/john-walsh-drops-campaign-under-pressure-from-democrats.html] after a plagiarism charge so that a new Democratic nominee can be named.

• The defense’s turn.

The chief defense lawyer for the South African track star Oscar Pistorius is delivering[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28684915] his final arguments in the murder trial and focusing on allegations that the police mishandled evidence.

• Vacation beckons.

President Obama has separate meetings today with the labor and commerce secretaries.

Then, the Obamas are scheduled to arrive in Martha’s Vineyard on Saturday for a two-week stay at a giant waterside estate[http://www.mvtimes.com/2014/07/09/president-obama-will-return-chilmark/].

He’ll return to Washington for two days[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/08/us/politics/ap-us-obama-vacation.html] during the break.

• Hawaii prepares.

Iselle is bringing rain and wind to the islands today after being downgraded to tropical storm from hurricane. But another hurricane, Julio, just upgraded to Category 3, is close behind.

• A firsthand look.

Robert McDonald, who was confirmed by the Senate last week as secretary of veterans affairs, is in Phoenix today[http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/investigations/2014/08/06/va-secretary-robert-mcdonald-coming-phoenix/13682561/] for his first visit to a veterans medical center since taking the post.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are falling moderately, depressed by events in Iraq.

European shares are down about 1 percent, and Asian stocks closed mostly lower, with Tokyo down 3 percent.

• A GlaxoSmithKline contractor, a British citizen, pleaded guilty in a Chinese court today to illegally obtaining private records on Chinese citizens, including confidential government-issued identity documents.

China has targeted Western companies in several fraud and antitrust cases in recent months.

• The Malaysian government is buying out[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/business/international/malaysia-airlines-to-be-taken-over-by-government.html] 31 percent of its tragedy-struck flag carrier, Malaysia Airlines, making it entirely state owned.

Even before this year’s disappearance of one jetliner and the downing of another, the airline had been consistently losing money.

NOTEWORTHY

• Laughing across America.

Oddball Fest[http://www.oddballfest.com/], a movable feast of comedy presented by the comedy website Funny or Die, starts today in Tampa, Fla., and will make stops in about 20 cities over the next several weeks.

Performers include Louis C. K., Sarah Silverman, Aziz Ansari and Amy Schumer.

• Scoring a place in hoops history.

A new class of inductees[http://www.hoophall.com/news/2014/8/4/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-2014-ens.html] will join the ranks of Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.

The honorees include the players Alonzo Mourning and Mitch Richmond, the coaches Gary Williams and Nolan Richardson, and David Stern, who ended his 30-year tenure as N.B.A. commissioner early this year.

• Cowabunga! (Er, maybe not.)

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the classic cartoon heroes of the millennial generation’s childhood, return to theaters today in a new movie. But don’t get too excited.

“The four unruly sewer-dwelling title characters look streamlined but no longer sweet in their goofy freakishness as they battle Shredder and his minions in a New York City that’s as plain as the movie,” writes our critic Nicolas Rapold[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/movies/movie-review-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles.html].

• Folk heroes of another time.

Hoboes are making their way to northern Iowa for their annual “convention,” a fair, reunion and memorial that has been held in Britt since 1900 to name a national hobo king and queen.

Frog and Bookworm Bonnie hold last year’s titles. Neither tramps (who travel but don’t work) nor bums (who neither travel nor work), hoboes still ride the rails when they can.

BACK STORY

One of the most visible players on the ground in Gaza is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, known as UNRWA[http://www.unrwa.org/].

Its spokesman, Christopher Gunness, recently broke down on live TV in a video that went viral[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/31/un-spokesman-chris-gunness-cries-gaza], mourning the deaths of children in his agency’s shelters, six of which have been struck[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/middleeast/international-scrutiny-after-israeli-barrage-strike-in-jabaliya-where-united-nations-school-shelters-palestinians-in-gaza.html]. (Eleven of his colleagues have also been killed[http://www.democracynow.org/2014/8/4/disgraceful_criminal_act_israel_condemned_as].)

UNRWA is viewed by some Israelis as an agent of the Palestinians[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/middleeast/tensions-escalate-between-israel-and-united-nations-in-gaza-strip.html], but the agency insists that it is only serving the mandate it was given decades ago — caring for and protecting the displaced in Gaza after Israel was established in 1948.

In 1950, there were 750,000 refugees. Today, the number is about five million[http://www.irinnews.org/report/89571/middle-east-palestinian-refugee-numbers-whereabouts] and includes their children and grandchildren in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank.

The agency, which has a deficit of nearly $70 million in 2014, is funded by voluntary contributions from U.N. members and partners. The United States, the biggest single donor, has given $250 million this year[http://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/us-reaffirms-its-support-unrwa].

Victoria Shannon, Rick Rojas and Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• No coalition of the willing.

The Sunni militant group known as ISIS has captured major Iraqi cities, sent vaunted Kurdish fighters into retreat and created a humanitarian crisis that threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

But the United States is largely going it alone[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/middleeast/iraq.html] in responding, with only limited aid from the British and the Turks.

“Europeans are worried about their own Muslims becoming radicalized,” says Steven Erlanger, our London bureau chief.

And, he says, “they have long ago stopped pretending that the Middle East is anything but an American sphere.”

Iraq, for the Europeans, is a “particularly American mess,” Mr. Erlanger says.

“There is a wide consensus that the American/British war in Iraq that overthrew Saddam Hussein was wrong in its premise,” Mr. Erlanger says. “So why should others get involved now?”

• A question of motive.

The militants in Iraq say they are creating a caliphate[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/syria-iraq-isis-rogue-state-along-two-rivers.html], an Islamic state. But their brutality also seems aimed at trying to provoke a wider war.

The two things aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive, says Ben Hubbard, our Middle East correspondent.

“They were the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,” he says. “Now they’ve dropped ‘Iraq and Syria.’ Does that mean they intend to take over Lebanon? Take over Palestine?”

Some maps drawn by the militants show them with territories as expansive as the Ottoman Empire, Mr. Hubbard says.

It’s unclear whether they have a grand strategy, or will just keep taking advantage of the opportunities on the ground.

“My guess,” he says, “is they will go as far as they can until they get stopped.”

• Ebola, up close.

We asked our videographer Ben C. Solomon what it’s like to witness West Africa’s Ebola epidemic, seeing its toll firsthand — and trying to stay safe.

“We’re walking past wards full of sick people,” he says. “The sickness is all around us. But you just don’t know where the danger lies.”

He is traveling with our West Africa correspondent, Adam Nossiter, and the photographer Tommy Trenchard.

Mr. Solomon says showing the power of this “terrible, deadly, absolutely devastating disease” warrants the risk of getting so close.

“I know a lot of people are looking at the statistics, and wondering how it will affect us back home,” he tells us.

But an outbreak in America would be contained quickly, he says. It’s another matter in Sierre Leone, which suffers from poverty, ignorance and limited resources.

"Doctors Without Borders and people with the World Health Organization are doing amazing work, but they’re fighting this battle on their own.”

• Taking it to the public.

“Amazon seemed to believe that if it cut off book sales, the authors would blame their publishers.”

“This was a miscalculation. They are blaming Amazon.”

That’s David Streitfeld, our reporter covering the war over the price of e-books.

Amazon blocked some publishers from its online sales, pressuring them to agree to cut their prices.

Now, in a return salvo, nearly 1,000 authors are taking out a $104,000 newspaper ad[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html] to demand that Amazon stop using writers as hostages.

“The writers are forcing Amazon onto the defensive,” Mr. Streitfeld says. “This is not a good place for a consumer company to be.”

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed strongly up. The S.&P. 500 gained 1.2 percent.

TONIGHT

• It has Oprah’s stamp of approval.

But our critic A.O. Scott isn’t as keen on “The Hundred-Foot Journey,” produced by Ms. Winfrey and Steven Spielberg.

The film, opening today, “is not in love with food; it is commercially invested in the idea that food is something people think they love,” Mr. Scott writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/movies/in-the-hundred-foot-journey-kitchen-wars-break-out.html].

Here’s what else is coming to theaters[http://www.nytimes.com/movies/intheaters.html] today.

• Primitive care.

The Oscar and Emmy winner Steven Soderbergh directs “The Knick[http://www.cinemax.com/the-knick/],” a series set at the Knickerbocker Hospital in New York City around 1900, where the staff, including a surgeon played by Clive Owen, struggle to save lives by gaslight.

Our critic Alessandra Stanleycalls it[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/arts/television/the-knick-a-cinemax-medical-drama-set-in-1900.html] “another ambitious examination of an important but often overlooked epoch in history” (10 p.m. Eastern, Cinemax).

• “Garbage is my passion.”

That’s a committed employee of TerraCycle[http://www.terracycle.com/en-US], a New Jersey recycling company that is home to the new reality series “Human Resources[http://www.pivot.tv/shows/human-resources].”

“Whether TerraCycle’s activities will save the planet is open to debate,” writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/arts/television/human-resources-on-pivot-gives-hope-to-the-working-young.html] our critic Neil Genzlinger, “but maybe this show will help turn around a moribund segment of the TV spectrum” (10 p.m. Eastern, Pivot).

• For political junkies.

Forty years after President Richard M. Nixon announced his resignation, Dick Cavett looks back at Watergate[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/dick-cavetts-watergate-preview/1848/] through clips of interviews with central figures from his old talk show (PBS, check local listings).

• The lives of lesbians.

From the producer of “The L Word” comes the new documentary “L Word Mississippi: Hate the Sin[http://www.sho.com/sho/reality-docs/titles/3403140/l-word-mississippi-hate-the-sin#/index],” set in the Deep South.

“Over the course of 90 minutes, preachers, parents, and random guys on the street tell these women they’re deranged, depraved, and Hell-bound,” writes June Thomas in Slate[http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/08/l_word_mississippi_hate_the_sin_on_showtime_reviewed.html] (9 p.m. Eastern, Showtime).

• If you’re staying up...

“The Tonight Show”: Jeff Bridges, co-star of “The Giver[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435651/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3],” in theaters next Friday (Aug. 15); Ali Larter, of TNT’s “Legends[http://www.tntdrama.com/shows/legends.html],” which begins next week; and the comedian Andy Woodhull[http://andywoodhull.com/] (11:35 p.m. Eastern, NBC).

THIS WEEKEND

Saturday

• The Obamas are to arrive in Martha’s Vineyard today for a two-week stay at a giant waterside estate[http://www.mvtimes.com/2014/07/09/president-obama-will-return-chilmark/]. Unusually, the president is scheduled to return to Washington for two days[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/08/us/politics/ap-us-obama-vacation.html] during the break.

• Voters will have to brave hurricane wind and rain to go to the polls [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/08/07/hurricanes-roil-historic-hawaii-primary-and-could-boost-challengers/] in Hawaii, where the governor and a senator are in danger of losing in Democratic primaries.

• The $45 million Aspen Art Museum opens to the public.

• It’s the U.S. Air Guitar Championships[http://usairguitar.com/] in Kansas City, Mo. The winner represents the red, white and blue at the Air Guitar World Championships in Finland later this month.

Times Insider
The Dangers of Reporting on Ebola

Adam Nossiter[http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/04/01/dangerous-roads-constant-crises-adam-nossiter-on-central-africa/] is the West and Central Africa bureau chief. He has been covering the Ebola outbreak in West Africa[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A6%22%7D] since the spring, when it quickly began to spread from areas in Guinea to Sierra Leone and Liberia. We asked him how close a reporter can get while reporting the story of this highly infectious disease.

“Stand back, two meters!” The Doctors Without Borders physician was firm. No risks with the Ebola patients.

I was at the hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone, one of the centers of the outbreak, where a survivor had come to greet his mother, a patient. I was with the survivor; his mother and the other Ebola patients were separated from us by a three-foot-high white plastic barrier, a few yards away. We could easily hear them and see them, but it would not have been wise to come within breathing distance of her. Any minute drop of saliva could be infectious. The doctor, off duty, was on my side of the barrier; I could see on the other side her space-suited colleagues, dealing with the Ebola patients who, though anxious-looking, were in early stages and thus still on their feet.

In covering Ebola, in Sierra Leone and in Guinea, I listen to the doctors from Doctors Without Borders (more commonly known as M.S.F. on this side of the Atlantic, for Médecins Sans Frontières). They are rigorous professionals. And I follow common sense. Don’t touch anybody who has been in contact with Ebola patients. Don’t get close to them. Don’t shake hands in the Ebola zone. Wash hands and boot soles in bleach solution, often. At the hospital in Kenema, one of the M.S.F. doctors told me: “Don’t touch the walls! Totally infected!” I walked through the corridors carefully.

If I have to be in a crowd, I try to keep some space between myself and others. Not easy in Africa. Recently, in a small village in Guinea where there had been Ebola victims, I was suddenly in a crowd; a jostling, energetic African village crowd. I kept taking notes. Too late to get edgy.

Ebola though, as a story, is a lot less menacing than covering the Islamist terror group Boko Haram[http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/africa/100000002870853/boko-haram-kidnapping-tactics-explained.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A6%22%7D], which I do, pretty often. With Ebola, you would have a fighting chance, at least.

A Witness to Ebola’s Discovery

It was October 1976 in Atlanta, and a disease that no one had ever seen was coming into focus. Word came from an amateur radio network in Africa that the mystery illness had killed hundreds of people in just over a month. The chief of the viral pathology branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was standing over an electron microscope. Dr. Frederick Murphy[http://www.utmb.edu/pathology/faculty/bios/Murphy.asp] was the first to see this unknown killer up close.

The virus would eventually be named after a river in then Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Dr. Murphy recalled his first encounter with Ebola, why it scared him and what might be done to control the current outbreak in West Africa[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html]. Here is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.

Q: What was your first thought when the Ebola virus came into focus on Oct. 13, 1976?

A. That day remains very vivid in my memory. It raised the hair on the back of my neck, the first image. I was the only one left at the C.D.C. who had worked with the Marburg virus[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/marburg/en/] in 1967. And the two viruses look alike. I was pretty sure it was Marburg, which was bad enough, but by the end of the day, we knew it was different.

Q. Talk a little about Marburg and why that was so scary.

A. In 1967, Marburg virus appeared in Europe in several places that were processing monkey kidneys to make cell culture for things like the polio vaccine. The people started getting sick. Eventually seven people died. That was really the first high containment work we ever did at the C.D.C. We received the virus immediately from Germany and from Britain and went to work on it just to get the basics, so that the C.D.C. would be ready for whatever might happen.

It was another league of threat. This virus was incredibly lethal in monkeys. The pathology is dramatic. The shape of the virus is dramatic. There were so different — Ebola and Marburg — from all the little round viruses that people would otherwise think about. It really got our attention.

Q. Why is shape so important?

A. They are actual filaments, just a flexible rod, and according to how they lay down, the shape will look different. If you look across the electron microscopic field, you see them in all different forms. I think there is something in that shape that is emotional or it strikes something fundamental in the way we think — not that all the other viruses are alike. The variety of shapes is quite amazing. But this was outside the frame of reference, it really just grabs you.

Q. What did the first image of Ebola do to motivate the response to the outbreak?

A. To get back to Africa took more than a week of work. In the days from the time the box arrived from being shipped from Belgium to Atlanta, it was incredibly dramatic. The box was opened by my colleague Patricia Webb, and all of the vials were broken. Anyone else would have brought the box to the autoclave [for sterilization]. She put on a gown and mask and gloves and squeezed a bit of fluid out of the cotton batting, and put it into a cell culture with a lot of extra antibiotics to kill any bacteria that were in there. Within two days, the cells started to look sick. And she gave me a few drops of the cell culture, and I prepared that for the electron microscope.

In those days, you had to be able to grow the virus. There was no genetic identification possible. So it had to go into cell culture and laboratory animals to identify if a virus was even there. What Patricia Webb did was the basis for everything else that followed.

In those days, getting another box shipped was a big deal. Communication was very bad. There were no cell phones. Communication between people who were in Yambuku[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1978/Vol56-No2/bulletin_1978_56%282%29_271-293.pdf] [at the heart of the outbreak] in Zaire was by ham radio[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_operator] network with amateur ham radio operators sending the signals on through several intermediate points to get the signal out of Africa. They were ham radio networks set in place to help missionary hospitals. Sounds like 100 years ago, doesn’t it?

Q. You looked at the actual damage that the virus does. How does it affect the body?

A. First of all, the virus grows very quickly. There may be a weeklong period incubation period after infection. But then the course of the clinical infection is really dramatic. Just over a matter of days people get so very very sick. The pathologic side is that several organs are just destroyed by the virus, especially the liver. And the amount of virus present in the damaged liver is overwhelming. It’s maybe the largest concentration of virus I’ve ever seen in one place.

Q. Do we have any idea of how it gets there and how it proliferates?

A. It replicates in lymphoid tissues. It’s not just limited to the liver. It spreads through the body through the blood and causes damage in many places. There’s often a rash, and respiratory symptoms. There’s just so much damage occurring so quickly that it makes sense that this virus is so lethal.

Q. That’s damage in humans and in some animals including monkeys and other laboratory animals, is that right?

A. Right. And yet, our present thinking is that the natural reservoir of Marburg and Ebola viruses are fruit bats in which the infection is silent.

Q. Is there something about the virus itself that defies our scientific attempts to classify, treat and eradicate it?

A. For these kinds of viruses, we don’t even talk about eradication. If a virus is living in fruit bats in Africa, there are just no ideas about how you would even eradicate it. Prevention has to start at the place where humans get infected. How we are going to protect people across Africa is still a good question. We know enough about the natural history of the virus in nature. It pops up, goes away, comes back. But it comes back in a different place. It comes back as a different genetic strain. There’s still a lot of mystery.

Q. Do you think the pace of scientific understanding increases during outbreaks like the one we are experiencing in West Africa right now?

A. As has happened over the years with Ebola outbreaks, scientists are sent to outbreak hot spots. But the first thing that has to happen is that the scientists have to take care of the sick people. Everybody chips in to help save lives and make patients more comfortable and to prevent more transmission. So the research comes way down the list. Maybe that’s why progress has been slow.

Q. If you were Ebola, what would you think of your prospects right now?

A. The way we humans have dealt with the infectious disease boils down to only a few arrows in our quiver. We have vaccines. If the virus is transmitted by mosquitos, we can try to control them. In the old days, we had quarantine, which has become pretty passé. And we have few drugs. But against the viruses there are very few.

The real question would be, If we had a vaccine, how would we use it across Africa? Who is going to pay for it? We’re now seeing how hard it is to eradicate polio[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/world-health-organization-polio-health-emergency.html]. We’re down to the last few places in the world where the polio virus is still present. And we have a very good vaccine. But it’s a complicated world out there. With polio, it’s expecting the end game, and with other diseases, you don’t even get started. There are still plenty of important diseases where we don’t have a vaccine. It’s not just Ebola.

Q. How do we beat back the current outbreak?

A. It’s still the standout virus. If you’re going into the laboratory to work on the short list of the viruses that require the maximum containment — the labs with the space suits — you’re still most focused when you’re working with Ebola. It’s the one where you would least want to stick yourself with a needle. It’s the first virus I think about when I think about biocontainment in a lab.

And if you’re going to work in the field on the reservoir animals in Africa, you have to have all of the same kinds of biocontainment to protect yourself there. That’s what makes everything so expensive and complicated.

The third place where you need containment is in the hospitals and clinics in Africa right now. You realize that many of the people who have been infected and have died are medical care personnel. It’s a special kind of biosafety that needs to be improved.

Q. Do you think that level of safety is even possible in West Africa right now?

A. The educational side of it is huge. And it’s more than just teaching people how to be careful. You have to provide all the equipment for people who have been trained to protect themselves. It’s these practical, on the ground, public health actions that limit transmission and then stop transmission. And that all starts with educating people.

‘Don’t Touch the Walls’: Ebola Fears Infect an African Hospital

KENEMA, Sierra Leone — So many patients, nurses and health workers have died in the government hospital that many people in this city, a center of the world’s worst Ebola epidemic, see it as a death trap.

Now, the wards are empty in the principal institution fighting the disease. Ebola stalks the city, claiming lives every day, but patients have fled the hospital’s long, narrow buildings, which sit silent and echoing in the fading light. Few people are taking any chances by coming here.

“Don’t touch the walls!” a Western medical technician yelled out. “Totally infected.”

Some Ebola patients still die at the hospital, perhaps four per day, in the tentlike temporary isolation ward at the back of the muddy grounds. But just as many, if not more, are dying in the city and neighboring villages, greatly increasing the risk of spreading the disease and undermining international efforts to halt the epidemic.

“People don’t die here now,” said the deputy chief of the hospital’s burying team, Albert J. Mattia, exasperated after a long day of Ebola burials. “They are dying in the community, five, six a day.” Mr. Mattia was particularly disturbed that many of the bodies his team were putting in the ground had come from outside the hospital, thwarting attempts to isolate patients and prevent them from passing the disease to others.

“It’s very, very dangerous, very hazardous; it is contributing to the Ebola dead,” he said as his two deputies nodded glumly in agreement. “You go to the wards, there are no patients.”

Containing the virus in Kenema — one of the nation’s largest cities and a gateway to an area of the country where the disease is rampant — is critical to taming the epidemic’s deadly advance across parts of West Africa. More than 930 people, including over 280 here in Sierra Leone, have died since the outbreak was first identified across the border in Guinea in March.

Since then, Sierra Leone has been hit with more cases of the disease than any other nation — 691out of 1,711 at last count[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_06_ebola/en/] — and the hospital in Kenema quickly became a focal point in the effort to grapple with the epidemic when the government set up a treatment center here for cases in the region.

International health officials have concentrated intensively on the hospital in the last several days, training health care workers, preparing a more secure isolation ward, establishing the rigorous separation of zones — low risk, high risk — that characterizes the tightly sealed Doctors Without Borders Ebola facilities elsewhere in stricken West Africa.

But it is a tough struggle, and the recent history of the hospital looms. More than 20 health care workers at the hospital have died trying to battle the disease over the last several months, including nurses, support staff and the country’s leading doctor.

“There’s a perception in the population that it is a dangerous place,” said Philippe Barboza, an epidemiologist who heads the World Health Organization team here. " ‘The farther one is from the hospital, the better,’ ” said Mr. Barboza, summing up the widely held sentiment. “Even to have a meeting here is difficult.”

Elsewhere in the region, the battle against the disease is equally difficult. Dr. Fazlul Haque, the deputy representative of Unicef in Liberia, said health workers were struggling to keep up with the rapidly growing number of cases. Some hospitals are closed, he said, in part because health workers are afraid of getting sick — 63 health workers in Liberia have been infected so far, he said, with more than 30 deaths.

In the past week alone, about six medical staff members at a Catholic hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, and 23 health workers in Bong County were infected, he said.

Liberia’s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, declared a state of emergency this week, calling it necessary “for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people.” The government has already quarantined some communities, including parts of western Liberia to stop the spread of the virus from Sierra Leone.

Dead bodies have been appearing on the streets and in houses throughout Monrovia, with people staging roadblocks to ensure that health workers remove them. But with hospitals closed in the capital, it was unclear how many of the victims had died of Ebola, or from other causes. A health worker said his burial team, one of 12, picked up seven bodies in Monrovia and surrounding areas on Thursday alone.

“Only two of the bodies were in houses, and the others were on the street,” the health worker said.

Here in Kenema, the hospital is fearsome even for the some of the newly arrived international workers who are hoping to turn it around.

“It’s pretty scary,” said Alexis Moens, a Doctors Without Borders logistician who was helping to set up the new, more secure isolation ward for Ebola patients.

“This is a dangerous place,” said Mr. Moens, adding that he washed his hands 50 times a day.

“There’s no system; there’s no isolation,” he said. “You make mistakes here, you get infected.”

On the streets of Kenema, a quiet provincial town at the foot of dark green hills, bisected by a main street of diamond merchants, there is distinct wariness about the hospital in the middle of town.

“That is where there is the most Ebola,” said Ibrahim Jalloh, 23. “Hardly any patients survive.”

He was playing a board game with friends on one of the town’s rutted dirt roads, before the 7 p.m. curfew imposed to discourage public gatherings that might contribute to the spread of the epidemic.

“We fear it because there is no medication there,” Mr. Jalloh added. Word that outsiders had come in to turn the hospital around was softening reservations, but they were still palpable.

“People are afraid of the hospital because you don’t know if you will meet up with a nurse who has it,” said Ibrahim Bah, 56.

Because there is resistance to using the hospital, many of the patients who do come here wait until they are very sick and already highly contagious.

“We are still getting people in very advanced stages,” said Mr. Barboza of the W.H.O.

On Thursday morning, a corpse was brought out from the hospital’s front wing — Mohamed Boekarie, 36, who had been brought to the hospital Wednesday night from his village to die. He was wrapped in a black plastic body bag, carried on a stretcher by two of Mr. Mattia’s men, in full protective gear. They sprayed the bag with disinfectant as they carried it through the hospital.

The surviving hospital workers feel the stigma of the hospital acutely.

“Unfortunately, people are not coming, because they are afraid,” said Halimatu Vangahun, the head matron at the hospital and a survivor of the deadly wave that decimated her nursing staff. She knew, all throughout the preceding months, that one of her nurses had died whenever a crowd gathered around her office in the mornings.

At the edge of the tented isolation ward, relatives come to visit Ebola patients over a white plastic fence with a six-and-a-half-foot buffer. Erison Moussa Touray, 22, tossed a bag of clothes over the fence to his older sister, Aminata Saidu. He is an Ebola survivor; she is a patient, along with their mother, Bandu Touray. The two patients looked anxious, but they were at least able to greet him.

“I hope for my mother,” said Mr. Touray, explaining that he had lost 16 family members to Ebola. “She’s the only one I have left.”

“Sometimes I sit down, and I don’t know what will make me to courage,” he said in the English patois common here. “My father, my brothers, all have passed away.”

He shouted encouragements to his mother and sister across the fence: Eat more, drink more. He asked them what sort of food they wanted: fufu, a staple made from starchy foods, like plantain or cassava.

“From this illness, I am not comedy anymore,” said Mr. Touray, a clerk for the local magistrate’s court. “I am tragedy. Very tragedy.”

In Ebola Outbreak, Who Should Get Experimental Drug?

Some have said it is wrong that with hundreds of Africans dying from the outbreak of Ebola, extremely scarce supplies of an experimental drug went to two white American aid workers.

But what if the first doses of the drug — which had never been used in people and had not even finished the typical animal safety testing — had been given to African patients instead?

“It would have been the front-page screaming headline: Africans used as guinea pigs for American drug company’s medicine,” said Dr. Salim S. Abdool Karim, director of Caprisa, an AIDS research center in South Africa.

A history of controversy about drug testing in Africa is just one of the complexities facing public health authorities as they wrestle with whether and how to bring that drug and possibly other experimental ones to the countries afflicted with Ebola. Who should get such a scarce supply of medicine? Health workers? Children? The newly infected who are not yet as sick?

The World Health Organization is convening a meeting of ethicists early next week to discuss this sensitive and difficult dilemma. The United States government is also forming a group to consider the same issues, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

At least two of the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak, Liberia and Nigeria, have asked for the drug, according to a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The debate about who should get the drug, which is called ZMapp, may be mainly academic in the short term, because there is virtually no supply left, Dr. Fauci said. By the time somewhat more ample but still modest supplies are available in a few months, the epidemic may have run its course.

Other experimental medicines might be available, but also probably in small amounts, like one from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals that has so far been tested only in healthy volunteers. Tekmira said Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration had determined the drug was safe enough to be tried in infected patients.

ZMapp is reported to have helped the two aid workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were initially treated in Liberia and are now at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. But experts say it is too soon to conclude it is truly effective.

ZMapp is being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, a nine-person company in San Diego that was still doing animal studies with an eye toward beginning human safety testing next year.

According to federal officials, ZMapp was given to the two Americans because Samaritan’s Purse, the aid organization that employed Dr. Brantly, found out about it and asked for it, not because of any favoritism to Americans.

Some bioethicists said they did not find it troublesome that the first doses went to to health workers, be they American or African.

Health workers, they said, can best understand the risks in taking a drug not yet tested in people and give informed consent. Offering health workers priority is a way to encourage them to undertake the grave dangers of caring for people with such a deadly, contagious disease. And if nurses and doctors get better, they might go back to caring for other patients, in effect multiplying the benefit of the drug.

“I think there are very special commitments that we must make ethically to the health care providers that are willing to go in and serve,” said Nancy Kass, a professor of bioethics and public health at Johns Hopkins University.

Supplies of ZMapp, which is made in tobacco plants, are being scaled up, but that is expected to take a few months.

Federal authorities say that the drug should not just be given to patients but should be connected with some sort of study to assess its safety and efficacy.

“You’ve got to balance the compassionate-use aspect with trying to figure out whether it works,” Dr. Fauci said.

Doing such a study in the midst of an outbreak could be difficult, especially in parts of Africa with limited medical infrastructure.

With enough drug for only a small percentage of infected people, who should get it?

Dr. Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, said priority should go to health care workers. Others say more recently infected patients would be more likely to be helped by the drug.

A senior Food and Drug Administration official said priority might go to those who have access to other supportive care because they are most likely to benefit. But that could mean that the limited supplies might go to relatively privileged Africans.

This, of course, assumes people will want the drug. That might not always be the case because of suspicions about health care in general and Western pharmaceutical companies in particular. Many patients stricken in the current outbreak are fleeing rather than going to clinics.

“There are just an awful lot of Africans who are afraid of the health care system right now,” said Dr. G. Kevin Donovan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at Georgetown University Medical Center.

Northern Nigeria has a history of resisting the campaign to eradicate polio, for example, with rumors circulating that vaccinations were a plot to sterilize Muslim women. At least nine polio immunization workers were shot to death there in February 2013.

Dr. Fauci said he had already heard from an aid worker who had just come back from the region of the Ebola outbreak that a Western drug marked as experimental “more likely will be met with resistance rather than welcoming.”

The aid group Doctors Without Borders has also expressed some caution. “As doctors, trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult choice since our first priority is to do no harm,” it said in a statement earlier this week.

There have been some controversies over testing of drugs in Africa and other developing regions, with critics saying that participants are exploited or not treated properly and that they help develop drugs that might not even be affordable in poor countries.

ZMapp would be provided free in studies, and it is too early to say how much it would cost if it ever gets to market.

Pfizer settled charges and lawsuits that accused it of improprieties in testing an experimental antibiotic during a 1996 meningitis outbreak in northern Nigeria. Eleven children in the trial died, five of them who received the Pfizer drug, called Trovan. Other children suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage.

Families accused the company of not getting proper clearance for the study, of failing to inform potential study participants that an approved drug was available and of using a too-low dose of a comparison drug to make Trovan look better. Pfizer denied any wrongdoing or liability and said that Trovan actually helped the patients and that the deaths and injuries were from meningitis, not the drug.

Dr. Caplan of NYU Langone said that in the end, experimental drugs against Ebola were likely to make little difference in the current outbreak and that resources would be better spent trying to stamp out the epidemic using quarantines and other public health measures.

“Morally, everyone is keenly interested in who should get the drug,” he said. But the most important moral question is, “What is the best thing to do to bring that outbreak to a close? And I don’t think it’s drugs.”

The uncontrolled spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa has laid bare how unprepared the United States and other advanced countries are to protect and treat hundreds if not thousands of Africans whose lives are threatened by an extremely dangerous virus for which there is no cure. The World Health Organization reported that by Aug. 6 Ebola had infected 1,779 people in four West African countries and killed 961 of them, and on Friday the organization declared the outbreak to be an international public health emergency. Sadly, the drugs that could potentially treat people already infected and the vaccines to protect healthy people from infection are all in the very earliest stages of testing. They may not be safe and effective, and even if they do pass muster in clinical trials, they cannot be produced in large quantities quickly enough to stem the widening epidemic anytime soon.

The uncertainties were highlighted by the special treatment given to an American doctor and an American aid worker who were infected while caring for patients in Liberia and treated there with a drug that has worked well in monkeys but never been tested in humans. They were flown back to Atlanta to receive the best care possible in an isolation ward at Emory University Hospital.

There were exuberant media reports that they had been saved by the drug and demands from Liberia that the drug be made available to African patients. Yet at this point no one knows whether the drug played any role in helping the two Americans, only that it didn’t kill them. The two may well have been recovering on their own, or been saved by the kind of supportive care that they will continue to receive at Emory.

In any case, very little of the drug is available, and the small company that makes it does not have the capacity to produce large quantities to treat large numbers of patients in the field. Another drug candidate is in clinical trials with a small number of patients, but the trials were recently suspended and then partially reinstated because of fears that it could harm the patients. Meanwhile, a clinical trial of the first potential vaccine is being expedited, but it will be months before its safety can be verified and the vaccine made available for humans.

Although some people argue that unproven drugs and vaccines should be offered to people apt to die from Ebola, it is important to remember that not everyone dies from the disease, many suspected cases turn out to be something else, and the treatment itself may harm the recipients.

There is no remedy on the near horizon. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sees it: ‘‘We do not know how to treat Ebola or vaccinate against it — and it will be a long time before we do.’’

Many drug companies have little interest in devising treatments or vaccines for Ebola because the potential for profit is small. Much of the research has been financed by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense and carried out by small start-ups. Some experts believe the federal government has not shown enough urgency to push these programs ahead, a contention that Congress ought to explore as more becomes known about this epidemic. Imagine if we had a vaccine that had already gone through early-stage clinical trials and could be used in further trials to see if it could work against a real-world epidemic.

Absent that, traditional public health measures, like finding and isolating patients who become sick, tracing their contacts and using stringent infection control procedures in hospitals, remain the best bet for containing the epidemic in West Africa. The C.D.C. has elevated its response to the highest possible level and is sending 50 health care professionals to the area, backed by hundreds more professionals in the United States. Sierra Leone, which has the highest number of cases, is planning to deploy hundreds of troops and police officers to enforce isolation measures that its residents have so far ignored, and Liberia, with the second largest number, has declared a 90-day state of emergency that allows it to suspend civil liberties and impose quarantines. Such public health measures should ultimately, although perhaps not quickly, bring the outbreaks under control.

The World Health Organization will convene a panel of medical ethicists to advise on whether untested medicines should be used in the outbreak and who should receive the very limited supplies that may be available. One priority should surely be the health care workers who tend to the sick.

W.H.O. declares health emergency; Agency says stopping Ebola outbreak requires ‘extraordinary’ response

Facing the worst known outbreak of the Ebola virus, with almost 1,000 fatalities in West Africa, the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency on Friday, demanding an ‘‘extraordinary’’ response — only the third such declaration of its kind since regulations permitting such alarms were adopted in 2007.

The organization stopped short of saying there should be general international travel or trade bans, but acknowledged that the outbreak, already in its sixth month, was far from being contained.

One major international medical organization, Doctors Without Borders, responded to the statement with a renewed call for a ‘‘massive deployment’’ of health specialists to the stricken countries. ‘‘Lives are being lost because the response is too slow,’’ it said.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the W.H.O.’s director general, told a news conference at the body’s Geneva headquarters: ‘‘This is the largest, most severe, most complex outbreak in the nearly four-decade history of the disease.’’

‘‘I am declaring the current outbreak of the Ebola virus disease a public health emergency of international concern,’’ she added.

Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O.’s head of health security, said that ‘‘things will get worse for a while’’ and that ‘‘we are fully prepared for addressing this for some months.’’

The W.H.O. urged all states where the disease is spreading to declare a state of emergency, to screen all people leaving at international airports, seaports and land crossings, and to prevent travel by anyone suspected of having the Ebola virus. The move is aimed at containing the disease. But the organization did not recommend a ban on travel to or from places with outbreaks because of the low risk of infection. ‘‘We don’t believe a general ban on that kind of travel makes any kind of sense at all,’’ Dr. Fukuda said.

The declaration was apparently intended to display a more aggressive stance by the health organization. In the past, it has often bent to pressure from member states demanding that there be no consequences even as epidemics have raged inside their borders and sometimes slipped over them.

But health specialists remain critical to the international response.

‘‘Declaring Ebola an international public health emergency shows how seriously W.H.O. is taking the current outbreak; but statements won’t save lives,’’ said Dr. Bart Janssens, the director of operations at Doctors Without Borders.

‘‘Countries possessing necessary capacities must immediately dispatch available infectious disease experts and disaster relief assets to the region,’’ he said in a statement. ‘‘It is clear the epidemic will not be contained without a massive deployment on the ground from these states.’’

According to figures released by the W.H.O. this past week, the virus has claimed 932 lives since March. Most of the cases are in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but nine cases have also been reported in Nigeria, where one person died after traveling there from Liberia.

The total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases, including the fatalities, was 1,711.

‘‘A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola,’’ the W.H.O. said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its emergency committee on the outbreak.

The statement called the spread of the disease an ‘‘extraordinary event,’’ describing the potential consequences as ‘‘particularly serious.’’ There is no licensed protocol of treatment or vaccine to halt the disease.

The W.H.O. listed a series of worrisome factors in its spread, including ‘‘the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries.’’

A Front Line Against Ebola Runs Through Newark’s Terminal B

Erica J. Sison has dealt with sick and dead dogs and cats, 40 dead lab rats in bags, trophy animals, cooked monkey meat on sticks, human skulls from Indonesia, bat specimens and a live Asian bat that flew out of an airplane cargo hold.

Now she is poised for Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html], and has seen three false alarms in the last two weeks.

Ms. Sison, the quarantine officer in charge at Newark Liberty International Airport[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/newark_liberty_international_airport_nj/index.html?inline=nyt-org], is on the front lines of a complex system developed to protect United States borders from a “Contagion”-like invasion of rare foreign diseases.

It is, she says, a bit anxiety provoking.

“I’ve learned pretty quick that I can never predict what someone is going to tell me when that phone rings,” she said on Friday. “These last two weeks we’ve been on adrenaline.”

The job is a largely unseen and unknown part of the border security system[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/quarantine/quarantinestationcontactlistfull.html] at 18 airports (including Kennedy International Airport) and two border crossings.

Ms. Sison, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org], operates out of an office at Newark’s Terminal B, the international arrivals terminal, in a secure area not far from where arriving passengers have to show their passports and are treated to C.D.C.-sponsored video monitors showing information[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/ebola-inbound-infographic] about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that has killed nearly 1,000 people.

In some ways, she is an Ellis Island of the airways, charged with ensuring that immigrants are fit to enter the country. But while some people who were ill were held at Ellis Island, Ms. Sison said, she does not hold people. If they need treatment, they may be quarantined, but only until they can be sent by ambulance to a hospital. There is a one-bed isolation room in her office, but it is more like the school nurse’s office than a space capsule.

Ms. Sison, 36, who has degrees in chemistry and public health and is completing her doctorate in epidemiology at Rutgers, took the post five years ago. She found out about it while working at the Newark city health department, on a measles case with the airport quarantine office.

She trains border protection officers on the disease du jour, so they know when to call her. In the case of Ebola, she has told them that the transmission is not airborne but that they should be alert for symptoms like fever, sweating and vomiting in travelers from West African countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. Less than 0.5 percent of the 243,000 international travelers to United States airports each day originate from those countries, including an average of 679 from Nigeria and 145 from the other three countries, according to the C.D.C.

The post can be busy even when there is not a major disease scare. Quarantine officers, who are not normally physicians, make 2,000 health consultations a year with C.D.C. physicians about sick travelers, Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency, said.

The last big scare was MERS[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/CORONAVIRUS/MERS/], or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The first confirmed cases in the United States were in May of this year, in travelers from Saudi Arabia.

At the moment, Ms. Sison said, the C.D.C.’s airport video terminals are flipping every few seconds between the latest exotic diseases: Ebola, MERS, measles and Chikungunya[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/chikungunya/], a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that has been found in countries in Africa[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/africa/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo], Asia, Europe and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as, for the first time last year, in Caribbean islands.

Usually, sick travelers are glad to see her because they want help, Ms. Sison said. The more combative passengers are the ones who are trying to bring in something that is precious to them but could carry disease, like monkey meat.

Passengers from West African countries are not specifically targeted for Ebola checks, C.D.C. officials said. “We’re not taking these passengers and doing anything differently,” Ms. Nordlund said.

Still, the border agents are on high alert.

This week and last week, Ms. Sison was called to her first suspected Ebola cases, two missionaries and a nonprofit worker who had been living in Liberia. They were not symptomatic, but the border agents “just wanted us to talk to them,” perhaps because of where the passengers had been, Ms. Sison said. The travelers were hyperaware of the risks. “They had to explain to people that they didn’t shake hands or hug,” she said.

As it turned out, they were not sick. They were sent on their way, and the all clear was sounded, for now.

In a brief news conference on Friday, President Obama called[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/world/middleeast/iraq.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=Banner&module=span-ab-top-region®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0] the crisis in Iraq a “long-term project,” but reiterated that the United States would not send ground forces to the region. Earlier, Mr. Obama said the stranded Yazidis[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/world/middleeast/chased-onto-iraqi-mountain-there-is-no-water-nothing.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=LargeMediaHeadlineSum&module=b-lede-package-region®ion=lede-package&WT.nav=lede-package], a religious minority, were in danger of “genocide” at the hands of militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Mr.

Obama authorized targeted airstrikes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/obama-weighs-military-strikes-to-aid-trapped-iraqis-officials-say.html] against ISIS on Thursday, drawing bipartisan support[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/us/politics/bipartisan-support-with-caveats-for-obama-on-iraq-airstrikes.html] from Congress.

But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has sharply criticized the president’s foreign policy and on Saturday said the limited military response was not enough and that it showed a “fundamental misunderstanding of the threat.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/us/politics/mccain-says-limited-us-strikes-on-militants-in-iraq-are-not-enough.html]”

Mr. McCain will explain his criticism of the White House on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Later on the show, retired General James L. Jones, a former White House national security adviser, and Zalmay Khalilzad, ambassador to Iraq during the Bush administration, will also discuss the crisis in Iraq.

Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said this week[http://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-humanitarian-aid-mission-and-air-strikes-against-islamic-state-militants-in-iraq] that he supported the president’s limited approach to the conflict in Iraq. He will share his position on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” James F. Jeffrey, former ambassador to Iraq during the Obama administration, will talk about American diplomatic relations with the country on CBS.

On “Fox News Sunday,” Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, both members of the Armed Services Committee, will weigh in on ISIS’s rapid advance across northern Iraq. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, will also discuss Iraq on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Later on the show, Representative Donna Edwards, Democrat of Maryland, will join the political roundtable.

General Carter F. Ham, former commander of United States and coalition forces in Mosul, will give his insight on the crisis in Iraq on ABC’s “This Week.”

Univison’s “Al Punto” will air a special on the Central Intelligence Agency, including interviews with the agency’s director, John O. Brennan, and the head of recruitment, Ron Patrick. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky who has criticized the agency, will discuss his reservations.

The World Health Organizationdeclared the Ebola outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html] in Western Africa an international public health emergency on Friday. Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O.’s assistant director-general for health security, will discuss the health community’s response to the virus on CBS.

Dr. Frank Glover Jr., who worked in Liberia for three years with a charity and testified before Congress[http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/4851174596.html] about the virus, and Robin Renée Sanders [http://nigeria.usembassy.gov/amb_robin_sanders.html], former United States ambassador to the Republic of Congo and Nigeria, will talk about the dangers the Ebola outbreak poses on ABC.

The White House may act alone in attempts to end tax benefits[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/business/Action-in-washington-on-corporate-inversions.html] for companies that move abroad to lower their tax bills. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a member of the Budget Committee, and former Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, will discuss the efficacy of such proposals on “Fox News Sunday.”

This week marked 40 years[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/richard-nixons-tenure-and-downfall-are-reassessed.html] since President Richard M. Nixon resigned following the Watergate scandal.

“The world is too much with us,” wrote the poet, a sentiment President Obama most likely shared this past week as he reluctantly ordered warplanes back over Iraq. As he did so, another Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire ended in resumed bombardment, Vladimir V. Putin defiantly ordered his own sanctions against the West and a terrible virus spread farther through West Africa.

A president who has taken great pains to pull the United States out of the world’s squabbles, Mr. Obama made no effort to conceal his distress at being pulled back in, for even a limited mission to protect minorities. “I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq,” Mr. Obama said on Thursday night. But the old “slippery slope” cliché figured in more than one analysis of his decision.

Still, the markets somehow managed to find a hopeful note in a world that seemed totally out of tune. Though Russia was reported to be massing troops on the Ukrainian border, and the government imposed a ban on most food imports from the United States and its allies, American stocks rallied on Friday when the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolai P. Patrushev, said in an interview that “Russia will continue to make all efforts for a very fast de-escalation of tensions.”

That “continue” carried the dubious suggestion that Russia had been making such efforts all along, but the fact that the markets latched on to the secretary’s statement testified 1) to the predominance of the Ukraine crisis over the Middle East in the minds of market strategists, and 2) that “the market is really tired of receiving one negative news item after another, and so is on the lookout for something positive,” as the Citigroup economist Ivan Tchakarov told Bloomberg.

Dragged Back Into Iraq

Following Mr. Obama’s authorization of the first significant military operation in Iraq since he pulled American ground troops out in 2011, the Air Force reported on Friday that two United States F-18 fighter jets had dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs onto an artillery target near Erbil, the Kurdish capital.

Mr. Obama’s hand in Iraq was forced by ISIS, the fanatical Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and its advance in northern Iraq against the Kurds, reliable American allies who have maintained a modicum of order in their semiautonomous region. Thousands of Yazidis — an oft-persecuted religious minority — fled to remote Mount Sinjar, where they were stranded without food or water.

ISIS was left in control of a two-mile-wide hydroelectric dam on the Tigris River notorious for its structural instability. Even if ISIS did nothing, officials said, leaving the dam unattended could lead to its collapse, sending a 65-foot-high wall of water through Mosul.

Though Mr. Obama said he had ordered the strikes to protect American personnel, the fact that he did so only when the Kurds became threatened — and not earlier in the year when ISIS seized FallujaH? and marched through Mosul and on toward Baghdad — was bound to raise questions. One explanation was in Baghdad’s Green Zone, where Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki continued to resist all demands that he go away. The failure of Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, to include Sunnis, Kurds and others in a government of national unity is widely blamed for the disarray that made it possible for ISIS to rout the Iraqi Army. Even his lieutenants have urged Mr. Maliki to step down. But having made innumerable enemies, he is said to be demanding immunity and a security detail paid for by the state.

Mr. Obama has insisted that there is “no American military solution” to the mess, and he no doubt hoped that limited strikes would enable Iraqis to turn the tables on ISIS. But what if they fail? Will he be forced to further action?

Israeli Fire, Russian Threat

Faith in military solutions, however, seemed to prevail in the fight between Israel and Hamas. No sooner had a 72-hour truce expired than rockets began to rain on southern Israel, and Israeli warplanes and naval vessels opened up on targets in Gaza. The pause in hostilities had been the longest since they broke out on July 8.

The Palestinians insist that the blockade of Gaza be lifted, and about 100 prisoners held by Israel be freed, if there is to be a truce. The Israelis insist that Hamas disarm. The Egyptians have been trying to get both sides to lower their demands, and to leave more complex issues for subsequent talks.

In the meantime, the Palestinian death toll stands at almost 1,900, mostly civilians, while Israel has lost 64 soldiers and three civilians.

On the Ukrainian front, forces loyal to Kiev continued tightening their ring around Donetsk, the seat of secessionists armed by Russia.

There was no evidence that Mr. Putin was prepared to back down. On the contrary, his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, announced on Thursday, in retaliation against Western sanctions, a one-year ban on many food imports from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia and Norway — a move that is likely to reduce food supplies and raise inflation in Russia. So far, his efforts to “de-escalate tensions,” to use Mr. Patrushev’s words, have consisted of insisting that Kiev stop attacking the rebels and that the West stop helping Kiev. And there remains the chilling possibility that Mr. Putin could send troops into eastern Ukraine on a “humanitarian mission” to the besieged denizens of Donetsk.

Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] Spreads in Africa

Wars were not the only scourge making the news last week. With the death toll from an outbreak of the Ebola virus approaching 1,000 in West Africa, the World Health Organization on Friday declared an international public health emergency. And Doctors Without Borders called for a “massive deployment” of medical workers to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries hit worst by the outbreak.

The Ebola virus causes a severe and often fatal illness, and while some drugs are being tested, there is no vaccine or treatment yet available to prevent or cure the disease. The virus is caught through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected people or animals.

Because it is not “spread through the air,” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O.’s head of health security, it can be contained.

Tracing Ebola’s Breakout to an African 2-Year-Old

Patient Zero in the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] outbreak, researchers suspect, was a 2-year-old boy who died on Dec. 6, just a few days after falling ill in a village in Guéckédou, in southeastern Guinea[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/guinea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. Bordering Sierra Leone[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/sierraleone/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Liberia, Guéckédou is at the intersection of three nations, where the disease found an easy entry point to the region.

A week later, it killed the boy’s mother, then his 3-year-old sister, then his grandmother. All had fever[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], vomiting[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/nausea-and-vomiting/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and diarrhea[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], but no one knew what had sickened them.

Two mourners at the grandmother’s funeral took the virus home to their village. A health worker carried it to still another, where he died, as did his doctor. They both infected relatives from other towns. By the time Ebola was recognized, in March, dozens of people had died in eight Guinean communities, and suspected cases were popping up in Liberia and Sierra Leone — three of the world’s poorest countries, recovering from years of political dysfunction and civil war.

In Guéckédou, where it all began, “the feeling was fright,” said Dr. Kalissa N’fansoumane, the hospital director. He had to beg his employees to come to work.

On March 31, Doctors Without Borders[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/doctors_without_borders/index.html?inline=nyt-org], which has intervened in many Ebola outbreaks, called this one “unprecedented,” and warned that the disease had erupted in so many different locations that fighting it would be enormously difficult.

Now, with 1,779 cases[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_08_ebola/en/], including 961 deaths and a small cluster in Nigeria[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/nigeria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], the outbreak is out of control and still getting worse. Not only is it the largest ever, but it also seems likely to surpass all two dozen previous known Ebola outbreaks combined. Epidemiologists predict it will take months to control, perhaps many months, and a spokesman for the World Health Organization said thousands more health workers were needed to fight it.

Some experts warn that the outbreak could destabilize governments in the region. It is already causing widespread panic and disruption. On Saturday, Guinea announced that it had closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia in a bid to halt the virus’s spread. Doctors worry that deaths could shoot up from malaria[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/malaria/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], dysentery and other diseases as Ebola drains resources from weak health systems. Health care workers, already in short supply, have been hit hard by the outbreak: 145 have been infected, and 80 of them have died.

Past Ebola outbreaks have been snuffed out, often within a few months. How, then, did this one spin so far out of control? It is partly a consequence of modernization in Africa, and perhaps a warning that future outbreaks — which are inevitable — will pose tougher challenges. Unlike most previous outbreaks, which occurred in remote, localized spots, this one began in a border region where roads have been improved and people travel a lot. In this case, the disease was on the move before health officials even knew it had struck.

Also, this part of Africa had never seen Ebola before. Health workers did not recognize it and had neither the training nor the equipment to avoid infecting themselves or other patients. Hospitals in the region often lack running water and gloves, and can be fertile ground for epidemics.

Public health experts acknowledge that the initial response, both locally and internationally, was inadequate.

“That’s obviously the case,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. “Look at what’s happening now.”

He added, “A couple of months ago, there was a false sense of confidence that it was controlled, a stepping back, and then it flared up worse than before.”

Health experts have grown increasingly confident in recent years that they can control Ebola, Dr. Frieden said, based on success in places like Uganda.

But those successes hinged on huge education campaigns to teach people about the disease and persuade them to go to treatment centers. Much work also went into getting people to change funeral practices that involve touching corpses, which are highly infectious.

But in West Africa, Ebola was unknown.

In some areas, frightened and angry people have attacked health workers[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html] and even accused them of bringing in disease.

“Early on in the outbreak, we had at least 26 villages or little towns that would not cooperate with responders in terms of letting people into the village, even,” said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization.

The outbreak has occurred in three waves; the first two were relatively small, and the third, starting about a month ago, was much larger, Mr. Hartl said. “That third wave was a clarion call,” he said.

At a House subcommittee hearing on Thursday, Ken Isaacs, a vice president of Samaritan’s Purse, said his aid group and Doctors Without Borders were doing much of the work on the outbreak.

“That the world would allow two relief agencies to shoulder this burden along with the overwhelmed Ministries of Health in these countries testifies to the lack of serious attention the epidemic was given,” he said.

Guinea’s Monumental Task

In mid-March, Guinea’s Ministry of Health asked Doctors Without Borders for help in Guéckédou.

At first, the group’s experts suspected Lassa fever, a viral disease endemic in West Africa. But this illness was worse. Isolation units were set up, and tests confirmed Ebola.

Like many African cities and towns, this region hums with motorcycle taxis and minivans crammed with passengers.

The mobility, and now the sheer numbers, make the basic work of containing the disease a monumental task. The only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate infected patients, trace all their contacts, isolate the ones who get sick and repeat the process until, finally, there are no more cases.

But how do you do that when there can easily be 500 names on the list of contacts who are supposed to be tracked down and checked for fever every day for 21 days?

“They go to the field to work their crops,” said Monia Sayah, a nurse sent in by Doctors Without Borders. “Some have phones, but the networks don’t always work. Some will say, ‘I’m fine; you don’t have to come,’ but we really have to see them and take their temperature. But if someone wants to lie and take Tylenol, they won’t have a temperature.”

At Donka Hospital in Guinea’s capital, Dr. Simon Mardel, a British emergency physician who has worked in seven previous hemorrhagic fever outbreaks and was sent to Guinea by the World Health Organization, realized this outbreak was the worst he had seen. A man had arrived late one night, panting and with abdominal pain[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/abdominal-pain/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. During the previous few days, he had been treated at two private clinics, given intravenous fluids and sent home. The staff did not suspect Ebola because he had no fever. But fever can diminish at the end stage of the disease.

The treatment room at Donka was poorly lit and had no sink. There were few buckets of chlorine solution, and the staff found it impossible to clean their hands between patients.

The man died two hours after arriving. Tests later showed he had been positive for Ebola. Untold numbers of health care workers and their subsequent patients had been exposed to the disease.

Gloves, in short supply at the hospitals, were selling for 50 cents a pair on the open market, a huge sum for people who often live on less than a dollar a day. At homes where families cared for patients, even plastic buckets to hold water and bleach[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/poison/sodium-hypochlorite-poisoning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] for washing hands and disinfecting linens were lacking.

Workers were failing to trace all patients’ contacts, whereas “in previous epidemics, if we missed one case that turned out to be positive, that was an exception,” Dr. Mardel said.

Tracing an Epidemic’s Origins

As is often the case in Ebola outbreaks, no one knows how the first person got the disease or how the virus found its way to the region. The virus infects monkeys and apes, and some previous epidemics are thought to have begun when someone was exposed to blood while killing or butchering an infected animal. Cooking will destroy the virus, so the risk is not in eating the meat, but in handling it raw. Ebola is also thought to infect fruit bats without harming them, so the same risks apply to butchering bats. Some researchers also think that people might become infected by eating fruit or other uncooked foods contaminated by droppings from infected bats.

Once people become ill, their bodily fluids can infect others, and they become more infectious as the illness progresses. The disease does not spread through the air like the flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier]; contact with fluids is necessary, usually through the eyes, nose, mouth or cuts in the skin. One drop of blood can harbor millions of viruses, and corpses become like virus bombs.

A research team that studied the Guinea outbreak traced the disease back to the 2-year-old who died in Guéckédou and published a report in The New England Journal of Medicine[http://www.nejm.org.proxy.bc.edu/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1404505]. He and his relatives were never tested to confirm Ebola, but their symptoms matched it and they fit into a pattern of transmission that included other cases that were confirmed by blood tests.

But no one can explain how such a small child could have become the first person infected. Contaminated fruit is one possibility. An injection with a contaminated needle is another.

Sylvain Baize, part of the team that studied the Guinea outbreak, and head of the national reference center for viral hemorrhagic fevers at the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, France, said there might have been an earlier case that went undiscovered, before the 2-year-old.

“We suppose that the first case was infected following contact with bats,” he said. “Maybe, but we are not sure.”

Roaring Back in Liberia

Dr. Fazlul Haque, deputy representative of Unicef in Liberia, said that after a few cases there in March and April, health workers thought the disease had gone away. But it came roaring back about a month later.

“It reappeared, and this time, it came in a very big way,” he said. “The rate of increase is very high now.”

From July 30 to Aug. 6, Liberia’s government reported more than 170 new cases and over 90 deaths.

“Currently, our efforts are not enough to stop the virus,” Dr. Haque said.

He added that most health agencies believed the true case numbers to be far higher, in part because locals were not coming forward when relatives fell ill, and because detection by the health authorities has been weak. Rukshan Ratnam, a spokesman for Unicef in Liberia, said some families had hidden their sick to avoid sending them to isolation wards or out of shame stemming from traditional beliefs that illness is a punishment for doing something wrong.

Dr. Haque said that the tracing of cases — crucial for the containment of the disease — was moving too slowly to keep up with new cases. Seven counties had confirmed cases, and the government had deployed security forces in Lofa County, where Liberia’s first case was detected, he said. But the government had given leave to nonessential employees in those areas, so it was not clear how they would have the staffing to isolate the sick. Some hospitals have closed because so many health workers have fallen ill.

Liberia has closed markets and many border crossings. It has said testing and screening would be done at immigration checkpoints.

But on Thursday, at a checkpoint staffed by at least 30 soldiers in Klay, Bomi County, there was no screening — just a blockade and a line of trucks loaded with bags of charcoal, plantains and potato greens.

Hilary Wesseh, a truck driver who was sucking the last drops of juice out of a small lime, said he had been stuck there for two days.

“They are holding us hostage,” he said.

A Desperate Call for Help

By June and July, Sierra Leone was becoming the center of the outbreak. At the government hospital in Kenema, Dr. Sheik Hummar Khan was leading the efforts to treat patients and control the epidemic.

But he was desperate for supplies: chlorine for disinfection, gloves, goggles, protective suits, rudimentary sugar and salt solutions to fight dehydration[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/dehydration/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and give patients a chance to survive. Early in July, he emailed friends and former medical school classmates in the United States, asking their help and sending a spreadsheet listing what he needed, and what he had. Many of the lines in the “available” column were empty. One of his requests was for body bags: 3,000 adult, 2,000 child.

Before his friends could send the supplies, Dr. Khan contracted Ebola himself. He died on July 29.

Nigeria Struggles to Cope With Ebola Outbreak

Ebola, one of the world’s most fatal diseases, has surfaced in Africa’s most populous country.

Nigerian health officials have announced nine confirmed cases and two deaths in the country from the Ebola outbreak that is sweeping West Africa, including a nurse and a man from Liberia whom the nurse had been caring for.

The man, Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized American citizen, had flown to Nigeria in late July and died soon after. He had infected at least seven other people, including the nurse, who died on Tuesday, officials said.

By Friday, President Goodluck Jonathan had declared a state of emergency, officially adding Nigeria, home to more than 160 million people, to the list of nations struggling to control one of the largest public-health emergencies in recent history. More than 900 people have died.

The story of Mr. Sawyer, who was reportedly aware that he was sick when he left Liberia, demonstrates just how difficult containing the disease will be in the modern age of rapid travel and growing urbanization. Nigeria has Africa’s largest economy and is deeply connected to the outside world, a fact that could magnify the consequences if the outbreak is not contained.

“Rapid epidemic transmission has been with us a long time, but my guess is that it’s accelerating, with the number of people on the move and intensity of air travel, global trade and the numbers of displaced people we have globally,” said Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist and the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

Climate change, population growth and an increase in displaced populations mean that people are pushing into previously uninhabited places, creating new vulnerabilities and bringing humans into closer contact with animal populations, where many of the diseases have begun, he said.

At the same time, globalization means that people are mixing more, trading more and handling more farm animals in industrial settings — all of which facilitate the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.

“This ought to force a reflection,” Mr. Sachs said, adding that establishing a basic network of community health workers across the developing world was an urgent priority.

Health officials emphasized that Nigeria still had only a few Ebola cases — nine as of Friday, with two deaths — and that its government had mobilized substantial forces to try to stop the spread of the disease.

David Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s effort in Nigeria, said the ministers of health and information were on hand Friday for the opening of an emergency operation center in Lagos, a sign that the government was treating the situation seriously.

“The Nigerians understand the magnitude of the problem here,” said Dr. Frank Mahoney, an epidemiologist who has been leading the C.D.C.'s Ebola response in Lagos. Still, he said, international health officials are undertaking a substantial effort in Nigeria, motivated by what might happen if the disease, which had been confined to remote forests and villages in decades past, starts to spread in one of Africa’s most densely populated countries.

“We are very worried about this,” Dr. Mahoney said, pointing out that Nigeria’s health care system could easily become overwhelmed. “Lagos is such a huge city with such a mobile population.”

Lagos, a city of nearly 20 million, the most populous in Nigeria, is also home to a large contingent of religious healers, such as Temitope Balogun Joshua, a popular Christian minister and televangelist known as T. B. Joshua. Health experts are concerned that sick people will flock to Lagos to seek his advice.

Dr. Mahoney said health experts were reaching out to such leaders, and Mr. Jonathan called on churches and religious leaders to halt large gatherings that could encourage the spread of the disease.

Almost all of the suspected Ebola cases involve people who had direct contact with Mr. Sawyer — either in the airport, where he was helped into a car, or in the hospital where he was treated, the First Consultant Medical Center.

Newspapers in Liberia and Nigeria were brimming with accounts of the strange tale of Mr. Sawyer’s sickness, which began in Liberia, where the disease is exploding.

According to a report[http://nationalchronicleliberia.com/news/politics/1024/how-patrick-sawyer-contracted-ebola/] in The National Chronicle, a Liberian newspaper, Mr. Sawyer’s sister, who died of Ebola in early July, had arrived at a hospital bleeding. But when doctors and nurses tried to put her in isolation, the report said, Mr. Sawyer refused to allow it, demanding that she be given a private ward. He undressed her, put her into a wheelchair and offered the hospital workers cash, the paper said.

And in an account[http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12304:patrick-sawyers-last-hours-at-spriggs&catid=25:politics&Itemid=59] in another Liberian newspaper, The New Dawn, which cited footage from a security camera in the airport in Monrovia, Mr. Sawyer behaved strangely as he waited for his flight out of Liberia. He sat alone, avoiding physical contact with people, including an immigration agent who tried to shake his hand, and even lay flat on his stomach on the floor of a corridor of the airport, the paper reported.

The episode prompted the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to publicly apologize to Nigeria about Mr. Sawyer, who she said had sneaked out of Liberia, where he was being tracked as a potential Ebola case, according to The Daily Independent[http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/08/ebola-president-liberia-sirleaf-johnson-apologises-nigeria-sawyer/], a Nigerian newspaper.

The number of suspected cases has continued to tick up slowly. Nigeria’s state oil company announced on Friday that it had closed its clinic in Lagos after a patient suspected of having Ebola was admitted there. The patient had visited the First Consultant Medical Center, which has since been closed.

In a strange twist, a doctors’ strike in Nigeria may have saved lives by reducing the number of medical workers who came into contact with Mr. Sawyer.

“It would have been a disaster,” said Babajide Saheed, a doctor and the secretary of the Lagos State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. “At the time, nobody was prepared for it.”

About 70 people are believed to have had contact with Mr. Sawyer, Nigerian health officials said. Dr. Mahoney said teams of people were working to call those people and to try to persuade them to stay at home and watch for symptoms, such as a rising temperature.

Just as concerning was what would happen if the disease began to spread inside the health care system, Dr. Mahoney said.

“The health care system in Nigeria would have a really difficult time responding to a communitywide outbreak,” he said.

Ben Ezeamalu contributed reporting from Oshogbo, Nigeria.

Ebola May Pose Little Threat to U.S., but It Looms Large on Twitter

As the shadow of the deadly Ebola virus looms over Africa, its danger clear and present, a lesser kind of contagion, diffuse but persistent, has infected social media feeds in the United States.

Ebola is trending on Twitter. Even a cursory hashtag search turns up, among the news articles and official announcements, expressions of fear, gallows humor and bad information. The virus can spread through the air? OMG! (It cannot.) A possible Ebola case in New York City? Time to pack for Mars! (It was not Ebola.)

Why do people feel compelled to post and rebroadcast jokes, rumors and dread of a distant disease that public health officials say is extremely unlikely to pose serious risk on this side of the Atlantic Ocean?

The science behind how and why ideas spread on social media is a growing area of research. At the most basic level, marketing experts say, people tend to share stories that stir their deepest feelings, whether positive or negative. To wit, frightful shark attacks routinely top the trending charts alongside cheerful cat videos and inspirational quotes.

“We are not just information-processing machines; we’re very driven by emotion,” said Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” Stronger emotions, Dr. Berger has found, increase sharing.

In 2011, he investigated the emotions that compel users to share articles via email. Dr. Berger asked 40 students to jog in place, and then presented each of them with a neutral news article that they could email to whomever they wanted.

After the physical arousal of jogging, Dr. Berger found that students were more likely to share the article, compared with when sitting still.

He concluded that people share content when they are stimulated, regardless of the source.

“It’s whatever generates arousal,” he said. “If you read a scary article about Ebola, and then you read another article, you’re more likely to share that second article because you’re anxious.”

Sharing stories on social media may help us relieve some of that anxiety, according to Pamela Rutledge, a psychologist and director of the Media Psychology Research Center in Corona del Mar, Calif.“Twitter panics, such as we’re seeing with Ebola, are a reflection of people trying to get information, sharing information — even if it’s inaccurate — because being part of the conversation is less threatening than being out of the ‘know,’ ” Dr. Rutledge said by email.

Our compulsion to post on Twitter about Ebola may be compounded by the fact that the human mind is hard-wired to focus on subjects with vivid examples.

“When people think about Ebola, they imagine flesh-eating, visceral, gory stuff,” Dr. Berger said. “High-arousal emotions increase sharing, and that’s even more likely when it’s visceral.”

This theory is based on a concept in psychology known as availability bias, which emerged some 40 years ago. In a study published in the journal Cognitive Psychology in 1973, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman found that people tend to judge the likelihood of an event based on immediate examples that come to mind.

For instance, you are much more likely to drown in the ocean than to be eaten by a shark. But since you can imagine a shark attack in graphic detail, you worry about it disproportionately. Public interest in the Ebola outbreak, a rare disease with vivid, disturbing symptoms, may have similar roots. The flu, after all, kills thousands of people in the United States every year, but it is rarely a hot topic on Twitter.

Other researchers, however, believe that the recipe for social-media momentum is less well defined.

“There are a few pretty general features that enhance likelihood that something will go viral,” said Duncan J. Watts, a sociologist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research in New York.

“For example, if it’s terrible and violent and people are dying, that’s a positive feature in your model,” he said. “Boring and heavy are unlikely to go viral.”

Beyond that, however, Dr. Watts posits that social-media obsessions are primarily fueled not by public sentiment, but by the influence of the mass media. Users focus on subjects that major outlets choose to cover, he said, and when journalists write and talk about Ebola, Twitter users begin posting comments about it.

“I suspect that for a lot of these viral phenomena,” he said, “look under the surface, and working there is the mass media.”

But the overheated Twitter rhetoric may have a few positive effects, spurring efforts by news media, advocates and individuals like Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to go into overdrive posting facts and hosting chat sessions to debunk rumors and quell fear.

Moreover, Dr. Watts added, when Twitter feeds are abuzz with concerns about Ebola, that may spur public health officials to do more to beat back the outbreak.

“If panic on social media gets world health authorities to pay attention and devote serious resources to a problem, it’s probably a good thing,” he said.

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Monday:

• Iraq plunges into political crisis.

Iraq’s top court ruled today that the prime minister’s party has the largest bloc in Parliament, forcing the president to invite him to form a government.

With American strikes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/middleeast/iraq.html] showing effects on the battlefield, Kurdish forces counterattacked Sunni militants in northern Iraq on Sunday.

• Peace prospects.

Israeli negotiators return to Cairo today for talks on a longer-term deal, through intermediaries, with the Palestinians.

Another 72-hour cease-fire went into effect today to allow Gaza residents to receive humanitarian aid.

• Teenager’s death is under scrutiny.

Civil rights leaders and the Justice Department are monitoring developments in a St. Louis suburb, where an unarmed black teenager[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/police-say-mike-brown-was-killed-after-struggle-for-gun.html] was shot by a police officer on Saturday, leading to violent protests there.

• Addressing inequality.

A group of U.S. mayors releases a report today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/nyregion/task-force-of-mayors-addresses-income-gap.html] showing that the income gap between the wealthiest Americans and middle- and low-income households continues to widen.

• Teachers on trial.

Jury selection begins today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/atlanta-jury-selection-set-to-begin-school-employees-accused-of-altering-test-scores.html] in the case of a dozen former Atlanta public schools employees accused of conspiring to alter and raise students’ standardized test scores.

• Too close to call.

Two Hawaii precincts where voting was postponed Saturday by Tropical Storm Iselle will decide the U.S. Senate primary race, in which the two Democratic candidates are separated by less than 1 percent of the vote.

In the same election, Neil Abercrombie became the first governor in Hawaii’s history to lose a primary race[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/politics/hawaii-primary.html], collecting only about 31 percent of the vote.

• Next steps for Ebola.

A World Health Organization panel of ethicists meets today[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_08_ebola/en/] to discuss the use of experimental treatments — never before used on humans — on patients in West Africa.

• Campaigns don’t rest.

President Obama, who is spending two weeks with his family on Martha’s Vineyard, will attend a fund-raiser on the island today.

• Hurricane fallout.

High winds, rain and flooding from what was Hurricane Bertha[http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28736323] are still battering England, Wales and Scotland.

And Hurricane Julio, northeast of Honolulu, is expected to weaken over the next 48 hours, the National Weather Service said.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are higher. European shares are up strongly, and several Asian indexes gained more than 1 percent.

• BuzzFeedwill announce today[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html] that it will use a $50 million investment to introduce new sections, create an in-house incubator for new technology and potential acquisitions, and beef up its video arm.

OVER THE WEEKEND

• The prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, became the country’s first popularly elected president[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/europe/erdogan-turkeys-premier-wins-presidential-election.html] on Sunday, capturing 52 percent of the popular vote.

• The N.C.A.A. violated antitrust law, a California judge ruled Friday[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/sports/federal-judge-rules-against-ncaa-in-obannon-case.html], by denying compensation to college athletes for using their images in promotional material. The N.C.A.A. is appealing.[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-will-appeal-obannon-ruling.html]

• The film “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” kicked its way to the top of the box office, bringing in an estimated $65 million domestically,[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/ninja-turtles-reboot-tops-weekend-box-office/] 30 percent more than analyst projections.

• Officials in upstate New York are investigating the death[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/sports/autoracing/tony-stewart-kills-driver-during-confrontation-on-racetrack.html] of a dirt track racer after he was fatally struck on Saturday by Tony Stewart, a Nascar driver.

• Rory McIlroy, 25, won the P.G.A. Championship[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/sports/golf/rory-mcilroy-wins-2014-pga-championship.html] in Louisville, Ky., on Sunday, shooting a final-round 68 and finishing at 16 under par.

• The $324 million settlement in a class-action suit over tech companies’ agreements not to hire one another’s engineers is too low, a federal judge in California said[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/technology/settlement-rejected-in-silicon-valley-hiring-case.html] in rejecting the proposal Friday.

NOTEWORTHY

• Lighting up the night sky.

The annual Perseid meteor shower[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/watch-for-falling-meteors/] will peak in the next night or two, with up to 100 meteors appearing in the sky each hour.

But the brightness of the “supermoon” -- when the orb is at its closest point with Earth for the year — may obscure the light show, if local clouds don’t.

• So just how cool is Brooklyn?

That’s what the Democratic National Committee will contemplate this week as it considers the New York City borough for the party’s 2016 presidential nominating convention[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/nyregion/clintons-support-de-blasios-push-to-bring-democratic-convention-to-brooklyn.html].

Others vying are Phoenix, Philadelphia and Cleveland, which is already hosting the 2016 Republican convention.

• Where the worst went.

On this day 80 years ago, the first batch of prisoners from a federal penitentiary arrived at Alcatraz[http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-029.htm], inaugurating the tiny island’s role as prison to the country’s most dangerous criminals until it closed in 1963.

Its inmates included Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Robert Franklin Straud, a murderer who became an ornithologist at Leavenworth and was best known as the Birdman of Alcatraz.

BACK STORY

Shark Week on Discovery Channel[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week/#!/sun] caused a stir as soon as viewers caught a glimpse of it in 1988.

Since then, Shark Week has grown into as much of a behemoth as “Colossus,” the purported 3,000-pound great white whose pursuit becomes one of the week’s main attractions.

The pop culture juggernaut[http://www.theatlantic.com.proxy.bc.edu/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-evolution-of-shark-week-pop-culture-leviathan/261063/] has even been ripped off by other channels: This summer, We TV had Snark Week, and Comedy Central had a version with a name a family-friendly news app can’t repeat.

A criticism of Shark Week has been its supposed shift away from science toward schlock, disappointing marine researchers. Sharks are “exciting enough that you don’t have to go for the least common denominators,” one of them told USA Today[http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/08/07/shark-week-inside/13671745/].

Over the coming days, the lineup includes “Monster Hammerhead,” “Alien Sharks: A Return to the Abyss,” “Lair of the Mega Shark” and the new late-night talk show, “Sharks After Dark.”

But come Saturday night, Shark Week retreats. That’s when the sage advice of the “30 Rock” character Tracy Jordan[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NxtL-oLm4] comes in handy: “Live every week like it’s Shark Week.”

Here’s what you need to know from NYT Now:

• Living while black.

“We’re great at outrage and great at reacting, but how do you get ahead of this, so you don’t have to keep reacting to another shooting?”

That’s William Rhoden, our sports columnist who has written extensively on race, speaking of the fatal police shooting[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html] of Michael Brown, 18.

His death over the weekend has led to mass protests and looting in suburban St. Louis.

What isn’t happening, Mr. Rhoden says, is the broad soul-searching required to remove blanket judgments.

“We’re viewed as athletes, we’re viewed as entertainers, and we’re viewed as threats,” he says. “There’s this underlying resentment and fear of black men that just hasn’t abated.”

Mr. Rhoden, who is black, says he and fellow volunteers in a youth community program have debated having “the talk” with the teenagers — telling them that they have to live by different rules.

But, he says, “I don’t want to weaken them.”

“I don’t want to be weakened. I want to walk with the same thunder as my white colleagues. I want to have the same sense of entitlement, that this world is mine.”

• The logic of a virus.

Months into West Africa’s Ebola epidemic[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-continues-to-spread-in-nigeria/], the virus’s medical profile is clear: cruel, efficient killer.

We asked Carl Zimmer, our science writer and the author of “A Planet of Viruses,”[http://carlzimmer.com/books/aplanetofviruses/index.html] for an evolutionary profile.

“There’s lots of ways of being a virus,” he tells us.

Some are relatively harmless and easily spread, like the cold virus. “Or you can take another strategy where you are not so nice to your host,” Mr. Zimmer says.

“That’s a risky strategy,” he points out. Every time a pathogen kills, it loses a place to live. So viruses sometimes also hang out in backup species – in Ebola’s case, probably bats.

And some evolve to move quickly from one host to another, like Ebola via body fluids.

“It performs this horrible trick of taking advantage of the way people care for their sick and honor their dead,” Mr. Zimmer says.

• The post office’s debit sheet.

The U.S. Postal Service said today that it racked up another big loss[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/business/USPS-reports-quarterly-finances.html] — $1.9 billion in its fiscal third quarter.

Ron Nixon, our reporter who follows the agency, says the problem isn’t just the public’s switch from stamps to email.

“A 2006 law requires them to pay about $5 billion a year into a future retiree health care fund,” he says.

That $5 billion is about the same amount the Postal Service lost last year.

“No one else in the government or the private sector has to do this,” he says.

MARKETS

• Wall Street stocks closed up. The S.&P. 500 gained 0.3 percent.

The host and panelists[http://www.sundance.tv/series/the-approval-matrix] argue a subject while pushing a small block representing it around a table.

The six episodes of host/panelist discussions[http://www.sundance.tv/series/the-approval-matrix] have already been filmed, so it stuck to broad themes, writes[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/arts/television/the-approval-matrix-begins-monday-on-sundance-tv.html] our critic Jon Caramanica, “like fame and television’s golden age.” (11 p.m. Eastern, Sundance TV).

• Smile, you’re on ...

Yes, “Candid Camera[http://www.candidcamera.com/],” which was broadcast in various formats from 1947 to 2004, is back, hosted by Mayim Bialik of “The Big Bang Theory” and Peter Funt, the son of the show’s creator.

In one stunt, mechanics inspecting the actress Megan Hilty’s car find no engine under the hood (8 p.m. Eastern, TV Land).

• All-points bulletin: It’s Shark Week on Discovery.

Fatal attacks in California are investigated in “Great White Serial Killer” at 8 p.m. Eastern.

Then it’s off to Guadalupe Island in Mexico, the home of large great white sharks, for “Jaws Strikes Back” at 9 p.m.

And scientists and fishermen look into sightings of a 20-foot hammerhead shark in Florida in “Monster Hammerhead” at 10 p.m.

• ICYMI.

The first episode of the highly regarded[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/arts/television/the-knick-a-cinemax-medical-drama-set-in-1900.html] Cinemax series “The Knick,” which was on Friday night, is available, free, for streaming[http://www.cinemax.com/the-knick/video/?bctid=3708203111001].

• If you’re staying up …

On “Chelsea Lately”: Megan Fox, who is starring in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/ninja-turtles-reboot-tops-weekend-box-office/],” the No. 1 film at the weekend box office (11 p.m., E!).

New York Today: Central Park, Untamed

Good morning on this sunny Monday.

A native woodland is growing just a stone’s throw from Midtown.

It’s called Hallett Nature Sanctuary[http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/hallett-nature-sanctuary.html]: a fenced-off, four-acre preserve tucked behind the pond at the southeastern end of Central Park.

During the summer, it is open on only one day a month. This month, that day falls on Tuesday.

For nearly 80 years, the area was totally off limits.

Robert Moses, then the parks commissioner, closed it to create a bird sanctuary and “to see what happens if you let nature take care of nature,” said Gal Lavid, operations director for the Central Park Conservancy[http://www.centralparknyc.org/].

What happened was that invasive species took over. In 2001, the conservancy, which runs the park, began removing them and reintroducing native plants.

Last fall, the sanctuary reopened for public tours.

The winding, climbing trail there is two-tenths of a mile.

Signs point out herbaceous plants more commonly found in groves outside the city: bottlebrush, little twinleaf, Canadian wild ginger.

The sanctuary also reveals the source of the waterfall that feeds the pond:

A hose, emerging from a quick-connect box hidden by native Virginia knotweed and threaded through a hollow log.

“Hallett’s little secret,” Mr. Lavid said, smiling.

The sanctuary is open 1 to 3 p.m. on Tuesday, no reservations necessary.

Weekly autumn visiting hours will probably resume in September.

Here’s what else you need to know.

WEATHER

Last hurrah. Sunny with highs in the mid 80s[http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.77657244207131&lon=-73.96940231323242#.U-iLMEh8FI7] and a few puffy cumulus.

Tuesday, it will rain after eight days without a drop.

…And rain. The forecast calls for up to three inches before skies clear on Thursday.

AND FINALLY …

Far below Park Avenue, in a tunnel lit turquoise, thousands of people listened to the sounds of the ocean on Saturday.

As visitors walked north through the seven-block passageway, they sonically surged deeper into the sea. They started with waves and sunk down to the scuttles of the seafloor.

A reporter from The Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/nyregion/with-park-avenue-closed-above-a-tunnel-that-sounds-like-the-sea.html?ref=nyregion] came across one visitor, Ilya Kushnirsky, as he tuned into some humpback whales.

Mr. Kushnirsky said, “This sounds more like Sonic Youth down here.”

Saturday is the last day to visit the tunnel.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, has declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa “the largest, most severe, most complex” in “the nearly four-decade history of the disease,” according to an editorial in The New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/opinion/controlling-the-ebola-epidemic.html?ref=opinion&_r=0].

“Apart from inflicting a staggering human toll, the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa has laid bare how unprepared the United States and other advanced countries are to protect and treat thousands of Africans whose lives are threatened by an extremely dangerous virus for which there is no cure.” Because drug companies have little financial interest in developing a vaccine, “traditional public health measures, like finding and isolating patients who become sick, tracing their contacts and using stringent infection control procedures in hospitals, remain the best bet for containing the epidemic.”

Other significant viewpoints from around the world:

Judicial elections are “a corrosive practice that should end,” says an editorial in The Washington Post[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/get-politics-out-of-judicial-selections/2014/08/10/6cca3860-1f3a-11e4-ab7b-696c295ddfd1_story.html]. “Even in races with two or more candidates, often few people pay attention — and the ones most likely to care are those with direct stakes in how courts will rule.” Similarly, with ideological polarization, the races can get even uglier than high-profile legislative or executive elections: “Conservatives have accused judges of helping to free terrorists and of sympathizing with rapists; liberals have accused judges of covering up sexual abuse by priests and of helping to deny treatment to cancer patients.” States with judicial elections in place should consider adopting appointment-based systems, as “the application of due process and the maintenance of Americans’ civil rights should be more isolated from the pressures of majoritarian elections.”

“The rich are getting richer in college sports,” says an editorial in The San Francisco Chronicle[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Big-sports-schools-set-their-own-rules-5680190.php]. “The nation’s big-ticket campus programs have won agreement to set many of their own operating and financial rules, deepening a divide with smaller campuses.” A decision by the N.C.A.A. will permit “name-brand schools” to operate by a modified set of regulations, allowing for more “autonomy” when it comes to “billion-dollar TV contracts and future athletes drawn to big-school programs.” Schools participating in major athletic conferences, such as the Pacific-12, will pay each student athlete a stipend ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 and enjoy “looser rules on recruiting and access to agents,” as well as specialized health coverage for athletes alone. “The wealthiest 65 schools will continue to dominate college sports.”

The likely re-election of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan signals a “shift toward authoritarianism” in Turkey, according to an editorial in The Independent[http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/the-new-sultan-erdogans-triumph-makes-drift-towards-authoritarianism-more-likely-9660483.html]. “After yesterday’s first round, in which he won more than 50 percent of the vote, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the all-powerful prime minister since 2002, is almost certainly heading for several more years in power under a new label, giving him time to complete the construction of what he calls the ‘new Turkey.’” Polls show him well ahead of both opponents — no surprise, considering “figures for last month showed that while Mr. Erdogan received 533 minutes of airtime on state television to make his pitch, his two rivals got three minutes and 45 seconds respectively.” This “farcically lopsided allocation of media coverage” is only one example of “many indications that Turkey is morphing into a Russian-style ‘shell’ democracy.”

“It would be easy to make fun of a federal accountability website that didn’t account for more than $619 billion,” says an editorial in The Arizona Republic[http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2014/08/10/federal-watchdog-site-suffers-missing-data/13879099/]. “Too easy.” But that should not mean USASpending.gov should get “a pass” for deficiencies documented in a new report released by the Government Accountability Office: “The website is a good idea that needs to get better. Much better.” According to The Republic: “The GAO found that the Executive Office of the President failed to report $247 million in assistance programs it funded in 2012. White House officials said they thought the Department of Health and Human Services was responsible for reporting that spending. Oops. Meanwhile, HHS failed to report $544 billion of its own spending. Double oops.” The goal of “using technology to put information about government spending in the hands of the governed needs to be nurtured and perfected. This is especially important now, as the administration is implementing last year’s Digital Accountability and Transparency Act.”

The call came in on a Friday morning, as Dr. Michael S. Phillips worked at his desk at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. A patient had arrived in the emergency room burning with fever after returning from a trip to Liberia.

Dr. Phillips knew instantly what this might mean: Ebola.

Within minutes, he dispatched one member of his staff to make sure that the sick man remained isolated and that doctors and nurses were taking precautions to protect themselves against contracting the virus. Then he turned to a second staff member.

''Stop what you're doing right now,'' Dr. Phillips told him, and sent him to the hospital's laboratory.

The lab?

Dr. Phillips, the director of the infection prevention and control unit at NYU Langone, was already envisioning what his staff had not: a tube of the patient's blood, loaded with the Ebola virus, landing in the hospital's nerve center and contaminating thousands of blood and tissue samples, endangering lab technicians and potentially bringing operations at the hospital to a halt.

''It bumps your pulse up a bit,'' Dr. Phillips said, with considerable understatement, as he recalled that hectic Aug. 1 morning.

The patient, it turned out, did not have the virus. But with an Ebola epidemic spreading across West Africa, Dr. Phillips and hospital epidemiologists in New York City are grappling with yet another worry as they go about their day-to-day work of preventing, tracking and controlling potentially deadly infections and diseases.

Last week found Dr. Phillips phoning into a conference call with the city's health department to get the latest guidance on Ebola and updating the hospital's protocols to include Nigeria among the West African countries affected by the epidemic.

Meanwhile, the tall, genial doctor and his staff were keeping tabs on other potential threats: Chikungunya, the mosquito-borne illness that has invaded the Caribbean; the virus known as MERS, for Middle East respiratory syndrome; and far more common maladies like tuberculosis, influenza, measles and the bacterial infections that sometimes surface and spread within hospitals.

Dr. Phillips, 50, is married and the father of three girls, and his mother still worries about his exposure to microscopic bugs.

But he has been hardened by battle after nearly 15 years of working in New York, an international crossroads that draws thousands of far-flung tourists, some of whom carry invisible illnesses along with their travel guides.

''I still get stressed, of course,'' Dr. Phillips said. ''But worry is not a good option. We have to make sure our processes are in place and think about how we can constantly improve our game.''

He keeps a container of hospital-grade bleach wipes in his office along with his family photos. He also has three industrial-size HEPA filters, which capture virulent microbes in the air, stationed near his desk. The machines are ready to roll, whenever he gets the call. Because, well, you never know.

The diversity of infectious ailments in the city was part of what drew Dr. Phillips to New York. As a young epidemiologist, he dreamed of battling tuberculosis in Eastern Europe. Then he met Dr. Marcelle Layton, a city health official. She persuaded him to instead battle communicable diseases in the city as an epidemic intelligence service officer for the Centers for Disease Control assigned to the health department in 2000.

''I get to eastern Brooklyn,'' Dr. Phillips said. ''It's just as good.''

Over the years, he has learned to expect the unexpected.

The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, came one month before his wedding day. So he canceled his honeymoon to continue his work at ground zero, collecting data on the injuries and illnesses suffered by emergency service workers and others working at the site. Then came the anthrax attacks targeting, among others, the offices of media companies in Manhattan; then a hepatitis outbreak in a local clinic; then SARS. Dr. Phillips played a leading role in all of those episodes and became the health department's director of general surveillance in the bureau of communicable diseases.

At NYU Langone, where he has worked since 2006, he has used molecular diagnostics and detailed data collection to help reduce infection, enlisting building maintenance workers as well as health professionals in the effort. He has also developed research-tested strategies to improve prospects for orthopedic surgery patients, in addition to protocols for dealing with patients who arrive with contagious diseases.

Last week, the big news was Ebola. So Dr. Phillips and his staff staged a dry run for how they would deal with someone who had the virus, with a fellow physician posing as an infected patient and a test tube filled with apple juice standing in for a blood vial. (There was no cranberry juice in the refrigerator.)

Dr. Layton, who, as the assistant commissioner in the health department's bureau of communicable diseases, has been helping to manage the city's response to the potential Ebola threat, said she felt reassured to know that Dr. Phillips was working in New York at a time like this. ''If something happens at NYU, I'm calling Mike,'' she said.

As for Dr. Phillips, he said he was perfectly comfortable knowing that at any given moment, a patient or an employee, a visitor or a reporter, might walk through the hospital's doors carrying a possibly dangerous virus.

He said he could not ask for a better job.

''I feel really lucky,'' he said.

At Heart of Ebola Outbreak, a Village Frozen by Fear and Death

NJALA NGIEMA, Sierra Leone — The signs of a deadly struggle remain: Scattered around the houses of the Ebola dead lie empty pill packages, their plastic casings punched through. Nearby in the mud are used packets of oral rehydration salts. The pills did not work and the hurried trip to the hospital, if there was one, came too late.

Inside house after house, Ebola has claimed its victims: Here, 10 people died; over there, four, including three children. A few yards away, an old man lives alone, his wife now dead. In another, seven people are dead, the village teacher said. In a long low house nearby, 16 died, all from the same family. Outside yet another, two tiny girls, one age 6 and her sister, 7, sit pensively in front, their parents gone.

And there are more. “So many,” said Sheku Jaya, the 35-year-old village teacher, clutching his little daughter’s hand. “We lost too many people.”

Here in the nation most afflicted by Ebola, in the hardest-hit part of the country, this may well be the most devastated village, local and international officials say. Some 61 people have died here, out of a population of perhaps 500. Njala Ngiema, a mud-brick community of rice and cassava farmers deep in the forest, is quiet now.

“We wanted to abandon this village,” Mr. Jaya said.

There are still people here, but the village appears frozen. Inside the darkened houses, the scant belongings of the victims — ragged clothing, sandals, a rare radio — sit untouched weeks later. No new cases have surfaced here in nearly a month, but fear that the deadly virus still lurks has kept everything in place. Nothing appears to have moved since the deadly tide swept through.

The Sierra Leone government, desperate to contain an epidemic that has claimed about 300 lives in this nation alone, has effectively cordoned off this part of the country, deploying troops and setting up roadblocks in the hardest-hit areas. Two districts here in the east — an area with about one million people — were put under quarantine by the government late last week, shutting down much of the traffic on the muddy road cutting through the Ebola zone.

Now, a region roughly the size of Jamaica has been cut off from the rest of the country because of the roadblocks, warned a local leader, David Keili-Coomber, the paramount chief — raising worries that if the epidemic does not decimate the region, a subsequent shortage of food, trade and supplies will.

“Our fear now is that closing these roads risks having more people die of malnutrition and even starvation than by Ebola,” Mr. Keili-Coomber said in an email message.

The sweeping quarantine, much like the one imposed[http://reliefweb.int/report/liberia/hunger-stalks-liberian-provinces-cut-ebola-quarantine?utm_campaign=mailto] on parts of Liberia across the border, underscores a basic reality in the battle against the epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/africa/dont-touch-the-walls-ebola-fears-infect-hospital.html]: Neither the government nor the international health organizations on the front lines seem able to stop it from spreading. So many villages have been struck, with so few health workers and other resources to try to halt the advance, that governments have resorted to closing off entire regions in hopes of containing the damage.

“Every week, we get one or two new villages with infections,” said Anja Wolz, the Doctors Without Borders’ physician who was running the organization’s treatment center outside the town of Kailahun last week. “It is a disaster.”

The government quarantine comes too late for Njala Ngiema, where the scourge’s mark is everywhere along the wide muddy road that runs through the palm-fringed village. In front of a house where five people died hang a pair of blue trousers, untouched since Ebola passed through. Inside a house where two elderly women lived, a plastic bag labeled “See the World,” packed with clothes, sits on a bed for a trip to the hospital that never happened. Towels, trousers and underclothes still hang from the rafters in another house where Foday Joko lived with his wife and daughter. All three died.

At the back of Alhaji Abbah’s house, where 16 people died, the stained and torn farming clothes he wore — blue jeans and T-shirts — still hang from a line. Nobody has dared to remove them.

“People are afraid; we asked them to burn them,” said James Baion, a teacher from the area who is helping to organize an Ebola response on behalf of local officials.

The sheet on Mr. Abbah’s bed is still rumpled and the pillow still askew. Poking out from the simple wood bed frame are his sandals. “He refused to go to the hospital,” Mr. Baion said. “He was afraid to go.” After Mr. Abbah died, he was found in a sitting position at the edge of his bed, hunched over, his head bowed.

So many of the farmers have died that the residents said this year’s planting season was not likely to occur.

“This farming season, we can’t do any work,” said Mr. Jaya, the teacher. “We have lost too many people.”

Villages all around here have been routed, and life has ground to a halt. Schools are closed, soccer matches called off, and food prices have shot up. In Bonbom, 24 are dead, along with 12 in Bendima, and 61 in Daru, a town of about 6,000 up the road from here, said the paramount chief in Daru, Musa Ngombu-kla Kallon II, ticking off the towns where his subjects have died.

“Some villages are deserted,” the chief said. In Sierra Leone, the paramount chief, a powerful semi-elected position, upholds customary laws and collects some taxes. “People got scared,” he said. “They ran away.”

Mr. Kallon himself lost his wife and daughter. His wife, taking care of the initial case in the town, an infected nurse, told her husband: “ ‘Don’t worry. Keep cool.’ ” At the nurse’s burial, everybody wanted to “touch in abundance” the corpse, Mr. Kallon said, even dressing the deceased’s hair. Infected corpses are highly infectious, presenting a common risk of infection.

Even at the Doctors Without Borders treatment center outside Kailahun, the doctors say they are not keeping pace with the epidemic, despite a staff of over 300, 10 tents, more than 2,000 protective suits and a mathematically precise layout to reduce the risk of infection.

“I think we are two steps behind,” Dr. Wolz said.

“We are still discovering villages,” she said, where Ebola victims are dying at home, rather than in isolation, risking new infections. There have been up to 140 new cases at the treatment center over the last three weeks, she said.

The standard protocols for containing the disease — isolating each patient, tracking the people they came in contact with, and monitoring all of those people for weeks to see if they develop any symptoms — seem an almost insurmountable task across the four West African nations that have reported about 1,800[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_08_ebola/en/] cases so far: Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.

International officials have said there were at least 500 contacts to trace just from the city in Guinea where the outbreak was first identified[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/world/africa/tracing-ebolas-breakout-to-an-african-2-year-old.html] in March, and the World Health Organization says it will need to send hundreds of additional health workers to the region to try to contain the epidemic.

At the Doctors Without Borders center, a medical assistant flipped cans of sardines to grateful Ebola patients behind a barrier, several of whom were eager to demonstrate their healthiness. But one patient, struggling to his feet, held his head in his hands. “Hurting, hurting, hurting,” said Mamou Samba, a 43-year-old mason, groaning and demanding painkillers.

Behind the tents, the morgue is full. A body arrived — a young man, his arm hanging limply from the stretcher, who appeared to have been in his prime. Most of the patients are breadwinners for their families, as one staff member put it. A team of five in full protective gear disinfected the corpse with a potent chlorine spray solution. Behind the morgue rose smoke from the latest incineration of protective gear, which is discarded after a single use.

Dr. Wolz said the outbreak would not end this year. “Everybody sends experts,” she said. “They sit in offices and go to meetings. We need people to go into the field.”

Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now.

Here’s what you need to know for Tuesday:

• “He made us laugh. He made us cry.”

That was President Obama, one of many who offered condolences to the family of the Oscar-winning actor Robin Williams, 63, who died[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/movies/robin-williams-oscar-winning-comedian-dies-at-63.html] of an apparent suicide on Monday.

The Marin County, Calif., sheriff’s office has scheduled a news conference today at 2 p.m. Eastern on his death.

• White House, by the sea.

Mr. Obama, on a two-week vacation with his family in Martha’s Vineyard, said Monday that he would support[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/world/middleeast/obama-pledges-support-for-a-new-iraqi-leader.html] the man chosen to succeed Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of Iraq.

(He also received[http://bit.ly/1vxKs8Q] the #IceBucketChallenge[http://www.alsa.org/news/archive/ice-bucket-challenge.html], a campaign raising awareness and funds for A.L.S., and must complete it today.)

• Echoing the president.

Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, at the annual Australia-U.S. strategic talks in Sydney, said today that the U.S. would consider expanding[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/us-outlines-conditions-for-expanded-military-and-political-support-in-iraq.html] support for Iraq if it formed a new government.

The U.S.[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/11/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-iraq-aid.html?ref=aponline] and Britain[http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28751958] are continuing to aid thousands of members of an Iraqi religious minority group who are under siege by militants.

• Unrest near St. Louis into another night.

The F.B.I. said it will investigate the weekend shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man who was to start college this week, and look into possible civil rights violations.

Monday night[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/us/looting-and-unrest-follows-vigil-for-st-louis-teenager.html], the police used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a crowd of mostly black protesters.

• Treating Ebola.

The Liberian government says it will get doses[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28749615] of an experimental drug that has been given to only two Americans and a Spaniard. And the World Health Organization said the death toll in West Africa has surpassed 1,000.

• Aid for Eastern Ukraine?

About 300 trucks left Moscow[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/europe/russian-convoy-leaves-moscow-for-ukraine-bearing-aid.html] this morning, but some suspect that the Kremlin is using the convoy as a way to invade its neighbor.

MARKETS

• Wall Street futures are slightly ahead. European shares are down, and Asia ended barely higher.

• Brian Cornell, a Pepsico executive, becomes Target’s chief executive today at a time when many analysts say the retailer needs new direction.

• The maker of the Candy Crush app, King Digital, reports earnings today for a second time.

NOTEWORTHY

• A new pitcher coming to the mound.

Major League Baseball owners, meeting today through Thursday, will consider replacements for the commissioner, Bud Selig, who is retiring after over 20 years.

• Berthillon patriarch is dead.

Raymond Berthillon, founder of the ice cream parlor celebrated as the best in Paris, has died[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/11/raymond-berthillon-dies-ice-cream-parlour-paris]. He was 90.

La Maison Berthillon, often with lines of customers snaking down its street on the Île Saint-Louis, is known for its luxury ice creams and sorbets.

• Botlr at your service.

A hotel near Apple’s headquarters in California said today that it will test a robotic bellhop[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/technology/hotel-to-begin-testing-botlr-a-robotic-bellhop.html] named Botlr, intended to carry items from the hotel lobby to guest rooms.

• Back in scrubs.

Rand Paul left behind his practice as an ophthalmologist when Kentucky sent him to the Senate, but he still returns to his old work several times a year to perform free eye surgeries for the poor.

Today, Senator Paul[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/24/rand-paul-travels/13132225/] will do operations in Louisville and is set to do more as part of a charitable trip to Guatemala in the coming days.

• Living treasures.

Because of poaching and habitat loss, the world’s elephant population is plummeting so rapidly that extinction is considered possible in less than 20 years.

Today, the third annual World Elephant Day[http://worldelephantday.org/news/2014/08/world-elephant-day-2014-press-release] offers a number of events[http://worldelephantday.org/events] intended to help turn the trend around.

BACK STORY

The English translation of Haruki Murakami’s new novel, “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,”[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/books/review/haruki-murakamis-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage.html] goes on sale today in the United States. It follows a 36-year-old man in Tokyo after he re-connects with old school friends.

In Japan, the novel sold over one million copies in its first week and became the best-selling book there last year. Murakami fans there are so devoted that they visit streets and places mentioned in his novels.

On Amazon.com, the English version is already a best seller.

But “Murakami is in fact a divisive figure in his native country,” says Hiroko Tabuchi, a Times correspondent who was formerly based in Tokyo.

Critics often take issue with the writer’s love for all things Western, Ms. Tabuchi says, “something that raises suspicion in a country that expects its citizens to be proud ambassadors of Japanese culture.”

“Yet even Murakami’s biggest skeptics realize that it is Murakami’s universalism that makes his works so widely popular,” she says.

“Murakami’s works go beyond literature,” she adds. “Murakami lays down tastes in music and cuisine, a way of life and of looking at the world.”

Joseph Burgess, Rick Rojas and Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.

World Health Organization Endorses Use of Experimental Ebola Drugs

GENEVA — The World Health Organization on Tuesday endorsed the use of untested drugs to combat the Ebola virus, just hours after a Spanish priest who had been supplied with experimental medication became the first European to die in the world’s worst known outbreak of the disease.

No proven cure or vaccine exists for the Ebola virus, which the World Health Organization says has killed 1,013 people in four West African countries — Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Around half of the people infected in the outbreak, first reported in March, have died. Last week, the World Health Organizationdeclared the outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html] a global health emergency.

The Spanish priest, Miguel Pajares, 75, worked in a hospital in Liberia and was the first European to return home after being infected with Ebola. Citing medical confidentiality rules, hospital officials in Madrid declined to say whether the priest had utlimately been treated with the experimental drug, ZMapp,[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/business/an-obscure-biotech-firm-hurries-ebola-treatment.html] made in the United States, but the Spanish Health Ministry said on Monday that it had obtained the medication for him.

The provision of ZMapp, a previously untested drug in extremely limited supply, to foreign aid workers evacuated from West Africa has raised broad ethical questions about the disparities in treatment between white outsiders and the Africans who form the overwhelming majority of the victims. Two American aid workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were were evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, received the drug as well[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/business/an-obscure-biotech-firm-hurries-ebola-treatment.html], prompting questions from some African officials about why their nations had not received the medication.

Then on Tuesday, the government of Liberia announced that it would receive ZMapp after a request to the United States by its president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. It said the drug would be used to treat two doctors battling for their lives against the Ebola virus.

That would be the first known use of the drug to treat Africans, but it also might be the last for a little while. The manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said that it had complied with a request received over the weekend from a West African nation, though it noted in a statement that the available supply of the drug was now “exhausted.”

In Geneva, the World Health Organization convened an ethics panel on Monday to debate the broader use of untested drugs. In a statement[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-ethical-review-summary/en/] on its website on Tuesday, it said that given “the particular circumstances of this outbreak,” the panel had reached a consensus that “it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet-unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention.”

The panel said the use of untested drugs should be guided by ethical criteria, including transparency about all aspects of the care provided, informed consent of the patient, freedom of choice and patient confidentiality.

World Health Organization officials said another meeting would be held at the end of the month to deal with another delicate and politically charged question: how to allocate scarce treatments.

Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday that there were several drugs and vaccines[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/health/second-experimental-drug-allowed-for-treating-ebola.html] that have shown some promise in animal testing that might conceivably be deployed in the outbreak.

However, she said, none “is available in unlimited supplies right now.” She added, “I don’t think that there could be any fair distribution of something which is available in such a small quantity.”

Dr. Kieny said that intensifying public health measures to contain the outbreak was more important than drugs. “It is very important to not give false hope to anybody that Ebola can be treated now,” she said.

The Spanish priest, Father Pajares, was flown back to Spain on Aug. 7 with a nun who worked with him, Juliana Bohi, who has tested negative for the Ebola virus. He was treated at Carlos III hospital in Madrid. The priest had worked for a Roman Catholic order based in Spain that runs hospitals in many parts of the world. His death from the Ebola virus was the first reported on European soil.

Upon their arrival in Spain, the two were kept separated and in isolation on a floor of the hospital in Madrid. A dozen doctors and nurses looked after Father Pajares, who died early Tuesday morning, although the hospital and Spain’s Health Ministry made no official statement about the exact circumstances of his death. He will be incinerated in a sealed coffin, without carrying out any prior autopsy, to reduce the risk of any further contagion.

The Spanish authorities said they had obtained a supply of ZMapp from Geneva last week, without giving details. On Monday, José María Viadero, the director of Juan Ciudad, a nongovernmental organization linked to the religious order Father Pajares belonged to, told Europa Press that Father Pajares was “stable” and was being treated with the experimental drug ZMapp since the weekend.

The hospital and Spain’s Health Ministry, however, would not comment on Tuesday about how Father Pajares had been treated, nor offer any assessment of the efficiency of the ZMapp experimental drug.

Father Pajares was a veteran missionary who joined his religious order as a teenager. He had previously worked in Ghana before settling in Liberia in 2007, where he worked in Saint Joseph’s Catholic Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, alongside others from the brotherhood of Saint John of God.

The repatriation of Father Pajares set off some debate in Spain last week, with some questioning why some of his African, Ebola-suffering colleagues had not also been allowed on the flight. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy offered his condolences for Father Pajares’s death, alongside other Spanish politicians and the royal family.

Mapp, the manufacturer of ZMapp, said it had complied with every request for the drug that had the necessary legal and regulatory approvals.

Mapp and the United States government, which has financed most of the company’s work, are making plans to increase supplies of ZMapp. But it is expected to take several months to increase supplies, and even then, there may be no more than a few hundred doses available, and perhaps less, according to federal officials and corporate executives.

The drug consists of three monoclonal antibodies, which are proteins designed to bind to the virus and neutralize. The drug has been manufactured in the leaves of tobacco plants at a facility in Owensboro, Ky., that is owned by Reynolds American, the cigarette company. Federal officials are looking at using other facilities to manufacture the drug as well.

Dr. Kieny said similar therapy might be provided using the blood of patients who have recovered from Ebola, because those patients apparently have effective antibodies. She said the World Health Organization was looking at helping blood centers in the affected countries gather such blood.

She said two vaccines to prevent disease could be ready for human testing by the end of September. If so, data would be available on their safety as early as the end of the year.

Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Alan Cowell from London. Andrew Pollack contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.

The stock market declined slightly on Tuesday, snapping a two-day rally, as energy shares tumbled along with oil prices. The pullback occurred on light trading volume typical of mid-August.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.44 points, or 0.06 percent, to 16,560.54. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slid 3.17 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,933.75. The Nasdaq composite index lost 12.08 points, or 0.27 percent, falling to 4,389.25.

Traders rushed to sell the stock of Kate Spade & Company, the maker and retailer of handbags and accessories, which plummeted $9.87, or 25.4 percent, to $29. The company warned that gross margins would be weaker than expected for the year.

The S.&P. 500 energy sector index dropped 0.7 percent as oil prices declined. Southwestern Energy fell $1.10, or 2.8 percent, to $38.21, while Consol Energy lost 97 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $39.49. Comstock Resources dropped $1.24, or 5 percent, to $23.56.

Brent crude oil fell $1.66, to $103.02 a barrel, in London after touching a 13-month low because of worries about oversupply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, even with possible disruptions in Iraq’s production. American crude oil for October delivery fell 73 cents, to $96.48 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Investors kept an eye on the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the turmoil in Iraq, looking for any market-moving news. “This is another lull in the market,” said Malcolm E. Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors. “With earnings season basically done and people on vacation, any little bit of news will move the market.”

About 4.3 billion shares traded on all market platforms on Tuesday, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of six billion shares.

“We already know the Middle East is unstable and that Russia is sending an aid convoy to Ukraine, so this is all the continuation of a longer-term issue that has been boiling for a long time,” Mr. Polley said.

Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, a Canadian biotechnology company that is developing a treatment for the often-fatal Ebola virus, slid $5.19, or 21.8 percent, to $18.61. Tekmira’s stock decline on heavy volume followed a recent rally. The World Health Organization said it backed the use of experimental Ebola drugs to treat the outbreak in West Africa.

In the bond market, interest rates edged upward. The yield on the Treasury’s 10-year note rose to 2.45 percent, from 2.43 percent late Monday, while its price slipped 6/32, to 100 14/32.

Using a Tactic Unseen in a Century, Countries Cordon Off Ebola-Racked Areas

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is so out of control that governments there have revived a disease-fighting tactic not used in nearly a century: the “cordon sanitaire,” in which a line is drawn around the infected area and no one is allowed out.

Cordons, common in the medieval era of the Black Death, have not been seen since the border between Poland and Russia was closed in 1918 to stop typhus from spreading west. They have the potential to become brutal and inhumane. Centuries ago, in their most extreme form, everyone within the boundaries was left to die or survive, until the outbreak ended.

Plans for the new cordon were announced on Aug. 1[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140801-ebola-cordon-sanitaire-stopper-propagation-virus-oms-margaret-chan-epidemie/] at an emergency meeting in Conakry, Guinea, of the Mano River Union, a regional association of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three countries hardest hit by Ebola, according to Agence France-Presse[http://news.yahoo.com/african-states-launch-100mn-ebola-response-plan-170858040.html]. The plan was to isolate a triangular area where the three countries meet, separated only by porous borders, and where 70 percent of the cases known at that time had been found.

Troops began closing internal roads in Liberia and Sierra Leone last week. The epidemic began in southern Guinea in December, but new cases there have slowed to a trickle. In the other two countries, the number of new cases is still rapidly rising. As of Monday, the region had seen 1,848 cases and 1,013 deaths[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/don/2014_08_11_ebola/en/], according to the World Health Organization, although many experts think that the real count is much higher because families in remote villages are avoiding hospitals and hiding victims.

Officials at the health organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which have experts advising the countries, say the tactic could help contain the outbreak but want to see it used humanely.

“It might work,” said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, the disease center’s chief quarantine expert. “But it has a lot of potential to go poorly if it’s not done with an ethical approach. Just letting the disease burn out and considering that the price of controlling it — we don’t live in that era anymore. And as soon as cases are under control, one should dial back the restrictions.”

Experts said that any cordon must let food, water and medical care reach those inside, and that the trust of inhabitants must be won through communication with their leaders.

The phrase cordon sanitaire, or sanitary barrier, appears to date from 1821, when France sent 30,000 troops into the Pyrenees to stop a lethal fever raging in Spain from crossing the border.

In Sierra Leone, large sections of the Kailahun and Kenema districts, an area the size of Jamaica, have been cut off by military roadblocks. Soldiers check the credentials and take the temperatures of those trying to go in or out. In Liberia, similar restrictions have been imposed north of the capital, Monrovia.

Nigeria is not involved because its small Ebola outbreak is hundreds of miles away. All 10 confirmed cases there are in Lagos, the financial capital, and all are apparently linked to a Liberian-American who arrived there on a flight and later died.

Inside the cordoned area of Sierra Leone and Liberia, alarmed residents have told reporters that they fear starving because food prices are rising. Many farmers have died, and traders who cannot travel cannot earn money.

It is not clear whether plans to deliver food, water and care are underway.

When cordons are imposed, “human rights have to be respected,” said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, which last week declared the outbreak[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/africa/who-declares-ebola-in-west-africa-a-health-emergency.html] an international public health emergency.

The agency will work with the World Food Program and other agencies to make sure food and supplies get in, he said.

W.H.O. officials attended the Conakry meeting but did not join the Aug. 1 announcement of the planned cordon. They have not opposed it, either.

“It seems like a reflexive movement by the governments to show that they’re doing something, and since they have armies more elaborate than their health care systems, they use the army,” said Dr. William Schaffner, the head of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University’s medical school.

There have been nearly 20 Ebola outbreaks in Africa since the disease was discovered in 1976, and all previous ones were beaten by the same tactics: Teams of outside health experts, usually from Europe and the United States, flew in, recruited local health workers and set up field hospitals where all known victims were quarantined and treated. The teams also took over burials, disinfecting and bagging bodies. They traced all contacts of known victims and hospitalized any people who fell ill. Health workers protected themselves with gloves, coveralls, masks, bleach spray and the burning of used gear.

This time, however, the outbreak quickly spread among the three contiguous countries, all battered by political dysfunction and civil wars. None had seen the virus before, and the global response was initially slow and inadequate. Protective equipment quickly ran out; leading local doctors fell ill and even died, stirring panic.

Now, experts say, the epidemic is too big to control with the old tactics. Tracing contacts requires many health care workers, because any victim — especially a nurse or a market trader — could have had physical contact with dozens of people.

And health care workers are often fearful of helping people who may have Ebola. It may become necessary, Dr. Cetron suggested, to pay people within the cordon to report cases and victims’ contacts.

Before the modern era of vaccines, antibiotics and infection control, cordons sanitaire were far more common.

As louse-borne typhus swept through post-revolutionary Russia, the victors in World War I closed Poland’s eastern border. Travelers wanting to cross had to be interned, bathed, shaved and deloused, and their clothes had to be treated with steam and chemicals.

The most famous voluntary cordon, according to Joseph P. Byrne, a historian at Belmont University in Nashville, was of the English village of Eyam. In 1665, the plague reached it from London, probably in fleas on cloth shipped to a local tailor, the first to die. The village, which had about 350 people, voluntarily cordoned itself off from the spring until November to prevent the plague from spreading to the rest of Derbyshire. Grateful people from other villages left food outside a circle of stones around Eyam. Only a quarter of the village survived, but the plague did not spread.

The United States has its own history of cordons, some with racial overtones. In 1899, a 35-acre area of Honolulu housing its Chinese and Japanese residents was sealed off by the Hawaii National Guard and white vigilantes because of the plague. Workers with outside jobs had to pass through showers. Ultimately, a blaze started by the Fire Department to burn flea-infested buildings got out of control and destroyed much of the district, leaving 8,000 people homeless.

The doctor who had been leading Sierra Leone's battle against the Ebola outbreak was now fighting for his own life, and his international colleagues faced a fateful decision: whether to give him a drug that had never before been tested on people.

Would the drug, known as ZMapp, help the stricken doctor? Or would it perhaps harm or even kill one of the country's most prominent physicians, a man considered a national hero, shattering the already fragile public trust in international efforts to contain the world's worst Ebola outbreak?

The treatment team, from Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, agonized through the night and ultimately decided not to try the drug. The doctor, Sheik Umar Khan, died a few days later, on July 29.

The doses of the drug that were not used were eventually sent to Liberia, where other doctors made the opposite decision -- and two American aid workers became the first people in the world to receive ZMapp. Both of them survived and are now being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

''It's a little political; that's what it looks like to me,'' Alhajie Khan, Dr. Khan's brother, said of the decision. ''Why would you not give it to him? The guy who helped all of these people.''

The provision of ZMapp, which is in extremely limited supply, to foreign aid workers has raised broad ethical questions about the disparities in treatment between white outsiders and the Africans who form the overwhelming majority of victims in the epidemic.

Those concerns were heightened further after Spanish officials confirmed that they had obtained a supply of ZMapp for a third patient, a 75-year-old Spanish priest who died Tuesday after having been evacuated to Madrid from Liberia.

The previously untold story of Dr. Khan, recounted by two doctors involved in discussions about whether to use ZMapp, offered an unusual glimpse into the wrenching ethical dilemma of when and how experimental drugs should be used to combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Had the treatment team decided differently in his case, the first person treated with the drug would have been African.

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization endorsed the use of untested drugs to combat the outbreak, which has already killed more than 1,000 people and continues to spread. But ZMapp and other potential treatments are in such short supply that another politically charged question remains: Who should get them?

Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday that several drugs and vaccines had shown some promise in animal testing and might conceivably be used.

But none are ''available in unlimited supplies right now,'' Dr. Kieny said. ''I don't think that there could be any fair distribution of something which is available in such a small quantity.''

On Tuesday, Liberia's government announced that it would receive ZMapp after its president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, requested the drug from the United States. It said the drug would be used to treat two doctors who have Ebola.

That would be the first known use of the drug to treat Africans, but it also might be the last for a while. The manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said that it had complied with a request from a West African nation, but noted in a statement that the available supply of the drug was now exhausted.

In the case of Dr. Khan, who has been called ''the arrowhead of the fight'' against Ebola in his country, the doctors involved said there was no intention to save the drug for Americans. They said it was not known that the American aid workers were sick at the time of the decision not to treat Dr. Khan, around July 23. Instead, they said, doctors feared stoking the considerable suspicion of Western medical institutions in the country, which was already making it harder to contain the outbreak.

''What they really didn't want to do was kill Dr. Khan with their attempt at therapy,'' said Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist at Doctors Without Borders. ''If word got out that M.S.F. killed Dr. Khan, that would have implications for outbreak control,'' he added, using the initials for the French name of the relief group.

Dr. Sprecher, who is involved in the procurement and use of drugs for Doctors Without Borders but was not directly treating Dr. Khan, said another factor was that Dr. Khan's virus levels were so high it was believed the drug would probably not work.

He said the treatment team never discussed the option of using the drug with Dr. Khan himself, deciding it would do so only if it decided to go ahead with the treatment.

''There are an awful lot of people who are very traumatized by the whole event,'' Dr. Sprecher said in a telephone interview from Brussels on Tuesday.

At the time the decision was made, less was known about ZMapp, which may have helped the two American relief workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were initially treated in Liberia and then evacuated.

Dr. Sprecher said the Spanish priest, the Rev. Miguel Pajares, had received the first of three recommended doses of ZMapp. He said the drug sent to Spain had originally been obtained by Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization for use in emergencies. It was kept at the University Hospital of Geneva, which had the authority to decide how the drug was used.

Father Pajares worked in a hospital in Liberia and was the first European to return home after being infected with Ebola. The Spanish Health Ministry confirmed that it had obtained ZMapp for him, but hospital officials in Madrid, citing patient confidentiality rules, declined to say whether Father Pajares had ultimately been treated with ZMapp. Officials said he would be cremated in a sealed coffin, with no autopsy, to reduce the risk of any further contagion.

Also on Tuesday, the press in Canada reported that the country's Health Ministry planned to offer hundreds of doses of an experimental vaccine for use in Africa.

Dr. Kieny of the W.H.O. said Tuesday that intensifying public health measures to contain the outbreak was more important than supplying drugs. ''It is very important to not give false hope to anybody that Ebola can be treated now,'' she said.

A string of coincidences led to the decision in Dr. Khan's case, Dr. Sprecher said. A Canadian team setting up a laboratory had taken some of the drug with it to Sierra Leone. It set up shop next to the Doctors Without Borders treatment center in Kailahun, and let the relief organization know the drug was available.

Dr. Khan was in charge of the Lassa fever ward in Kenema, which had become the Ebola ward. But when he became ill he was moved to Kailahun so he would not be treated by his own colleagues. Dr. Khan was going to be airlifted to Switzerland, where he would receive better care, making the drug less necessary, his treatment team reasoned. But after the decision was made, and just before he was to depart, Dr. Khan began vomiting and having diarrhea, and the transportation company refused to take him.

Dr. Daniel G. Bausch, an associate professor of tropical medicine at Tulane University who was involved in the discussions, said that he disagreed with the decision and that if he were sick with a life-threatening disease he would have wanted the drug, even if it had not undergone safety testing.

He also said he thought Dr. Khan should have been asked for his own opinion. ''Dr. Khan was the perfect patient, I think, to understand the complexities of that gray area,'' he said.

Nonetheless, he said that it was a close call and that he respected the decision of the doctors on the ground. ''There was considerable difference of opinion even within M.S.F.,'' he said.

Dr. Bausch, who has been a consultant to the W.H.O., said he had been a close friend of Dr. Khan and had recruited him in 2004 to take over the Lassa fever ward at the hospital in Kenema, a dangerous job given that the previous holder of the position had died from Lassa fever.

Dr. Bausch was in Sierra Leone until July 16. When he and Dr. Khan said goodbye to each other that day, Dr. Khan felt well. But he became sick within hours and tested positive for Ebola virus around July 21 or July 22, setting the stage for the decision.

"We were willing to try anything,'' said Dr. Khan's sister, Umu Khan. ''It was not right; we should have had a say.''

A scarce Ebola drug was obtained for the Rev. Miguel Pajares, who was taken to a Madrid hospital last week. He died on Tuesday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY EMILIO NARANJO/EUROPEAN PRESS AGENCY) (A10)

Ebola Claims Another Sierra Leone Doctor

FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — A second leading Sierra Leone doctor has succumbed to the Ebola epidemic[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/31/world/africa/ebola-virus-outbreak-qa.html] sweeping across West Africa, dealing another blow to the country’s faltering efforts to stem the disease.

Dr. Modupeh Cole, 56, died Wednesday at the Ebola treatment center operated by Doctors Without Borders[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/] in the northeastern town of Kailahun, officials at the health ministry said.

He had apparently been infected while seeing a patient at the country’s leading hospital, Connaught Hospital, here in the capital, officials said. The patient later tested positive for Ebola.

The loss of Dr. Cole was described as significant by health officials in a country with a severe shortage of well-trained doctors, especially coming two weeks after the death of Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, the virologist who was leading the fight against the disease in eastern Sierra Leone, where it has flourished.

Dr. Cole “was a highly qualified physician, and we have very few of them on hand,” said Dr. Amara Jambai, director of prevention and control at the health ministry. “You can imagine what this does to the younger cohort. It’s like having a general falling in battle. It just brings more misery. It’s not good. When you have a health system that’s constrained, it’s a bit too much.”

Connaught, where Dr. Cole worked, is Sierra Leone’s leading referral hospital, so Ebola patients inevitably go there, initially at least. But it does not have a treatment center for them or an isolation ward.

It was one such patient who apparently passed the deadly disease to the doctor. “He was trying to see a patient, and the patient was falling,” Dr. Jambai said. “The patient was trying to help himself to the couch, and the patient fell.” The patient was positive for Ebola, he added.

Dr. Cole trained in the Soviet Union in the 1980s before returning to Sierra Leone in 1987, Dr. Jambai said.

The disease continues to spread, with the World Health Organization reporting[http://www.who.int.proxy.bc.edu/csr/disease/ebola/en/] 1,013 deaths across four countries — Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone — as of Saturday. Sierra Leone reported the most confirmed and probable cases, 730, and the third-highest death toll, 315. Health workers suspect that this figure may be far too low, given the number of confirmed Ebola cases in the country, 656.

On Tuesday, some of the rare experimental Ebola drug known as ZMapp[http://www.cdc.gov.proxy.bc.edu/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/qa-experimental-treatments.html] arrived in Liberia. The minister of foreign affairs, Augustine Ngafuan, transported three courses of the drug himself on a commercial flight from the United States. The Liberian government had announced that two courses would be administered to two doctors from John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.

But Dr. Moses Massaquoi, a health ministry official, said in a telephone interview that “things have changed,” adding that the medication would be administered to health workers, among them a doctor and a nurse, without specifying. Health officials also emphasized that the very limited courses of the medication, which is unproven and virtually untested, were not a panacea.

“For me this is not the answer; it’s just a matter of trial,” said Tolbert Nyenswah, the assistant minister of health. “We need to continue mechanisms to break transmission so that we can eradicate this disease.”

A third death in Nigeria was reported by the Economic Community of West African States[http://www.ecowas.int/], a regional bloc, which said Tuesday that Jatto Asihu Abdulqudir, a staff member in Lagos, had succumbed to the disease. Mr. Abdulqudir was among those who assisted an infected Liberian-American who had arrived by plane for a conference in July. The passenger, Patrick Sawyer[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/world/africa/ebola-in-nigeria.html], died on July 25, and a nurse who treated him died shortly after.

Nigerian media reported Wednesday that officials were concerned about the spread of the disease beyond Lagos, with 21 people being placed under quarantine in the southeastern city of Enugu. They were reported to have had contact with a nurse who treated Mr. Sawyer.

In Nigeria, the outbreak still appears relatively contained, with 10 confirmed cases and 198 people being watched in Lagos and Enugu, according to Liberian media reports. In Sierra Leone, by contrast, a substantial portion of the nation is under quarantine by the government, and the number of cases, and deaths, keeps growing.

“When figures have names, that is when reality sinks in,” Dr. Jambai said. “It’s a very sad day.”

As Ebola’s Toll Rises, Drug Makers Race to Test Medicines

Because outbreaks are sporadic and mainly confined to Africa, the Ebola[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] virus has not been a priority for profit-seeking pharmaceutical companies.

But with the largest ever Ebola outbreak now having killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa, drug companies and doctors are scrambling to see whether any existing medicines or drugs under development can help stem the epidemic.

Options include experimental treatments that have never before been tested on people and some of the world’s most widely used drugs — statins like Lipitor[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/lipitor_drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which are approved to lower cholesterol[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/cholesterol/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but might, some advocates say, also help with Ebola.

The search is especially intense among smaller companies whose research has been funded by the government.

Investors, too, are watching the drug makers. Stock in one of the hopefuls, Tekmira, which is based in Canada, has nearly doubled in the last month. Stock in BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, which received a brief boost in 2005 and again in 2009 from a flu[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] drug the company has been developing, was also up on Wednesday, undoubtedly in part because the company has a drug in the animal-testing stage that might work against Ebola. Experts caution that most of these drugs are so early in development and in such limited quantities that they may not make a difference.

“I wish I had a better story for you, but that’s it,” one official at the Health and Human Services Department said after discussing the relative handful of drugs and vaccines in the pipeline, most of which have yet to be tested even in small clinical trials.

Despite the long odds, two Ebola vaccines could begin initial safety testing in people as early as next month, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his agency did not have formal contracts with some of the companies involved.

While testing will be in healthy volunteers, some of those volunteers might be health care workers who intend to go to Africa.

One of the vaccines was developed by a government laboratory in Canada. The Canadian government on Tuesday said it would donate 800 to 1,000 doses to the World Health Organization[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_health_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org], presumably for use in Africa.

That vaccine is licensed to NewLink Genetics[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/genetics/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a company in Ames, Iowa. Charles Link, the chief executive, said NewLink could manufacture tens of thousands of doses over the next couple of months.

The other vaccine is being developed by the National Institutes of Health, with GlaxoSmithKline holding the commercial license. There are 400 doses available now, enough for a clinical trial in healthy adults, the federal official said.

As far as treatments for people already stricken with Ebola, most attention has focused on ZMapp, developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego. The drug, which consists of antibodies[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/antibody-titer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that bind to and neutralize the virus, appears to have helped two American aid workers stricken in Liberia. Although the company says it has exhausted its supply — apparently enough to treat only six people — the federal official said he hoped that an additional 10 to 50 treatment courses could be made by the end of the year, enough to begin a small safety study.

Tekmira’s drug uses a technique called RNA interference to silence genes in the Ebola virus. Its early-stage clinical trial in healthy volunteers was delayed by the Food and Drug Administration[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/food_and_drug_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] last month because of side effects. But the F.D.A. last week said that the drug was safe enough to test in people actually infected with Ebola.

Sarepta Therapeutics has said it has enough experimental drug left over to treat about two dozen people. The company stopped developing the drug, which also uses RNA interference, after the Defense Department halted its funding.

A flu drug being developed by Fujifilm Holdings of Japan has shown some effectiveness against Ebola in mice, and BioCryst also has an antiviral drug that has been tested in mice. The next step is for those drugs to work in monkeys.

“I have shelves full of things that protect rodents that don’t work in monkeys,” said Dr. Thomas W. Geisbert, a professor and Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. “If it doesn’t protect a monkey, it’s hard to image how you would push it forward for use in humans.”

The W.H.O. said on Tuesday that it would be permissible to try to treat Ebola patients with untested medicines, providing certain ethical standards were observed.

Even so, Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the organization’s assistant director general, was cautious. “It is very important to not give false hope to anybody that Ebola can be treated now,” she said at a news conference in Geneva.

Since drugs directed specifically at Ebola are still in early development, some doctors are suggesting trying drugs already approved for other uses that are readily available and proved to be relatively safe — like statins.

The champion of this idea is Dr. David Fedson, a retired professor and vaccine company executive living in France. He said that although statins did not attack the virus, they might help calm the runaway immune system reaction that could follow infection, which is what inflicts much of the damage on the body.

“The concept of treating the host response is sitting there in front of our noses,” said Dr. Fedson, who has been trying to rally support for his proposal.

So far, however, the W.H.O. had turned up its nose at the idea, he said. Some Ebola experts are also skeptical.

“When you start talking about modulating the immune response[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/immune-response/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier], you can have unintended consequences,” said Dr. Geisbert of the University of Texas.
